There are several spectroscopic techniques which can be used to identify organic molecules: infrared (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) UV/visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

IR, NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy are based on observing the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by molecules. MS is based on measuring the mass of the molecule and any fragments of the molecule which may be produced in the MS instrument.

==UV/Visible Spectroscopy==
UV/Vis Spectroscopy uses ultraviolet and/or visible light to examine the electronic properties of molecules.  Irradiating a molecule with UV or Visible light of a specific wavelength can cause the electrons in a molecule to transition to an excited state.  This technique is most useful for analyzing molecules with conjugated systems or carbonyl bonds.

==NMR Spectroscopy==
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most useful analytical techniques for determining the structure of an organic compound. There are two main types of NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR (Proton NMR) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR (Carbon NMR). NMR is based on the fact that the nuclei of atoms have a quantized property called spin. When a magnetic field is applied to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nucleus, the nucleus can align either with (spin +1/2) or against (spin -1/2) the applied magnetic field.

These two states have different potential energies and the energy difference depends on the strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field about a nucleus, however, depends on the chemical environment around the nucleus. For example, the negatively charged electrons around and near the nucleus can shield the nucleus from the magnetic field, lowering the strength of the effective magnetic field felt by the nucleus. This, in turn, will lower the energy needed to transition between the +1/2 and -1/2 states. Therefore, the transition energy will be lower for nuclei attached to electron donating groups (such as alkyl groups) and higher for nuclei attached to electron withdrawing groups (such as a hydroxyl group).

In an NMR machine, the compound being analyzed is placed in a strong magnetic field and irradiated with radio waves to cause all the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei to occupy the higher energy -1/2 state. As the nuclei relax back to the +1/2 state, they release radio waves corresponding to the energy of the difference between the two spin states. The radio waves are recorded and analyzed by computer to give an intensity versus frequency plot of the sample. This information can then be used to determine the structure of the compound.




'''Aromatics in H-NMR'''
'''Electron Donating Groups vs. Electron Withdrawing Groups'''

On monosubstituted rings, electron donating groups resonate at high chemical shifts.  Electron donating groups increase the electron density by releasing electrons into a reaction center, thus stabilizing the carbocation.  An example of an electron donating group is methyl (-CH3).

Accordingly, electron withdrawing groups are represented at low chemical shifts.  Electron withdrawing groups pull electrons away from a reacting center.  This can stabilize an electron rich carbanion. Some examples of electron withdrawing groups are halogens (-Cl, -F) and carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Looking at the H NMR spectrum of ethyl benzene, we see that the methyl group is the most electron withdrawing, so it appears at the lowest chemical shift.  The aromatic phenyl group is the most electron donating, so it has the highest chemical shift.

'''Disubstituted Rings'''

The sum of integrated intensity values for the entire aromatic region shows how many substituents are attached to the ring, so a total value of 4 indicates that the ring has 2 substituents.  When a benzene ring has two substituent groups, each exerts an influence on following substitution reactions. The site at which a new substituent is introduced depends on the orientation of the existing groups and their individual directing effects.  For a disubstituted benzene ring, there are three possible NMR patterns.  
[[Image:omp.gif]]

Note that para-substituted rings usually show two symmetric sets of peaks that look like doublets.  

The order of these peaks is dependent on the nature of the two substituents.  For example, the three NMR spectra of chloronitrobenzene isomers are below:

=Mass Spectroscopy=

A mass spectroscope measures the exact mass of ions, relative to the charge.  Many times, some form of separation is done beforehand, enabling a spectrum to be collected on a relatively pure sample.  An organic sample can be introduced into a mass spectroscope and ionised.  This also breaks some molecules into smaller fragments.

The resulting mass spectrum shows:

1) The heaviest ion is simply the ionised molecule itself. We can simply record its mass.

2) Other ions are fragments of the molecule and give information about its structure. Common fragments are:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''species'''
|'''formula'''
|'''mass'''
|-
|methyl
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|15
|-
|ethyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|29
|-
|phenyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|77
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=Infrared spectroscopy.=



Absorbing infrared radiation makes covalent bonds vibrate. Different types of bond absorb different wavelengths of infrared:
 
Instead of wavelength, infrared spectroscopists record the wavenumber; the number of waves that fit into 1 cm. (This is easily converted to the energy of the wave.)

For some reason the spectra are recorded backwards (from 4000 to 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is typical), often with a different scale below 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (to see the fingerprint region more clearly) and upside-down (% radiation transmitted is recorded instead of the absorbance of radiation).

The wavenumbers of the absorbed IR radiation are characteristic of many bonds, so IR spectroscopy can determine which functional groups are contained in the sample.  For example, the carbonyl (C=O) bond will absorb at 1650-1760cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Typical method ==

&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Infrared_spectroscopy|Wikipedia article.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IR_spectroscopy_apparatus.svg|thumbnail|centre|400px|Typical apparatus]]

A beam of infra-red light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in).

== Global ban enforcement ==

Hi. Please enforce the global ban on [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] declared by [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales Jimbo Wales] in [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:Community_Review/Wikimedia_Ethics:Ethical_Breaching_Experiments&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=548143&amp;oldid=548142 this edit].  Thanks!  &amp;nbsp; — &lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[[User:Jeff G.|Jeff]] [[User:Jeff G./talk|G. ツ]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:21, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:Looking through his edits I don't see any reason to ban him.  Looking at the other wiki's you've posted this message on it seems many of them feel the same.  I will not personally block any user without reason, regardless of who requests it. I find it notable that many of the admins at the other wiki's where you've requested this have responded similarly. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:47, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

::I will reverse any block made here simply for editing in a positive manner.  There's a request at [[m:Steward_requests/Global#Global_lock.2Funlock_for_Thekohser|Meta]], which is the only forum for a global ban that is appropriate. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:21, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:::I agree that Thekosher's activities here don't really justify blocking him on Wikibooks, but if Mike decides to block him then I think it would be a mistake to reverse that. From what Thekosher has written elsewhere you can see why Jimbo and other Wikipedians have taken against him. Starting a wheel war would be such a disaster here, that the rest of us should just swallow our principles this time for the good of the project. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 17:18, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

::::Beyond the possibility of a local block being implemented with no corresponding policy violation to justify it, a block here for actions on other wikis would seem to be against Mike's statement on his [[m:User:Mike.lifeguard|Meta page]] stating that steward actions would only be taken here in case of an emergency.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:45, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== Renaming a Book ==

Hallo
I would like, if possible, to rename a book.  I was the main author and need to change the name to reflect future use, however I have published links to pages in this book that I hope will still work when the book is renamed.  Is this going to be possible and how can I achieve it?  Thanks [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 10:14, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:You may use the move tab, by default it will leave behind a redirect that will automatically take users to the new book.  If the book consists of many pages you may want to ask an administrator to do it for you, since our tools allow us to move all subpages of a given module.  Unfortunately there is no way to protect the continued existence of these redirects indefinitely into the future for two reasons.  One someone may come along and start a new book with the same title as your old book and over write the redirect in doing so.  (Also there is a policy of deleting redirects are orphaned.  Though placing a link in the discussion page of your book could prevent this.)  So it is best if possible to update the links where ever you can.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:23, 27 April 2010 (UTC)


Thanks - I would like to go ahead and ask an administrator to make that change for me.  The book is currently called Question Writer 3 Manual and I would like it changed to Question Writer Manual.  Please let me know if there is anything I need to do [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 08:12, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

:All the pages have been renamed, all the links have been adjusted and made relative, the tags have been corrected to improve the print version, and headings have been added to the collection now linked from the main page to divide the dynamic PDF into chapters. The only thing not done was to correct the fair-use rationales on the images to point to the new page locations, but they do so through the redirects that were left behind. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:13, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

Thank you ever so much (even though I see now that I asked in the wrong place....[[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 08:23, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

:Now worries, you've got exactly the right place.  The page on Renaming is for renaming user accounts and not books. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:12, 12 May 2010 (UTC)  
:(PS. Thanks for getting to this before me A)

== RealityBot ==

The account {{userlinks|RealityBot}} probably isn't a bot, seeing that it has no userpage or user talk. If I'm right, shouldn't it be blocked indef? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:01, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
:We have no policy that would call for that. [[Wikibooks:Bots]] doesn't mention anything related to a user having a bot-like name and vice versa and the non-policy [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] doesn't deal with usernames.  Bots can run on Wikibooks without the bot flag and even without approval (assuming they aren't disruptive). Short of causing disruption, I can not justify a block at this time. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:14, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
::Also there was nothing harmful about the one existing edit under this account. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:26, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Huh, really? In Wikipedia bot accounts don't have to end with -bot but non-bot accounts must not end with -bot. Also in Wikipedia non-approved bots can't be created as they don't have the bot flag. Sorry for my mistake; I'm still quite new here. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:30, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
::::No problem. Wikipedia tends to be rather high-strung about such things. If the account isn't editing, there's no deception. If they start contributing regularly, you might consider asking them to request at [[WB:RENAME|rename]]. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mikelifeguard]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|enwikibooks]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 11:33, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
:::::OK, at this stage it seems to be editing like a bot would. However it should be provided with the bot flag. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:51, 7 May 2010 (UTC)
::::::We don't, however, hide edits for bots that have not been explicitly approved at [[WB:RFP]].  At minimum, I want to know who's operating it. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:31, 7 May 2010 (UTC)
:::::We seem to be having this conversation in two places. It doesn't look at all like a &quot;bot editing&quot; - the edits are far too infrequent to provide any evidence it is a bot. But regardless of that, bots do not get granted the bot flag without a proper discussion about the purpose and usage of the bot and that requires the operator to come forward and request the flag. There's no precedent, and I oppose creating one, of setting the bot flag just because an account name includes the three letters &quot;bot&quot;. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:37, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:I see no explicit request from Thenub314 on this other than discussion.  In fact, several titles have been mentioned in the discussion.  And if he's been undoing your revisions to the book, that makes me question if you're in a position to ask for a rename to a book he's been working on extensively.  Thenub's comments indicate he feels the book's introduction adequately defines its scope and audience; this rename seems as though it'd just be to satisfy you.  As for now, I've added {{tlx|book&amp;nbsp;title|Linear&amp;nbsp;Algebra|An&amp;nbsp;Introduction&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Mathematical&amp;nbsp;Discourse}} to the front page, to provide a subtitle without bloating out every page's link length. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
::''Coming up with a title that correctly gives the flavor of the book is difficult.  I suppose I think something like [[Linear Algebra: An Introduction to Mathematical Discourse]].'' This is what Thenub suggested. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 21:49, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Sometimes we just float ideas around to think about them or to get feedback. I don't see why Thenub's comment should be taken as a binding compromise. &lt;s&gt;Furthermore, I question the point of bringing this to the Administrative Assistance room, given that it is an editorial decision and also that Thenub himself is an admin, so theoretically he ''could'' unilaterally move the book if he really felt a pressing need to do so.&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 21:58, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: For what it is worth, real life is quite busy right now, so bringing a name change request here makes good sense and I had told [[User:33rogers|33rogers]] at some point in the discussion.  But as [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] seems to have guessed, I don't I like my own suggestion all that much, it sounds very 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century but I couldn't think of much better. I was kind of hoping it would spark some new idea, but I don't really mind having it there for the time being. For the moment, my opinion is that the book title template that Adrignola put in is perfect.  It allows us to try out different things without having to move all the pages this way and that.  And suggestions about the title are also still floating around, we should take [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]'s suggestions just as seriously as my own.  Maybe after we settle we can discuss a permanent move. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:08, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
::::: (Never mind, I have just seen that the idea of bringing it here came from Thenub. Consider the strikeout I left in my post above as a public contrition for overzealousness.) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 16:54, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

:Well, I'd support a vandalism only infinite account block - the contributions are all vandalism, and the attempt to impersonate you (by adding a block notice with an attempt to make the notice appear to come from your account) is clearly deserving of a block.

::It was telling that Adrignolans blanked [[User talk: Mikimeral |Mikimeral's talk page]], whom I had blocked indefinitely for vandalism.

::::&quot;'''But that guy's only a kid in the first grade'''&quot;. How do you know? Unless you have personal knowledge, anything else could be made up. In any case, abuse of multiple accounts to avoid a block isn't allowed, so the second account won't be unblocked.

:::: (Edit conflict with QU, forgive any repetition) Even if it were indefinite, a user can always request an unblock.  But don't be too moved by the persons claims that they are in P2, with near certainty this is a deception.  None of the P2 kids I am in contact with are really capable of sock puppeting, and some of the other edits I have seen form this user.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Redox Reactions (review) ==
Hi. I am curious as to why there is a review section on redox reactions on this page. I think it would just be better to state something along the lines of &quot;Please read [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|redox reactions]] before continuing&quot; or &quot;This page assumes general knowledge of redox reactions. Please read [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|redox reactions]] for more details&quot;. Electrochemistry is not really possible to fully understand without any knowledge of redox reactions anyway, so they should read about redox reactions first. That would make the information about redox reactions on this page unnecessary and redundant. --[[User:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:black;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:darkgreen;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;ward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] 21:42, 4 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Speedy Delete''': Unmaintained; Empty; see [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] &amp; [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Chess/Q&amp;A]] --16:38, 18 May 2010 (UTC)[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]])

:Strong [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  This is a unnecessary RfD, this page was tagged by [[User:33rogers|33rogers]] for speedy, oposed by myself and restored by Adrignola and finally there is a comment by Swift (that raises the issue of usefulness but never states it should be deleted) on the same page (off topic but now restored) and on the undelete request on Adrignola's talk.
: Given that, the rationals stated above is at least wrong and at worst deceptive (since it doesn't conform to reality). The indicated previous discussion clearly made a distinction on pages on the talk namespace. The page IS maintained and IS considered useful.
:I've been mostly working on that project alone and I think that any page in the talk namespace if maintained, and has a relation to that project's topic, is beneficial and invokes participation. In any case it should be to the existing book communities to manage that space. A RfD would be only in order if the book was abandoned or the page offensive in any way.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' No reason to delete. Even if this page wasn't actively watched, that doesn't devalue it's use. I suggested that it be deleted on the talk page as I personally don't see the value. Book contributors on the other hand do, and that's good enough for me. Not only is there no harm in keeping this, there is no gain in deleting it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:13, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

*There is already consensus from [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] that Wikipedia's Reference desk is the correct place for asking questions. The talk page in question has no useful content and I ask that it be deleted (speedy delete). --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 04:05, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
*: There is no such consensus. It may be a better place for a particular purpose but that doesn't mean wikibooks ''cannot'' have Q&amp;A pages, which is what you seem to be saying. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:07, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
*Furthermore, the only '''content''' on the page was:

&lt;nowiki&gt;== Delete, transwiki or move ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

First off, this page hasn't been used in the several years since it was started. It seems to not provide a very useful service and might just as well be deleted. Still, a place for readers to place questions may still be useful but might fit better at Wikiversity. Wikibooks concerns itself with the authoring of quality educational textbooks, while Wikiversity with the actual education. Should this page belong here, it would rather belong in the main namespace. That leaves the talk page to discussing the page &amp;mdash; as this section does. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:34, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. Mainly because the link to the Q&amp;A from the front page of the book says &quot;If you have questions related to P2P that are not addressed on the book, ask at the Q&amp;A.&quot;, clearly stating it was not meant as a general reference desk and hinting at its intended usage as a tool for identifying gaps in the book contents (a reasonable motivation for a Q&amp;A page, as I previously stated in the Python Q&amp;A RfD). Furthermore, the page is on Talk: namespace and is linked to an actively maintained book (so that it can potentially be useful to editors and visitors or even, if necessary, adjusted to better fit project scope). The really important point to be raised on this discussion, however, is that the nuanced arguments for and against deletion in the previous Python Q&amp;A RfD clearly show it would ''not'' be adequate to rush all similar cases through speedy deletion. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 05:03, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;'''Neutral'''&lt;/s&gt; While the comments above to sound reasonable, I still have doubts about keeping Q&amp;As. While Duplode's comment sounds rational, it sound a bit like word-play to me. If anyone convinces me I might change my mind though. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:16, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{keep}} '''and''' [[File:Symbol move vote.svg|15px]] '''Move'''. No particular reason to delete it, and one of the books main contributors would like to keep it.  Though as the page is linked from the books main page, it seems more appropriate to me to have the page in the main namespace. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:06, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: The page is a talk page, it is not part of the book content. (All pages that don't constitute the book content shouldn't be on the project's namespace (see also my post below and if you can reply there, same subject). Why do you feel it the main namespace is the best location?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

* {{keep}} This isn't just about whether to delete, though (nor even whether to rename, although I'm rather in favor of Thenub314's suggestion to move it to mainspace, since there's a demonstrated need for a separate page on which to discuss the content of the page).  Each Q&amp;A page is part of the structure of the book in which it occurs, and rearranging that structure should be done delicately and compassionately with due consideration to the circumstances and community of the individual book; RFD is too blunt an instrument (to say nothing of speedy delete, which doesn't appropriately apply because it is supposed to be limited to utterly uncontroversial cases).  There are two separate functions to be thought through and addressed appropriately:
:* helpdesk, which most of the ''general'' Wikibooks community here seem to agree is not appropriate for Wikibooks  &amp;mdash; but there seems to be some background level of ambivalence, and some disagreement over whether to farm it out to Wikipedia or to Wikiversity, and it might be more appropriately a decision for the local community of each book rather than for the larger community that deals with RFDs &amp;mdash; and
:* suggestions box, a place to suggest additional coverage that might be appropriate for the particular book &amp;mdash; suggestions that some books might choose to invite their readers to make at a special page dedicated to the purpose; and other books might choose to invite their readers to make at the book's main talk page, or at individual content pages' talk pages; and still other books might not specifically invite at all, but just leave readers to decide on their own initiative to make suggestions on the talk pages.
: At any rate, it seems to me that general discussion should be at the general reading room rather than here, and specific discussion of individual books should be at those individual book's main talk pages (with links from the Q&amp;A pages in question, presumably) rather than here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I don't agree, the Q&amp;A isn't part of the book, it is a talk page, a discussion area. The need that you feel exists in reality doesn't, for instance Swift post (not Q&amp;A material, and so offtopic on that page) seems to have been forced there, but this is mostly a software limitation, and structurally the main talk page indicates the right place to post such messages. 
:: The way we still use talkpages as if we are in Wikipedia is a software limitation and often a habit. This makes it hard to fallow discussions and to be aware of all activities, on the books I've centered my participation I also took steps to unobtrusively center all talks/discussions in a small set of pages and it seems to work better.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I agree with the view that this sort of page should be in the main namespace. I see no reason why a module cannot be interactive with content from readers. The talk page is then for the purpose of discussing that page. Either way, it doesn't really matter as it seems to do the job and I don't see anyone complaining.
:: I don't, however, agree with your statement on this so-called &quot;''general'' Wikibooks community&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:07, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Since this discussion is quickly moving in a more general and constructive direction I followed Pi zero's suggestion and [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Q.26A_pages_and_the_role_of_namespaces|forked it at the reading room]] (excuse me for the slightly ridiculous length of my post there). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 23:15, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:::: I don't mean to ignore the fork, but allow me to answer Panic's question here, since it was directed to me and is about this page instead of general considerations.  My reasons are two-fold, first it would allow the page to have a discussion page.  This would allow a more appropriate placement of Swift's comments.  Secondly, I do see the page as the part of the content of the book.  Sort of a frequently asked questions, where it is not clear if the questions are frequent.  Granted maybe that wasn't its intention, but that is how I see it. It is my opinion that this is also how readers of the book will view the page in some way.  When developed, many people will read the page not to ask a question, but to read other peoples questions and their answers with the hopes of learning from them.

Tagged by Weavejester, the main (perhaps only real) contributor following a declined speedy. Reason given was &quot;Requesting deletion: is unlikely to ever be updated. Confuses search engines.&quot; &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:05, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' At first I felt this was a rather tricky issue, but looking around for information on this software, I think everyone would be best served if we let this go.
: The book seems to be the creation of a fairly small development community which has moved the documentation to the [http://compojure.org Compojure project website]. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that anyone would want to build a separate wikibook based on this outdated one. Policies aside, it seems highly unlikely that anyone will benefit from this book which, with its third place in [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Compojure&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= an internet search] for the software and [http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/browse_thread/thread/54de878b01218f2b/00d3df5af9d9c143?lnk=gst&amp;q=wikibooks#00d3df5af9d9c143 year old information], is actually more likely to confuse people looking for information, hurting both the Compojure project as well as Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:15, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''':&lt;/s&gt; I've seen attempts on other books where contributors have moved to other websites and tried to remove content here or tell readers to ignore content here get reversed.  The hard truth is that a great deal of the books on software here are likely to be outdated.  I merged several books into [[Beginner's Guide to Adobe Flash]], which itself was for Flash 8 (2005); some of the other books dealt with Flash MX (2002) and all referred to it as Macromedia Flash, before the rename to Adobe Flash (2007).  Let's ask ourselves how many books &quot;unlikely to ever be updated, confuses search engines&quot; would apply to.  It'd make a better topic for a general forum, but this is what comes to my mind regarding this nomination.  &lt;s&gt;In this particular case, the only significant contributor has requested deletion, so I personally would have honored the speedy deletion request.&lt;/s&gt; -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:15, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Look closer. The only page where Weavejester is the only significant contributor is [[Compojure/Dependencies]]. so Darklama's call was correct.

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' People seem to forget or overlook that not everyone can buy a new computer annually or afford to get the latest release of software programs. How is not keeping updated with the latest version of software programs a problem? I can imagine people will still find a use for books that talk about an older release. Wikibooks isn't paper so books can sit idle until someone comes along to update or improve on them. I've been inclined not to honor deletions like this where people decided to continue the work elsewhere and there can potentially be useful work here still. IMO failure to keep up isn't a reason to delete. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:03, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' The existing deletion policy doesn't provide any context for the creator/contributor asking for a deletion but states that as valid basis for speedy deletion. My opinion is that only the request of the contributor wouldn't justify the deletion of any usable content and so seems QuiteUnusual (and  Swift raises the issue that this isn't even an exact fact). But Swift argumentation for deletion is based on what he sees as future expectation for evolution, on the other hand Adrignola experience (and my own) seems to indicate that even abandoned stubs can be turned into useful projects, to that point even the rational for the requested speedy seems strange and a weak reason to provide the deletion, should we act to promote another projects or is our first duty to benefit Wikibooks? What about the license of the &quot;new&quot; content ?
: I'm willing to change my opinion if stronger argumentation is put forward or a greater assurance is given that the new location will keep the content free, I wouldn't mind at all that a link to the new location would be used with some visibility but carefully constructed not to redirect contributors (something similar to what I've done when fixing the [[Slackersbible]]). At this moment I prefer to keep the free stub...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:37, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. I'm not supporting deletion, I just saw the RFD tag had been placed on the book following the declined speedy without creating an entry here. I put the RFD discussion here purely as an &quot;administrative tidy up&quot;, not because I support the deletion. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:00, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. While from a superficial point of view the objections raised by Weavejester make sense this request sounds too much like a mere claim of ownership. There is no reason not to believe in the future someone else could build upon the existing pages and update the book, particularly if the Compojure community grows. In particular, comparing the code examples in the book and on the official site reveals that one year certainly was not enough to make all information useless (for instance, the syntax wasn't re-elaborated from scratch). By the way, &quot;confusing search engines&quot; is not a good argument. If the book is really too outdated to be useful people will stop linking to it and Google ratings will gradually drop. And finally, if there were worries about the situation mentioned in the post linked by Swift it wouldn't cost much to modify the offending page so that it provides links to where to read updated installation instructions - probably it would take about the same time it took to file speedy del and RfD requests... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 22:51, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
:: P.S.: Some good soul [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Compojure%2FGetting_Started&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1804311&amp;oldid=1799303 just did exactly that] :) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:49, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. My aim is not to claim ownership over the content, but to remove a resource that is frequently a source of confusion. Wikibooks tend to rate quite highly on search engines; not necessarily because many people link to the specific book, but because Wikibooks is a highly linked-to site in general. So even if there were no direct links to the Compojure wikibook, it would still be ranked highly by search engines. Because of this, I tend to get a fair few questions on why the steps in the Compojure wikibook don't work, and I have to explain that the wikibook is considerably out of date and shouldn't be used as a reference. Now, I could slap out-of-date notices on all the pages, and link back to up-to-date documentation, but given that no-one is interested in keeping it updated, is there any point to keeping it around? It's conceivable that someone might take up the task in future, but as every page of the wikibook is thoroughly obsolete, they'd have to rewrite all the pages anyway: it would be far simpler for our hypothetical maintainer to start from scratch. This is my reasoning behind requesting that the book be deleted. -- [[User:Weavejester|Weavejester]] 01:52, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I don't understand why this is a frequent source of confusion. Surely people would be just as confused reading a hard copy or printed book about an older version of the software when a newer version of the software is installed on their computer? How is this failure to not use the right book for the right version of the software our problem or even your problem? How about adding this sort of confused question to some sort of FAQ document on your website? You could for example add &quot;Q: Why Does X, Y, or Z not work for me? A: Make sure you are using the correct software version. The interface changed between 1.0-blah and 1.2-blah.&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:34, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Printed books are typically written about stable software. In this case, the Compojure wikibook partially documents an early, pre-alpha version that bears little resemblance to the current releases. If the wikibook detailed anything that was still used, I'd recommend keeping the page. -- [[User:WeaveJester|WeaveJester]] 19:36, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

:'''Keep''' per above, perhaps rename to remind readers that it's about the old version. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:43, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''': To extend upon my previous comments, which are along this vein...  This is a fundamental misunderstanding with what Wikibooks is, in that it is not a web host; contributing here releases content under a [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|license]] that permits redistribution of the material, with no retraction of that.  If Wikibooks comes up third in the results (pretty good for Wikibooks competing with Wikipedia), update the documentation here or make the site's documentation rank higher than Wikibooks.  In no other situation would one have any hopes of shutting down one's competitors in the search engine results page.  Following the link above, I get [http://weavejester.github.com/compojure/docs/contributing-documentation.html this page] on contributing documentation.  Read through that and see just how inconvenient it is to update it for the average user trying to help out others after discovering a solution to a problem they encountered that wasn't addressed in the documentation.  I personally find this platform inferior to Wikibooks (which does permit review of changes before they are shown to logged-out users).  While this isn't about ownership of content here, is it about control of content elsewhere, given that Weavejester must be asked for permission to update the documentation on compjure.org?  Maybe the users simply prefer our platform instead? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:19, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Just to make things clear. Ownership is not the same as control.

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep and Versiontag''' I was pointed here via [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Software_Books_and_software_versions|WB:RR/G]]; you can read my post there for my general position. Basically a way to make it ''extremely clear'' to any viewer that the material applies to a specific version of the software needs to be found and a consensus general guideline would be great to have on top of that. Is there any way to make RevisionReview have ''multiple'' stable versions? Failing that perhaps we can set up some kind of template that works like [[w:Dwarf Fortress|Dwarf Fortress']] wiki handles multiple versions (although without using namespaces) ([http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Alcohol] [http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/40d:Alcohol]). For now at the very least put a notice on all pages summarizing that: 1) These pages represent an old version of the software, 2) Anyone is welcome to contribute material relevant to any version of the software (so long as it's made clear what version the page refers to), and 3) If a page is edited to refer to a new version of the software it should also be edited to reflect that fact.

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Well... so long as the wikibook is clearly marked as being out of date, I guess that's fine. My goal was never to remove competing sources of information, nor to subvert anyone's creative output. My only issue it that the wikibook currently contains no relevant or useful information, and in my view would only hinder anyone wishing to maintain an up-to-date Compojure wikibook, as it would be easier for any hypothetical maintainer to start from scratch. That said, I understand that removing information, however obsolete and useless, potentially sets a dangerous precedent, and therefore I withdraw my request for deletion.  -- [[User:WeaveJester|WeaveJester]] 19:36, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elemental analysis''' is the process for determining the partial or complete chemical formula for a substance.  Most commonly, it involves the complete combustion in air or oxygen of the substance and then quantifying the amount of elemental oxides produced.  In the case of organic compounds, the carbon is converted to carbon dioxide and the hydrogen to water.  From these, the percent carbon and percent hydrogen in the substance can be found and compared with a proposed chemical formula for the substance at hand.

Element test: Put a small amount of the solid into a small piece of Na metal then roll it around the solid, followed by introduction into a fusion tube. The tube is heated with a gentle flame at a slow rate (in order not to evaporate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present in solid) then strong heating till the bottom of the tube become red hot. The tube is then put in a beaker containing a minimal amount of water then heated, cooled, filtered and the filtrate divided into three parts.

1. &lt;u&gt;Test for nitrogen&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate and ferrous sulphate are boiled and cooled and dilute sulphuric acid is added. If green or blue color occurs the solid contain nitrogen.

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+C+N --&gt; NaCN&lt;br&gt;
FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+NaCN gives Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4NaCN give the complex Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
ferrous oxidizes to ferric by the acid so
3Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]+4Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2. &lt;u&gt;Test for sulphur&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute acetic acid and lead acetate, yielding a brown or black precipitate. 

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+S --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S +Pb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields lead sulphide, a black precipitate.

or:
The filtrate and sodium nitro prusside yield a violet color 

Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO] --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NOS] = violet color

3. &lt;u&gt;Test for chlorine&lt;/u&gt;:

a) In the absence of N or S:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate. Formation of a white precipitate suggests the presence of chlorine.

b) In the presence of N and/or S :

The filtrate is exposed to dilute sulphoric acid then boiled to 1/3 initial volume and cooled. Formation of a white precipitate after the addition of dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate suggests the presence of chlorine.

&lt;b&gt;Equations&lt;/b&gt;:

NaCN+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; AgCN white ppt&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S black ppt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In the presence of N or S these two precipitates may interfere with the white colour of the result of the chlorine test.  Therefore dilute sulphoric acid is added because in the presence of N or S&lt;/b&gt;:
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+ dilute H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;4 gives H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas
NaCN+ dilulte H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives HCN gas 

There is no interference with the white colour expected from the chlorine test in solid.

[[File:Gas chromatograph.jpg|thumb|Pictured is a sophisticated gas chromatography system. This instrument records concentrations of acrylonitrile in the air at various points throughout the chemical laboratory.]]
'''Chromatography ''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χρώμα:''chroma'', color and γραφειν:''graphein'' to write) is the collective term for a set of [[laboratory techniques]] for the [[separation of mixtures]]. 
It involves passing a mixture dissolved in a &quot;mobile phase&quot; through a ''stationary phase'', which separates the [[analyte]] to be measured from other molecules in the mixture based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's [[partition coefficient]] result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus '''changing''' the separation.

Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for further use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.

==History==
The '''history of chromatography''' begins during the mid-19th century. Chromatography, literally &quot;color writing&quot;, was used—and named— in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]]. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many types of [[separation process]].

Some related techniques were developed during the 19th century (and even before), but the first true chromatography is usually attributed to Russian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet|Mikhail Semyonovich Tsvet]], who used columns of calcium carbonate for separating plant pigments during the first decade of the 20th century during his research of [[chlorophyll]].

Chromatography became developed substantially as a result of the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] during the 1940s and 1950s. They established the principles and basic techniques of [[partition chromatography]], and their work encouraged the rapid development of several types of chromatography method: [[paper chromatography]], [[gas chromatography]], and what would become known as [[high performance liquid chromatography]]. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Simultaneously, advances continually improved the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.

==Chromatography terms==

*The '''analyte''' is the substance to be separated during chromatography.
*'''Analytical chromatography''' is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a sample.
*A '''bonded phase''' is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing. 
*A '''chromatogram''' is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture. 
:[[File:Rt 5 9.png|300px|Chromatogram with unresolved peaks]] [[File:Rt 5 12.png|300px|Chromatogram with two resolved peaks]]
:Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]], [[Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.
*A '''chromatograph''' is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.
*'''Chromatography''' is a physical method of separation in which the components to be separated are distributed between two phases, one of which is stationary (stationary phase) while the other (the mobile phase) moves in a definite direction.
*The '''eluent''' is the mobile phase leaving the column.
*An '''[[eluotropic series]]''' is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.
*An '''immobilized phase''' is a stationary phase which is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.
*The '''mobile phase''' is the phase which moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and CEC), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of [[HPLC]] the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or polar solvents in reverse phase chromotagraphy and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated. 
*'''Preparative chromatography''' is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.
*The '''retention time''' is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: [[Kovat's retention index]]
*The '''sample''' is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.
*The '''solute''' refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.
*The '''solvent''' refers to any substance capable of solubilizing other substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in LC.
*The '''stationary phase''' is the substance which is fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the [[silica]] layer in [[Chromatography#Thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]

==Techniques by chromatographic bed shape==
===Column chromatography===
Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6504x0819.pdf IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography] IUPAC Recommendations 1993, Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 65, No. 4, pp.819-872, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called '''flash column chromatography''' (flash).&lt;ref&gt;Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1978''', ''43(14)'', 2923-2925. {{DOI|10.1021/jo00408a041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

|Number of Pages: 790}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.

In [[expanded bed adsorption]], a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.

===Planar chromatography===
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of [[chlorophyll]]]]
'''Planar chromatography''' is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ([[paper chromatography]]) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ([[thin layer chromatography]]). Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific [[Retention factor]] (R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.

====Paper chromatography====
Paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]''. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of [[solvent]] and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.

====Thin layer chromatography====
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique and is similar to [[paper chromatography]]. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like [[silica gel]], [[aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat, inert substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, [[HPTLC|high-performance TLC]] can be used.

==Displacement chromatography==
The basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:  
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography 101]. Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Techniques by physical state of mobile phase==
===Gas chromatography===
Gas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as Gas-Liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile  phase is a gas. Gas chromatography is always carried out in a column, which is typically &quot;packed&quot; or &quot;capillary&quot; (see below) .

Gas chromatography (GC) is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a solid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often Helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter glass tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]]; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat will denature them), frequently encountered in [[biochemistry]], it is well suited for use in the [[petrochemical]], environmental monitoring, and [[Chemical industry|industrial chemical]] fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.

===Liquid chromatography===
Liquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).

In the HPLC technique, the sample is forced through a column that is packed with irregularly or spherically shaped particles or a porous monolithic layer (stationary phase) by a liquid (mobile phase) at high pressure. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Technique in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g. toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) is called normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g. water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 = octadecylsilyl as the stationary phase) is called reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Ironically the &quot;normal phase&quot; has fewer applications and RPLC is therefore used considerably more. 

Specific techniques which come under this broad heading are listed below. It should also be noted that the following techniques can also be considered [[fast protein liquid chromatography]] if no pressure is used to drive the mobile phase through the stationary phase. See also [[Aqueous Normal Phase Chromatography]].

==Affinity chromatography==
Affinity chromatography&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bailon, George K. Ehrlich, Wen-Jian Fung and Wolfgang Berthold, An Overview of Affinity Chromatography, Humana Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-89603-694-9, ISBN 978-1-60327-261-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very [[robust]]. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of [[protein]]s bound to tags. These [[fusion protein]]s are labeled with compounds such as [[His-tag]]s, [[biotin]] or [[antigen]]s, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.

Affinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.).  Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.

However, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatogaphy properties.  Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (I.e. Dionex IMAC) .  Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinty. 

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
Supercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.

==Techniques by separation mechanism==
===Ion exchange chromatography===
Ion exchange chromatography uses ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an [[ion exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s which interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to be retained. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].

===Size exclusion chromatography===
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as '''gel permeation chromatography''' (GPC) or '''gel filtration chromatography''' and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).
Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore,molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retension; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions.

==Special techniques==
===Reversed-phase chromatography===
Reversed-phase chromatography is an elution procedure used in liquid chromatography in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase.

===Two-dimensional chromatography===
In some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical ([[Chemical classification]]) properties. Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography.
The sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate,developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.

===Simulated moving-bed chromatography===

===Pyrolysis gas chromatography===

===Fast protein liquid chromatography===
Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) is a term applied to several chromatography techniques which are used to purify proteins. Many of these techniques are identical to those carried out under high performance liquid chromatography, however use of FPLC techniques are typically for preparing large scale batches of a purified product.

===Countercurrent chromatography===
Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. It involves mixing a solution of liquids, allowing them to settle into layers and then separating the layers.

===Chiral chromatography===
Chiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. Chiral chromatography HPLC columns (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.

'''Affinity chromatography''' is a method of separating [[biochemistry|biochemical]] mixtures and based on a highly specific biological interaction such as that between antigen and antibody, enzyme and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or [[biochemistry receptor|receptor]] and [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]].  Affinity chromatography combines the size fractionation capability of [[gel permeation chromatography]] with the ability to design a chromatography that reversibly binds to a known subset of molecules. The method was by Cuatrecasas P, Wilchek M,and Meir Wilchek for which the Wolf Prize in Medicine was awarded in 1987. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, affinity chromatography has been the means by which many scientists from different disciplines have been introduced in to the fields of modern biology {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.
==Uses==

Affinity chromatography can be used to:
* Purify and concentrate a substance from a mixture into a buffering solution 

* Reduce the amount of a substance in a mixture

* Discern what biological compounds bind to a particular substance, such as drugs

* Purify and concentrate an enzyme solution.

==Principle==

The immobile phase is typically a gel matrix, often of agarose; a linear sugar molecule derived from algae.&lt;ref&gt;Voet and Voet, Biochemistry John Wiley and Sons; 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the starting point is an undefined heterogeneous group of molecules in solution, such as a cell lysate, growth medium or blood [[blood plasma|serum]]. The molecule of interest will have a well known and defined property which can be exploited during the affinity purification process. The process itself can be thought of as an entrapment, with the target molecule becoming trapped on a solid or stationary phase or medium. The other molecules in solution will not become trapped as they do not possess this property. The solid medium can then be removed from the mixture, washed and the target molecule released from the entrapment in a process known as elution. Possibly the most common use of affinity chromotography is for the purification  of recombinant proteins.

==Batch and column setup==
[[Image:Affinity-column.png|right|thumb|Column chromatography|170px]]
Binding to the solid phase may be achieved by column chromatography whereby the solid medium is packed onto a column, the initial mixture run through the column to allow setting, a wash buffer run through the column and the elution buffer subsequently applied to the column and collected. These steps are usually done at ambient pressure. 
Alternatively binding may be achieved using a batch treatment, by adding the initial mixture to the solid phase in a vessel, mixing, separating the solid phase (for example), removing the liquid phase, washing, re-centrifuging, adding the elution buffer, re-centrifuging and removing the eluate.

Sometimes a hybrid method is employed, the binding is done by the batch method, then the solid phase with the target molecule bound is packed onto a column and washing and elution are done on the column.

A third method,expanded bed adsorption, which combines the advantages of the two methods mentioned above, has also been developed. The solid phase particles are placed in a column where liquid phase is pumped in from the bottom and exits at the top. The gravity of the particles ensure that the solid phase does not exit the column with the liquid phase.

==Specific uses==

Affinity chromatography can be used in a number of applications, including nucleic acid purification, protein purification from cell free extracts, and purification from blood.

===Immunoaffinity===

Another use for the procedure is the affinity purification of antibodies from blood serum. If serum is known to contain antibodies against a specific antigen (for example if the serum comes from an organism against the antigen concerned) then it can be used for the affinity purification of that antigen. This is also known as Immunoaffinity Chromatography. For example if an organism is immunised against a GST-fusion protein it will produce antibodies against the fusion-protein, and possibly antibodies against the GST tag as well. The protein can then be covalently coupled to a solid support such as agarose 

For thoroughness the GST protein and the GST-fusion protein can each be coupled separately. The serum is initially allowed to bind to the GST affinity matrix. This will remove antibodies against the GST part of the fusion protein. The serum is then separated from the solid support and allowed to bind to the GST-fusion protein matrix. This allows any antibodies that recognize the antigen to be captured on the solid support. Elution of the antibodies of interest is most often achieved using a low [[pH]] buffer such as glycine pH 2.8. The eluate is collected into a neutral [[tris]] or phosphate buffer, to neutralize the low pH elution buffer and halt any degradation of the antibody's activity. This is a nice example as affinity purification is used to purify the initial GST-fusion protein, to remove the undesirable anti-GST antibodies from the serum and to purify the target antibody.

A simplified strategy is often employed to purify antibodies generated against peptide [[antigen]]s. When the peptide antigens are produced synthetically, a terminal [[cysteine]] residue is added at either the N- or C-terminus of the peptide. This cysteine residue contains a [[sulfhydryl]] functional group which allows the peptide to be easily conjugated to a carrier protein (e.g.Keyhole limpet hemocyaninKLH). The same cysteine-containing peptide is also immobilized onto an agarose resin through the cysteine residue and is then used to purify the antibody.

===Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography===

Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) is based on the specific coordinate covalent bond of amino acids, particularly histidine, to metals.  This technique works by allowing proteins with an affinity for metal ions to be retained in a column containing immobilized metal ions, such as cobalt, nickel, copper for the purification of histidine containing proteins or peptides, iron,zinc or gallium for the purification of phosphorylated proteins or peptides. Many naturally occurring proteins do not have an affinity for metal ions, therefore [[recombinant DNA technology]] can be used to introduce such a protein tag into the relevant gene. Methods used to elute the protein of interest include changing the pH, or adding a competitive molecule, such as imidazole.

===Recombinant proteins===

Possibly the most common use of affinity chromatography is for the purification of recombinant proteins. Proteins with a known affinity are [[protein tag|protein tagged]] in order to aid their purification. The protein may have been genetically modified so as to allow it to be selected for affinity binding, this is known as a fusion protein. Tags include glutathione-S-transferase tags. have an affinity for nickel or cobalt ions which are Coordinate covalent bond|coordinated] with a chelator for the purposes of solid medium entrapment. For elution, an excess amount of a compound able to act as a metal ion ligand, such as imidazole, is used. GST has an affinity for glutathione -commercially available immobilized as glutathione agarose. For elution, excess glutathione is used to displace the tagged protein.

===Lectins===

Lectin affinity chromatography is a form of affinity chromatography where lectins are used to separate components within the sample. Lectins, such as [[Concanavalin A]] are proteins which can bind specific carbohydrate (sugar) molecules. The most common application is to separate proteins based on their Glycosylation groups.

[[Image:P1000495.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Typical set up for manual column chromatography.]]
[[Image:Colortest.jpg|frame|right|A chemist in the 1950s using column chromatography.  The Erlenmeyer receptacles are on the floor.]]
'''Column chromatography''' in [[chemistry]] is a method used to purify individual [[chemical compounds]] from mixtures of compounds.  It is often used for preparative applications on scales from micrograms up to kilograms.

The classical preparative chromatography column, is a glass tube with a diameter from 5&amp;nbsp;mm to 50&amp;nbsp;mm and a height of 50&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 m with a tap at the bottom. Two methods are generally used to prepare a column; the dry method, and the wet method. For the dry method, the column is first filled with dry [[Chromatography#Chromatography_terms|stationary phase]] powder, followed by the addition of mobile phase, which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet, and from this point is never allowed to run dry. For the wet method, a [[slurry]] is prepared of the [[eluent]] with the [[Chromatography#Chromatography_terms|stationary phase]] powder and then carefully poured into the column. Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered [[separating funnel]] is put on top of the column.

The individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are running at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute one at a time. During the entire chromatography process the eluent is collected in a series of [[fractionation|fraction]]s. The composition of the eluent flow can be monitored and each fraction is analyzed for dissolved compounds, e.g. by analytical chromatography, [[Ultraviolet|UV]] absorption, or [[fluorescence]]. Colored compounds (or [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] compounds with the aid of an [[Ultraviolet|UV]] lamp) can be seen through the glass wall as moving bands.

==Overview==
[[Image:Column chromatography sequence.png|600px|thumb|Column chromatography proceeds by a series of steps.]]

== Stationary phase

The ''stationary phase'' or ''adsorbent'' in column chromatography is a solid. The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is [[silica gel]], followed by [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. [[Cellulose]] powder has often been used in the past. Also possible are [[ion exchange chromatography]], [[reversed-phase chromatography]] (RP), [[affinity chromatography]] or [[expanded bed adsorption]] (EBA). The stationary phases are usually finely ground powders or gels and/or are microporous for an increased surface, though in EBA a fluidized bed is used.'''

== Mobile phase (eluent) ==

The ''mobile phase'' or ''[[eluent]]'' is either a pure [[solvent]] or a mixture of different solvents. It is chosen so that the [[retention factor]] value of the compound of interest is roughly around 0.2 - 0.3 in order to minimize the time and the amount of eluent to run the chromatography. The eluent has also been chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The eluent is optimized in small scale pretests, often using [[chromatography|thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) with the same stationary phase.

A faster [[flow rate]] of the eluent minimizes the time required to run a column and thereby minimizes diffusion, resulting in a better separation, see [[Van Deemter's equation]].  A simple laboratory column runs by [[gravity]] flow.  The flow rate of such a column can be increased by extending the fresh eluent filled column above the top of the stationary phase or decreased by the tap controls.  Better flow rates can be achieved by using a pump or by using compressed gas (e.g. air, [[nitrogen]], or [[argon]]) to push the solvent through the column (flash column chromatography).&lt;ref&gt;Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1978''', ''43(14)'', 2923-2925. ({{DOI|10.1021/jo00408a041}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

The particle size of the stationary phase is generally finer in flash column chromatography than in gravity column chromatography. For example, one of the most widely used silica gel grades in the former technique is mesh 230 – 400 (40 – 63 µm), while the latter technique typically requires mesh 70 – 230 (63 – 200 µm) silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;Normal phase column chromatography, [http://www.materialharvest.com/welcome/silica_products/silica_gels_chromatography.html Material Harvest]&lt;/ref&gt;

A spreadsheet that assists in the successful development of flash columns has been developed. The spreadsheet estimates the retention volume and band volume of analytes, the fraction numbers expected to contain each analyte, and the resolution between adjacent peaks. This information allows users to select optimal parameters for preparative-scale separations before the flash column itself is attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, J. D.; Kormos, C. M. ''[[J. Chromatogr. A]]'' '''2008''', ''1211''(1-2), 49-54. ({{DOI|10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.085}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automated Systems ==
[[Image:Metrohm 850.jpg|thumb|right|An automated ion chromatography system.]]
Column chromatography is an extremely time consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab.  Therefore, several manufacturers have developed automated flash chromatography systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around 50-75 psi) that minimize human involvement in the purification process.  Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive HPLC systems such as a gradient pump, sample injection ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent.  Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial kg scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems.

The resolution (or the ability to separate a mixture) on an LPLC system will always be lower compared to HPLC, as the packing material in an HPLC column can be much smaller, typically only 5 micrometre thus increasing stationary phase surface area, increasing surface interactions and giving better separation.  However, the use of this small packing media causes the high back pressure and is why it is termed high pressure liquid chromatography.  The LPLC columns are typically packed with silica of around 50 micrometres, thus reducing back pressure and resolution, but it also removes the need for expensive high pressure pumps.  Manufacturers are now starting to move into higher pressure flash chromatography systems and have termed these as medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) systems which operate above 150 psi.

The software controlling an automated system will coordinate the components, allow a user to only collect the factions that contain their target compound (assuming they are detectable on the system's detector) and help the user to find the resulting purified material within the fraction collector.  The software will also save the resulting chromatograph from the process for archival and/or later recall purposes.

A representative example of column chromatography as part of an undergraduate laboratory exercise is the separation of three components (out of 28) in the oil of [[spearmint]]: [[carvone]], [[limonene]] and [[dehydrocarveol]] &lt;ref&gt;''Isolation of Three Components from Spearmint Oil: An Exercise in Column and Thin-Layer Chromatography'' Davies, Don R.; Johnson, Todd M. J. Chem. Educ. '''2007''' 84[http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Feb/abs318.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[microscale chemistry|microscale]] setup consisting of a [[Pasteur pipette]] as column with silica gel stationary phase can suffice. The starting eluent is [[hexane]] and solvent [[Chemical polarity|polarity]] is increased during the process by adding [[ethyl acetate]].

== Column Chromatogram Resolution Calculation ==

Typically, column chromatography is set up with peristaltic pumps flowing buffers and the solution sample through the top of the column.  The solutions and buffers pass through the column where a fraction collector at the end of the column setup collects the eluted samples.  Prior to the fraction collection, the samples that are eluted from the column pass through a detector such as a [[spectrophotometer]] or [[mass spectrometer]] so that the concentration of the separated samples in the sample solution mixture can be determined.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you were to separate two different proteins with different binding capacities to the column from a solution sample, a good type of detector would be a spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 280&amp;nbsp;nm.  The higher the concentration of protein that passes through the eluted solution through the column, the higher the absorbance of that wavelength.
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the column chromatography has a constant flow of eluted solution passing through the detector at varying concentrations, the detector must plot the concentration of the eluted sample over a course of time.  This plot of sample concentration versus time is called a chromatogram.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ultimate goal of chromatography is to separate different components from a solution mixture.  The resolution expresses the extent of separation between the components from the mixture.  The higher the resolution of the chromatogram, the better the extent of separation of the samples the column gives.  This data is a good way of determining the column’s separation properties of that particular sample.  The resolution can be calculated from the chromatogram.
&lt;br /&gt;
The separate curves in the diagram represent different sample elution concentration profiles over time based on their affinity to the column resin.  To calculate resolution, the retention time and curve width are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Retention Time:''' The time from the start of signal detection by the detector to the peak height of the elution concentration profile of each different sample.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Curve Width:''' The width of the concentration profile curve of the different samples in the chromatogram in units of time.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A simplified method of calculating chromatogram resolution is to use the plate model&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;Harrison et al.  ''Bioseparations Science and Engineering''.  Oxford University Press.  New York, New York.  2003&lt;/ref&gt;.  The plate model assumes that the column can be divided into a certain number of sections, or plates and the mass balance can be calculated for each individual plate.  This approach approximates a typical chromatogram curve as a [[Gaussian distribution]] curve.  By doing this, the curve width is estimated as 4 times the standard deviation of the curve, 4σ.  The retention time is the time from the start of signal detection to the time of the peak height of the Gaussian curve.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the variables in the figure above, the resolution, plate number, and plate height of the column plate model can be calculated using the equations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Resolution (R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;
	 R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2(t&lt;sub&gt;RB&lt;/sub&gt; – t&lt;sub&gt;RA&lt;/sub&gt;)/(w&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + w&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	t&lt;sub&gt;RB&lt;/sub&gt; = retention time of solute B&lt;br /&gt;
	t&lt;sub&gt;RA&lt;/sub&gt; = retention time of solute A&lt;br /&gt;
	w&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = Gaussian curve width of solute B&lt;br /&gt;
	w&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = Gaussian curve width of solute A&lt;br /&gt;
Plate Number (N):&lt;br /&gt;
	N = (t&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(w/4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Plate Height (H):&lt;br /&gt;
	H = L/N&lt;br /&gt;
Where L is the length of the column.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;

== Column Adsorption Equilibrium ==

For an adsorption column, the column resin (the stationary phase) is composed of microbeads.  Even smaller particles such as proteins, carbohydrates, metal ions, or other chemical compounds are conjugated onto the microbeads.  Each binding particle that is attached to the microbead can be assumed to bind in a 1:1 ratio with the solute sample sent through the column that needs to be purified or separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Binding between the target molecule to be separated and the binding molecule on the column beads can be modeled using a simple equilibrium reaction K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = [CS]/([C][S]) where K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[equilibrium constant]], [C] and [S] are the concentrations of the target molecule and the binding molecule on the column resin, respectively.  [CS] is the concentration of the complex of the target molecule bound to the column resin.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using this as a basis, three different isotherms can be used to describe the binding dynamics of a column chromatography: linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The linear isotherm occurs when the solute concentration needed to be purified is very small relative to the binding molecule of the.  Thus, the equilibrium can be defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For industrial scale uses, the total binding molecules on the column resin beads must be factored in because unoccupied sites must be taken into account.  The [[Langmuir isotherm]] and Freundlich isotherm are useful in describing this equilibrium.
Langmuir Isotherm:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = (K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;[C])/(1 + K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C]), where S&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; is the total binding molecules on the beads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Freundlich Isotherm:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C]&lt;sup&gt;1/n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Freundlich isotherm is used when the column can bind to many different samples in the solution that needs to be purified.  Because the many different samples have different binding constants to the beads, there are many different Keq’s.  Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm is not a good model for binding in this case.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Discovery==
The advent of displacement chromatography can be attributed to Tiselius &lt;ref&gt;A. Tiselius. Displacement development in adsorption analysis.  Ark. Kemi. Mineral Geol. 16A: 1–18    (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;, who in 1943 first classified the modes of chromatography as frontal, elution, and displacement. Displacement chromatography has since found a variety of applications from isolation of transuranic elements &lt;ref&gt;G. T. Seaborg. The Transuranium Elements. Science 104(2704):379-386 (1946).	&lt;/ref&gt; to biochemical entities &lt;ref&gt;J. Frenz and C.S. Horvath.  High performance displacement chromatography.  pp 212-314 in  C. Horvath (Ed.) High Performance Liquid Chromatography-advances and perspectives. Vol. 5, Academic Press, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Displacement chromatography is a chromatographic method in which the components are resolved into consecutive  “rectangular” zones of highly concentrated pure substances rather than solvent separated “peaks”. The molecules are forced to migrate down the column by an advancing wave of a displacer molecule that has a higher affinity for the stationary phase than the feed solute. &lt;ref&gt;N. Tugcu .  Purification of proteins using displacement chromatography.  pp 71-89 in M. Zachariou (Ed.)  Methods in Molecular Biology: Vol 421 Affinity Chromatography: Methods and Protocols. 2nd edition. Humana Press, Totowa NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this forced migration, higher product concentrations and purities may be obtained compared to other modes of chromatography.  The technique was rediscovered by Horvath &lt;ref&gt;C.S. Horvath, A. Nahum, and J. Frenz. High performance displacement
chromatography. J. Chromatogr. 218, 365–393(1981).
&lt;/ref&gt; and has since found many applications, particularly in the realm of biological macromolecule purification.

==Principle==
The basic principle of displacement chromatography is:   
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;Displacement Chromatography 101.  [http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html] Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks.  Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification.  The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors.  But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix.  Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference.  In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings.  Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings.  Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Theory and method==
As shown above, a displacement chromatography process can be broken down into three distinct phases:  loading, displacement, and regeneration.  For the sake of simplicity, examples of biomolecule purification given here will be restricted to proteins.  In principle, all biomolecules of commercial interest today – including oligonucleotides and antibodies – can be purified in displacement mode, with the right choice of column matrix and displacer.

'''Loading phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
The purification starts with a column equilibrated with a loading buffer similar to elution chromatography methods.  The feed mixture containing the impure proteins in buffer is loaded onto the column at a fairly slow rate, under conditions where the materials are well retained.  The purpose of this step is to initiate the binding of the biomolecules in a semiequilibrium state. This is shown in the graphic as the mixture of proteins begins an early separation into yellow and purple components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Displacement phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
After the sample has been loaded, the column is fed a solution of displacer at a fairly low concentration (typically 5 mM) in the same buffer used to load the sample.  The displacer is designed to bind more tightly to the matrix than any of the biomolecules and thus &quot;pushes&quot; all components of the mixture off the matrix ahead of it.  As long as each sample component and the displacer is not irreversibly adsorbed on the column matrix, there is some of each continually adsorbing to, and desorbing from, the matrix.  

In elution mode, optimal results are obtained when concentrations are so low that individual components act independently and do not compete for binding sites on the matrix.  In displacement mode, sample components are introduced in much more concentrated form, and so it is possible for a stronger binding component – either the displacer or one of the proteins in the sample mixture – to compete for binding sites.  The stronger binding components (initially, the displacer itself) then displace by successfully competing for binding sites. 
Based on their individual binding strengths, each component in the original sample then becomes a “displacer” for the next less tightly bound component.  Thus a displacement train is established as adjacent, focused bands with little overlap (yellow and purple in the graphic).  In a successful run, the train is fully established before the components of interest arrive at the bottom of the column.  Fractions can be collected and the desired product cuts made.

'''Regeneration phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
When the displacer breaks through, i.e., begins to emerge from the column, the run is complete and column regeneration can begin.  Regeneration is accomplished by using a buffer that can remove the displacer from the matrix, followed by an equilibration with loading buffer in preparation for the next run.  Since displacers must bind more strongly than any protein being purified, it is to be expected that their removal from the column should require some special conditions.  A non-trivial part of the design of a good displacer, then, is the incorporation of some structural feature that allows for complete removal from the matrix under some conditions.

'''Advantages of displacement chromatography'''&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction between displacement and step gradient chromatography is that the displacer front always remains behind the adjacent feed zones in the displacement train whereas desorbents (e.g., salts in ion exchange, organic modifiers in reversed-phase chromatography) move through the feed zones. The displacement mode of chromatography takes advantage of the thermodynamic characteristics of the chromatographic system to overcome many of the shortcomings of preparative elution and gradient chromatography. This characteristic of displacement makes it less sensitive to the feed loads than the elution modes of operation, thus enabling it to deliver higher process throughputs. Another advantage is the high resolution that displacement can deliver as compared to elution processes. Displacement  chromatography exploits the nonlinear, multicomponent competition among the components to be separated, resulting in higher resolution, particularly among closely related species. In contrast, in elution processes (e.g., linear gradient, step gradient), the separation takes place under relatively weaker binding conditions (which are essential to get the solutes off the column). The separation factors among solutes are thus lower in elution than in displacement, leading to poorer resolution in the elution modes of operation. Other advantages of displacement include a better control over the product concentrations and the emergence of the product in relatively low concentrations of the mobile phase modifier. The combination of high throughputs and high resolutions in a single process makes displacement an attractive mode of operation for protein purification.

==Applications==
The chromatographic purification of proteins from complex mixtures can be quite challenging, particularly when the mixtures contain similarly retained proteins or when it is desired to enrich trace components in the feed. Further, column loading is often limited when high resolutions are required using traditional modes of chromatography (e.g. linear gradient, isocratic chromatography). In these cases, displacement chromatography is an efficient technique for the purification of proteins from complex mixtures at high column loadings in a variety of applications.
An important advance in the state of the art of displacement chromatography was the development of low molecular mass displacers for protein purification in ion exchange systems.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Cramer and G. Jayaraman, Current Opinions in Biotechnology 4: 217-225, (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;G. Jayaraman, S. Gadam, and S. M. Cramer. J. Chromatogr. A 630:53-68. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;G. Jayaraman, Y. Li, J. A. Moore, and S. M. Cramer. J. Chromatogr. A 702:143-155. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;. This research was significant in that it represented a major departure from the conventional wisdom that large polyelectrolyte polymers are required to displace proteins in ion exchange systems.
Low molecular mass displacers have significant operational advantages as compared to large polyelectrolyte displacers. For example, if there is any overlap between the displacer and the protein of interest, these low molecular mass materials can be readily separated from the purified protein during post-displacement processing using standard size-based purification methods (e.g. size exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration). In addition, the salt dependent adsorption behavior of these low MW displacers greatly facilitates column regeneration. These displacers have been employed for a wide variety of high resolution separations in ion exchange systems&lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S. Vunnum, G.  Jayaraman, and S. M. Cramer. Biotech. and Bioeng. 48: 452-460. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S.  Vunnum, and S. M. Cramer.  J. Chromatogr. A, 707:57-67. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S. Vunnum, and S. M. Cramer.  Adsorption 4:3-4. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, K. Barnthouse, and S. M. Cramer. Biotech. and Bioeng., 56:119-129. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;KA. Kundu, A. A.  Shukla, K. A.

Barnthouse, S. S. Bae, J. A. Moore, and S. M. Cramer.. J. Chromatogr. A 814:1-2. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the utility of displacement chromatography for the purification of recombinant growth factors&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Barnthouse, W. Trompeter, R. Jone, P. Inampudi, R.Rupp, and S. M. Cramer. J. Biotechnol. 66:125-136 (1998) &lt;/ref&gt; , antigenic vaccine proteins&lt;ref&gt; A. A. Shukla, R. L. Hopfer, D. N. Chakravarti, E. Bortell, and S. M. Cramer. Biotechnol.

A 923:65-73(2001)&lt;/ref&gt; has also been demonstrated. There are several examples in which displacement chromatography has been applied to the purification of proteins using ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, as well as reversed phase chromatography &lt;ref&gt;R. Freitag and J. Breier. J. Chromatogr. A 691, 101–112 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Displacement chromatography is well suited for obtaining mg quantities of purified proteins from complex mixtures using standard analytical chromatography columns at the bench scale. It is also particularly well suited for enriching trace components in the feed. Displacement chromatography can be readily carried out using a variety of resin systems including, ion exchange, HIC and RPLC &lt;ref&gt;Trace Component Amplification.

Reactive and Functional Polymers 54, 37–47(2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
Two-dimensional chromatography represents the most thorough and rigorous approach to evaluation of the proteome. While previously accepted approaches have utilized elution mode chromatographic approaches such as cation exchange to reversed phase HPLC, yields are typically very low requiring analytical sensitivities in the picomolar to femptomolar range &lt;ref&gt;.

Vol. 1, No. 1, Pages 37-46 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;. As Displacement chromatography offers the advantage of concentration of trace components, two dimensional chromatography utilizing displacement rather than elution mode in the upstream chromatography step represents a potentially powerful tool for analysis of trace components, modifications, and identification of minor expressed components of the proteome.&lt;ref&gt;  2D-HPLC Course SACHEM, Inc.

'''Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)''', or simply '''gas chromatography (GC)''', is a common type of [[chromatography]] used in [[organic chemistry]] for [[Separation process|separating]] and analyzing compounds that can be [[vaporized]] without [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]]. Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture (the relative amounts of such components can also be determined). In some situations, GC may help in identifying a compound. In [[microscale chemistry]], GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; &gt;{{cite book | author = Pavia, Donald L., Gary M. Lampman, George S. Kritz, Randall G. Engel | title = Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques (4th Ed.) | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole| pages = 797-817 | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 978-0-495-28069-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gas chromatography, the ''moving phase'' (or &quot;mobile phase&quot;) is a carrier [[gas]], usually an [[inert]] gas such as [[helium]] or an [[Reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas such as [[nitrogen]]. The ''stationary phase'' is a microscopic layer of [[liquid]] or [[polymer]] on an inert [[solid]] support, inside a piece of [[glass]] or [[metal]] tubing called a column. The instrument used to perform gas chromatography is called a ''gas chromatograph'' (or &quot;aerograph&quot;, &quot;gas separator&quot;).

The gaseous compounds being analyzed interact with the walls of the column, which is coated with different stationary phases. This causes each compound to [[Elution|elute]] at a different time, known as the ''retention time'' of the compound. The comparison of retention times is what gives GC its analytical usefulness.

Gas chromatography is in principle similar to [[column chromatography]] (as well as other forms of chromatography, such as [[HPLC]], [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]]), but has several notable differences. Firstly, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is carried out between a liquid stationary phase and a gas moving phase, whereas in column chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the moving phase is a liquid. (Hence the full name of the procedure is &quot;Gas-liquid chromatography&quot;, referring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively.) Secondly, the column through which the gas phase passes is located in an [[oven]] where the [[temperature]] of the gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography (typically) has no such temperature control. Thirdly, the [[concentration]] of a compound in the gas phase is solely a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[vapor pressure]] of the gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

Gas chromatography is also similar to [[fractional distillation]], since both processes separate the components of a mixture primarily based on [[boiling point]] (or vapor pressure) differences. However, fractional distillation is typically used to separate components of a mixture on a large scale, whereas GC can be used on a much smaller scale (i.e. microscale).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

Gas chromatography is also sometimes known as '''vapor-phase chromatography''' (VPC), or '''gas-liquid partition chromatography''' (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently found in [[scientific literature]]. Strictly speaking, GLPC is the most correct terminology, and is thus preferred by many authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

== History ==

[[Chromatography]] dates to 1903 in the work of the [[Russia]]n scientist, [[Mikhail Semenovich Tswett]]. [[Germany|German]] graduate student [[Fritz Prior]] developed solid state gas chromatography in 1947.  [[Archer John Porter Martin]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for his work in developing liquid-liquid (1941) and paper (1944) chromatography, laid the foundation for the development of gas chromatography and later produced liquid-gas chromatography (1950).

== GC analysis ==

A '''gas chromatograph''' is a chemical analysis instrument for separating [[chemical]]s in a complex sample.  A gas chromatograph uses a flow-through narrow tube known as the ''column'', through which different chemical constituents of a sample pass in a gas stream (carrier gas, ''mobile phase'') at different rates depending on their various chemical and physical properties and their interaction with a specific column filling, called the ''stationary phase''. As the chemicals exit the end of the column, they are detected and identified [[electronics|electronically]]. The function of the stationary phase in the column is to separate different components, causing each one to exit the column at a different time (''retention time''). Other parameters that can be used to alter the order or time of retention are the carrier gas flow rate, and the temperature.

In a GC analysis, a known volume of gaseous or liquid [[analyte]] is injected into the &quot;entrance&quot; (head) of the column, usually using a micro[[syringe]] (or, solid phase microextraction fibers, or a gas source switching system).  As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through the column, this motion is inhibited by the [[adsorption]] of the analyte [[molecule]]s either onto the column walls or onto packing materials in the column. The rate at which the molecules progress along the column depends on the strength of [[adsorption]], which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials. Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression, the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along the column and reach the end of the column at different times (retention time). A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column; thus, the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined.  Generally, substances are identified (qualitatively) by the order in which they emerge (elute) from the column and by the retention time of the analyte in the column.

== Physical components ==
[[Image:Gas chromatograph.png|thumb|350px|right|Diagram of a gas chromatograph.]]
=== Autosamplers ===

The autosampler provides the means to introduce a sample automatically into the inlets. Manual insertion of the sample is possible but is no longer common. Automatic insertion provides better reproducibility and time-optimization.

Different kinds of autosamplers exist. Autosamplers can be classified in relation to sample capacity (auto-injectors vs. autosamplers, where auto-injectors can work a small number of samples), to robotic technologies (XYZ robot vs. rotating/SCARA-robot – the most common), or to analysis:
* '''Liquid'''
* '''Static head-space by syringe technology'''
* '''Dynamic head-space by transfer-line technology'''
* '''[[Solid phase microextraction|SPME]]'''

Traditionally autosampler manufacturers are different from GC manufacturers and currently no GC manufacturer offers a complete range of autosamplers. Historically, the countries most active in autosampler technology development are the United States, Italy, and Switzerland.

=== Inlets ===

The '''column inlet''' (or ''injector'') provides the means to introduce a sample into a continuous flow of carrier gas. The inlet is a piece of hardware attached to the ''column head''. 

&lt;u&gt;Common inlet types are:&lt;/u&gt;
* '''S/SL (Split/Splitless) injector'''; a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a ''septum'' - the heat facilitates [[volatilization]] of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (''splitless'' mode) or a portion (''split'' mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the ''split vent''. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (&gt;0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes. (&lt;0.01%)
* '''On-column inlet'''; the sample is here introduced in its entirety without heat. 
* '''PTV injector'''; Temperature-programmed sample introduction was first described by Vogt in 1979. Originally Vogt developed the technique as a method for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 µL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The temperature of the liner was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low-boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the Programmed Temperature Vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented.
* '''Gas source inlet''' or '''gas switching valve'''; gaseous samples in collection bottles are connected to what is most commonly a six-port ''switching valve''.  The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated ''sample loop''. Upon switching, the contents of the sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream. 
* '''P/T (Purge-and-Trap) system''';  An inert gas is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing insoluble volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix.  The volatiles are 'trapped' on an absorbent column (known as a trap or concentrator) at ambient temperature.  The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream.  Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually hooked up to the S/SL port. 
* '''[[Solid phase microextraction|SPME]]''' (solid phase microextraction) offers a convenient, low-cost alternative to P/T systems with the versatility of a syringe and simple use of the S/SL port.

=== Columns ===

Two types of columns are used in GC:
*'''Packed columns''' are 1.5 - 10 m in length and have an internal diameter of 2 - 4 mm.  The tubing is usually made of stainless steel or glass and contains a ''packing'' of finely divided, inert, solid support material (e.g. [[diatomaceous earth]]) that is coated with a liquid or solid stationary phase.  The nature of the coating material determines what type of materials will be most strongly adsorbed.  Thus numerous columns are available that are designed to separate specific types of compounds. 
*'''Capillary columns''' have a very small internal diameter, on the order of a few tenths of millimeters, and lengths between 25-60 meters are common. The inner column walls are coated with the active materials (WCOT columns), some columns are quasi solid filled with many parallel micropores (PLOT columns).  Most capillary columns are made of fused-[[silica]] with a [[polyimide]] outer coating. These columns are flexible, so a very long column can be wound into a small coil. 
*'''New developments''' are sought where stationary phase incompatibilities lead to geometric solutions of parallel columns within one column. Among these new developments are: 
** Internally heated ''microFAST'' columns, where two columns, an internal heating wire and a temperature sensor are combined within a common column sheath ([http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04012004-193144 microFAST]);
** ''[http://www.restek.com/restek/images/external/620-04-001.pdf Micropacked columns]'' (1/16&quot; OD) are column-in-column packed columns where the outer column space has a packing different from the inner column space, thus providing the separation behaviour of two columns in one. They can easily fit to inlets and detectors of a capillary column instrument. 

The '''temperature-dependence''' of molecular adsorption and of the rate of progression along the column necessitates a careful control of the column [[temperature]] to within a few tenths of a degree for precise work.  Reducing the temperature produces the greatest level of separation, but can result in very long elution times.  For some cases temperature is ramped either continuously or in steps to provide the desired separation.  This is referred to as a '''temperature program'''.  Electronic pressure control can also be used to modify flow rate during the analysis, aiding in faster run times while keeping acceptable levels of separation.

The '''choice of carrier gas''' (''mobile phase'') is important, with hydrogen being the most efficient and providing the best separation.  However, helium has a larger range of flowrates that are comparable to hydrogen in efficiency, with the added advantage that helium is non-flammable, and works with a greater number of detectors.  Therefore, helium is the most common carrier gas used.

=== Detectors ===

A number of detectors are used in gas chromatography.  The most common are the [[flame ionization detector]] (FID) and the [[thermal conductivity detector]] (TCD).  Both are sensitive to a wide range of components, and both work over a wide range of concentrations.  While TCDs are essentially universal and can be used to detect any component other than the carrier gas (as long as their thermal conductivities are different from that of the carrier gas, at detector temperature), FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD.  However, an FID cannot detect water.  Both detectors are also quite robust. Since TCD is non-destructive, it can be operated in-series before an FID (destructive), thus providing complementary detection of the same analytes.

Other detectors are sensitive only to specific types of substances, or work well only in narrower ranges of concentrations.  They include:
*[[discharge ionization detector]] (DID), which uses a high-voltage electric discharge to produce ions.
*[[electron capture detector]] (ECD), which uses a radioactive [[Beta particle]] (electron) source to measure the degree of electron capture.
*[[flame photometric detector]] (FPD)
*[[flame ionization detector]] (FID)
*[[Hall electrolytic conductivity detector]] (ElCD)
*[[helium ionization detector]] (HID)
*[[Nitrogen Phosphorus Detector]] (NPD)
*[[mass selective detector]] (MSD)
*[[photo-ionization detector]] (PID)
*[[pulsed discharge ionization detector]] (PDD)
*[[thermal energy(conductivity) analyzer/detector]] (TEA/TCD)

Some gas chromatographs are connected to a [[mass spectrometer]] which acts as the detector.  The combination is known as [[GC-MS]].  Some [[GC-MS]] are connected to an [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectrometer]] which acts as a back up detector. This combination is known as [[GC-MS-NMR]]. Some [[GC-MS-NMR]] are connected to an [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]] which acts as a back up detector. This combination is known as [[GC-MS-NMR-IR]]. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS.

== Methods ==

The '''method''' is the collection of conditions in which the GC operates for a given analysis.  '''Method development''' is the process of determining what conditions are adequate and/or ideal for the analysis required.

Conditions which can be varied to accommodate a required analysis include inlet temperature, detector temperature, column temperature and temperature program, carrier gas and carrier gas flow rates, the column's stationary phase, diameter and length, inlet type and flow rates, sample size and injection technique.  Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, there may be a number of detector conditions that can also be varied.  Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development.

[[Image:GeoStrataEclipse.jpg]]

This image above shows the interior of a GeoStrata Technologies Eclipse Gas Chromatograph that runs continuously in three minute cycles. Two valves are used to switch the test gas into the sample loop. After filling the sample loop with test gas, the valves are switched again applying carrier gas pressure to the sample loop and forcing the sample through the Column for separation.

=== Carrier gas selection and flow rates ===
Typical carrier gases include [[helium]], [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[air]].  Which gas to use is usually determined by the detector being used, for example, a [[Discharge ionization detector|DID]] requires helium as the carrier gas.  When analyzing gas samples, however, the carrier is sometimes selected based on the sample's matrix, for example, when analyzing a mixture in argon, an argon carrier is preferred, because the argon in the sample does not show up on the chromatogram.  Safety and availability can also influence carrier selection, for example, hydrogen is flammable, and high-purity helium can be difficult to obtain in some areas of the world.  (See: [[Helium#Occurrence and production|Helium--occurrence and production]].)

The purity of the carrier gas is also frequently determined by the detector, though the level of sensitivity needed can also play a significant role.  Typically, purities of 99.995% or higher are used.  Trade names for typical purities include &quot;Zero Grade,&quot; &quot;Ultra-High Purity (UHP) Grade,&quot; &quot;4.5 Grade&quot; and &quot;5.0 Grade.&quot;

The carrier gas flow rate affects the analysis in the same way that temperature does (see above).  The higher the flow rate the faster the analysis, but the lower the separation between analytes.  Selecting the flow rate is therefore the same compromise between the level of separation and length of analysis as selecting the column temperature.

With GCs made before the 1990s, carrier flow rate was controlled indirectly by controlling the carrier inlet pressure, or &quot;column head pressure.&quot;  The actual flow rate was measured at the outlet of the column or the detector with an electronic flow meter, or a bubble flow meter, and could be an involved, time consuming, and frustrating process.  The pressure setting was not able to be varied during the run, and thus the flow was essentially constant during the analysis. The relation between flow rate and inlet pressure is calculated with [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation#Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids|Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids]].

Many modern GCs, however, electronically measure the flow rate, and electronically control the carrier gas pressure to set the flow rate.  Consequently, carrier pressures and flow rates can be adjusted during the run, creating pressure/flow programs similar to temperature programs.

=== Inlet types and flow rates ===

The choice of inlet type and injection technique depends on if the sample is in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present that has to be vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the S/SL injector (SPME applications).

=== Sample size and injection technique ===
==== Sample injection ====
[[Image:GCruleof10.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The rule of ten in gas chromatography]]
The real chromatographic analysis starts with the introduction of the sample onto the column. The development of capillary gas chromatography resulted in many practical problems with the injection technique. The technique of on-column injection, often used with packed columns, is usually not possible with capillary columns. The injection system, in the capillary gas chromatograph, should fulfil the following two requirements:
#The amount injected should not overload the column.
#The width of the injected plug should be small compared to the spreading due to the chromatographic process. Failure to comply with this requirement will reduce the separation capability of the column. As a general rule, the volume injected, V&lt;sub&gt;inj&lt;/sub&gt;, and the volume of the detector cell, V&lt;sub&gt;det&lt;/sub&gt;, should be about 1/10 of the volume occupied by the portion of sample containing the molecules of interest (analytes) when they exit the column.

Some general requirements, which a good injection technique should fulfill, are:

*It should be possible to obtain the column’s optimum separation efficiency.
*It should allow accurate and reproducible injections of small amounts of representative samples.
*It should induce no change in sample composition. It should not exhibit discrimination based on differences in boiling point, polarity, concentration or thermal/catalytic stability.
*It should be applicable for trace analysis as well as for undiluted samples.

=== Column selection ===

=== Column temperature and temperature program ===
[[Image:GC Oven inside.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A gas chromatography oven, open to show a capillary column]]
The column(s) in a GC are contained in an oven, the temperature of which is precisely controlled electronically.  (When discussing the &quot;temperature of the column,&quot; an analyst is technically referring to the temperature of the column oven.  The distinction, however, is not important and will not subsequently be made in this article.)

The rate at which a sample passes through the column is directly proportional to the temperature of the column.  The higher the column temperature, the faster the sample moves through the column.  However, the faster a sample moves through the column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.

In general, the column temperature is selected to compromise between the length of the analysis and the level of separation.

A method which holds the column at the same temperature for the entire analysis is called &quot;isothermal.&quot;  Most methods, however, increase the column temperature during the analysis, the initial temperature, rate of temperature increase (the temperature &quot;ramp&quot;) and final temperature is called the &quot;'''temperature program'''.&quot;

A temperature program allows analytes that elute early in the analysis to separate adequately, while shortening the time it takes for late-eluting analytes to pass through the column.

== Data reduction and analysis ==

'''Qualitative analysis:'''

Generally chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis), which is called a chromatogram.  This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the [[analyte]]s present in a sample eluting from the column at different times.  Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant.  Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes.  In most modern applications however the GC is connected to a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks.

'''Quantitive analysis:'''

The area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the chromatogram.  By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined.  Concentration can be calculated using a [[calibration curve]] created by finding the response for a series of concentrations of analyte, or by determining the [[relative response factor]] of an analyte.  The relative response factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an [[internal standard]] (or [[external standard]]) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte).

In most modern [[GC-MS]] systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks, and match [[mass spectrometry|MS]] spectra to library spectra.

== Application ==
In general, substances that vaporize below ca. 300 °C (and therefore are stable up to that temperature) can be measured quantitatively. The samples are also required to be [[salt]]-free; they should not contain [[ion]]s. Very minute amounts of a substance can be measured, but it is often required that the sample must be measured in comparison to a sample containing the pure, suspected substance.

Various [[GC temperature program|temperature programs]] can be used to make the readings more meaningful; for example to differentiate between substances that behave similarly during the GC process.

Professionals working with GC analyze the content of a chemical product, for example in assuring the quality of products in the chemical industry; or measuring toxic substances in soil, air or water. GC is very accurate if used properly and can measure [[picomole]]s of a substance in a 1 ml liquid sample, or [[Parts per notation|parts-per-billion]] concentrations in gaseous samples.

In practical courses at colleges, students sometimes get acquainted to the GC by studying the contents of [[Lavender]] oil or measuring the [[ethylene]] that is secreted by ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'' plants after artificially injuring their leaves. These GC analyses hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a [[Thermal conductivity detector|TCD]].  The [[hydrocarbon]]s are separated using a capillary column and detected with an [[Flame ionization detector|FID]].  A complication with light gas analyses that include H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted).  For this reason, dual TCD instruments are used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common.  Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than 2 separate ones.  The sensitivity is less but this is a tradeoff for simplicity in the gas supply.

== GCs in popular culture ==

Movies, books and TV shows tend to misrepresent the capabilities of gas chromatography and the work done with these instruments.

In the U.S. TV show [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]], for example, GCs are used to rapidly identify unknown samples.  &quot;This is [[gasoline]] bought at a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] station in the past two weeks,&quot; the analyst will say fifteen minutes after receiving the sample.

In fact, a typical GC analysis takes much more time; sometimes a single sample must be run more than an hour according to the chosen program; and even more time is needed to &quot;heat out&quot; the column so it is free from the first sample and can be used for the next. Equally, several runs are needed to confirm the results of a study - a GC analysis of a single sample may simply yield a result per chance (see [[statistical significance]]).

Also, GC does not positively identify most samples; and not all substances in a sample will necessarily be detected.  All a GC truly tells you is at which relative time a component eluted from the column and that the detector was sensitive to it. To make results meaningful, analysts need to know which components at which concentrations are to be expected; and even then a small amount of a substance can hide itself behind a substance having both a higher concentration and the same relative elution time. Last but not least it is often needed to check the results of the sample against a GC analysis of a reference sample containing only the suspected substance.

A [[GC-MS]] can remove much of this ambiguity, since the [[mass spectrometer]] will identify the component's molecular weight.  But this still takes time and skill to do properly.

Similarly, most GC analyses are not [[push-button]] operations.  You cannot simply drop a sample vial into an auto-sampler's tray, push a button and have a computer tell you everything you need to know about the sample. According to the substances one expects to find the operating program must be carefully chosen.

A push-button operation can exist for running similar samples repeatedly, such as in a chemical production environment or for comparing 20 samples from the same experiment to calculate the mean content of the same substance.  However, for the kind of investigative work portrayed in books, movies and TV shows this is clearly not the case.

'''High-performance liquid chromatography''' (HPLC) is a form of [[column chromatography]] used frequently in [[biochemistry]] and [[analytical chemistry]]. It is also sometimes referred to as '''high-pressure liquid chromatography'''. HPLC is used to separate components of a mixture by using a variety of chemical interactions between the substance being analyzed ([[analyte]]) and the chromatography column.  

==Operation==
The basic operating principle of ''HPLC'' is to force the [[analyte]] through a [[column chromatography|column]] of the [[stationary phase]] (usually a tube packed with small round particles with a certain surface chemistry) by pumping a liquid (mobile phase) at high [[pressure]] through the column. The sample to be analyzed is introduced in small volume to the stream of mobile phase and is retarded by specific chemical or physical interactions with the stationary phase as it traverses the length of the column. The amount of retardation depends on the nature of the analyte, stationary phase and mobile phase composition. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (comes out of the end of the column) is called the retention time and is considered a reasonably unique identifying characteristic of a given analyte. The use of pressure increases the linear [[velocity]] (speed) giving the components less time to [[diffusion|diffuse]] within the column, leading to improved resolution in the resulting [[Chromatography|chromatogram]]. Common [[solvent]]s used include any miscible combinations of [[Water (molecule)|water]] or various organic liquids (the most common are [[methanol]] and [[acetonitrile]]). Water may contain buffers or salts to assist in the separation of the analyte components, or compounds such as [[Trifluoroacetic acid]] which acts as an ion pairing agent. 

A further refinement to HPLC has been to vary the mobile phase composition during the analysis, this is known as ''gradient elution''. A normal gradient for reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% methanol and progress linearly to 50% methanol over 25 minutes, depending on how [[hydrophobic]] the analyte is. The gradient separates the analyte mixtures as a function of the affinity of the analyte for the current mobile phase composition relative to the stationary phase. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a [[liquid-liquid extraction]] but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/methanol gradient, the more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) under conditions of relatively high methanol; whereas the more hydrophilic compounds will elute under conditions of relatively low methanol. The choice of solvents, additives and gradient depend on the nature of the stationary phase and the analyte. Often a series of tests are performed on the analyte and a number of generic runs may be processed in order to find the optimum HPLC method for the analyte - the method which gives the best separation of peaks.

==Types of HPLC==
=== Normal phase chromatography ===
Normal phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) was the first kind of HPLC chemistry used, and separates analytes based on polarity.  This method uses a polar stationary phase and a nonpolar mobile phase, and is used when the analyte of interest is fairly polar in nature. The polar analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increase in analyte polarity, and the interaction between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) increases the elution time. The interaction strength not only depends on the functional groups in the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors and structural isomers are often resolved from one another. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes while more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times. Particularly polar solvents in a mixture tend to deactivate the column by occupying the stationary phase surface. This is somewhat particular to normal phase because it is most purely an adsorptive mechanism (the interactions are with a hard surface rather than a soft layer on a surface).. 

NP-HPLC had fallen out of favor in the 1970's with the development of reversed-phase HPLC because of a lack of reproducibility of retention times as water or protic organic solvents changed the hydration state of the silica or alumina chromatographic media. Recently it has become useful again with the development of [[Hilic|HILIC]] bonded phases which utilize a partition mechanism which provides reproducibility.

=== Reversed phase chromatography ===
Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) consists of a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been treated with RMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;. The retention time is therefore longer for molecules which are more non-polar in nature, allowing polar molecules to elute more readily. Retention time is increased by the addition of polar solvent to the mobile phase and decreased by the addition of more hydrophobic solvent. Reversed phase chromatography (RPC) is so commonly used that it is not uncommon for it to be incorrectly referred to as &quot;HPLC&quot; without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RPC to qualify drugs before their release.

RPC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which result from repulsive forces between a polar eluent, the relatively non-polar analyte, and the non-polar stationary phase. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand in the aqueous eluent. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for &quot;cavity-reduction&quot; around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the [[surface tension]] of the eluent (water: 73 erg/cm2, methanol: 22 erg/cm2) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding less-polar solvent (MeOH, ACN)into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. [[Gradient elution]] uses this effect by automatically changing the polarity of the mobile phase during the course of the analysis.

Structural properties of the analyte molecule play an important role in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C-H, C-C, and generally nonpolar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) results in a longer retention time because it increases the molecule's nonpolar surface area, which is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO- or -NH3+ reduce retention as they are well integrated into water. Very large molecules, however, can result in an incomplete interaction between the large analyte surface and the ligands alkyl chains and can have problems entering the pores of the stationary phase. 

Retention time increases with hydrophobic - nonpolar - surface area. Branched chain compounds elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C-C-bonds elute later than the ones with a C=C or C-C-triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single C-C-bond.

Aside from mobile phase surface tension (organizational strength in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention.  For example, the addition of inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5 erg/cm2 pro Mol for NaCl, 2.5 erg/cm2 pro Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the [[entropy]] of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteines and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC). 

Another important component is the influence of the [[pH]] since this can change the hydrophobicity of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a [[buffering agent]], such as [[sodium phosphate]], to control the pH. A volatile organic acid such as [[formic acid]] or most commonly [[trifluoroacetic acid]] is often added to the mobile phase, if mass spectrometry is applied to the eluent fractions. The buffers serve multiple purposes: they control pH, neutralize the charge on any residual exposed silica on the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize charge on the analyte. The effect varies depending on use but generally improve the chromatography.

Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared with normal silica columns, however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and should '''never''' be used with aqueous [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] as these will destroy the underlying silica backbone. They can be used with aqueous acid but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a [[column]] is to inject a sample which is a [[mixture]] of 2,2'- and 4,4'- [[bipyridine]]. Because the 2,2'-bipy can [[chelate]] the metal it is normal that when a [[metal]] [[ion]] is present on the surface of the [[silica]] the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted, tailing will be seen on this distorted peak.

=== Size exclusion chromatography ===
{{details|Size exclusion chromatography}}
[[Size exclusion chromatography]] (SEC), also known as ''gel permeation chromatography'' or ''gel filtration chromatography'', separates particles on the basis of size. It is generally a low [[Image resolution|resolution]] chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, and is the primary technique for determining the average molecular weight of natural and synthetic [[polymers]].

=== Ion exchange chromatography ===
{{details|Ion exchange chromatography}}
In Ion-exchange chromatography, retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Ions of the same charge are excluded. Some types of Ion Exchangers include: (1) Polystyrene resins- allows cross linkage which increases the stability of the chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. (2) Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers (gels)-These possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for protein separation.(3)Controlled-pore glass or porous silica.  

In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius. 

An increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. An increase in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while a decrease in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange.

This form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: In purifying water, preconcentration of trace components, Ligand-exchange chromatography, Ion-exchange chromatography of proteins, High-pH anion-exchange chromatography of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, etc.

=== Bioaffinity chromatography ===

This chromatographic process relies on the property of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waal's interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.

=== Isocratic flow and gradient elution ===

With regard to the mobile phase, a composition that remains constant throughout the procedure is termed ''isocratic''.

In contrast to this is the so called &quot;gradient elution&quot;, which is a separation where the mobile phase changes its composition during a separation process. One example is a gradient in 20 min starting from 10% Methanol and ending up with 30% Methanol. Such a gradient can be increasing or decreasing. The benefit of gradient elution is that it helps speed up elution by allowing components that elute more quickly to come off the column under different conditions than components which are more readily retained by the column. By changing the composition of the solvent, components that are to be resolved can be selectively more or less associated with the mobile phase as a result at equilibrium they spend more time in the solvent and less in the stationary phase therefore they elute faster.

==Parameters==
=== Internal diameter ===
The internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is a critical aspect that determines quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column and also influences sensitivity. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption at the expense of loading capacity.
*Larger ID columns (over 10 mm) are used to purify usable amounts of material because of their large loading capacity.
*Analytical scale columns (4.6 mm) have been the most common type of columns, though smaller columns are rapidly gaining in popularity. They are used in traditional quantitative analysis of samples and often use a [[spectrophotometer|UV-Vis absorbance detector]].
*Narrow-bore columns (1-2 mm) are used for applications when more sensitivity is desired either with special UV-vis detectors, [[fluorescence]] detection or with other detection methods like [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]]
*Capillary columns (under 0.3 mm) which are used almost exclusively with alternative detection means such as [[mass spectrometry]]. They are usually made from [[fused silica]] capillaries, rather than the stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ.

=== Particle size ===
Most traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical silica particles (very small beads).  These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcgceurope.com/lcgceurope/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=333246&amp;pageID=3#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Xiang, Y. Liu and M. L. Lee; J. Chrom. A, Vol. 1104, Issues 1-2, (2006), Pages 198-202 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Cs.Horváth, B.A. Preiss and S.R. Lipsky; Anal. Chem., 39, 1422–1428 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This means that changing to particles that are half as big in the same size of column will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are more often used in non-HPLC applications such as [[solid-phase extraction]].

=== Pore size ===
Many stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics especially for larger analyses. For example a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but not easily leave once inside.

=== Pump pressure ===
[[Pump]]s vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible [[flow rate]].  [[Pressure]] may reach as high as 6000 [[Pound per square inch|lbf/in²]] (~40 MPa, or about 400 atmospheres).  Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore be able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (&lt; 2 micrometres).  These &quot;Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography&quot; systems or UHPLCs can work at up to 15,000 lbf/in² (~100 MPa or about 1000 atmospheres). Note that the term &quot;UPLC&quot;, sometimes found instead is a trademark of [[Waters Corporation]] and not the name for the technique in general.

'''Ion-exchange chromatography''' (or ''ion chromatography'') is a process that allows the separation of [[ion]]s and [[polar molecule]]s based on their charge. It can be used for almost any kind of charged molecule including large [[proteins]], small [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acid]]s. The solution to be injected is usually called a ''sample'', and the individually separated components are called ''analytes''. It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control.

== History ==
Ion methods have been in use since 1850, when H. Thompson and J. T. Way, researchers in England, treated various clays with ammonium sulfate or carbonate in solution to extract the ammonia and release calcium. In 1927, the first [[zeolite]] mineral column was used to remove interfering calcium and magnesium ions from solution to determine the sulfate content of water. The modern version of IEC was developed during the wartime [[Manhattan Project]]. A technique was required to separate and concentrate the radioactive elements needed to make the atom bomb. Researchers chose [[adsorb]]ents that would latch onto charged [[transuranium elements]], which could then be differentially eluted. Ultimately, once declassified, these techniques would use new IE [[resin]]s to develop the systems that are often used today for specific purification of biologicals and inorganics. In the early 1970s, ion chromatography was developed by Hamish Small and co-workers at [[Dow Chemical|Dow Chemical Company]] as a novel method of IEC usable in automated analysis. This later lead to the formation of Dionex Corp (Dow -Ion Exchange) who lead the market in IC equipment and developments. IC uses weaker ionic resins for its stationary phase and an additional neutralizing stripper, or suppressor, column to remove background eluent ions. It is a powerful technique for determining low concentrations of ions and is especially useful in environmental and water quality studies, among other applications.

==Principle==
[[Image:Ion chromatogram.JPG|thumb|450px|right|Ion Chromatogram]]
Ion exchange chromatography retains [[analyte]] molecules on the column based on [[Coulomb's law|coulombic]] (ionic) interactions. The stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups (R-X) that interact with analyte ions of opposite charge. This type of chromatography is further subdivided into cation exchange chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The ionic compound consisting of the cationic species M+ and the anionic species B- can be retained by the stationary phase.

Cation exchange chromatography retains positively charged [[cation]]s because the stationary phase displays a negatively charged functional group:

&lt;math&gt;\text{R-X}^-\text{C}^+\,+\, \text{M}^+ \, \text{B}^- \rightleftarrows \,\text{R-X}^-\text{M}^+ \,+\, \text{C}^+ \,+\, \text{B}^-&lt;/math&gt;

Anion exchange chromatography retains anions using positively charged functional group:

&lt;math&gt;\text{R-X}^+\text{A}^-\,+\, \text{M}^+ \, \text{B}^- \rightleftarrows \,\text{R-X}^+\text{B}^- \,+\, \text{M}^+ \,+\, \text{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the ion strength of either C+ or A- in the mobile phase can be adjusted to shift the equilibrium position and thus retention time.

The ion chromatogram shows a typical chromatogram obtained with an anion exchange column.

==Typical technique==
[[Image:Metrohm 850.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Metrohm 850 Ion chromatography system]]
A sample is introduced, either manually or with an [[autosampler]], into a sample loop of known volume. A [[buffer solution|buffered]] aqueous solution known as the mobile phase carries the sample from the loop onto a column that contains some form of stationary phase material.  This is typically a resin or gel matrix consisting of [[agarose]] or [[cellulose]] beads with [[Covalent bond|covalently]] bonded charged functional groups. The target analytes (anions or cations) are retained on the stationary phase but can be eluted by increasing the concentration of a similarly charged species that will displace the analyte ions from the stationary phase. For example, in cation exchange chromatography, the positively charged analyte could be displaced by the addition of positively charged sodium ions. The analytes of interest must then be detected by some means, typically by [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] or UV/Visible light absorbance. 

In order to control an IC system, a [[chromatography data system]] (CDS) is usually needed. In addition to IC systems, some of these CDSs can also control [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and HPLC systems.

== Separating proteins ==
[[Image:Ion exchange column.jpg|thumb|left|Preparative-scale ion exchange column used for [[protein purification]].]]

Proteins have numerous functional groups that can have both positive and negative charges.  Ion exchange chromatography separates proteins according to their net charge, which is dependent on the composition of the mobile phase.  By adjusting the pH or the ionic concentration of the mobile phase, various protein molecules can be separated.  For example, if a protein has a net positive charge at pH 7, then it will bind to a column of negatively-charged beads, whereas a negatively charged protein would not. By changing the pH so that the net charge on the protein is negative, it too will be eluted.

Elution by changing the ionic strength of the mobile phase is a more subtle effect - it works as ions from the mobile phase will interact with the immobilized ions in preference over those on the stationary phase.  This &quot;shields&quot; the stationary phase from the protein, (and vice versa) and allows the protein to elute.

'''Micellar electrokinetic chromatography''' (MEKC), is an analytical technique, a modification of [[capillary electrophoresis]], where the samples are separated by differential partitioning between micelles (pseudo-stationary phase) and an surrounding aqueous buffer (mobile phase) &lt;ref&gt;Terabe, S.; Otsuka, K.; Ichikawa, K.; Tsuchiya, A.; Ando, T. ''Anal. Chem''. '''1984''', ''56'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The basic set-up and detection methods used for MEKC are the same as those used in CE.  The difference is that the solution contains a surfactant at a [[concentration]] that is greater than the critical [[micelle]] concentration (CMC).  Above this concentration, surfactant monomers are in equilibrium with micelles. In most applications, MEKC is performed in open capillaries under [[alkaline]] conditions to generate a strong electroosmotic flow.  [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) is the most commonly used surfactant in MEKC applications.  The anionic character of the sulfate groups of SDS cause the surfactant and micelles to have electrophoretic mobility that is counter to the direction of the strong [[electroosmotic flow]].  As a result, the surfactant monomers and micelles migrate quite slowly, though their net movement is still toward the cathode &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D.R. “Capillary Electrophoresis” John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.: New York, '''1995'''.&lt;/ref&gt;. During a MEKC separation, analytes distribute themselves between the hydrophobic interior of the micelle and hydrophilic buffer solution as shown in ''figure 1''.

[[Image:MEKC.gif|frame|Figure 1: Depiction of the distribution of analytes (A) based on their hydrophobicity.]]

Analytes that are [[soluble|insoluble]] in the interior of micelles should migrate at the electroosmotic flow velocity, &lt;math&gt;u_o&lt;/math&gt;, and be detected at the retention time of the buffer, &lt;math&gt;t_M&lt;/math&gt;.  Analytes that solubilize completely within the micelles (analytes that are highly hydrophobic) should migrate at the micelle velocity, &lt;math&gt;u_c&lt;/math&gt;, and elute at the final elution time, &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Terabe, S.; Otsuka, K.; Ichikawa, K.; Tsuchiya, A.; Ando, T. ''Anal. Chem''. '''1984''', ''56'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Theory ==
The micelle velocity is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;u_c= u_p+u_o&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_p&lt;/math&gt; is the electrophoretic velocity of a micelle.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

The retention time of a given sample should depend on the capacity factor, &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;k^1=\frac{n_c}{n_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt;  is the total number of moles of solute in the micelle and &lt;math&gt;n_w&lt;/math&gt; is the total moles in the aqueous phase.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  The retention time of a solute should then be within the range:

&lt;math&gt; t_M\le t_r\le t_c &lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that charged analytes have a more complex interaction in the capillary because they exhibit electrophoretic mobility, engage in electrostatic interactions with the micelle, and participate in hydrophobic partitioning.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The fraction of the sample in the aqueous phase, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;math&gt; R= \frac{u_s-u_c}{u_o-u_c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; is the migration velocity of the solute.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  The value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed in terms of the capacity factor:

&lt;math&gt; R=\frac{1}{1+k^1}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relationship between velocity, tube length from the injection end to the detector cell (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;), and retention time, &lt;math&gt;u_{o}= L/t_M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u_{c}= L/t_{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_s = L/t_r&lt;/math&gt;, a relationship between the capacity factor and retention times can be formulated:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt; k^1=\frac{t_r-t_M}{t_M(1-(t_r/t_M))}&lt;/math&gt;

The extra term enclosed in parenthesis accounts for the partial mobility of the hydrophobic phase in MEKC.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  This equation resembles an expression derived for &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; in conventional packed-bed chromatography:

&lt;math&gt; k=\frac{t_r-t_M}{t_M}&lt;/math&gt;

A rearrangement of the previous equation can be used to write an expression for the retention factor:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_r =\left ( \frac{1+k^1}{1+(t_M/t_c)k^1} \right )t_M&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation it can be seen that all analytes that partition strongly into the micellar phase (where &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; is essentially ∞) migrate at the same time, &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt;.  In conventional chromatography, separation of similar compounds can be improved by [[gradient]] elution. In MEKC, however, techniques must be used to extend the elution range to separate strongly retained analytes.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Elution ranges can be extended by several techniques including the use of [[organic compound|organic]] modifiers, cyclodextrins, and mixed micelle systems.  Short-chain alcohols or [[acetonitrile]] can be used as organic modifiers that decrease &lt;math&gt;t_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; to improve the resolution of analytes that co-elute with the micellar phase.  These agents, however, may alter the level of the EOF.  Cyclodextrins are cyclic [[polysaccharide]]s that form inclusion complexes that can cause competitive hydrophobic partitioning of the analyte.  Since analyte-cyclodextrin complexes are neutral, they will migrate toward the cathode at a higher velocity than that of the negatively charged micelles.  Mixed micelle systems, such as the one formed by combining SDS with the neutral surfactant Brij-35, can also be used to alter the selectivity of MEKC.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


== History ==

In 1984, the Terabe group reported a technique that enabled [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) instrumentation to be used in the separation of neutral (as well as ionic) species.

==Applications of MEKC==
The simplicity and efficiency of MEKC have made it an attractive technique for a variety of applications.  Further improvements can be made to the selectivity of MEKC by adding [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] selectors or chiral surfactants to the system.  Unfortunately, this technique is not suitable for protein analysis because proteins are generally too large to partition into a surfactant micelle and tend to bind to surfactant [[monomer]]s to form SDS-protein complexes.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  Recent applications of MEKC include the analysis of uncharged [[pesticide]]s&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, essential and branched-chain [[amino acid]]s in nutraceutical products&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, [[hydrocarbon]] and alcohol contents of marjoram herb&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; .  MEKC has also been targeted for its potential to be used in combinatorial chemical analysis.    The advent of combinatorial [[chemistry]] has enabled [[medicinal chemistry|medicinal chemists]] to synthesize and identify large numbers of potential
[[medication|drugs]] in relatively short periods of time. Small sample and [[solvent]] requirements and the high resolving power of MEKC have enabled this technique to be used to quickly analyze a large number of compounds with good resolution. Traditional methods of analysis, like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to identify the purity of a combinatorial library, but assays need to be rapid with good resolution for all components to provide useful information for the chemist.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;   The introduction of surfactant to traditional capillary electrophoresis instrumentation has dramatically expanded the scope of analytes that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis.

'''Paper chromatography''' is an [[analytical chemistry]] technique for separating and identifying mixtures that are or can be coloured, especially [[pigment]]s. This can also be used in secondary or primary colours in ink experiments. This method has been largely replaced by [[thin layer chromatography]], however it is still a powerful teaching tool. '''Two-way paper chromatography''', also called [[two-dimensional chromatography]] , involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90° in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of similar compounds, for example, [[amino acids]].

==Technique of Paper Chromatography==
A small concentrated spot of [[solution]] that contains the sample of the [[solute]] is applied to a strip of [[chromatography paper]] about two centimetres away from the base of the plate, usually using a [[capillary tube]] for maximum precision. This sample is absorbed onto the paper and may form interactions with it. Any substance that reacts or bonds with the paper cannot be measured using this technique. The paper is then dipped into a suitable [[solvent]], such as [[ethanol]] or [[water]], taking care that the spot is above the surface of the solvent, and placed in a sealed container.

The solvent moves up the paper by [[capillary action]], which occurs as a result of the attraction of the solvent molecules to the paper; this can also be explained as differential [[adsorption]] of the solute components into the solvent. As the solvent rises through the paper it meets and dissolves the sample mixture, which will then travel up the paper with the solvent solute sample. Different compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to differences in solubility in the solvent, and due to differences in their attraction to the fibres in the paper. The more soluble the component the further it goes. Paper chromatography takes anywhere from several minutes to several hours.

In some cases, ''paper chromatography'' does not separate pigments completely; this occurs when two substances appear to have the same values in a particular solvent. In these cases, two-way chromatography is used to separate the multiple-pigment spots.

===Ascending chromatography===
In this method, the solvent is in pool at the bottom of the vessel in which the paper is supported

===Descending chromatography===
In this method, the solvent is kept in a trough at the top of the chamber and is allowed to flow down the paper. The liquid moves down by capillary action as well as by the gravitational force, thus this method is also known as the gravitational method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In this case, the flow is more rapid as compared to the ascending method, and the chromatography is completed more quickly. The apparatus needed for this case is more sophisticated. The developing solvent is placed in a trough at the top which is usually made up of an inert material. The paper is then suspended in the solvent. Substances that cannot be separated by ascending method can sometimes be separated by the descending method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Chromatography as art==
Chromatography can be used as an art alternative because of certain colours that it creates, but paper chromatography rarely produces decipherable colours if executed incorrectly. Sometimes, chromatographic results may start with undesirable &quot;leafy&quot; colours, but if done correctly and completely, magnificent hues can be produced.

==R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value==
R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value may be defined as the ratio of the distance travelled by the substance to the distance travelled by the solvent. R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; values are usually expressed as a fraction of two decimal places but it was suggested by Smith that a percentage figure should be used instead. If R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value of a solution is zero, the solute remains in the stationary phase and thus it is immobile. If R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value = 1 then the solute has no affinity for the stationary phase and travels with the solvent front.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) includes any chromatographic method that uses a non-polar stationary phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=reversed-phase chromatography|file=R05376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;reversed phase&quot; has a historical background. In the 1970s most liquid chromatography was done on non-modified silica or alumina with a hydrophilic surface chemistry and a stronger affinity for polar compounds - hence it was considered &quot;normal&quot;. The introduction of alkyl chains bonded covalently to the support surface reversed the elution order &lt;ref&gt;I. Molnar and C. Horvarth, Clin.Chem., 22 (1976) 1497.&lt;/ref&gt;. Now polar compounds are eluted first while non-polar compounds are retained - hence &quot;reversed phase&quot;. All of the mathematical and experimental considerations used in other chromatographic methods apply (i.e. separation resolution proportional to the column length). Today, reversed-phase column chromatography accounts for the vast majority of analysis performed in liquid chromatography. 

== Stationary Phases==
===Silica Based Stationary Phases===

Any inert non-polar substance that achieves sufficient packing can be used for reversed-phase chromatography. The most popular column is a octadecyl carbon chain (C18) bonded silica (USP classification L1) with 297 columns commercially available &lt;ref&gt;Chromatographic Reagents Used in USP - NF and Pharamcopeial Forum, (2007 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by C8 bonded silica (L7 - 166 columns), pure silica (L3 - 88 columns), cyano bonded silica (L10 - 73 columns) and phenyl bonded silica (L11 - 72 columns). Note that C18, C8 and phenyl are dedicated reversed phase packings while cyano columns can be used in a reversed phase mode depending on analyte and mobile phase conditions. It should be noted at this point that not all C18 columns have identical retention properties. Surface functionalization of silica can be performed in a monomeric or a polymeric reaction with different short-chain organosilanes used in a second step to cover remaining silanol groups (end-capping). While the overall retention mechanism remains the same subtle differences in the surface chemistries of different stationary phases will lead to changes in selectivity.

== Mobile Phase Considerations==

Mixtures of water or aqueous buffers and organic solvents are used to elute analytes from a reversed phase column. The solvents have to be miscible with water and the most common organic solvents used are acetonitrile, methanol or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Other solvents can be used such as ethanol, 2-propanol (iso-propyl alcohol). Elution can be performed isocratic (the water-solvent composition does not change during the separation process) or by using a gradient (the water-solvent composition does change during the separation process). The pH of the mobile phase can have an important role on the retention of an analyte and can change the selectivity of certain analytes.
Charged analytes can be separated on a reversed phase column by the use of ion-pairing (also called ion-interaction). This technique is known as reversed phase ion-pairing chromatography.

'''Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)''' is a [[chromatography|chromatographic]] method in which molecules in solution are separated based on their size (more correctly, their [[hydrodynamic volume]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)|file=S05705}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually applied to large [[molecule]]s or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as '''gel-filtration chromatography''', versus the name '''gel-permeation chromatography''', which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. SEC is a widely used [[polymer characterization]] method because of its ability to provide good Mw results for polymers.

==Applications==
The main application of gel-filtration chromatography is the [[fractionation]] of proteins and other water-soluble polymers, while gel permeation chromatography is used to analyze the molecular weight distribution of organic-soluble polymers. Either technique should not be confused with [[gel electrophoresis]], where an electric field is used to &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;push&quot; molecules through the gel depending on their electrical charges.

SEC is a widely used technique for the purification and analysis of synthetic and biological polymers, such as [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]] and [[nucleic acids]]. Biologists and biochemists typically use a gel medium &amp;mdash; usually [[polyacrylamide]], [[dextran]] or [[agarose]] &amp;mdash; and filter under low pressure. Polymer chemists typically use either a [[silica]] or crosslinked [[polystyrene]] medium under a higher pressure. These media are known as the '''stationary phase'''.

==Advantages==

The advantages of this method include good separation of large molecules from the small molecules with a minimal volume of eluate&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;, and that various solutions can be applied without interfering with the filtration process, all while preserving the biological activity of the particles to be separated. The technique is generally combined with others that further separate molecules by other characteristics, such as acidity, basicity, charge, and affinity for certain compounds. With size exclusion chromatography, there are short and well-defined separation times and narrow bands, which lead to good sensitivity. There is also no sample loss because solutes do not interact with the stationary phase. Disadvantages are, for example, that only a limited number of bands can be accommodated because the time scale of the chromatogram is short, and, in general, there has to be a 10% difference in molecular mass to have a good resolution&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The technique was invented by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin R Ruthven, working at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, London.&lt;ref&gt;Lathe, GH and Ruthven, CR (1955) The separation of substances on the basis of their molecular weights, using columns of starch and water. Biochem J. 60(4):xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lathe, GH and Ruthven, CR (1956) The separation of substances and estimation of their relative molecular sizes by the use of columns of starch in water. Biochem. J. 62(4): 665-674. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=13315231 article]&lt;/ref&gt; They later received the John Scott Award for this invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/johnscottaward.html John Scott Award]&lt;/ref&gt; While Lathe and Ruthven used starch gels as the matrix, [[Jerker Porath]] and [[Per Flodin]] later introduced dextran gels;&lt;ref&gt;Porath, J and Flodin, P (1959) Gel filtration: A method for desalting and group separation. Nature 183(4676): 1657-1659.&lt;/ref&gt; other gels with size fractionation properties include agarose and polyacrylamide. A short review of these developments has appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, M (2006) A look back, adventures in the matrix. Nature Methods 3(5): 410 [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v3/n5/full/nmeth0506-410.html article]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and method ==
One requirement for SEC is that the analyte does not interact with the surface of the stationary phases. Differences in elution time are based solely on the volume the analyte &quot;sees&quot;. Thus, a small molecule that can penetrate every corner of the pore system of the stationary phase &quot;sees&quot; the entire pore volume and the interparticle volume, and will elute late (when the pore- and interparticle volume has passed through the column ~80% of the column volume). On the other extreme, a very large molecule that cannot penetrate the pore system &quot;sees&quot; only the interpartile volume (~35% of the column volume) and will elute earlier when this volume of mobile phase has passed through the column. The underlying principle of SEC is that particles of different sizes will [[Elution|elute]] (filter) through a stationary phase at different rates. This results in the separation of a solution of particles based on size. Provided that all the particles are loaded simultaneously or near-simultaneously, particles of the same size should elute together. Each size exclusion column has a range of molecular weights that can be separated. The exclusion limit defines the molecular weight at the upper end of this range and is where molecules are too large to be trapped in the stationary phase. The permeation limit defines the molecular weight at the lower end of the range of separation and is where molecules of a small enough size can penetrate into the pores of the stationary phase completely and all molecules below this molecular mass are so small that they elute as a single band&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Superdex 200HR gel filtration column.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|A size exclusion column.]]

This is usually achieved with an apparatus called a column, which consists of a hollow tube tightly packed with extremely small porous polymer beads designed to have pores of different sizes. These pores may be depressions on the surface or channels through the bead. As the solution travels down the column some particles enter into the pores. Larger particles cannot enter into as many pores. The larger the particles, the faster the elution.

The filtered solution that is collected at the end is known as the '''eluate'''. The '''void volume''' includes any particles too large to enter the medium, and the solvent volume is known as the '''column volume'''.

==Factors affecting filtration==
[[Image:SizeExChrom.png|thumb|right|300px|A cartoon illustrating the theory behind '''size exclusion chromatography''']]
In real-life situations, particles in solution do not have a fixed size, resulting in the probability that a particle that would otherwise be hampered by a pore passing right by it. Also, the stationary-phase particles are not ideally defined; both particles and pores may vary in size. Elution curves, therefore, resemble [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]]. The stationary phase may also interact in undesirable ways with a particle and influence retention times, though great care is taken by column manufacturers to use stationary phases that are inert and minimize this issue.

Like other forms of chromatography, increasing the column length will enhance the resolution, and increasing the column diameter increases the capacity of the column. Proper column packing is important to maximize resolution: An overpacked column can collapse the pores in the beads, resulting in a loss of resolution. An underpacked column can reduce the relative surface area of the stationary phase accessible to smaller species, resulting in those species spending less time trapped in pores.  Unlike affinity chromatography techniques, a solvent head at the top of the column can drastically diminish resolution as the sample diffuses prior to loading, broadening the downstream elution.

== Analysis ==
In simple manual columns, the eluent is collected in constant volumes, known as fractions. The more similar the particles are in size the more likely they will be in the same fraction and not detected separately. More advanced columns overcome this problem by constantly monitoring the eluent.
[[Image:Size exclusion standardisation.png|thumb|left|300 px|Standardization of a size exclusion column.]]
The collected fractions are often examined by [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic techniques]] to determine the concentration of the particles eluted. Common spectroscopy detection techniques are refractive index (RI)and ultraviolet (UV).   When eluting spectroscopically similar species (such as during biological purification), other techniques may be necessary to identify the contents of each fraction. It is also possible to analyse the eluent flow continuously with RI, [[Low-angle laser light scattering|LALLS]], [[Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering]] MALS, UV, and/or viscosity measurements.

The elution volume (Ve) decreases roughly linearly with the [[logarithm]] of the molecular [[hydrodynamic volume]]. Columns are often calibrated using 4-5 standard samples (e.g., folded proteins of known molecular weight), and a sample containing a very large molecule such as thyroglobulin to determine the [[void volume]]. (Blue dextran is not recommended for Vo determination because it is heterogeneous and may give variable results) The elution volumes of the standards are divided by the elution volume of the thyroglobulin (Ve/Vo) and plotted against the log of the standards' molecular weights.

==Applications==
===Biochemical applications===

In general, SEC is considered a low resolution chromatography as it does not discern similar species very well, and is therefore often reserved for the final &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. The technique can determine the [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins that have slow exchange times, since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions, preserving macromolecular interactions. SEC can also assay protein [[tertiary structure]], as it measures the hydrodynamic volume (not molecular weight), allowing folded and unfolded versions of the same protein to be distinguished. For example, the apparent [[hydrodynamic radius]] of a typical protein domain might be 14 Å and 36 Å for the folded and unfolded forms, respectively. SEC allows the separation of these two forms, as the folded form will elute much later due to its smaller size.

===Polymer synthesis===

SEC can be used as a measure of both the size and the [[polydispersity]] of a synthesised [[polymer]], that is, the ability to be able to find the distribution of the sizes of polymer molecules. If standards of a known size are run previously, then a [[calibration curve]] can be created to determine the sizes of polymer molecules of interest in the solvent chosen for analysis (often [[THF]]). In alternative fashion, techniques such as light scattering and/or [[viscometry]] can be used online with SEC to yield absolute molecular weights that do not rely on calibration with standards of known molecular weight. Due to the difference in size of two polymers with identical molecular weights, the absolute determination methods are, in general, more desirable. A typical SEC system can quickly (in about half an hour) give polymer chemists information on the size and polydispersity of the sample. The preparative SEC can be used for [[polymer fractionation]] on an analytical scale.

==Drawback==

In SEC, mass is not measured so much as the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer molecules, that is, how much space a particular polymer molecule takes up when it is in solution. However, the approximate molecular weight can be calculated from SEC data because the exact relationship between molecular weight and hydrodynamic volume for polystyrene can be found. For this, polystyrene is used as a standard. But the relationship between hydrodynamic volume and molecular weight is not the same for all polymers, so only an approximate measurement can be arrived at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pslc.ws/mactest/sec.htm Polymer Science Learning Center (PSLC) - Size Exclusion Chromatography]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another drawback is the possibility of interaction between the stationary phase and the analyte. Any interaction leads to a later elution time and thus mimics a smaller analyte size.

==Absolute size-exclusion chromatography==
Absolute size-exclusion chromatography (ASEC) is a technique that couples a [[dynamic light scattering]] (DLS) instrument to a size exclusion chromatography system for absolute size measurements of proteins and macromolecules as they elute from the chromatography system.

The definition of absolute used here is that it does not require calibration to obtain hydrodynamic size, often referred to as hydrodynamic diameter (D&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; in units of nm). The sizes of the macromolecules are measured as they elute into the flow cell of the DLS instrument from the size exclusion column set. However, the ability to calculate molar mass from DLS does require a model to be used. Thus, the technique does rely on a prior knowledge of the shape (limited to a few choices) and the assumption that the shape chosen is applicable to the sample. This approach is a crude estimate at best.

A big advantage of DLS coupled with SEC is the ability to obtain enhanced DLS resolution {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  Batch DLS is simple and provides a direct measure of the protein size but the resolution of DLS is 3 to 1 in diammeter.  Using SEC, the proteins and protein oligomers are separated, allowing oligomeric resolution, but  the high protein loadings required to get a reasonable response from the DLS instrument will overload standard SEC columns and severely reduce normal resolution (see references below).  Aggregation studies can also be done using ASEC.

Limitations of ASEC include flow-rate, concentration, and precision. Because a correlation function requires anywhere from 3–7 seconds to properly build, a limited number of data points can be collected across the peak. This fact can cause erroneous data at flow rates above 0.5 mL/min. Resolution may also be limited if the flow-cell volume is not minimized.

In addition, size vs. mass relationships for [[globular proteins]] and polymeric systems are known for some solvent conditions, and can be used to estimate the molecular mass from the DLS measured [[Stokes radius]].

'''Thin layer chromatography''' (TLC) is a [[chromatography]] technique used to separate mixtures.&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

This layer of adsorbent is known as the [[stationary phase]].

After the sample has been applied on the plate, a [[solvent]] or solvent mixture (known as the [[mobile phase]]) is drawn up the plate via [[capillary action]]. Because different [[analyte]]s ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry (5th Edition) (Hardcover) by A.I. Vogel (Author), A.R. Tatchell (Author), B.S. Furnis (Author), A.J. Hannaford (Author), P.W.G. Smith ISBN 0582462363&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Thin layer chromatography can be used to:

*Monitor the progress of a reaction
*Identify compounds present in a given substance
*Determine the purity of a substance

Specific examples of these applications include:
*determination of the components a plant contains
*analyzing [[ceramide]]s and [[fatty acid]]s
*detection of [[pesticide]]s or [[insecticide]]s in food and water
*analyzing the dye composition of fibers in [[forensic]]s, or 
*assaying the [[radiochemical purity]] of [[radiopharmaceutical]]s

A number of enhancements can be made to the original method to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved with TLC and to allow more accurate quantitation.  This method is referred to as [[HPTLC]], or &quot;high performance TLC&quot;.

==Plate preparation==
TLC plates are usually commercially available, with standard particle size ranges to improve reproducibility. They are prepared by mixing the adsorbent, such as [[silica gel]], with a small amount of [[inert]] binder like [[calcium sulfate]] (gypsum) and water. This mixture is spread as a thick slurry on an unreactive carrier sheet, usually [[glass]], thick aluminum foil, or plastic. The resultant plate is dried and ''activated'' by heating in an oven for thirty minutes at 110&amp;nbsp;°C. The thickness of the adsorbent layer is typically around 0.1 – 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm for analytical purposes and around 0.5 – 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm for preparative TLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materialharvest.com/welcome/silica_products/tlc_plates.html Tables] showing the thickness value of commercial regular and preparative Thin Layer Chromatography plates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Tlc sequence.svg|thumb|right|200px|Development of a TLC plate, a purple spot separates into a red and blue spot.]]
[[Image:TLC-Essential-Oils.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chromatogram of 10 [[essential oil]]s coloured with [[vanillin]] reagent. ]]
The process is similar to [[paper chromatography]] with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different stationary phases. Because of its simplicity and speed TLC is often used for monitoring [[chemical reaction]]s and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products.

A small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a plate, about one centimeter from the base. The plate is then dipped in to a suitable [[solvent]], such as [[hexane]] or [[ethyl acetate]], and placed in a sealed container. The [[solvent]] moves up the plate by [[capillary action]] and meets the sample mixture, which is dissolved and is carried up the plate by the solvent. Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase, and because of differences in solubility in the solvent.  By changing the solvent, or perhaps using a mixture, the separation of components (measured by the [[Retardation factor|R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]] value) can be adjusted.  Also, the separation achieved with a TLC plate can be used to estimate the separation of a [[column chromatography|flash chromatography]] column.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, J. D.; Kormos, C. M. ''[[J. Chromatogr. A]]'' '''2008''', ''1211''(1-2), 49-54. ({{DOI|10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.085}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding places on the stationary phase. For instance, if normal phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase it can be considered polar. Given two compounds which differ in polarity, the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is therefore more capable to dispel the mobile phase from the binding places. Consequently, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resulting in a higher Rf value). If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents, it is more capable of dispelling solutes from the silica binding places and all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate. Practically this means that if you use a mixture of ethyl acetate and heptane as the mobile phase, adding more ethyl acetate results in higher Rf values for all compounds on the TLC plate. Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate. An [[eluotropic series]] can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase. If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired, an apolar stationary phase should be used, such as C18-functionalized silica.

==Preparative TLC==

TLC can also be used on a small semi-preparative scale to separate mixtures of up to a few hundred milligrams.  The mixture is not &quot;spotted&quot; on the TLC plate as dots, but rather is applied to the plate as a thin even layer horizontally to and just above the solvent level.  When developed with solvent the compounds separate in horizontal bands rather than horizontally separated spots.  Each band (or a desired band) is scraped off the backing material.  The backing material is then extracted with a suitable solvent (e.g. [[Dichloromethane|DCM]]) and filtered to give the isolated material upon removal of the solvent. For small-scale reactions with easily separated products, preparative TLC can be a far more efficient in terms of time and cost than doing [[column chromatography]]. Obviously, the whole plate can not be chemically developed or the product will be chemically destroyed.  Thus this technique is best used with compounds that are coloured, or visible under [[UV light]]. Alternatively, a small section of the plate can be chemically developed e.g. cutting a section out and chemically developing it, or masking most of the plate and exposing a small section to a chemical developer like [[iodine]].

==Analysis==
As the chemicals being separated may be colorless, several methods exist to visualize the spots:
* Often a small amount of a [[fluorescent]] compound, usually [[manganese]]-activated [[zinc silicate]], is added to the adsorbent that allows the visualization of spots under a [[blacklight]] (UV&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt;). The adsorbent layer will thus fluoresce light green by itself, but spots of analyte quench this fluorescence. 
* [[Iodine]] vapors are a general unspecific color [[reagent]]
* Specific color reagents exist into which the TLC plate is dipped or which are sprayed onto the plate&lt;ref&gt;Stains for Developing TLC Plates http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfthb/research/handbook/TLCstains.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of lipids, the chromatogram may be transferred to a [[PVDF]] membrane and then subjected to further analysis, for example [[mass spectrometry]], a technique known as [[Far-Eastern blot]]ting.

Once visible, the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; value , or [[retention factor]], of each spot can be determined by dividing the distance traveled by the product by the total distance traveled by the solvent (the solvent front). These values depend on the solvent used, and the type of TLC plate, and are not physical constants.

==Applications==
In [[organic chemistry]], reactions are qualitatively monitored with TLC. Spots sampled with a [[capillary]] tube are placed on the plate: a spot of starting material, a spot from the reaction mixture, and a &quot;co-spot&quot; with both. A small (3 by 7&amp;nbsp;cm) TLC plate takes a couple of minutes to run. The analysis is qualitative, and it will show if the starting material has disappeared, i.e. the reaction is complete, if any product has appeared, and how many products are generated (although this might be under-estimated due to co-elution). Unfortunately, TLCs from low-temperature reactions may give misleading results, because the sample is warmed to room temperature in the capillary, which can alter the reaction—the warmed sample analyzed by TLC is not the same as what is in the low-temperature flask. One such reaction is the [[DIBALH]] reduction of ester to aldehyde.

As an example the chromatography of an extract of green leaves (for example [[spinach]]) in 7 stages of development. [[Carotene]] elutes quickly and is only visible until step 2. [[Chlorophyll]] A and B are halfway in the final step and [[lutein]] the first compound staining yellow.

In this method the alcohol and catalyst solution (for instance iron(III) chloride) are place separately on the base line, then reacted and then instantly analyzed.

[[Image:GCMS closed.jpg|right|300 px|Example of a GC-MS|thumb]]
'''Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry''' ('''GC-MS''') is a method that combines the features of [[gas-liquid chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] to identify different substances within a test sample. Applications of GC-MS include [[drug abuse|drug]] detection, [[fire]] investigation, environmental analysis, [[explosives]] investigation, and identification of unknown samples. GC/MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify [[trace element]]s in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification.

The GC-MS has been widely heralded as a &quot;[[gold standard (test)|gold standard]]&quot; for [[Forensics|forensic]] substance identification because it is used to perform a ''specific test''. A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A ''non-specific test'' merely indicates that a substance falls into a category of substances. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to [[false positive]] identification.

==History==
The use of a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography was developed during the 1950s by Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ac50164a024 | title = Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and Gas-Liquid Partition Chromatography | year = 1959 | author = Gohlke, R. S. | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 31 | pages = 535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =10.1016/1044-0305(93)85001-E | title =Early gas chromatography/mass spectrometry | year =1993 | author =Gohlke, R | journal =Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume =4 | pages =367 | last2 =McLafferty | first2 =Fred W.   }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensitive devices were bulky, fragile, and originally limited to laboratory settings. The development of affordable and [[miniaturized]] [[computer]]s has helped in the simplification of the use of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. In 1996 the top-of-the-line high-speed GC-MS units completed analysis of fire accelerants in less than 90 seconds, whereas first-generation GC/MS would have required at least 16 minutes.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} This has led to their widespread adoption in a number of fields.

==Instrumentation==
{{Main|../gas chromatograph|mass spectrometer}}
[[Image:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|300 px|The insides of the GC-MS, with the column of the gas chromatograph in the oven on the right.]]
The GC-MS is composed of two major building blocks: the [[gas chromatograph]] and the [[mass spectrometer]]. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) as well as the phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane).  The difference in the chemical properties between different [[molecule]]s in a mixture will separate the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules take different amounts of time (called the retention time) to come out of (elute from) the gas chromatograph, and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into [[ion]]ized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass to charge ratio. 

[[Image:Gcms schematic.gif|thumb|left|300 px|GC-MS schematic]]
These two components, used together, allow a much finer degree of substance identification than either unit used separately. It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame Ionization Detector) detects multiple molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column (''i.e.'' have the same retention time) which results in two or more molecules to co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes makes it extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically lends to increased certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.

===Purge and Trap GC-MS===
For the analysis of [[volatile]] compounds a [[Purge and Trap]] (P&amp;T) concentrator system may be used to introduce samples.  The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber.  An inert gas such as [[Nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging.  The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a [[pressure gradient]] (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber.  The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'.  The trap is a column of [[adsorbent]] material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase.  The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system.  P&amp;T GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and [[BTEX]] compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Optimizing the Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds - Technical Guide&quot; Restek Corporation, Lit. Cat. 59887A&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of Mass Spectrometer Detectors===
The most common type of mass spectrometer (MS) associated with a gas chromatograph (GC) is the quadrupole mass spectrometer, sometimes referred to by the [[Hewlett-Packard]] (now [[Agilent]]) trade name &quot;Mass Selective Detector&quot; (MSD).  Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer.  Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, however these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories.  Other detectors may be encountered such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), or in the case of an ion trap MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.

==Analysis==

A mass spectrometer is typically utilized in one of two ways: Full Scan or Selective Ion Monitoring (SIM).  The typical GC/MS instrument is capable of performing both functions either individually or concomitantly, depending on the setup of the particular instrument.

===Full scan MS===
When collecting data in the full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is determined and put into the instrument's method.  An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be ''m/z'' 50 to ''m/z'' 400.  The determination of what range to use is largely dictated by what one anticipates being in the sample while being cognizant of the solvent and other possible interferences.  A MS should not be set to look for mass fragments too low or else one may detect air (found as ''m/z'' 28 due to nitrogen), carbon dioxide (''m/z'' 44) or other possible interferences.  Additionally if one is to use a large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments.

Full scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample.  It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample.  During instrument method development it may be common to first analyze test solutions in full scan mode to determine the retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method.

===Selected ion monitoring===
In selected ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are entered into the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer.  The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan.  More scans can take place each second.  Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, [[matrix interference]]s are typically lower.  To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important to be sure that the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.

===Types of Ionization===
After the molecules travel the length of the column, pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods with typically only one method being used at any given time.  Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected, usually by an electron multiplier diode, which essentially turns the ionized mass fragment into an electrical signal that is then detected.

The ionization technique chosen is independent of using Full Scan or SIM.

====Electron Ionization====
By far the most common and perhaps standard form of ionization is [[electron ionization]] (EI).  The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not much unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb.  The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way.  This &quot;hard ionization&quot; technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass to charge ratio (m/z) and few, if any, molecules approaching the molecular mass unit.  Hard ionization is considered by mass spectroscopists as the employ of molecular electron bombardment, whereas &quot;soft ionization&quot; is charge by molecular collision with an introduced gas.  The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependant upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70eV (electron Volts).  The use of 70eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with National Institute of Standard (NIST-USA) library of spectra applying algorithmic matching programs and the use of methods of analysis written by many method standardization agencies.

====Chemical Ionization====
In [[chemical ionization]] a reagent gas, typically [[methane]] or [[ammonia]] is introduced into the mass spectrometer. Depending on the technique (positive CI or negative CI) chosen, this reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a 'soft' ionization of the molecule of interest.  A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI.  One of the main benefits of using chemical ionization is that a mass fragment closely corresponding to the molecular weight of the analyte of interest is produced.

;Positive Chemical Ionization
In Positive Chemical Ionization (PCI) the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule, most often with a proton exchange.  This produces the species in relatively high amounts.

;Negative Chemical Ionization
In Negative Chemical Ionization (NCI) the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte.  This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply.

The primary goal of instrument analysis is to quantify an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some sample in the library. This is best performed by a [[computer]] because there are a myriad of visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also simultaneously correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by GC), to more accurately relate certain data.

Another method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another.  In this method, the tallest peak is assigned 100% of the value, and the other peaks being assigned proportionate values.  All values above 3% are assigned. The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak. The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical [[formula]] containing the various [[Chemical element|elements]] which are believed to be in the compound. The [[isotope]] pattern in the spectrum, which is unique for elements that have many isotopes, can also be used to identify the various elements present. Once a chemical formula has been matched to the spectrum, the molecular structure and bonding can be identified, and must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC/MS. Typically, this identification done automatically by programs which come with the instrument, given a list of the elements which could be present in the sample.

A “full spectrum” analysis considers all the “peaks” within a spectrum. Conversely, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected peaks associated with a specific substance. This is done on the assumption that at a given retention time, a set of [[ion]]s is characteristic of a certain compound. This is a fast and efficient analysis, especially if the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured, but the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.

===GC-tandem MS===
When a second phase of mass fragmentation is added, for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS). MS/MS can sometimes be used quantitate low levels of target compounds in the presence of a high sample matrix background.

The first quadrupole (Q1) is connected with a collision cell (q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode, depending on the type of MS/MS analysis being performed. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)) and Neutral Loss Scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called &quot;daughter spectrum&quot;). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a &quot;transition&quot; and forms the basis for SRM.  SRM is highly specific and virtually eliminates matrix background.

==Applications==
===Environmental Monitoring and Cleanup===
GC-MS is becoming the tool of choice for tracking [[Persistent Organic Pollutant|organic pollutants]] in the environment. The cost of GC-MS equipment has decreased significantly, and the reliability has increased at the same time, which has contributed to its increased adoption in [[environmental monitoring|environmental studies]]. There are some compounds for which GC-MS is not sufficiently sensitive, including certain pesticides and herbicides, but for most organic analysis of environmental samples, including many major classes of pesticides, it is very sensitive and effective.

===Criminal Forensics===
GC-MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a [[crime]]. The analysis of [[fire]] debris using GC-MS is well established, and there is even an established American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standard for fire debris analysis. GCMS/MS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices and results, used in court, need to be highly accurate.

===Law Enforcement===
GC-MS is increasingly used for detection of illegal narcotics, and may eventually supplant drug-sniffing dogs.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It is also commonly used in forensic toxicology to find drugs and/or poisons in biological specimens of suspects, victims, or the deceased.

===Security===
A post-September 11 development, [[explosive detection]] systems have become a part of all [[United States of America|US]] [[airport]]s. These systems run on a host of technologies, many of them based on GC-MS. There are only three manufacturers certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] to provide these systems,{{Fact|date=October 2007}} one of which is Thermo Detection (formerly Thermedics), which produces the [[Egis explosives detector|EGIS]], a GC-MS-based line of explosives detectors. The other two manufacturers are Barringer Technologies, now owned by Smith's Detection Systems and Ion Track Instruments, part of General Electric Infrastructure Security Systems.

===Food, Beverage and Perfume Analysis===
[[Food]]s and [[beverage]]s contain numerous [[aromatic compounds]], some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing. GC-MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include [[esters]], [[fatty acids]], [[alcohols]], [[aldehydes]], [[terpenes]] etc. It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or [[adulteration]] which may be harmful and which is often controlled by governmental agencies, for example [[pesticides]].

===Astrochemistry===
Several GC-MS have left earth. Two were brought to [[Mars]] by the [[Viking program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://appel.nasa.gov/items/Viking_GCMS_case_07%2025%2006.pdf The Development of the Viking GCMS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venera]] 11 and 12 and [[Pioneer Venus]] analysed the atmosphere of [[Venus]] with GC-MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|volume = 292| pages = 610–613 |year = 1981 |doi = 10.1038/292610a0|title =Chemical composition of the atmosphere of Venus| author = V. A. Krasnopolsky, V. A. Parshev}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huygens probe]] of the [[Cassini-Huygens]] mission landed one GC-MS on [[Saturn's]] largest moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= The abundances of constituents of Titan’s atmosphere from the GCMS instrument on the Huygens probe |author= H.

===Medicine===
In combination with [[isotopic labeling]] of metabolic compounds, the GC-MS is used for determining [[metabolism|metabolic activity]]. Most applications are based on the use of [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] as the labeling and the measurement of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios with an '''[[Isotope_ratio_mass_spectrometry|isotope ratio mass spectrometer]]''' ('''IRMS'''); an MS with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios.

'''Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry''' ('''LC-MS''', or alternatively '''HPLC-MS''') is an [[analytical chemistry]] technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of [[High performance liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography]] (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of [[mass spectrometry]]. LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and specificity. Generally its application is oriented towards the specific detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture).

==Liquid chromatography==
===Scale===
A major difference between traditional [[High performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and the [[chromatography]] used in LC-MS is that in the latter case the scale is usually much smaller, both with respect to the internal diameter of the column and even more so with respect to flow rate since it scales as the square of the diameter. For a long time, 1 mm columns were typical for LC-MS work (as opposed to 4.6&amp;nbsp;mm for HPLC). More recently 300&amp;nbsp;µm and even 75&amp;nbsp;µm capillary columns have become more prevalent. At the low end of these column diameters the flow rates approach 100&amp;nbsp;nL/min and are generally used with [[nanospray]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mas.1280130504 Capillary liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, Kenneth B. Tomer, M. Arthur Moseley, Leesa J. Deterding, Carol E. Parker, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 13, 1994, pp 431-457]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow splitting===

When standard [[bore]] (4.6 mm) columns are used the flow is often split ~10:1. This can be beneficial by allowing the use of other techniques in tandem such as MS and UV. However splitting the flow to UV will decrease the sensitivity of spectrophotometric detectors. The mass spectrometry on the other hand will give improved sensitivity at flow rates of 200 μL/min or less.

==Mass spectrometry==
===Mass analyzer===

There are a lot of mass analyzers that can be used in LC/MS. [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|Single Quadrupole]], [[Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer|Triple Quadrupole]], [[Ion Trap]], TOF ([[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time of Flight]]) and Quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF).

===Interface===

Understandably the interface between a liquid phase technique which continuously flows liquid, and a gas phase technique carried out in a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of [[electrospray ionization]] changed this. The interface is most often an [[electrospray]] ion source or variant such as a nanospray source; however [[fast atom bombardment]], [[thermospray]] and [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] interfaces are also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mas.1280110103 Combined liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Part III. Applications of thermospray, Patrick Arpino, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 11, 1992 pp 3-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Various deposition and drying techniques have also been used such as using moving belts; however the most common of these is off-line [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI]] deposition.&lt;ref&gt;Combined liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Part I. Coupling by means of a moving belt interface, Patrick Arpino, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 8, 1989 pp 35-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/10009479/ABSTRACT Coupling matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization to liquid separations, Kermit K. Murray, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 16, pp 283-299]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Pharmacokinetics===
LC-MS is very commonly used in [[pharmacokinetic]] studies of pharmaceuticals and is thus the most frequently used technique in the field of [[bioanalysis]]. These studies give information about how quickly a drug will be cleared from the hepatic blood flow, and organs of the body. MS is used for this due to high sensitivity and exceptional specificity compared to UV (as long as the analyte can be suitably ionised), and short analysis time. 

The major advantage MS has is the use of tandem MS-MS. The detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The process is essentially a selection technique, but is in fact more complex. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick. It is common now to have analysis times of 1 minute or less by MS-MS detection, compared to over 10 mins with UV detection.&lt;ref&gt;Increasing Speed and Throughput When Using HPLC-MS/MS Systems for Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Screening, Y. Hsieh and W.A. Korfmacher, Current Drug Metabolism Volume 7, Number 5, 2006, Pp. 479-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD. 1986.

Anal Chem. 1985 Feb;57(2):474-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteomics===
LC-MS is also used in the study of [[proteomics]] where again components of a complex mixture must be detected and identified in some manner. The [[bottom-up proteomics]] LC-MS approach to proteomics generally involves protease digestion and denaturation (usually [[trypsin]] as a protease, urea to denature tertiary structure and iodoacetamide to cap cysteine residues) followed by LC-MS with [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] or LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) to derive sequence of individual peptides.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15722218&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wysocki VH, Resing KA, Zhang Q, Cheng G |title=Mass spectrometry of peptides and proteins |journal=Methods |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=211–22 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15722218 |doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2004.08.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LC-MS/MS is most commonly used for proteomic analysis of complex samples where peptide masses may overlap even with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Samples of complex biological fluids like human serum may be run in a modern LC-MS/MS system and result in over 1000 proteins being identified, provided that the sample was first separated on an SDS-PAGE gel or HPLC-SCX.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Drug development===
LC-MS is frequently used in drug development at many different stages including Peptide Mapping, Glycoprotein Mapping, Natural Products Dereplication, Bioaffinity Screening, In Vivo Drug Screening, Metabolic Stability Screening, Metabolite Identification, Impurity Identification, Degradant Identification, Quantitative [[Bioanalysis]], and Quality Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/66004558/ABSTRACT LC/MS applications in drug development, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Mike S.

'''Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry''' is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by [[gas chromatography]] and detected using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16531644&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halket JM, Zaikin VG | title = Derivatization in mass spectrometry --7. On-line derivatisation/degradation | journal = European journal of mass spectrometry (Chichester, England) | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16531644 | doi = 10.1255/ejms.785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
[[Pyrolysis]] is the thermal dissociation of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a [[platinum]] wire, or placed in a [[quartz]] boat inside a platinum coil, and rapidly heated to 600 – 800 C. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. Various methylating reagents, which increase the volatility of polar fragments, can be added to a sample before pyrolysis. These fragments can then be separated on a gas chromatograph (GC). 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not as well-known is the pyrolysis inside a Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injector. The reason this technique is relatively unknown is that PTV injectors in general are of yet not often used. With some of the latest versions it is now possible to heat the sample very quickly until an end temperature of 600°C is reached. Some PTV's have a ramp rate of 30°C/sec. The fast ramp rate and the end temperature of 600°C are enough to make good pyrolysis. There are many advantages to using the injector as a pyrolyser. There is a price advantage, and switching from pyrolysing to normal GC injections can be done without changing the configuration of the hardware. 
Both liquid as well solid samples can be used when a PTV injector with a relative big liner is used. Real quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published.
&lt;br /&gt;

==Applications==
Pyrolysis [[gas chromatography]] is very useful for the identification of synthetic polymeric media, such as acrylics or alkyds, and synthetic varnishes.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/resources/scienceresearch/glossary.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art Conservation: Scientific Research |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for environmental samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12568366&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Janos P | title = Separation methods in the chemistry of humic substances | journal = Journal of chromatography.

The '''distribution constant''' (or '''partition ratio'''), is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the distribution of an [[analyte]] in two [[immiscible]] [[solvent]]s.&lt;ref name=Rice1993&gt;{{citation | last = Rice | first =  N.

The ratio of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]] of a [[solute]], A in an [[aqueous]]/[[organic compound|organic]] system will remain constant and independent of the total [[quantity]] of A (hence &lt;math&gt;[A]_{org} \propto [A]_{aq}&lt;/math&gt;), so at any given temperature:

&lt;math&gt;(K_D)_A = {(a_A)_{org} \over(a_A)_{aq}} \approx {[A]_{org} \over[A]_{aq}}&lt;/math&gt;

Distribution constants are useful as they allow the calculation of the concentration of remaining analyte in the solution, even after a number of [[solvent extraction]]s have occurred. They also provide guidance in choosing the most efficient way to conduct an [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extractive separation]].

Thus, the conentration of A remaining in an aqueous solution after ''i'' extractions with an organic solvent can be found using:

&lt;math&gt;[A]_i = ({V_{aq} \over V_{org} K_D + V_{aq}})^i [A]_0&lt;/math&gt;

(where [A]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of A remaining after extracting V&lt;sub&gt;aq&lt;/sub&gt; [[millilitre]]s of solution with the original concentration of [A]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with ''i'' portions of the organic solvent, each with a volume of V&lt;sub&gt;org&lt;/sub&gt;).

The '''Freundlich equation''' or '''Freundlich adsorption isotherm''' is an [[adsorption]] [[isotherm]], which is a curve relating the [[concentration]] of a [[solute]] on the surface of an [[adsorbent]], to the concentration of the solute in the liquid with which it is in contact.  There are basically two well established types of adsorption isotherm: the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and the [[Langmuir equation|Langmuir adsorption isotherm]].

==Freundlich adsorption isotherm==
[[File:Freundlich sorption isotherm.svg|thumb|right|Example of the Freundlich isotherm, showing the amount adsorbed, q (e.g., in mol/kg), as a function of equilibrium concentration in the solution, c (e.g., in mol/L). The graph is for the values of the constants of K=4 and 1/n=0.6.]]
The Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm is mathematically expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\ x/m=Kp^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; 

or

:&lt;math&gt;\ x/m=Kc^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:x = [[mass]] of [[adsorbate]] 
:m = mass of [[adsorbent]]
:p = [[Solubility equilibrium|Equilibrium]] [[pressure]] of adsorbate
:c = Equilibrium [[concentration]] of adsorbate in solution.
K and 1/n are constants for a given adsorbate and adsorbent at a particular temperature.

'''Kovats retention index''' (shorter '''Kovats index''', '''retention index'''; plural '''retention indices''') is a concept used in [[gas chromatography]] to convert [[retention time]]s into system-independent constants. The index is named after the Hungarian born Swiss chimist, [[Ervin Kováts]] who lied down this retention concept during the 1950s while contributing to the composition analysis of the [[essential oils]].[http://isic.epfl.ch/kovats/]

The retention indices of a certain chemical compound is its retention time normalised to the retention times of adjacently eluting n-alkanes. While retention times vary with the individual [[chromatography|chromatographic]] system (e.g. with regards to column length, film thickness, diameter, carrier gas velocity and pressure, void time), the derived retention indices are quite independent of these parameters and allow comparing values measured by different [[Analytical_chemistry|analytical laboratories]] under varying conditions. Tables of retention indices can help identify components by comparing experimentally found retention indices with known values. &lt;ref name=Kovats1958&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kovats | first =  E. | title = Gas-chromatographische Charakterisierung organischer Verbindungen. Teil 1: Retentionsindices aliphatischer Halogenide, Alkohole, Aldehyde und Ketone | volume = 41 | pages = 1915–32 | year = 1958 | journal = [[Helv. Chim. Acta]] | doi = 10.1002/hlca.19580410703}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title = retention index,  '''I''' in column chromatography |file = R05360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=MassFinder&gt;[http://massfinder.com/wiki/Retention_index_guide Retention index guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
The method takes advantage of the linear relationship between the values of &lt;math&gt;log (t_r')&lt;/math&gt; and the number of [[carbon]] atoms in a [[molecule]]. The value of Kovats index is usually represented by ''I'' in [[mathematical]] expressions. Its applicability is restricted to [[organic compound]]s. For isothermal chromatography, the Kovats index is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;I = 100 \times \left [ n + ( N - n ) \frac{log (t_{r (unknown)} ') - log (t_{r (n)} ')}{log (t_{r (N)} ') - log (t_{r (n)} ')} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Where;

&lt;math&gt;I =&lt;/math&gt; Kovats retention index,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the smaller [[alkane]],&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;t_r' =&lt;/math&gt; the adjusted retention time.

For temperature programmed chromatography, the Kovats index is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;I = \left [ \frac{t_{r (unknown)} - t_{r (n)} )}{t_{r (N)} - t_{r (n)} } \right ] * ( 100 \times z ) + ( 100 \times n )&lt;/math&gt;

Where;

&lt;math&gt;I =&lt;/math&gt; Kovats retention index,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the smaller [[alkane]],&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z =&lt;/math&gt; the difference of the number of carbon atoms in the smaller and larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;t_r =&lt;/math&gt; the retention time.

In [[chromatography]], the '''retardation factor''' (also known as '''retention factor''') describes the ratio of time spent in the stationary phase relative to time spent in the mobile phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ettre | first =  L. S. | year = 1993 | title = Nomenclature for chromatography (IUPAC Recommendations 1993) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 65 | pages = 819 | doi = 10.1351/pac199365040819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Planar chromatography==

The retardation factor in [[planar chromatography]], ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be mathematically described by the following ratio:&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05353.html IUPAC Gold Book  - retardation factor in planar chromatography]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_f = \frac{\mbox{migration distance of substance}}{\mbox{migration distance of solvent front}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if particular substance in an unknown mixture travels 2.5 cm and the solvent front travels 5.0 cm, the retention factor would be 0.5. An R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value will always be in the range 0 to 1: if the substance moves at all, it moves along the direction the solvent (&quot;mobile phase&quot;) does less, but cannot move further than the solvent does. R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values are only useful if they are between these two extremes. One can choose a mobile phase with different characteristics (especially polarity) in order to control how far the substance being investigated migrates. An R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value is characteristic for any given compound (provided that the same stationary and mobile phases are used). 

It can provide corroborative evidence as to the identity of a compound. If the identity of a compound is suspected but not yet proven, an authentic sample of the compound, or standard, is spotted and run on a TLC plate side by side (or on top of each other) with the compound in question. Note that this identity check must be performed on a single plate, because it is difficult to duplicate all the factors which influence R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; exactly from experiment to experiment.

==Column chromatography==
In [[column chromatography]] the retardation factor, ''R'', is the fraction of the sample in the mobile phase at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05352.html IUPAC Gold Book - retardation factor in column chromatography ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_f = \frac{1}{k+1} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the [[retention factor]].

The '''Van Deemter equation''' in [[chromatography]] relates the variance per unit length of a separation column to the linear [[mobile phase]] [[velocity]] by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0009-2509(56)80003-1 | author = van Deemter JJ, Zuiderweg FJ and Klinkenberg A | year = 1956 | title = Longitudinal diffusion and resistance to mass transfer as causes of non ideality in chromatography | journal = [[Chem. Eng. Sc.]] | volume = 5 | pages = 271–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties include pathways within the column, [[diffusion]] ([[axial]] and longitudinal), and [[mass transfer]] [[kinetics]] between stationary and mobile phases.  In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase velocity is taken as the exit velocity, that is, the ratio of the flow rate in ml/second to the cross-sectional area of the ‘column-exit flow path.’ For a packed column, the cross-sectional area of the column exit flow path is usually taken as 0.6 times the cross-sectional area of the column.  Alternatively, the linear velocity can be taken as the ratio of the column length to the dead time.  If the mobile phase is a gas, then the [[pressure]] correction must be applied. The variance per unit length of the column is taken as the ratio of the column length to the column efficiency in [[theoretical plate]]s.  The Van Deemter equation is a [[hyperbolic function]] that predicts that there is an optimum velocity at which there will be the minimum variance per unit column length and, thence, a maximum efficiency. The Van Deemter equation was the result of the first application of rate theory to the chromatography elution process.

==Van Deemter equation==

:&lt;math&gt; H = A + \frac{B}{u} + C \cdot u &lt;/math&gt;

Where 

* A = [[Eddy-diffusion]] 
* B = [[Longitudinal diffusion]]
* C = [[mass transfer]] kinetics of the analyte between mobile and stationary phase
* ''u'' = [[Linear Velocity]].

A is equal to the multiple paths taken by the [[chemical compound]], in open [[tubular]] [[capillary|capillaries]] this term will be zero as there are no multiple paths. The multiple paths occur in packed columns where several routes through the column packing, which results in band spreading.

B/''u'' is equal to the longitudinal diffusion of the particles of the compound.

C''u'' is equal to the equilibration point. In a column, there is an interaction between the mobile and stationary phases, C''u'' accounts for this.

A minimum value for H can be found by differentiating: 
:&lt;math&gt; U= \sqrt{\frac{B}{C}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Plate count==
[[Image:Rt 5 15.png|400px|thumb|right|Two well resolved peaks in a chromatogram]]The plate height given as:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{L}{N} \,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;L \,&lt;/math&gt; the column length and :&lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt; the plate count can be estimated from a [[chromatogram]] by analysis of the [[retention time]] &lt;math&gt;t_R \,&lt;/math&gt; for each component and its [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; as a measure for peak width, provided that the elution curve represents a [[Gaussian curve]].

In this case the plate count is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = plate number, N | file = P04694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{t_R}{\sigma}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

By using the more practical peak width at half height &lt;math&gt;W_{1/2} \,&lt;/math&gt; the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;N = 5.55 \cdot \left(\frac{t_R}{W_{1/2}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

or with the width at the base of the peak:

:&lt;math&gt;N = 16 \cdot \left(\frac{t_R}{W_{base}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Expanded van Deemter==
The Van Deemter equation can be further expanded to:

:&lt;math&gt;H = 2\lambda d_p + 2GD_m/\mu + \omega(d_p \mbox{ or } d_c)^2\mu/D_m +Rd_f^2\mu/D_s&lt;/math&gt;

Where: 
* H is plate height
* λ is particle shape (with regard to the packing)
* d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is particle diameter
* G, ω, and R are constants
* D&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the mobile phase
* d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the capillary diameter
* d&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the film thickness
* D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the diffusion coefficient of the stationary phase.

Van Deemter's equation indicates that band broadening mechanisms are proportionally dependent on flow rate, inversely proportional to flow rate and independent of flow rate.

The '''water bowline''' is a variation on the [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]]. It is less likely to jam or slip and can be used in extreme conditions, such as in wet environments, hence the name. There are more turns near the loop end, which makes more friction, which leads to less tension on the core of the knot.

'''Nuclear quadrupole resonance''' spectroscopy or NQR is a [[chemical analysis]] technique related to nuclear magnetic resonance ([[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceweek.com/2005/sb050128-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==

In NMR, nuclei with [[spin (physics)|spin]] ≥ 1/2 have a magnetic dipole moment so that their energies are split by a magnetic field, allowing resonance absorption of energy related to the difference between the ground state energy and the excited state.  In NQR, on the other hand, nuclei with spin ≥ 1 , such as &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;[[nitrogen|N]], &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;[[chlorine|Cl]] and &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;[[copper|Cu]], also have an electric [[quadrupole]] moment so that their energies are split by an electric field gradient, created by the electronic bonds in the local environment. Since unlike NMR, NQR is done in an environment without a static (or DC) magnetic field, it is sometimes called &quot;[[zero field NMR]]&quot;. Many NQR transition frequencies depend strongly upon temperature.

Any nucleus with more than one unpaired nuclear particle (protons or neutrons) will have a charge distribution which results in an electric quadrupole moment.
Allowed nuclear energy levels are shifted unequally due to the interaction of the nuclear charge with an electric field gradient supplied by the non-uniform distribution electron density (e.g. from bonding 
electrons) and/or surrounding ions.  The NQR effect results when transitions are induced 
between these nuclear levels by an externally applied [[radio frequency]] (RF) magnetic field.   
The technique is very sensitive to the nature and symmetry of the bonding around the nucleus.
The energy level shifts are much larger than the chemical shifts measured in NMR.  Due to symmetry, 
the shifts become averaged to zero in the liquid phase, so NQR spectra can only be measured 
for solids.  

==Applications==

There are several research groups around the world currently working on ways to use NQR to detect explosives.  Units designed to detect landmines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1608/MR1608.appk.pdf Appendix K: Nuclear quadrupole resonance], by Allen N. Garroway, [[Naval Research Laboratory]]. In Jacqueline MacDonald, J. R. Lockwood: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1608/ Alternatives for Landmine Detection]. Report MR-1608, Rand Corporation, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and explosives concealed in luggage have been tested. A detection system consists of a [[radio frequency]] (RF) power source, a coil to produce the magnetic excitation field and a detector circuit which monitors for a [[radio frequency|RF]] NQR response coming from the explosive component of the object.

Another practical use for NQR is measuring the water/gas/oil coming out of an [[oil well]] in realtime.
This particular technique allows local or remote monitoring of the extraction process, calculation of the well's remaining capacity and the water/detergents ratio the input pump must send to efficiently extract oil.

A '''4Pi Microscope''' is a laser scanning fluorescence microscope with an improved optical axis|axial resolution. The typical value of 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm can be improved to 100-150&amp;nbsp;nm which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5-7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy.

==Working principle==

[[Image:Scheme-4PiMicroscope.jpg|thumb|Scheme of a 4Pi microscope]].

The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses which both are focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical paths lengths through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and also the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible. The solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that is used for illumination and detection is increased and approaches the ideal case. In this case the sample is illuminated and detected from all sides simultaneously.

The operation mode of a 4Pi microscope is shown in the figure. The laser light is divided by a beam splitter (BS) and directed by mirrors towards the two opposing objective lenses. At the common focal point superposition of both focused light beams occurs. Excited molecules at this position emit fluorescence light which is collected by both objective lenses, combined by the same beam splitter and deflected by a dichroic mirror (DM) onto a detector. There superposition of both emitted light pathways can take place again.

In the ideal case each objective lens can collect light from a solid angle of &lt;math&gt;\Omega=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. So, with two objective lenses one can collect from every direction (solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega=4\pi&lt;/math&gt;). The name of this type of microscopy is derived from the maximal possible solid angle for excitation and detection. Practically one can achieve only aperture angles of about 140° for an objective lens, which corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;1.3\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be operated in three different ways: In a 4Pi microscope of type A, the coherent superposition of excitation light is used to generate the increased resolution. The emission light is either detected from one side only or in an incoherent superposition from both sides. In a 4Pi microscope of type B, only the emission light is interfering. When operated in the type C mode, both excitation and emission light are allowed to interfere leading to the highest possible resolution increase (~7 fold along the optic axis as compared to confocal microscopy).

In a real 4Pi microscope light is not applied from all sides, leading to so-called side lobes in the point spread function. Typically (but not inevitably) two-photon excitation microscopy is used in a 4Pi microscope in combination with an emission pinhole to lower these side lobes to a tolerable level.

==History==

In 1971, Christoph Cremer and Thomas Cremer proposed the creation of a perfect hologram, i.e. that carries the whole field information of the emission of a point source in all directions, a so-called &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; hologram.&lt;ref&gt;Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field: C. Cremer and T. Cremer in M1CROSCOPICA ACTA VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;br /&gt; [http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/AG_Cremer/pdf-files/Cremer_Micros_Acta_1978.pdf Basic design of a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope &amp; principle of a confocal laser scanning 4Pi fluorescence microscope, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first description of a practicable system of 4Pi microscopy, i.e. the setup with two opposing, interfering lenses, was invented by Stefan Hell in 1991&lt;ref&gt;European patent [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&amp;NR=0491289 EP 0491289]&lt;/ref&gt;. He could demonstrate it experimentally also in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.W. Hell, E.H.K. Stelzer, S. Lindek, C. Cremer |title=Confocal microscopy with an increased detection aperture: type-B 4Pi confocal microscopy |journal=Optics Letters |volume=19 |year=1994 |pages=222-224 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ol-19-3-222&amp;seq=0 |doi=10.1364/OL.19.000222}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the following years the number of applications for this microscope have grown. Parallel excitation and detection with 64 spots in the sample simultaneously combined with the improved spatial resolution resulted in the successful recording of the dynamics of mitochondria in yeast cells with a 4Pi microscope in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Egner, S. Jakobs, S.W. Hell

|volume= 99 |year= 2002 |pages= 3370-3375 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/6/3370.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.052545099}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A commercial version was launched by microscope manufacturer Leica Microsystems in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Review article [http://www.kompetenznetze.de/netzwerke/opti-photonicnet/innovationshighlights/en/4Pi_Mikroskop 4Pi microscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Up to now, the best quality in a 4Pi microscope was reached in conjunction with the STED principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= R. Schmidt, C.A. Wurm, S. Jakobs, J. Engelhardt, A. Egner, S.W. Hell |title=Spherical nanosized focal spot unravels the interior of cells |journal=Nature Methods |volume=5 |year= 2008 |pages= 539-544 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n6/pdf/nmeth.1214.pdf |doi= 10.1038/nmeth.1214}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using a 4Pi microscope with appropriate excitation and de-excitation beams it was possible to create a uniformly 50&amp;nbsp;nm sized spot which corresponds to a decreased focal volume compared to confocal microscopy by a factor of 150-200.

'''Accelerator mass spectrometry''' (AMS) differs from other forms of mass spectrometry in that it accelerates ions to extraordinarily high kinetic energies before mass analysis. The special strength of AMS among the mass spectrometric methods is its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass (&quot;abundance sensitivity&quot;, e.g. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C from &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapterurl=http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/A00048.pdf

|url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/compendium/index.html
|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method suppresses molecular isobars completely and in many cases can separate atomic isobars (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N from &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) also. This makes possible the detection of naturally occurring, long-lived radio-isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Their typical isotopic abundance ranges from 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;. AMS can outperform the competing technique of decay counting for all isotopes where the half life is long enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16134128&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Budzikiewicz H, Grigsby RD |title=Mass spectrometry and isotopes: a century of research and discussion |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=146–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16134128 |doi=10.1002/mas.20061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The method==
Generally, negative ions are created (atoms are ionized) in an ion source. In fortunate cases this already allows the suppression of an unwanted isobar, which does not form negative ions (as &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N in the case of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements). The pre-accelerated ions are usually separated by a first mass spectrometer of sector-field type and enter an electrostatic &quot;tandem accelerator&quot;. This is a large nuclear particle accelerator based on the principle of a Tandem van de Graaff Accelerator operating at 0.2 to many million volts with two stages operating in tandem to accelerate the particles. At the connecting point between the two stages, the ions change charge from negative to positive by passing through a thin layer of matter (&quot;stripping&quot;, either gas or a thin carbon foil). Molecules will break apart in this stripping stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Litherland, A. E. | title = Ultrasensitive Mass Spectrometry with Accelerators | journal = Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science | year = 1980 | volume = 30 | pages = 437–473 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.30.120180.002253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. d. L. John | title = Mass spectrometry and geochronology | year = 1998 | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–125 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1998)17:2&lt;97::AID-MAS2&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete suppression of molecular isobars (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements) is one reason for the exceptional abundance sensitivity of AMS.
Additionally, the impact strips off several of the ion's electrons, converting it into a positively charged ion. In the second half of the accelerator the now positively charged ion is accelerated away from the highly positive center of the electrostatic accelerator which previously attracted the negative ion. When the ions leave the accelerator they are positively charged and are moving at several percent of the speed of light. In a second stage of mass spectrometer, the fragments from the molecules are separated from the ions of interest. This spectrometer may exist of magnetic or electric Sector instrument|sectors, and so called velocity selectors, which utilizes both electric fields and magnetic fields.
After this state, no background is left, unless a stable (atomic) isobar forming negative ions exists (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;S if measuring &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl), which is not suppressed at all by the setup described so far. Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these can be separated by methods borrowed from nuclear physics, like degrader foils and gas-filled magnets.
Individual ions are finally detected by single-ion counting (with silicon surface-barrier detectors, ionization chambers, and/or time-of-flight telescopes). Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these detectors can provide additional identification of background isobars by nuclear-charge determination.

===Generalizations===
The above is an example. There are other ways in which AMS is achieved; however, they all work based on improving mass selectivity and specificity by creating high kinetic energies before molecule destruction by stripping, followed by single-ion counting.

==History==
Luis Walter Alvarez|L.W. Alvarez and Robert Cornog of the United States first used an accelerator as a mass spectrometer in 1939 when they employed a cyclotron to demonstrate that &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He was stable; from this observation, they immediately (and correctly) concluded that the other mass-3 isotope tritium was radioactive. In 1977, inspired by this early work, Richard A. Muller at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory recognized that modern accelerators could accelerate radioactive particles to an energy where the background interferences could be separated using particle identification techniques.  He published the seminal paper in Science (vol 196, pages 489-494, 1977) showing how accelerators (cyclotrons and linear) could be used for detection of tritium, radiocarbon (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), and several other isotopes of scientific interest including &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be; he also reported the first successful radioisotope date experimentally obtained using tritium (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H).  His paper was the direct inspiration for other groups using cyclotrons (G. Raisbeck and F. Yiou, in France) and tandem linear accelerators (D. Nelson, R. Korteling, W. Stott at McMaster).  K. Purser and colleagues also published the successful detection of radiocarbon using their tandem at Rochester.  Soon afterwards the Berkeley and French teams reported the successful detection of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, an isotope widely used in geology. Soon the accelerator technique, because it was about a factor of 1000 more sensitive, virtually supplanted the older “decay counting” methods for these and other radioisotopes.

==Applications==
The  applications are many. AMS is most often employed to determine the concentration of carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, e.g. by. Archaeologists for radiocarbon dating. An accelerator mass spectrometer is required, over other forms of mass spectrometry, because of their insufficient abundance sensitivity, and to resolve stable nitrogen-14 from radiocarbon. Due to the long half-life of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, decay counting requires significantly larger samples.
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl are used for surface exposure dating in geology.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I are used as hydrological tracer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Microscopy Group''' or '''AMG''' is a manufacturer of microscopes based in Mill Creek, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amgmicro.com/ Advanced Microscopy Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
Their products include the  EVOS Microscope, a digital inverted microscope for use in fluorescence and transmitted light applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonics.com/Content/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=29924 Evos Inverted Microscope] June 12, 2007 Photonics.com&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes a Light-emitting diode illumination system. The integrated microprocessor and imaging system, and a high resolution digital camera let users process and analyze live and captured images. The 15-inch Liquid crystal display replaces the traditional eye pieces. Software features include time-lapse, cell counting and transfection analysis.

A key feature of the EVOS fluorescence microscope is its LED-based light cube system. Each light cube integrates the illumination source, the light engine and the fluorescence filters into a single unit, removing need for alignment or calibration. The optical path is shortened and the light cube delivers bright illumination intensities. Each LED lasts for more than 50,000 hours. LEDs can be adjusted and controlled, and the chance of photobleaching or phototoxicity is reduced.

The embedded microprocessor gives users control of image acquisition and management. Mouse-controlled user interface allows adjusting illumination levels, balancing fluorescence and transmitted light channels, and capturing image data and saving it to a portable USB flash drive.

This portable unit can be placed in a cell culture hood for sensitive cell isolation procedures and is equipped with a DVI output that can be connected to an external display or monitor.

'''Alpha cleavage''', '''(α-cleavage)''' in [[organic chemistry]], refers to the act of breaking the [[carbon-carbon bond]],&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7641-2794-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hathaway, Bruce A. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Organic chemistry the easy way |edition= |language= |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location=Woodbury, N.Y |year=2005 |origyear= |quote= |isbn=0-7641-2794-2 |oclc= |doi= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=fjy2oJuJ_0kC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=%22Alpha+cleavage%22+%22carbon-carbon+bond%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=20&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=LsVySOaJNZOkiwGD_LgO&amp;sig=ACfU3U3IlpMzSiZN4SPDARQjeuWcUVZLyA|accessdate=|page= 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; adjacent to the carbon bearing a specified [[functional group]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00004.html |title=α-cleavage (alpha-cleavage) |accessdate=2008-07-08 |work=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology (Gold Book) |publisher=IUPAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass spectrometry==
Generally this topic is discussed when covering [[mass spectrometry]] and occurs generally by the same mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Todd1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Todd, J. F. J. | year = 1991 | title = Recommendations for nomenclature and symbolism for mass spectroscopy (including an appendix of terms used in vacuum technology). (Recommendations 1991) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 63 | pages = 1541 | doi = 10.1351/pac199163101541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=α-cleavage (alpha-cleavage)|file=A00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage, 
an electron is knocked off an atom (usually by electron collision) to form a radical cation. Electron removal generally happens in the following order:  1) [[lone pair]] electrons, 2) [[pi bond]] electrons, 3) [[sigma bond]] electrons

One of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond.The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the lone pair atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks/cleaves the bond from which the two electrons were removed.

Example C-C-(O::)-H &gt; C-C-(O:.+)-H &gt; C' + (C=O:+)-H  where : is a lone pair + is a positive charge and ' is a radical/free electron

In molecules containing carbonyl groups, often competes with [[McLafferty rearrangement]].

==Photochemistry==
In [[photochemistry]], it is the [[Homolysis|homolytic]] cleavage of a bond adjacent to a specified group.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Verhoeven1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Verhoeven, J.

== Hoping you won't be too busy ==

Hi Italienmoose. You've probably been busy, but I just want to say that I've been hoping you'll have time to continue working on [[French]] (as well as [[A-level French]]). I've had some time to do some formatting work and add content from Wiktionary to tables, but I won't be doing any of the more substantial work, without which the book won't be too useful for beginners. Without you there won't be any active contributors soon. Thanks for your work so far, and let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:55, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

I'll see what I can do but at the moment I'm more interested in some of the science books.  Seeing as there's not really anyone to collaborate with at least that will probably speed up my progress once I get around to it.

'''Ambient ionization''' is a form of [[ion]]ization in which ions are formed outside the mass spectrometer without sample preparation or separation.&lt;ref name=Cooks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooks | first1 = R. Graham | last2 = Ouyang | first2 = Zheng | last3 = Takats | first3 = Zoltan | last4 = Wiseman | first4 = Justin M. | year = 2006 | title = Ambient Mass Spectrometry | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5767 | pages = 1566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1119426 | pmid = 16543450 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Direct analysis in real time==
Direct analysis in real time (DART) is an [[atmospheric pressure]] [[ion source]] that operates by exposing the sample to a gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or excited neutral [[atoms]], vibronically excited [[molecules]] (or [[Metastability in molecules|&quot;metastables&quot;]]).  [[Excited state]]s are formed in a [[glow discharge]] in a chamber through which the gas flows..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.B. Cody, J.A. Laramée, H.D. Durst |journal=Anal.

==Desorption electrospray ionization==
Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) uses an [[electrospray]] source to create charged droplets that are directed at a solid sample. The charged droplets pick up the sample through interaction with the surface and then form highly charged ions that can be sampled into a mass spectrometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takáts Z, Wiseman JM, Cooks RG |title=Ambient mass spectrometry using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI): instrumentation, mechanisms and applications in forensics, chemistry, and biology |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1261–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16237663 |doi=10.1002/jms.922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization==
Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) enables direct analysis of samples deposited on surfaces by means of a jet of hot solvent vapour and [[ultraviolet]] light. The hot jet thermally desorbs the sample from a surface and the vaporized sample is [[ionized]] by a vacuum ultraviolet light and consequently sampled into a mass spectrometer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Arvola V, Kotiaho T, Ketola RA, Franssila S, Kauppila TJ, Kostiainen R |title=Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal.

==Laser assisted==
Electrospray-assisted [[laser]] desorption/ionization (ELDI) relies on a laser to the desorption of material into the electrospray plume.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16299699&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shiea J, Huang MZ, Hsu HJ, Lee CY, Yuan CH, Beech I, Sunner J |title=Electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for direct ambient analysis of solids |journal=Rapid Commun.

[[Image:WMAP 2008.png|thumb|200px|WMAP image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation]]
Anisotropy (ænaɪˈsɒtrəpi) is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy, which implies homogeneity in all directions. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical property (absorbance, refractive index, density, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a polarizer.

==Fields of interest==
===Computer graphics===

In the field of computer graphics, an anisotropic surface will change in appearance as it is rotated about its geometric normal, as is the case with velvet.

Anisotropic filtering (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as bilinear and trilinear filtering don't take account of the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in aliasing or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.

=== Chemistry ===
A chemical anisotropic filter, as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the proximal regions filter out larger particles and distal regions increasingly remove smaller pales, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.

In NMR spectroscopy, the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their chemical shift.  In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of benzene. This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.

=== Wood ===
Wood is a naturally anisotropic material.  Its properties vary widely when measured with the growth grain or against it.  For example, wood's strength and hardness will be different for the same sample if measured in differing orientation.

=== Real World Imagery===
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).

===Physics===
[[Image:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A plasma lamp displaying the nature of plasmas, in this case, the phenomenon of &quot;filamentation&quot;]]
Cosmologists use the term to describe the uneven temperature distribution of the cosmic microwave background radiation. There is evidence for a so-called &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19425994.000-axis-of-evil-a-cause-for-cosmic-concern.html 'Axis of evil' a cause for cosmic concern - space - 13 April 2007 - New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early Universe that is at odds with the currently favored theory of rapid expansion after the [[Big Bang]]. Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.

[[Physicists]] use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. [[Magnetic anisotropy]], for example, may occur in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show &quot;filamentation&quot; (such as that seen in [[lightning]] or a [[plasma globe]]) that is directional.

An anisotropic liquid is one which has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or [[chloroform]], which contain no structural ordering of the molecules. [[Liquid crystals]] are examples of anisotropic liquids.

Some materials [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.  It is more common for heat conduction to be anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in [[electronics]] are often anisotropic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Many [[crystal]]s are anisotropic to [[light]] (&quot;optical anisotropy&quot;), and exhibit properties such as [[birefringence]]. [[Crystal optics]] describes light propagation in these media. An &quot;axis of anisotropy&quot; is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers). Some materials can have multiple such [[optical axis|optical axes]].

===Geophysics===
[[Seismic anisotropy]] is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic [[wavelength]] (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's [[crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[inner core]].

[[Geological]] formations with distinct layers of [[sedimentary]] material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; [[electrical conductivity]] in one direction (e.g. parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g. perpendicular to a layer). This property is used in the gas and [[oil exploration]] industry to identify [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing sands in sequences of [[sand]] and [[shale]]. Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high [[resistivity]] (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity. [[Formation evaluation]] instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas wells.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] of [[aquifer]]s is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to [[drainage|drains]]&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 1997, The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf]. The corresponding free EnDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/endrain.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Water well|wells]],&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 2002, Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells, 9 pp. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf]. The corresponding free WellDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/weldrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability is to be taken into account otherwise the results may be subject to error.

Most common rock-forming [[mineral]]s are anisotropic, including [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their [[optical mineralogy|optical properties]]. An example of an isotropic mineral is [[garnet]].

===Medical acoustics===
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting [[echogenicity]] of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. In [[diffusion tensor imaging]], anisotropy alterations may reflect diffusion changes of water in the brain, particularly in the [[white matter]].

===Material science and engineering===
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. An example would be the dependence of [[Young's modulus]] on the direction of load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |first = U.F.
  |title = Texture and Anisotropy: Preferred Orientations in Polycrystals and their effect on Materials Properties
  |publisher = [[Cambridge]]
  |year = 2000
  |isbn = 9780521794206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] patterns which are often produced during manufacturing of the material.  In the case of rolling, &quot;stringers&quot; of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced [[composite material|composites]] are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it. Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour. This is especially important in processes such as [[Stamping (metalworking)|deep-drawing]].

===Microfabrication===

Anisotropic etching techniques (such as [[Deep reactive ion etching]]) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high [[aspect ratio]].  These features are commonly used in [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] and [[microfluidic]] devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching could also refer to certain chemical etchants which are etching a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of [[Silicon]] [100] produces pyramid-like structures)

[[Image:Canal_rays.png|right|thumb|300 px|Canal ray tube schematic showing the rays to the right of the perforated cathode]]
'''Anode rays''' (or '''Canal rays''') are beams of positive [[ion]]s that were observed in experiments by the [[Germany|German]] [[scientist]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-941901-31-9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Grayson, Michael A. |title=Measuring mass: from positive rays to proteins |publisher=Chemical Heritage Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=4 |isbn=0-941901-31-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later work on anode rays by [[Wilhelm Wien]] and [[J. J. Thomson]] led to the development of [[mass spectrometry]].

==Experiments==
Goldstein used a [[Gas filled tube|gas discharge tube]] which had a perforated [[cathode]].  A &quot;ray&quot; is produced in the holes (canals) in the cathode and travels in a direction opposite to the &quot;[[cathode ray|cathode rays]],&quot; which are streams of [[electron|electrons]]. Goldstein called these positive rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot; - canal rays because it looks like they are passing through a canal. In 1907 a study of how this &quot;ray&quot; was deflected in a [[magnetic field]], revealed that the [[Particle physics|particles]] making up the ray were not all the same [[mass]].  The lightest ones, formed when there was some [[hydrogen]] gas in the tube, were calculated to be about 1837 times as massive as an [[electron]]. They were [[protons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
'''Perlwikibot''' is an open-source project which aims to create a complete framework for rapidly creating and deploying computer programs which can perform common repetitive tasks on [[MediaWiki]] wikis. These clients are typically called 'bots' - hence the project name.

You can help fix bugs or add new functionality to the framework. The code is licensed under the GNU General Public License. In short, this means anyone may use the code for any purpose, including commercial use, and including making and distributing modified versions so long as they provide attribution and all derivative versions are also licensed under the GPL.

== Code style ==

Perl code is hard enough to read already, so try to make an effort to write readable code.

=== Comments ===
Comments should be included wherever the code does something that isn't obvious.

;bad:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub foo {
    my $param = shift; # Take the first param
    my @args = @_;     # Take the remaining elements, if any
}
&lt;/source&gt;
;good:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub bar {
    my $param = shift; # The page to edit
    my @args  = @_;    # Contains any other settings (for example, whether to mark the edit as minor)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perltidy ===
Perltidy is a code indenter and formatter. You can use it to help clean up your Perl code. For perlwikibot, use:

 -syn    # Syntax check input and output
 -b      # Backup and modify in-place
 -l=78   # Max line width is 78 cols
 -i=4    # Indent level is 4 cols
 -ci=4   # Continuation indent is 4 cols
 -vt=0   # Minimum vertical tightness
 -vtc=0  # Minimum vertical tightness closing
 -cti=0  # No extra indentation for closing brackets
 -pt=2   # Maximum parenthesis tightness
 -sbt=2  # Maximum square bracket tightness
 -bt=1   # Medium brace tightness
 -nsfs   # No space before semicolons
 -nolq   # Don't outdent long quoted strings
 -boc    # Break at old comma breakpoints
 -bbs    # Blank line before subs
 -sot    # Stack opening tokens
 -sct    # Stack closing tokens
 -bbao   # Break before all operators

You can put this in &lt;code&gt;.perltidyrc&lt;/code&gt;, and they'll be used every time you use perltidy. Put the file in your working directory to apply only to that directory, or in your &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt; to use the settings for everything.

Alternatively, set each option as a command line option to perltidy:
 user@host:~$ perltidy -syn -b -l=78 ...

'''Isotopomers''' or '''isotopic isomers''' are isomers with isotopic atoms, having the same number of each isotopic atom but differing in their positions. It can be either constitutional isomers or stereoisomers.
For example, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHDCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D are a pair of constitutional isotopomers. (R)- and (S)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHDOH  or (Z)- and (E)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHD are examples of isotopic stereoisomers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''BASICS OF IRON &amp; STEEL'''

Iron and Steel industry has been one of the oldest and has been an instrumental industry collaborating in the growth of mankind, civilizations and modern world.
As it is rightly envisaged in their statement India's major public sector steel giant STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA LIMITED's catch line&quot;There is a little bit of Steel in everybody's life&quot;

If you had to name the technologies that had the greatest effect on modern society, the refining of the heavy metal element iron  would have to be near the top. Iron makes up a huge array of modern products. especially carbon-rich, commercial iron, which we call steel. Cars, tractors, bridges, trains (and their rails), tools, skyscrapers, guns and ships all depend on iron and steel to make them strong. Iron is so important that primitive societies are measured by the point at which they learn how to refine it. This is where the &quot;Iron Age&quot; classification comes from.

­Have you ever wondered how people refine iron and steel? You've probably heard ­of iron ore, but how do we turn a slab of rock into a set of stainless steel surgical instruments or a locomotive? In this article, you'll learn all about iron and steel. 
I thought why not gift the community with an easy to refer book on Steel making with information and insights on the happenings, developments and achievements in this wonderful industry.,

So, let's get going..

But, HOLD ON .. Before we dive into the world of steel making, let us first go through why do we need to know all this, don't you agree?

[[File:C:\Documents and Settings\PRASENJIT\My Documents\My Pictures\book\pic1.jpg]]
'''The Advantages of Iron'''
­
­Iron is an incredibly useful substance.It's less brittle than stone yet, compared to wood or copper, extremely strong. If properly heated, iron is also relatively easy to shape into various forms, as well as refine, using simple tools. And speaking of those tools, unlike wood, iron can handle high temperatures, allowing us to build everything from fire tongs to furnaces out of it.In contrast to most substances, you can also magnetize iron, making it useful in the creation of electric motors and generators. Finally, there certainly aren't any iron shortages to worry about. 
The Earth's crust is 5 percent iron, and in some areas, the element concentrates in ores that contain as much as 70 percent iron.

When you compare iron and steel with something like aluminum, you can see why it was so important historically. To refine aluminum, you need access to huge quantities of electricity. Furthermore, to shape aluminum, you have to either cast it or extrude it. Iron, however, is much easier to manipulate. The element has been useful to people for thousands of years, while aluminum really didn't exist in any meaningful way until the 20th century.

­Fortunately, iron can be created relatively easily with tools that were available to primitive societies. There will likely come a day when humans become so technologically advanced that iron is completely replaced by aluminum, plastics and things like carbon and glass fibers. But right now, the economic equation gives inexpensive iron and steel a huge advantage over these much more expensive alternatives.

The only real problem with iron and steel is rust. Fortunately, you can control rust by painting, galvanizing, chrome plating or coating the iron with a sacrificial anode, which corrodes faster than the stronger metal. Think of this last option as hiring a bodyguard to take a bullet for the president. The more active metal has to almost completely corrode before the less active iron or steel begins the process.

­Humans have come up with countless uses for iron, from carpentry tools and culinary equipment to complicated machinery and instruments of torture. Before iron can be put to any of these uses, however, it has to be mined from the ground. 

'''Iron'''

This element is fairly-good reducing agent- so good that it rarely appears uncombined in nature. Iron is by far the most common of these. One of the most common elements in the universe, it is the heaviest metal that forms in normal fusion in stars (but only the largest stars). Once a star begins to produce iron in its core, that star is doomed in short order to a violent explosion that destroys the star and scatters its matter, including all of the elements that it has formed in fusion.

Uncombined iron is found in meteors, solid objects that strike the earth. Iron is by far the most common of the transition elements, and one of the most useful. It's hard to count all the uses of iron, the metal most used (whether pure or in alloys) in almost all machines. Giant &quot;glass box&quot; skyscrapers depend upon iron bars within their concrete &quot;skeletons&quot; to give them strength and stability. The rails of railroads are long iron bars. Concrete highways and airstrips have iron re-enforcing bars to give them the strength to hold heavy vehicles. The vehicles themselves are largely iron and a harder material known as steel, an alloy of iron, carbon, and often metals other than iron.

Iron is the cheapest of all structural metals. With some skill of an artisan known as a blacksmith it can be worked into many useful objects such as horseshoes, nails, plows, chains, pails, ladders, and many tools. In foundries, iron and steel are shaped in far greater quantities into such objects as furniture and parts of aircraft, ships, motor vehicles, and appliances.

Iron has one fault as a structural material: it rusts easily. In the presence of water (especially salt water) it corrodes into oxides:

'''Fe(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → FeO(s) 2 Fe(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)'''

and a mixed oxide known as hematite

'''2 Fe(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)'''

one of the most common ores of iron. Iron oxides are mildly alkaline, so iron resists attacks by alkalis; acids attack it. For example,

'''Fe (s) + H2SO4(l) → Fe2+(aq) + SO42-(aq) + H2(g)'''

Even a comparatively weak acid, like phosphoric acid, can attack iron oxide. This is the &quot;naval jelly&quot; reaction that removes rust from iron:
'''
FeO(s) + H3PO4(l) → Fe2+(aq) + HPO4(aq)-2 + H2O(l)'''

A great advance of humanity, the beginning of the Iron Age, began when people found that they could separate iron from oxygen by burning it with carbon (usually charcoal) which can reduce iron oxides to iron:
'''
Fe3O4(s) + 4 C(s) → 3 Fe(s) + 4 CO(g)'''

Much of existing economic activity depends upon the extraction of iron ore, the reduction of iron ore to iron, the strengthening of iron to steel, the creation of iron and steel objects, and the various practices used in protecting iron from corrosion.

Important as that activity is, our lives would be impossible without an important compound of iron known as hemoglobin which carries oxygen through the bloodstream to cells where the cells can use the oxygen to release energy from food also delivered to cells through the bloodstream.
The earth itself has a hot, dense core of largely iron and nickel. At the temperatures characteristic of the Earth's core the iron and nickel form a giant natural magnet that creates a magnetic field that goes beyond the Earth itself into the atmosphere. That magnetic field drives off much dangerous radiation that would kill life on the Earth's surface if it reached the earth's surface.</text>

=== Description ===

It was aimed to measure Leader-Member Exchange (LMX). Therefore a multidimensional measure was developed and validated. Item analysis involving 302 working students, followed by construct and criterion-related validation using 249 employees representing two organizations resulted in a multidimensional LMX scale. The results provided support for the affect, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Loyalty|loyalty]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Contribution|contribution]] dimensions identified by Dienesch and Liden (1986), as well as a fourth dimension, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Professional respect|professional respect]]. The following items are taken from the affect dimension of LMX.

=== Items ===

*I like my supervisor very much as a person.
*My supervisor is the kind of person one would like to have as a friend.
*My supervisor is a lot of fun to work with.

== Loyalty (alpha = 0.84) ==
=== Description ===

The authors reconceptualize organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in terms of civic citizenship and propose a new OCB measurement. It uses five categories of citizenship: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Loyalty|loyalty]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Obedience|obedience]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Social participation|social participation]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Advocacy participation|advocacy participation]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Functional participation|functional participation]]. Based on data from 950 employees, support is found for the measurement's construct validity.

=== Definition ===

Organizational citizenship can be conceptualized as a global concept that includes all positive organizationally relevant behaviors of individual organization members.

Loyalty is understood as allegiance to an organization and promotion of its interests.

=== Description ===

It was aimed to measure Leader-Member Exchange (LMX). Therefore a multidimensional measure was developed and validated. Item analysis involving 302 working students, followed by construct and criterion-related validation using 249 employees representing two organizations resulted in a multidimensional LMX scale. The results provided support for the [[Handbook of Management Scales/Affect|affect]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Loyalty|loyalty]], and contribution dimensions identified by Dienesch and Liden (1986), as well as a fourth dimension, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Professional respect|professional respect]]. The following items are taken from the contribution dimension of LMX used in the addendum of the article.

=== Items ===

*I do work for my supervisor that goes beyond what is specified in my job description.
*I am willing to apply extra efforts, beyond those normally required, to meet my supervisor's work goals.
*I do not mind working my hardest for my supervisor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategic IT planning ==
=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the strategic IT planning dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Strategic IT planning characterizes an organization’s competence in matching IT capabilities with the changing, cross-functional  business requirements of the enterprise.

=== Items ===

*We constantly review our IT capabilities against strategic goals.
*IT plans are redesigned as required to meet evolving conditions.
*Strategic IT planning is a continuous process.
*Written guidelines exist to structure strategic IT planning in our organization.
*Top management is not involved in strategic IT planning. (reversed coded)
*Strategic IT planning includes inputs from all functional areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Programming with ooc''' book. This is the first comprehensive effort to cover the entirety of the ooc language, among with a collection of idioms, in order to allow the general public to discover the language.

== About ooc ==
[[File:Bk_Llama,_Kristiansand_Zoo,_Norway.jpg|thumb|270px|A llama, the mascot of ooc]]

ooc is a modern, self-hosting, object-oriented, functional-ish, high-level, low-level sexy programming language, starring closures, interfaces, enums, garbage collection.. It strives to be powerful, modular, extensible, portable, yet simple and fast.

The main implementation ooc is rock, a self-hosting compiler which translates ooc sources to C source code, and then use a C compiler to produce an executable.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the project management dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Project management involves the use of skills and knowledge in coordinating the scheduling and monitoring of defined activities to ensure that the stated objectives of implementation projects are achieved.

=== Items ===

*The tasks to be performed during the ERP project are clearly defined.
*The responsibilities of project team members are clearly defined.
*There is a formal management process to track external contractor activities.
*Problems found during reviews of external project members are not tracked to closure. (reverse coded)
*Measurements are used to determine the status of project tasks.
*Project tasks are reviewed on a periodic basis.
*The ERP project leader is able to track project tasks to completion.
*The ERP project leader is experienced in project management.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the IT skills dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

A competency in IT skills refers to the ability to configure and maintain information systems in support of the business.

=== Items ===

*The internal IT staff have the ability to conduct routine ERP system maintenance.
*There is a high degree of technical expertise in the IT organization.
*The database administrator is an expert in the ERP database management system.
*Internal IT team members understand custom ERP software programs.
*The IT staff are able to efficiently implement ERP system upgrades.
*The IT staff have the technical ability to conduct a formal validation of all system changes.
*IT staff are able to analyze the technical impact of proposed system changes.
*The IT staff actively builds relationships with business managers.
*IT staff offer ideas on how IT can be used to achieve business goals.
*IT staff communicate with functional use groups in the ERP Entity.
*The IT organization provides a service to the business.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the ERP training dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

ERP training refers to the processes involved in teaching each of the various user groups to use the ERP system efficiently in their day-to-day activities.

=== Items ===

*Specific user training needs were identified early in the implementation.
*A formal training program has been developed to meet the requirements of ERP system users.
*Training materials have been customized for each specific job.
*We seldom update training materials to reflect system changes.
*Training materials target the entire business task, not just the ERP screens and reports.
*Employees are tracked to ensure that they have received the appropriate ERP system training.
*All users have been trained in basic ERP system skills.
*ERP system training review sessions are scheduled.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the learning dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

The learning competency refers to activities designed to identify cutting-edge ERP techniques from both internal and external sources. It also encompasses the formal and/or informal process of pilot-testing these new methods of using the capabilities of ERP system to deliver business value in day-to-day operations.

=== Items ===

*Benchmarking is used to identify cutting-edge ERP techniques.
*We keep track of ERP developments related to our industry.
*Cross-functional groups meet regularly to discuss new uses for the ERP system.
*Internal groups meet regularly to share new methods of using the ERP system.
*ERP improvement suggestions are regularly collected from multiple employee levels.
*Business experiments are conducted to evaluate potential improvements in the way we use ERP.
*ERP experimentation is encouraged even if the proposed improvement is unsuccessful.
*External ERP experts are invited to suggest better ways to use the ERP system.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the change readiness dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Change readiness refers to the managerial strategies used to overcome workforce resistance to the operational changes resulting from the implementation of the ERP system.

=== Items ===

*Employees understand how they fit into the new ERP Entity.
*Employees have input into how their jobs will change with new ERP business processes.
*Management actively works to alleviate employee concerns about ERP.
*An ERP support group is available to answer concerns about ERP job changes.
*The roles of all employees under the ERP system have been clearly communicated.
*The change readiness of employees impacted by the ERP system is regularly assessed.
*Employees are not prepared for a series of ERP-related changes as the system evolves. (reverse coded)
*ERP-focused changes to the employee reward system have been communicated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Computer Programming/Control/0}}
{{wikipedia|Control flow}} __TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
{{Computer Programming/Control/1}}

 {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {
     ''other statement''
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/1.1}}

 {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''other statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''other statement''
 ...
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {
     ''another statement''
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/1.3}}


=== ''match'' ===

Often it is necessary to compare one specific variable against several constant expressions. For this kind of conditional expression the ''match'' statement exists. For example:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} (x) {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} 1 =&gt;
      walkTheDog()
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} 5 =&gt;
      launchNuke()
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      selfDestruct()
  }

The last ''case'' here has an empty condition. It's called a ''catch-all case'', which code will be executed in case none of the above cases are matched.

Unlike ''switch'' in C or Java, there is no need to break of a case explicitly with the ''break'' keyword. Only one case per match is only ever executed. This enforces simple designs, at the cost of some flexibility. For example, [[w:Duff's_device|Duff's device]] can't be written in ooc.

However, in some ways, ''match'' is more flexible than a switch. For example, you can have a match without an initial condition:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} (x &lt; 0) =&gt;
      -1
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} (x &gt; 0) =&gt;
      1
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      0
 }

Here we define custom conditions inside the cases, rather than values to compare. The parenthesis are optional, but included here for the sake of readability. It behaves exactly as if we had written ''{{ooc/kw|match}} (true) {'' on the first line.

Another difference with traditional ''switch'' statements is that a ''match'' can be used as an expression. In that case, it's evaluated to the value of the last statement in the case executed. It's a good idea to have a ''catch-all case'' when you use a match as an expression, so that there are no cases where the value is undetermined.

Finally, values are compared using the equality operator ''=='', which can &amp;mdash; like any ooc operator &amp;mdash; be overloaded. This means that ''match'' works with strings as well, which have ''=='' overloaded in the core sdk:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} (humor) {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} &quot;sad&quot; =&gt;
      ohNoes()
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} &quot;happy&quot; =&gt;
      yay()
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      bahHumbug()
 }

By overloading the ''=='' operator, it is possible to use any user-defined type in a ''match'' statement.

== Unconditionals ==

=== ''return'' ===

''return'' exits the current function, optionally passing to the outer scope any value you gave to it

  {{ooc/kw|return}} 42

''return'' doesn't always have a value, it can also only simply be used to exit a function at any point

  {{ooc/kw|return}}

=== ''goto'' ===

ooc doesn't have a ''goto'' keyword. You can control the flow of loops with ''break'' and ''continue'', and exit function via ''return''. The ooc language thrives to be simple, and considers that ''goto'' doesn't belong to a high-level language. See [[w:Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]]'s work for further reading &lt;ref name=&quot;dijkstra1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[w:Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] | year = 1968 | month = March | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF |format=PDF| title = Go To Statement Considered Harmful | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–148 | doi = 10.1145/362929.362947 |quote=The unbridled use of the go to statement has as an immediate consequence that it becomes terribly hard to find a meaningful set of coordinates in which to describe the process progress.  ... The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive, it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one's program.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Computer Programming/Control/7}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   doSomething()
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/8}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (x &lt; 5) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/10}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 
   {{ooc/kw|if}} (x &gt; 5) {
     {{ooc/kw|break}}
   }
 
   doSomething(x)
 }

=== Skipping iterations ===

The ''continue'' keyword can be used to zap the rest of the loop's body and go directly to the next iteration.

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 
   {{ooc/kw|if}} (x == 5) {
     {{ooc///|skip the 5th step}}
     {{ooc/kw|continue}}
   }
 
   doSomething(x)
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/11}}

 {{ooc/kw|for}} (i in 1..11) {
    doSomething(i)
 }

Ranges are delimited by ''..'' &amp;mdash; You can store ranges and re-use them later, e.g.:

 range := 1..11

 {{ooc///|then, later:}}
 {{ooc/kw|for}} (i in range) {
    doSomething(i)
 }

This works because ''1..11'' constructs a new ''Range'', which is a ''cover type''. Covers are explained in later chapters.

''for'' allows to iterate through values of any types, as long as they implement the ''iterator'' method, returning an ''Iterator''. For example, you can iterate over ''ArrayList''s:

 list := [&quot;moody&quot;, &quot;jolly&quot;, &quot;bored&quot;] as ArrayList&lt;Int&gt;
 {{ooc/kw|for}} (state in list) {
   println(state)
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">There were many causes for hatred of the Armenians. One major factor was the fact that Armenians were primarily Christian, in an otherwise predominantly Muslim area, which was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. Because they were Christian, many Armenians attended missionary schools, and were better educated than the average Turkish citizen, which led to growing resentment of Armenians (Freedmen, 14).  	

==Abdul Hamid II==
Under the rule of Abdul Hamid II, in the late 19th century, Armenians came to be considered second-class citizens (Freedmen, 14). This established a precedent, which took a world war to be fully broken, with devastating effects. Eventually, Ismail Enver Pasha and Talet Bey overthrew Abdul, but continued to persecute Armenians. At the beginning of World War I, most Armenian men aged 45 to 60 were forced into the Ottoman Army, and compelled to do menial tasks, such as carrying heavy supplies for soldiers on foot (Balakian, 178). Nearly all the remaining Armenian men were taken away from their town, and systematically shot (Balakian, 175). Many women were forced to become Kurdish or Turkish wives, against their will, and many children were left orphaned (Freedmen, 32). Those families that were not immediately separated were forced to walk thousands of miles into deserts, where they were abandoned, and left to die.

Abdul Hamid II was extremely paranoid, persecuted the Armenians. Being an insomniac, Abdul tended to pace around his palace at night, with a loaded pistol. He kept the safety off, and killed at least two palace workers who startled him during the night. In addition, he believed that people tried to poison his food, and created elaborate food preparation procedures, including bars on the kitchen windows. He also was gullible: early in his life, a fortune-teller told him to drink a specific mixture every day, or he would die. He followed her advice, and continued drinking the substance every day until he died (Balakian, 48).  

His paranoia spread to his ruling as well. Books were censored for bizarre reasons and phones were tapped (Spencer, 95). One reason many science textbooks were censored is they contained the word &quot;H2O,&quot; which Abdul believed looked like code for &quot;Hamid II is nothing,&quot; (Balakian, 48) 	Abdul had a strong hatred for Armenians, which may have been started by the fact that many historians believe that his mother was Armenian. He was known to be very close to her, but she was a drug addict, and died when Abdul was only 7 years old (Balakian, 35). Throughout his life, Abdul’s father ignored him. 	

Abdul soon began policies against Armenians. He passed laws stating that Christians could not travel throughout the Ottoman Empire without a permit, and banned all public references to Armenia (Spencer, 95). Abdul also began to refer to Armenians only as &quot;the loyal millet&quot; (implying the Armenians were loyal to the Russians). He also is quoted as saying &quot;I will soon settle those Armenians. I will... make them smart, and relinquish their revolutionary ambitions,&quot; (Balakian, 36). He also increased taxes on Armenians (Adalian). His actions culminated in the Hamidian Massacres. From 1894 through 1896, Hamid, under a guise that Armenians were taking Kurdish land, allowed Turkish and Kurdish groups to attack Armenian villages. An attempt was made by a group of Armenians to bring their plight onto the world stage by taking over the Ottoman Bank. This caused a mob of 50,000 Turks to form and kill 600,000 Armenians (Adalian). These terrible actions led many world leaders to nickname Hamid The Great Assassin (Freedmen, 11).  	

By establishing policies that ultimately killed Armenians, Abdul Hamid II established a custom of distrust of them, as well as all citizens. When, in 1913, Hamid's government was taken over, the extensive spy network he created was a valuable asset for the new government in its attempts to persecute Armenians. In fact, in the words of Colgate University professor Peter Balakian &quot;The very sultan [the Young Turks] had just deposed had expanded the Ottoman bureaucracy by creating the most extensive system of intelligence in the empire's history,&quot; (181). 	

==Ismail Enver Pasha==
Ismail Enver Pasha helped overthrow Hamid Abdul II in 1913, but continued the brutality towards Armenians. By 1889, a new Turkish group had formed: the Young Turks. Originally, their ideas centered on liberty; an early advocate of the Young Turks movement, Ali Suavi, described their ideas as &quot;for the first time, the idea of a Turkish, as distinct from an Islamic or Ottoman loyalty,&quot; (Balakian, 135). However, in the 1890's, the movement split. One group became pro-democracy, against Abdul Hamid II, and was sympathetic to the Armenians plight. On the other hand, the remaining side grew into a more nationalistic Turkish group. One historian described their goals: to &quot;solve the problems for all the peoples and ethnic minorities in the empire,&quot; (Balakian, 140). In 1906, a political party was created by some nationalistic Young Turks at the Imperial Military Medical School in Constantinople (Balakian, 139), called the Committee on Union and Progress (CUP) (Freedmen, 13). 	

In 1913, CUP took over the Ottoman Empire, overthrowing Abdul's government. The three leaders, Enver Pasha, the minister of war, Telet Bey, the minister of the interior, and Ahmed Djemal, the minister of the marine, formed what is often referred to as the Young Turk Triumvirate (Adalian). In the process, Enver gained control of the Ottoman Special Organization, the spy network that was set up by Hamid.

In 1914, the Young Turk army, led by Enver, lost the battle of Sankamish, badly (Balakian, 178). To keep his strong outward face of power, Enver blamed the Armenians, just as Abdul did, by claiming they were spying for the Russians. The Ottoman government soon began to manufacture more propaganda that the Armenians were helping the Russians (Freedman, 17). One example of this is a statement released by the government: &quot;The Armenians are in league with the enemy. They will launch an uprising,&quot; (Balakian 182). It also began a policy of disarming all Armenian men. Soon after, a plan was put in place to massacre them, which involved taking them off to far areas and shooting them.

Following the plan to murder the men, the Young Turk Triumvirate, led by Enver, established what British historians James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee dubbed the &quot;Reign of Terror,&quot; (181). In it, all Armenians, men or women, were disarmed, officials followed practices involving randomly breaking into Armenian homes, arresting and executing many Armenians (Balakian, 178). The Ottoman Special Organization's Kurdish armies carried out the policy, and they were given a lot of freedom to commit terrible acts against Armenians (Freedmen, 20). Because of the bureaucracy and extensive intelligence set up by Abdul, Enver was able to more easily institute his plan.  	

==Mehmet Telet Bey==
Another important figure in the Armenian genocide was Mehmet Telet Bey. He was also a member of CUP, but before it, he had worked as a telegrapher. This aided him in helping CUP with intelligence, especially when plotting to overthrow Abdul (Adalian). Before helping found CUP, Telet and Enver worked together as war profiteers in Constantinople (Freedmen, 18).  	After CUP took over, Telet became minister of the interior. In 1915, following a series of propaganda messages by CUP, Telet issued a statement, reiterating CUP's claim that Armenians had been helping the Russians, and claiming that the only way to save the Ottoman Empire was to deport them. Unfortunately, the Ottoman Empire tended to abandon the Armenians after deporting them. On April 24th, 1915, hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and leaders were executed. To this day, April 24th is considered a day of mourning by Armenians (Freedmen, 27). 	

In May 1915, Telet passed the Temporary Law of Deportation. It stated that, in the interest of national security, the Ottoman government could deport any Armenian citizen, if they were &quot;suspected of treason,&quot; (Freedmen, 22). In practice, this meant that the Ottoman government could deport Armenians whenever they wanted.  	Soon after the Temporary Law of Deportation, Telet issued another government proclamation. In the proclamation, Telet demanded that all Armenians, except those who were sick, had to leave their homes within five days. They would be escorted from their homes by armed guards. In the meantime, the report also stated, Armenians could not sell any property they owned, but they could only take with them what they could carry. This effectively robbed all Armenians of everything they owned. According to the report, those who did not cooperate would be killed (Freedmen, 23). By issuing this order, Telet officially ordered the genocide of the Armenians (Freedmen, 19). 	

The effects of Telet's two acts were devastating. Almost all healthy Armenian men who hadn't been killed were, and all the women, along with the elderly and children were forced to walk up to one thousand miles to Syria and Mesopotamia (present day Iraq), causing many to die of exposure-related ailments, and many others shot by the armed guards. In northern Turkey, some Armenians were taken by rail cars. However, upon arrival, the Armenians were abandoned in the remote regions of the desert, with almost no possibility of survival (Freedmen, 24). This terrible situation was only made worse by Telet: on March 29, 1916, he formally rejected aid, disallowing aid agencies from helping those starving and dying without any water or food (Freedmen, 53). Telet also specifically ordered that all Armenian orphans be killed (Adalian).  	

Telet also appointed Dr. Behaeddin Shakir. Starting in 1915, he gradually took over CUP's operation to kill Armenians. By lobbying for the Special Organization, the elaborate spy network set up by Abdul Hamid II, to have more power, he allowed the government to have less interaction and therefore less responsibility in the extermination, one of the most devastating things he did. In the eastern section of Turkey, he persuaded CUP to allow the Special Organization complete autonomy (Balakian, 182).  	

He also instituted a killing program, which encouraged the killing of Armenians by Turks and Kurds. There were many causes for this, including greed for Armenian belongings, the idea of a holy war, or jihad, for Islam, and abstract ideas of Turkish nationalism (Balakian, 183). According to Professor Balakian, &quot;Dr. Shakir played a role not unlike that of Nazi Reich security head Reinhard Heydrich.&quot;  (183). 	

In conclusion, the actions of Hamid Abdul II, Enver Pasha, and Telet Bey caused the deaths of over 1 million Armenians. These actions set an unfortunate precedent of genocide. In a small number of cases, the Turks used a primitive form of gas chambers, where Armenians were forced inside a cave containing a fire, which was then sealed airtight (Balakian, 176). In 1917, Enver Pasha met with German Chancellor Wilhelm II, aboard a German warship (Freedmen, 39). In this meeting, many historians believe the Ottoman Turks gave the Nazis ideas relating to genocide, such as gas chambers. When Telet was being prosecuted for war crimes, he escaped extradition in Germany. During Hitler’s reign, he was given a full military burial. 	

In addition, the precedent set by the genocide has continued. Genocide still occurs around the world today, and the Turkish government has yet to recognize the genocide of the Armenian people. Because of their horrendous actions, three people significantly altered the course of history, and ruined the lives of millions of Armenian people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Libraries|File IO}}

The '''C standard library''' is a standardized collection of header files and library routines used to implement common operations, such as input/output and character string handling. Unlike other languages (such as COBOL, Fortran, and PL/I) C does not include builtin keywords for these tasks, so nearly all C programs rely on the standard library to function.

== History ==
The C programming language previously did not provide any elementary functionalities, such as I/O operations. Over time, user communities of C shared ideas and implementations to provide that functionality. These ideas became common, and were eventually incorporated into the definition of the standardized C programming language. These are now called the '''C standard libraries'''.

Both Unix and C were created at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During the 1970s the C programming language became increasingly popular, with many universities and organizations beginning to create their own variations of the language for their own projects. By the start of the 1980s compatibility problems between the various C implementations became apparent. In 1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a standard specification of C known as &quot;ANSI C&quot;. This work culminated in the creation of the so-called '''C89''' standard in 1989. Part of the resulting standard was a set of software libraries called the '''ANSI C standard library'''.

Later revisions of the C standard have added several new required header files to the library. Support for these new extensions varies between implementations.

The headers '''&lt;iso646.h&gt;''', '''&lt;wchar.h&gt;''', and '''&lt;wctype.h&gt;''' were added with Normative Addendum 1 (hereafter abbreviated as '''NA1'''), an addition to the C Standard ratified in 1995.

The headers '''&lt;complex.h&gt;''', '''&lt;fenv.h&gt;''', '''&lt;inttypes.h&gt;''', '''&lt;stdbool.h&gt;''', '''&lt;stdint.h&gt;''', and '''&lt;tgmath.h&gt;''' were added with '''C99''', a revision to the C Standard published in 1999.

{{NOTE|The [[C++]] programming language includes the functionality of the ANSI C 89 standard library, but has made several modifications, such as placing all identifiers into the &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; namespace and changing the names of the header files from &lt;tt&gt;&lt;xxx.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;cxxx&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (however, the C-style names are still available, although deprecated).}}

== Design ==
The declaration of each function is kept in a header file, while the actual implementation of functions are separated into a library file. The naming and scope of headers have become common but the organization of libraries still remains diverse. The standard library is usually shipped along with a compiler. Since C compilers often provide extra functionalities that are not specified in ANSI C, a standard library with a particular compiler is mostly incompatible with standard libraries of other compilers.


Much of the C standard library has been shown to have been well-designed.  A few parts, with the benefit of hindsight, are regarded as mistakes.  The string input functions &lt;code&gt;gets()&lt;/code&gt; (and the use of &lt;code&gt;scanf()&lt;/code&gt; to read string input) are the source of many buffer overflows, and most programming guides recommend avoiding this usage.  Another oddity is &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt;, a function that is designed as a primitive [[w:lexical analysis|lexical analyser]] but is highly &quot;fragile&quot; and difficult to use.

== ANSI Standard ==
The ANSI C standard library consists of 24 C header files which can be included into a programmer's project with a single directive. Each header file contains one or more function declarations, data type definitions and macros. The contents of these header files follows.

In comparison to some other languages (for example Java) the standard library is minuscule.  The library provides a basic set of mathematical functions, string manipulation, type conversions, and file and console-based I/O.  It does not include a standard set of &quot;container types&quot; like the C++ Standard Template Library, let alone the complete graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits, networking tools, and profusion of other functionality that Java provides as standard.  The main advantage of the small standard library is that providing a working ANSI C environment is much easier than it is with other languages, and consequently porting C to a new platform is relatively easy.  

Many other libraries have been developed to supply equivalent functionality to that provided by other languages in their standard library.  For instance, the GNOME desktop environment project has developed the GTK+ graphics toolkit and GLib, a library of container data structures, and there are many other well-known examples.  The variety of libraries available has meant that some superior toolkits have proven themselves through history.  The considerable downside is that they often do not work particularly well together, programmers are often familiar with different sets of libraries, and a different set of them may be available on any particular platform.

== Common support libraries ==

While not standardized, C programs may depend on a runtime library of routines which contain code the compiler uses at runtime. The code that initializes the process for the operating system, for example, before calling &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, is implemented in the C Run-Time Library for a given vendor's compiler. The Run-Time Library code might help with other language feature implementations, like handling uncaught exceptions or implementing floating point code.

The C standard library only documents that the specific routines mentioned in this article are available, and how they behave. Because the compiler implementation might depend on these additional implementation-level functions to be available, it is likely the vendor-specific routines are packaged with the C Standard Library in the same module, because they're both likely to be needed by any program built with their toolset.

Though often confused with the C Standard Library because of this packaging, the C Runtime Library is not a standardized part of the language and is vendor-specific.

== Compiler built-in functions ==

Some compilers (for example, [[w:GCC|GCC]]) provide built-in versions of many of the functions in the C standard library; that is, the implementations of the functions are written into the compiled object file, and the program calls the built-in versions instead of the functions in the C library shared object file.  This reduces function call overhead, especially if function calls are replaced with inline variants, and allows other forms of optimization (as the compiler knows the control-flow characteristics of the built-in variants), but may cause confusion when debugging (for example, the built-in versions cannot be replaced with instrumented variants).

== POSIX standard library ==
POSIX, (along with the Single Unix Specification), specifies a number of routines that should be available over and above those in the C standard library proper; these are often implemented alongside the C standard library functionality, with varying degrees of closeness. For example, glibc implements functions such as fork within libc.so, but before NPTL was merged into glibc it constituted a separate library with its own linker flag. Often, this POSIX-specified functionality will be regarded as part of the library; the C library proper may be identified as the ANSI or ISO C library.

Analytical chemistry is the study of the separation, identification, and quantification of the chemical components of natural and artificial materials.  Qualitative analysis gives an indication of the identity of the chemical species in the sample and quantitative analysis determines the amount of one or more of these components. The separation of components is often performed prior to analysis.
Analytical methods can be separated into classical and instrumental. Classical methods (also known as wet chemistry methods) use separations such as precipitation, extraction, and distillation and qualitative analysis by color, odor, or melting point. Quantitative analysis is achieved by measurement of weight or volume. Instrumental methods use an apparatus to measure physical quantities of the analyte such as light absorption, fluorescence, or conductivity. The separation of materials is accomplished using chromatography or electrophoresis methods.
Analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in experimental design, chemometrics, and the creation of new measurement tools to provide better chemical information. Analytical chemistry has applications in forensics, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis, and materials analysis.

===Instrumental methods of analysis===
Atomic absorption and emission spectroscopy including ICP-AES, 
UV- visible spectrophotometry,

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Closing Argument is portion of the trial where counsel can present and explain the reason why the trier-of-fact should decide in their favour. 

==Effective Argumentation==

Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court lists 16 rules of argumentation before a judge in his book &quot;Making your case: The art of persuading judges&quot;: [http://www.utahbar.org/cle/springconvention/materials/making_your_case.pdf]
#Be sure the court has jurisdiction
#know your audience
#Know your case
#Know your adversary's case
#Pay attentions to the standard of decision
#Never overstate your case. Be scrupulously accurate
#Occupy the most defensible terrain
#Yield indefensible terrain
#Take Pains to select the best arguments
#Communicate clearly and concisely
#Appeal not just to rules but also common sense 
#When you must rely on fairness to modify the strict application of the law, identify some jurisprudential maxim that supports you
#Reason is paramount and that overt appeal to emotions is resented
#Assume a posture of respective intellectual equality with the bench
#Maintain your emotions and do not accuse
#Close in a powerful way and say explicitly what you want the court to do

==Purpose and Objectives of Direct Examination==

The objective of direct evidence is to elicit evidence from the witness that is: (1) admissible, (2) persuasive and credible. All of this is to the goal of establishing facts that support your theory of the case and establishing the essential elements of your case. 

Proper direct evidence should possess a number of qualities: (1) a organized, logical and complete narrative; (2) corroboration (3) limited gaps that are vulnerable to cross examination.

==Preparing Direct Examinations==

The purpose of calling any witnesses should be primarily to advance the theory of your case. The theory should revolve around the establishments of facts that make out the elements that need to be proven to have the judge decide the issue of contention.

For a prosecutor who is attempting to establish an offence, the starting point then is to generate the following: 
* a list of elements that need to be proven;  
* a list facts available to match elements; 
* list witnesses that will provide each fact needed; and 
* if necessary, a check list that you follow as you proceed with your evidence

==Preparing a Witness==
The first question when considering a direct examination is to ask oneself &quot;what is the purpose of calling this witness?&quot; If the answer does not advance the case, or may open weaknesses in the case, the advocate must consider not calling the person to testify.

Considerations should include:
* whether the witness have a criminal record
* whether the witness can articulate well enough
* whether the witness may testify to matters harmful to the case

A witness interview should consist of two parts. The first part of the interview should be for the purpose of discovery and the second part should be for practising and rehearsal. Where possible this should be divided into two different interviews.

A witness should be given a copy of any written statement or transcript of an audio statement before reviewing their evidence.

Multiple witnesses should never be interviewed together. The main exception would be to interview a witness in the presence of a police officer who is a witness on the matter.

===Preparing for Cross examination===


==Organization==
In Mauet, Fundamentals of Trial Technique&lt;Ref&gt;2nd ed. Can. at p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that a standard template for questioning for many criminal and civil trials should follow a logical or chronological order. Following the sequence of:
#Background
#Description of incident location
#what occurred just before the incident
#How the incident occurred
#what happened immediately after the incident
#injuries incurred and treatment given
#present physical injuries
#exhibits that highlight the main points

A similar general structure applicable to most witnesses was provided in &quot;The Art of Trial&quot; by Robert White: 
# Identify the witness;
# Detail the witness's interest or lack thereof in the case 
# For each item that needs to be proven:
##the name of the item;
##set the stage;
## elicit crucial testimony;
## establish opportunities for observations and reasons for remembering.

==Questioning==

===Framing the questions===
The questions are intended to signal to the witness what they should talk about. It is important that the language used is tailored to the level of understanding of the witness. It most cases it is important to keep the questions simple, using plain language. More complex questions should be broken down into multiple smaller questions.

===Bad Questioning Styles===
* Beginning a question with &quot;And&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot;
* Repeating the answer given by the witness back at them

===Objectionable questions===
* argumentative questions - that is, questions that seek to make argument to the court, such as questions asking for inferences or interpretations of facts not proven
* vague or over-broad questions
* irrelevant questions
* questions seeking an opinion or conclusion

==Techniques==

==Strategy and Tactics==

==Frequent issues==
===Accused's testimony===

===Refreshing memory===

===Documents===

[[Image:Aromatic-ring-current-2.png|thumb|right|200px|A diagram of an aromatic ring current.  ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the applied magnetic field, the red arrow indicating its direction.  The orange ring shows the direction of the ring current, and the purple rings show the direction of the [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] magnetic field.]]

An '''aromatic ring current''' is an effect observed in [[aromaticity|aromatic]] [[molecules]] such as [[benzene]] and [[naphthalene]]. If a [[magnetic field]] is directed [[perpendicular]] to the plane of the aromatic system, a ring current is induced in the delocalized [[pi-bond|π electrons]] of the aromatic ring.&lt;ref&gt;''The induced magnetic field in cyclic molecules.'' Merino, G.; Heine, T.; Seifert, G. [[Chem. Eur. J.]]; '''2004'''; 10; 4367-4371.  {{DOI|10.1002/chem.200400457}} &lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct consequence of [[Ampère's law]]; since the electrons involved are free to circulate, rather than being localized in bonds as they would be in most non-aromatic molecules, they respond much more strongly to the magnetic field.

Aromatic ring currents are relevant to [[NMR spectroscopy]], as they dramatically influence the [[chemical shift]]s of [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[hydrogen atom|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in aromatic molecules,&lt;ref&gt;''Aromaticity and Ring Currents Gomes'', J. A. N. F.; Mallion, R. B. [[Chem. Rev.]]; (Review); '''2001'''; 101(5); 1349-1384.  {{DOI|10.1021/cr990323h}} &lt;/ref&gt; as well as in any organic or inorganic aromatic molecule.  The effect helps distinguish these nuclear environments and is therefore of great use in molecular structure determination. In benzene, the ring protons experience [[deshielding]] because the induced magnetic field has the same direction as the external field and their [[chemical shift]] is 7.3 ppm compared to 5.6 to the [[vinylic]] proton in [[cyclohexene]]. In contrast any proton inside the aromatic ring experiences [[shielding (NMR)|shielding]] because both fields are in opposite direction. This effect can be observed in [[cyclooctadecanonaene]] ([18]annulene) with 6 inner protons at &amp;minus;3 ppm. 

The situation is reversed in [[antiaromatic]] compounds. In the [[dianion]] of [18]annulene the inner protons are strongly deshielded at 20.8 ppm and 29.5 ppm with the outer electrons significantly shielded (with respect to the reference) at &amp;minus;1.1 ppm. Hence a '''diamagnetic ring current''' or '''diatropic ring current''' is associated with aromaticity whereas a '''paratropic ring current''' signals antiaromaticity.

A similar effect is observed in three-dimensional [[fullerene]]s; in this case it is called a '''sphere current''' &lt;ref&gt;''Sphere Currents of Buckminsterfullerene'', Mikael P. Johansson, Jonas Jusélius, and Dage Sundholm, [[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]], Vol. 44, No. 12, pp. 1843-1846, '''2005''' {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200462348}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Numerous attempts have been made to quantify [[aromaticity]] with respect to the observed ring current.&lt;ref&gt;''What is aromaticity?'' Paul von Rage Schleyer and Haijun Jiao Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 2, pp. 209-218, '''1996''' [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6802x0209.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; One method is called '''diamagnetic susceptibility exaltation''' [[Lambda|Λ]] defined as the difference between the measured [[magnetic susceptibility]] of a compound and a calculated value based on group additivity tables. [[Benzene]] is clearly aromatic (Λ = &amp;minus;13.4), [[borazine]] (Λ = &amp;minus;1.7) and [[cyclohexane]] (Λ = 1.1) are not aromatic and [[cyclobutadiene]] (Λ = +18) is antiaromatic.

Another measurable quantity is the [[chemical shift]] of [[lithium]] ions Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in complexes of lithium with aromats because lithium tends to [[coordination chemistry|coordinate]] to the [[hapticity|face]] of the aromatic rings. Thus the lithium atom in [[cyclopentadienyl]] lithium (CpLi) has a chemical shift of &amp;minus;8.6 ppm (aromatic) and its Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; complex  a shift of &amp;minus;13.1.  

Both methods suffer from the disadvantage that values depend on ring size. The '''nucleus-independent chemical shift''' ('''NICS''') is a [[computational chemistry|computational method]] that calculates the [[chemical shift]] of a hypothetical lithium ion positioned directly inside the ring&lt;ref name=Schleyer&gt;''Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shifts: A Simple and Efficient Aromaticity Probe'' Paul von Ragué Schleyer, Christoph Maerker, Alk Dransfeld, Haijun Jiao, and Nicolaas J. R. van Eikema Hommes [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1996'''; 118(26) pp 6317-6318; (Communication) {{DOI|10.1021/ja960582d}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this method negative NICS values indicate aromaticity and positive values antiaromaticity.

Yet another method called the '''harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity''' ('''HOMA''') &lt;ref&gt;''Definition of aromaticity basing on the harmonic oscillator model'' Tetrahedron Letters, Volume 13, Issue 36, '''1972''', Pages 3839-3842 J. Kruszewski and T. M. Krygowski {{DOI|10.1016/S0040-4039(01)94175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized sum]] of [[squared deviations]] of [[bond length]]s from the optimal value, which is assumed to be realized for a fully aromatic system &lt;ref&gt;''How far is the π-electron delocalization of the phenanthrene moiety modified in the aza-analogues and their N-oxides?'' Beata T. Stępień, Tadeusz M. Krygowski,a Michał K. Cyrański, Jacek Młochowski, Pierluigi Orioli, and Francesco Abbate [[Arkivoc]] 2003 [http://www.arkat-usa.org/?VIEW=MANUSCRIPT&amp;MSID=893 Link]&lt;/ref&gt;. An aromat has HOMA value 1 whereas a non-aromatic compound has value 0. For all-carbon systems, a HOMA value is obtained making use of this equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{HOMA} =  1- 257.7\sum^n_i(d_{\rm opt} - d_i)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

with the value of 257.7 the normalization value, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; the optimized bond length (1.388&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom]]) and ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' the experimental or computed bond length.

I guess tomato only saves WAN monthly and daily in/out byte counts and no intraday history nor device-specific history?

I would also like to hear some numbers about the claim that saving to NVRAM or JFFS is dangerous. Is it so that using JFFS is much safer since the JFFS2 file system takes care of distributing the wear evenly throughout the large JFFS partition? I would calculate that if the memory can withstand 10,000 write cycles (I have heard that nowadays average flash memory can even withstand 100,000 cycles) and the size of the JFFS partition is 1 MB and the file is no more than 1 KB then the log can be saved at least 10,000,000 times, which makes over 1000 years if the log is saved every hour — so JFFS seems a pretty safe option (at least if the JFFS partition is not full of some other files (but maybe JFFS2 can do wear-leveling in those situations as well)). I do not know the details of the design of JFFS2 and its overhead, though.--[[Special:Contributions/84.50.143.71|84.50.143.71]] ([[User talk:84.50.143.71|talk]]) 21:52, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

==Classification (QoS)==
Per the [[Tomato_Firmware/Menu_Reference#Classification|section]] describing the '''QoS -&gt; Classification''' (&lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt;) page: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, the order of rules can affect performance. For example, if an L7 rule is qualified as UDP this will help performance. But, if it is moved below the DNS rule (with a classification of &quot;Highest&quot;), it will prevent packet inspection of all DNS connections which are also UDP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First of all ''&quot;the DNS rule&quot;'' is never defined and so this illustration does not clarify. It raises more questions. 
I suspect that the order of rules at this &lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt; page is significant but I cannot find any better documentation. So here is a very specific clarifying question: 
* If a packet matches two (or more) rules in the list specified at the &lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt; page then does the earliest rule (in the list) take effect or does the latest rule take effect?
I ''suspect'' that the '''earliest''' rule in the list takes effect.

This behaviour would be consistent with my understanding that when ''no rule'' in the list matches for a given packet then the '''Default class''' specified on the '''QoS -&gt; Basic Settings''' (&lt;tt&gt;qos-settings.asp&lt;/tt&gt;) page takes effect.

'''Aspirating IMS''' is an ion mobility spectrometry technology used to detect low or trace quantities of chemicals in the surrounding atmosphere. It is applied in industrial and military purposes to detect harmful substances in air.

== Operation ==

Aspiration IMS operates with open-loop circulation of sampled air. Sample flow is passed via ionization chamber and then enters to measurement area where the ions are deflected into one or more measuring electrodes by perpendicular electric field which can be either static or varying. The output of the sensor is characteristic of the ion mobility distribution and can be used for detection and identification purposes.

[[Image:Spectral lines en.PNG|thumb|Emission lines and absorption lines compared to a continuous spectrum.]]

In [[physics]], '''atomic [[spectral lines]]''' are of two types:
* An '''emission line''' is formed when an electron makes a transition from a particular discrete [[energy level]] of an atom, to a lower energy state, emitting a photon of a particular energy and wavelength. A spectrum of many such photons will show an emission spike at the wavelength associated with these photons.
* An '''absorption line''' is formed when an electron makes a transition from a lower to a higher discrete energy state, with a photon being absorbed in the process. These absorbed photons generally come from background continuum radiation and a spectrum will show a drop in the continuum radiation at the wavelength associated with the absorbed photons.

The two states must be [[bound state]]s in which the electron is bound to the atom, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a &quot;bound–bound&quot; transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely (&quot;bound–free&quot; transition) into a [[continuous spectrum|continuum]] state, leaving an [[ionization|ionized]] atom, and generating continuum radiation.

A [[photon]] with an energy equal to the energy difference between the levels is released or absorbed in the process. The frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; at which the spectral line occurs is related to the photon energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by [[Planck's law]] &lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

== Emission and absorption coefficients ==

The emission of atomic line radiation may be described by an [[emission coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; with units of energy/time/volume/solid angle. ''&amp;epsilon; dt dV d&amp;Omega;'' is then the energy emitted by a volume element &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; into solid angle &lt;math&gt;d\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For atomic line radiation:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}n_2 A_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; is the density of emitting atoms, &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''Einstein coefficient''' for spontaneous emission, which is fixed for any two energy levels. By [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|Kirchhoff's law]], the absorption characteristics in a region of space are closely tied to its emission characteristics, so we must mention the absorption coefficient as well. The absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; will have units of 1/length and  ''&amp;kappa;' dx'' gives the fraction of intensity absorbed for a light beam at frequency ''&amp;nu;'' while traveling distance dx. The absorption coefficient is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa' = \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}~(n_1 B_{12}-n_2 B_{21}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral intensity of radiation at (and near) frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; is the density of absorbing atoms, and &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{21}&lt;/math&gt; are the Einstein coefficients for absorption and induced emission respectively. Like the coefficient &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, these are also constant for any two energy levels.

In the case of [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]], the densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]], but for other cases, (e.g. [[laser]]s) the calculation is more complicated.

The above equations have ignored the influence of the spectral line shape. To be accurate, the above equations need to be multiplied by the (normalized) spectral line shape, in which case the units will change to include a 1/Hz term.

== The Einstein coefficients ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stimulated emission]] --&gt;

In 1916, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that there are essentially three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line. The three processes are referred to as '''spontaneous emission''', '''induced emission''' and '''absorption''' and with each is associated an '''Einstein coefficient''' which is  a measure of the probability of that particular process occurring.

===Spontaneous emission===
 
{{main|Spontaneous emission}}
[[Image:AtomicLineSpEm.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic spontaneous emission]]

Spontaneous emission is the process by which an electron &quot;spontaneously&quot; (i.e. without any outside influence) decays from a higher energy level to a lower one.  The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; will decay spontaneously to state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, emitting a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of atoms in state ''i''&amp;nbsp; then the change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to spontaneous emission will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{A_{21}}=A_{21}n_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;
=== Stimulated emission ===
{{main|Stimulated emission}}
[[Image:AtomicLineInEm.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic stimulated emission]]

[[Stimulated emission]] (also known as induced emission) is the process by which an electron is induced to jump from a higher energy level to a lower one by the presence of electromagnetic radiation at (or near) the frequency of the transition.  The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;B_{21}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time per unit energy density of the radiation field, that an electron in state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; will decay to state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, emitting a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to induced emission will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{B_{21}}=B_{21}n_2 I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral intensity of the radiation field at the frequency of the transition.

Stimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the development of the [[laser]].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

=== Photoabsorption ===
{{main|Absorption (optics)}}
[[Image:AtomicLineAb.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic absorption]]

Absorption is the process by which a photon is absorbed by the atom, causing an electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time per unit energy density of the radiation field, that an electron in state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; will absorb a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; and jump to state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to absorption will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{B_{12}}=-B_{12}n_1 I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

== Detailed balancing ==

The Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities associated with each atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part. Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermal equilibrium will be valid universally. At equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have [[detailed balance|detailed balancing]] as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;0=A_{21}n_2+B_{21}n_2I(\nu)-B_{12}n_1 I(\nu)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Along with detailed balancing, we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] , and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.

From the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] we have for the number of excited atomic specie ''i'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_i}{n}= \frac{g_i e^{-E_i/kT}}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total density of the atomic specie, excited and unexcited, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is the degeneracy of state ''i'', and ''Z'' is the [[partition function]]. From [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] we have for the spectral intensity at frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(\nu)=\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\nu)=\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].
Note that in some treatments, the blackbody energy density is used rather than the intensity, in which case:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\nu)=\frac{8\pi h\nu^3 }{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these expressions into the equation of detailed balancing and remembering that &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{21}g_2e^{-h\nu/kT}+B_{21}g_2e^{-h\nu/kT}\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}=
B_{12}g_1\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation must hold at any temperature, so that the three Einstein coefficients are interrelated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_{21}}{B_{12}}=\frac{g_1}{g_2}~F(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_{21}}{B_{12}}=\frac{g_1}{g_2}&lt;/math&gt;

When this relation is inserted into the original equation, one can also find a relation between &lt;math&gt;A_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, involving [[Planck's law]].

== Oscillator strengths ==

Oscillator strength &lt;math&gt;f_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{12}=\frac{\pi e^2}{m_e c}\,f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron charge and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron mass. This allows all three Einstein coefficients to be expressed in terms of the single oscillator strength associated with the particular atomic spectral line:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{21}=\frac{8\nu^2 \pi^2 e^2}{m_e c^3}~\frac{g_1}{g_2}~f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{12}=\frac{4\pi^2 e^2}{m_e h\nu c}\,f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{21}=\frac{4\pi^2 e^2}{m_e h\nu c}~\frac{g_1}{g_2}~f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black's bishop is pinning white's c knight, and his c5 advance has just put additional pressure on white's center. At this point, white has chosen to regain the initiative by kicking out the bishop with 5.a3.

Black usually takes the knight with [[/5...Bxc3+|5...Bxc3+]], because moving [[/5...Ba5|5...Ba5]] leaves the c5 pawn undefended and open to white's 6.dxc5.

Black takes the pinned knight to avoid having his bishop boxed in. White's only plausible reply is [[/6. bxc3|6.bxc3]].

I see you're mainly interested in editing calculus and general chemistry.  Me too.  Guess I'll be seeing you around a bit. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 19:47, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:Glad to know that there are others interested in those books. It seemed like general chemistry was extinct. I just finished those two subjects in my high school. All the information is fresh in my head. The hard part is putting it all into words :) --[[User:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:black;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:darkgreen;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;ward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] 21:56, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

== This might help ==

Perhaps you could take a look at [[Using Wikibooks]]. It tells you a lot about editing. BTW, if you use the beta toolbar in your preferences, the toolbar can offer help.

      <comment>/* Drafting a Statement */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Disclosure==
A component of the collection of evidence may include requests for further disclosure from the Police or Crown Office. 

==Investigations==
An investigation should be undertaken to discover additional facts and obtain additional evidence that may be used at trial or used in settlement negotiations. 

Amongst the types of evidence that can be obtained by investigation include:
# locate witnesses and obtain statements of eye-witnesses
# obtain information on the background on possible crown witnesses (e.g. work history, character, reputation, criminal history)
# obtain other information that could be used for impeachment
# photographs of scenes

==Taking Statements==

===Potential witnesses===
All potential witnesses should give statements or at the least be interviewed. The net should be cast broadly, so the interviews should go beyond simply the parties to the case and their direct associates. 

People to be contacted include:
* employees/employers of the parties 
* friends of the parties
* relatives of the parties

Counsel should not shy away from talking to parties adverse to the client's case. Any witness may change allegiance over time.

By having a witness give a statement you are able to pin them down on their recollection.

===Drafting a Statement===
Tips for statements:
* should be in the witnesses own words 
* should contain clear and specific details
* should be facts and ''not'' opinions. 
* should not include argument
* should avoid hearsay evidence.

Example Outline of Issues to cover in the statment:&lt;br&gt;
'''witness background'''
* full name, date of birth
* residence
* occupation
'''Facts'''
* Date and time of incident
* Location and actions of witness at time of incident
* Others present at the time of incident (include name, age, relationship, description)
* observations of incident
* reactions (verbal/physical) of each person
* outcome of incident
* harm or damage caused 
* state of person or property prior to harm or damage
* whether anyone else could have seen what happened
* the witnesses' familiarity with the charges and how they would have known?

A warning should be given not to talk to anyone about their evidence.

===Interviewing clients===
{{stub}}

==Organizing Evidence==
The evidence should be organized before you begin outlining the theory of the case and examinations. 

The most straightforward manner of organizing information is chronologically. A chart showing the sequence of events can be quite useful. This is a preferred manner where the case consists of multiple witnesses discussing a single event.

Each event can be broken down into key sub-events. The testimony of each witness should be organized to match each sub-event. Each of these can be used as a topic in cross-examination. At each juncture, look at the non-testimonial evidence and see how it supports the testimony. Also consider the logic of the sequence of events and whether there is something abnormal about it.

      <comment>/* Optical spectroscopy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Atomic spectroscopy is the determination of elemental composition by its electromagnetic or mass spectrum.  Atomic spectroscopy is closely related to other forms of spectroscopy. It can be divided by atomization source or by the type of spectroscopy used.  In the latter case, the main division is between optical and mass spectrometry.  Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex.  This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail.  Because optical spectroscopy is generally less expensive and has performance adequate for many tasks, it is far more common.  Atomic absorption spectrometers are one of the most commonly sold and used analytical devices.

==Optical spectroscopy ==
Electrons exist in energy levels within an atom.  These levels have well defined energies and electrons moving between them must absorb or emit an energy equal to the difference between them.  In optical spectroscopy, the energy absorbed to move an electron to a more energetic level and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is in the form of a photon (a particle of light).  Because this energy is well-defined, an atom's identity can be found by the energy of this transition.  The wavelength of light can be related to its energy.  It is usually easier to measure the wavelength of light than to directly measure its energy.

Optical spectroscopy can be further divided into absorption, emission, and fluorescence.

In atomic absorption spectroscopy, light is passed through a collection of atoms.  If the wavelength of the light has energy corresponding to the energy difference between two energy levels in the atoms, a portion of the light will be absorbed.  The relationship between the concentration of atoms, the distance the light travels through the collection of atoms, and the portion of the light absorbed is given by the Beer-Lambert law.

The energy stored in the atoms can be released in a variety of ways.  When it is released as light, this is known as fluorescence.  Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy measures this emitted light.  Fluorescence is generally measured at a 90° angle from the excitation source to minimize collection of scattered light from the excitation source, often such a rotation is provided by a Pellin-Broca prism on a turntable which will also separate the light into its spectrum for closer analysis.  The wavelength once again tells you the identity of the atoms.  For low absorbances (and therefore low concentrations) the intensity of the fluoresced light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms.  Atomic fluorescence is generally more sensitive (i.e. it can detect lower concentrations) than atomic absorption.

Strictly speaking, any measurement of the emitted light is emission spectroscopy, but atomic emission spectroscopy usually does not include fluorescence and rather refers to emission after excitation by thermal means.  The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms.

==Mass spectrometry==

Atomic mass spectrometry is similar to other types of mass spectrometry in that it consists of an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector.  Atoms' identities are determined by their mass-to-charge ratio (via the mass analyzer)  and their concentrations are determined by the number of ions detected. Although considerable research has gone into customizing mass spectrometers for atomic ion sources, it is the ion source that differs most from other forms of mass spectrometry.  These ion sources must also atomize samples, or an atomization step must take place before ionization.  Atomic ion sources are generally modifications of atomic optical spectroscopy atom sources.

==Ion and atom sources==
Sources can be adapted in many ways, but the lists below give the general uses of a number of sources.  Of these, flames are the most common due to their low cost and their simplicity.  Although significantly less common, inductively-coupled plasmas, especially when used with mass spectrometers, are recognized for their outstanding analytical performance and their versatility.  

For all atomic spectroscopy, a sample must be vaporized and atomized.  For atomic mass spectrometry, a sample must also be ionized.  Vaporization, atomization, and ionization are often, but not always, accomplished with a single source.  Alternatively, one source may be used to vaporize a sample while another is used to atomize (and possibly ionize).  An example of this would be laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, where a laser is used to vaporize a solid sample and an inductively-coupled plasma is used to atomize the vapor.

With the exception of flames and graphite furnaces, which are most commonly used for atomic absorption spectroscopy, most sources are used primarily for atomic emission spectroscopy.

The '''Balmer series''' or '''Balmer lines''' in [[atomic physics]], is the designation of one of a set of six different named series describing the [[spectral line]] emissions of the [[hydrogen atom]].
The Balmer series is calculated using the '''Balmer formula''', an [[empirical]] equation discovered by [[Johann Balmer]] in 1885. 

The visible [[spectrum]] of [[light]] from [[hydrogen]] displays four [[wavelength]]s, 410 [[metre#SI prefixed forms of metre|nm]], 434&amp;nbsp;nm, 486&amp;nbsp;nm, and 656&amp;nbsp;nm, that reflect emissions of [[photon]]s by [[electron]]s in excited states transitioning to the quantum level described by the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' equals 2.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Nave (2006). HyperPhysics: [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/hyde.html#c4 ''Hydrogen Spectrum'']. Georgia State University. Accessed March 1st, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of [[ultraviolet]] Balmer lines with wavelengths shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm.
[[file:Emission spectrum-H.svg|600px|thumb|The four visible [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen emission spectrum lines]] in the Balmer series. H-alpha is the red line at the right.]]

==Overview==
[[Image:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|left|210px|In the simplified '''Rutherford Bohr model''' of the [[hydrogen atom]], the Balmer lines result from an electron jump between the second energy level closest to the nucleus, and those levels more distant. Shown here is a photon emission. The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 3 \rightarrow 2&lt;/math&gt; transition depicted here produces [[H-alpha]], the first line of the [[Balmer series]]. For hydrogen (&lt;math&gt;Z = 1&lt;/math&gt;) this transition results in a photon of [[wavelength]] 656 nm (red).]]

The Balmer series is characterized by the [[electron]] transitioning  from ''n'' ≥ 3 to ''n'' = 2, where ''n'' refers to the [[radial quantum number]] or [[principal quantum number]] of the electron.  The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letter: ''n'' = 3 to ''n'' = 2 is called H-α, 4 to 2 is H-β, 5 to 2 is H-γ, and 6 to 2 is H-δ.  As the first spectral lines associated with this series are located in the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], these lines are historically referred to as &quot;H-alpha&quot;, &quot;H-beta&quot;, &quot;H-gamma&quot; and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.

Although physicists were aware of atomic emissions before 1885, they lacked a tool to accurately predict where the spectral lines should appear.  The Balmer equation predicts the four visible absorption/emission lines of hydrogen with high accuracy.  Balmer's equation inspired the [[Rydberg equation]] as a generalization of it, and this in turn led physicists to find the [[Lyman series|Lyman]], [[Paschen series|Paschen]], and [[Brackett series]] which predicted other absorption/emission lines of hydrogen found outside the [[visible spectrum]].

The familiar red [[H-alpha]] spectral line of hydrogen gas, which is the transition from the shell ''n'' = 3 to the Balmer series shell ''n'' = 2, is one of the conspicuous colors of the universe.  It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of [[emission nebula|emission]] or ionization nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]], which are often [[H II regions]] found in star forming regions.  In true-color pictures, these nebula have a distinctly pink color from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.

Later, it was discovered that when the spectral lines of the hydrogen spectrum are examined at very high resolution, they are found to be closely-spaced doublets. This splitting is called [[fine structure]].  It was also found that excited electrons could jump to the Balmer series ''n''=2 from orbitals where ''n'' was greater than 6, emitting shades of violet when doing so.
[[Image:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Two of the Balmer lines (α and β) are clearly visible in this emission spectrum of a [[deuterium lamp]].]]

==Balmer's formula==
Balmer noticed that a single number had a relation to every line in the hydrogen spectrum that was in the [[visible light]] region.  That number was 364.56&amp;nbsp;nm.  When any integer higher than 2 was squared and then divided by itself minus 4, then that number multiplied by 364.56 gave a wavelength of another line in the visible hydrogen spectrum.  By this formula he was able to show that certain measurements of lines made in his time by [[spectroscopy]] were slightly inaccurate measurements and his formula predicted lines that were later found although had not yet been observed.  His number also proved to be the limit of the series.

The Balmer equation could be used to find the [[wavelength]] of the absorption/emission lines and was originally presented as follows (save for a notation change to give Balmer's constant as ''B''):

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\ = B\left(\frac{m^2}{m^2 - n^2}\right) = B\left(\frac{m^2}{m^2 - 2^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength.
:''B'' is a constant with the value of 3.6456×10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; m or 364.56 nm.
:''n'' is equal to 2
:''m'' is an integer such that ''m'' &gt; ''n''.

In 1888 the physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen.  The equation commonly used to calculate the Balmer series is a specific example of the [[Rydberg formula]] and follows as a simple reciprocal mathematical rearrangement of the formula above (conventionally using a notation of '''n''' for '''m''' as the single integral constant needed):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{4}{B}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = R_\mathrm{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) \quad \mathrm{for~} n=3,4,5,...&lt;/math&gt; 

where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed/emitted light and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rydberg constant]] for hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is seen to be equal to &lt;math&gt;4/B&lt;/math&gt; in Balmer's formula, and this value, for an infinitely heavy nucleus, is &lt;math&gt;4/(3.6456*10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; meter) = 10,973,731.57 meter&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CODATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in astronomy==
The Balmer series is particularly useful in [[astronomy]] because the Balmer lines appear in numerous stellar objects due to the abundance of hydrogen in the [[universe]], and therefore are commonly seen and relatively strong compared to lines from other elements.  

The [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular are very important.  Other characteristics of a star can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include [[surface gravity]] (related to physical size) and composition.

Because the Balmer lines are commonly seen in the spectra of various objects, they are often used to determine [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] due to [[doppler shift]]ing of the Balmer lines.  This has important uses all over astronomy, from detecting [[binary star]]s, [[exoplanet]]s, compact objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s (by the motion of hydrogen in [[accretion disk]]s around them), identifying groups of objects with similar motions and presumably origins ([[moving group]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, and debris from collisions), determining distances (actually [[redshift]]s) of galaxies or [[quasar]]s, and identifying unfamiliar objects by analysis of their spectrum.  

Balmer lines can appear as [[absorption line|absorption]] or [[emission line|emission]] lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed.  In [[star]]s, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are &quot;strongest&quot; in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 [[kelvin]] ([[spectral type]] A).  In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, [[active galaxy|AGN]]s, [[H II region]]s and [[planetary nebula|planetary]] [[nebula]]e, the Balmer lines are emission lines.

In stellar spectra, the H-epsilon line (transition 7-2) is often mixed in with another absorption line caused by ionized [[calcium]] known by astronomers as &quot;H&quot; (the [[Fraunhofer lines|original designation]] given by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]).  That is, H-epsilon's wavelength is quite close to CaH at 396.847&amp;nbsp;nm, and cannot be resolved in low resolution spectra.  The H-zeta line (transition 8-2) is similarly mixed in with a neutral [[helium]] line seen in hot stars.

In optics, the '''Beer-Lambert law''', also known as '''Beer's law''' or the '''Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law''' is an empirical relationship that relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling.

==Equations==


There are several ways in which the law can be expressed:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\alpha lc \,&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; {I_{1}\over I_{0}} = 10^{-\alpha l c}&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; A = -\log_{10}\frac{I_1}{I_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{4 \pi k}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; 
Here:
*A is absorbance
*''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity of the incident light 
*''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity after passing through the material
*''l'' is the distance that the light travels through the material (the path length)
*''c'' is the concentration of absorbing species in the material 
*&amp;alpha; is the ''absorption coefficient'' or the molar absorptivity of the absorber
*&amp;lambda; is the wavelength of the light
*''k'' is the extinction coefficient

In essence, the law states that there is a logarithmic dependence between the transmission of light through a substance and the concentration of the substance, and also between the transmission and the length of material that the light travels through. Thus if ''l'' and &amp;alpha; are known, the concentration of a substance can be deduced from the amount of light transmitted by it.

The units of ''c'' and &amp;alpha; depend on the way that the concentration of the absorber is being expressed. If the material is a liquid, it is usual to express the absorber concentration ''c'' as a mole fraction i.e. a dimensionless fraction.  The units of &amp;alpha; are thus reciprocal length (e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of a gas, ''c'' may be expressed as a density (units of reciprocal length cubed, e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;), in which case &amp;alpha; is an ''absorption cross-section'' and has units of length squared (e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If concentration ''c'' is expressed in moles per unit volume, &amp;alpha; is a molar absorptivity given in units of mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; or sometimes L mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The value of the absorption coefficient &amp;alpha; varies between different absorbing materials and also with wavelength for a particular material. It is usually determined by experiment.

In spectroscopy and spectrophotometry, the law is almost always defined in terms of common logarithms and powers of 10 as above. In general optics, the law is often defined in an alternate exponential form:

:&lt;math&gt; {I_{1}\over I_{0}} = e^{-\alpha' l c}&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; A' = - \alpha' l c = -\ln \frac{I_1}{I_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &amp;alpha;' and ''A''' are approximately 2.3 (≈ln 10) times smaller than the corresponding values of &amp;alpha; and ''A'' defined in terms of base-10 functions. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting data that the correct form of the law is used.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly scattering. If the light is especially intense, nonlinear optical processes can also cause variances.

==  Beer-Lambert law in the atmosphere ==

This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The Beer-Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written

:&lt;math&gt;I_n=(I_o/R^2)\,\exp(-(k_a+k_g+k_{NO2}+k_w+k_{O3}+k_r) m)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where each &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; is an extinction coefficient whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:

*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; refers to aerosols (that absorb and scatter)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly mixed gases (mainly carbon dioxide (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;)  and molecular oxygen(&lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;) which only absorb)
*&lt;math&gt;NO_2&lt;/math&gt; is nitrogen dioxide, mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is water vapour absorption
*&lt;math&gt;O_3&lt;/math&gt; is ozone (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is Rayleigh scattering from molecular oxygen (&lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;) and nitrogen (&lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt;) (responsible for the blue color of the sky).

&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the ''optical mass'', a term basically equal to &lt;math&gt;1/\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the solar azimuth (the solar angle with respect to a direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site).

This equation can be used to retrieve &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt;, the aerosol optical thickness, which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.

==History==
Beer's law was independently discovered (in various forms) by Pierre Bouguer in 1729, Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1760 and August Beer in 1852.

The '''Berkeley Geochronology Center''' ('''BGC''') is a [[501(c)|non-profit]] [[geochronology]] [[research institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. It was originally a research group in the laboratory of [[University of California Berkeley]] [[geophysics|geophysicist]] and [[geochronology|geochronologist]] [[Garniss Curtis]], now [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Swisher|first=Carl C.|coauthors=Garniss H. Curtis, and Roger Lewin|title=Java Man: How Two Geologists Changed Our Understanding of Human Evolution|pages=107–108|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn-13=9780226787343}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is now an independent scientific research institute directed by the  geologist and geochronologist [[Paul Renne]], adjunct professor of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at Berkeley.

In 1985, Curtis, set to retire in 1989, moved the group from his lab at the University to the basement of the independent [[Donald Johanson|Institute for Human Origins]] (IHO), at the suggestion of [[United States of America|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The geochronologists worked separately from the IHO, although IHO contained their bureaucratic infrastructure, until 1989 when they became officially known as the Institute for Human Origins Geochronology Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;   In 1994 the group officially split from the IHO based on different viewpoints of their respective missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;KalbKalb2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalb|first=Jon|title= Adventures in the Bone Trade: The Race to Discover Our Ancestors in Ethiopia's Afar Depression|pages=298–299|date=2000|publisher= Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|isbn-13=9780387987422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  

The Institute specializes in fundamental questions of the age of the earth, using state-of-the-art instrumentation to find the age of rocks that will answer questions about [[geology]] and [[geobiology]] in [[History of the Earth|earth history]].  The institute is capable of performing gas extraction, and thermal ionization [[mass spectrometry]] analysis on rocks up to billions of years old using the techniques of [[argon–argon dating]] and [[uranium-lead dating]].  BGC also performs [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] analysis to  establish correlating or independent ages from the fossilized magnetic fields.  The staff includes research scientists specializing in various geological periods and areas, in addition to postdoctoral scholars and graduate students.  Scientists at BGC have also been active in dating extraterrestrial materials such as meteorites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Whitehouse|first=David|title='Four-billion-year chill' on Mars|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4703055.stm|date=2005-07-21|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Split from Institute for Human Origins==
Both Curtis and IHO founder, [[Donald Johanson]], were known to have egos that might &quot;clash&quot;, but Howell thought that bringing the two research groups together could benefit both.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The IHO's mission included publicizing the anthropology of ancient human ancestors to the general public, and the geochronology scientists felt the anthropologists emphasized this at the expense of more basic science, while the paleoanthropologist felt the geochronologists were devoting too much research time and funding to general geology questions not related to the institute's primary mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The anthropologists had more public recognition in the press, while the geochronologists were obtaining more scientific grant moneys and publishing more scientific papers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The split was acrimonious and garnered negative publicity for some of those involved from their peers in professional organizations, particularly as [[Gordon Getty]], the single largest donor, and a board member of IHO, withdrew funding to the parent institute (IHO), while providing start-up moneys to the geochronology group. &lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KalbKalb2000&quot; /&gt;

'''Binding energy''' is the [[mechanical energy]] required to disassemble a whole into separate parts. A bound system has a lower [[potential energy]] than its constituent parts; this is what keeps the system together. The usual convention is that this corresponds to a ''positive'' binding energy.

In general, binding energy represents the [[mechanical work]] which must be done in acting against the forces which hold an object together, while disassembling the object into component parts separated by such sufficient distance that further separation requires negligible additional work.

[[Electron binding energy]] is a measure of the energy required to free electrons from their atomic orbits.

Nuclear binding energy is derived from the [[strong nuclear force]] and is the [[energy]] required to disassemble a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] into free unbound [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s. At the [[quantum chemistry|atomic level]], the binding energy of the atom is derived from [[electromagnetic interaction]] and is the [[ionization energy|energy]] required to disassemble an atom into free electrons and a nucleus. In [[astrophysics]], [[gravitational binding energy]] of a celestial body is the energy required to disassemble it into space debris (dust and gas). This quantity is not to be confused with the [[gravitational potential energy]], which is the energy required to separate two bodies, such as a celestial body and a satellite, to infinite distance, keeping each intact (the latter energy is lower).

==Mass defect==
Because a bound system is at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents, its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this &quot;lost&quot; mass after binding, may be fractionally small. For systems with high binding energies, however, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. 

Since all forms of energy in a system (which has no net [[momentum]]) have mass, the question of where the missing mass of the binding energy goes is of interest. The answer is that this mass does not &quot;disappear&quot; into energy (a common misconception); rather, transformed to heat or light, this mass may ''move away'' to another location. The &quot;mass defect&quot; from binding energy is therefore only mass which has moved. However, it remains mass, because mass is conserved in systems for any given single observer, so long as the system remains closed. Thus, if binding energy mass is transformed into heat, the system must be cooled (the heat removed) before the mass-deficit appears in the cooled system. In that case, the removed heat (which has mass itself when measured in the original inertial frame) represents exactly the mass &quot;deficit&quot;. 

For example, when two large objects (such as the earth and a meteor) are attracted by a [[gravitational field]] and collide, the energy for the heat of impact is extracted from the gravitational field of the objects. However, the system does ''not'' lose mass (which represents its binding energy) ''until'' this heat is radiated into space, and this space is no longer counted as part of the original system (equivalent to opening the original system). 

Closely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear considerations. However, in nuclear reactions, the fraction of mass which may be removed as light or heat, and which then appears as binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than other forces. 

In nuclear reactions, the &quot;light&quot; which must be [[radiation|radiated]] to remove binding energy may be in the form of direct [[gamma radiation]]. Again, however, no mass-deficit can in theory appear until this radiation has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.

The energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference between the binding energies of the fuel and the fusion or fission products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, once evolved heat and radiation have been removed.

== Atomic binding energy ==

The binding energy for a single atom is given by

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \Delta m \cdot c^2 = (m_s - m_b) \cdot c^2 = (Z \cdot m_p + N \cdot m_n - m_b) \cdot c^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''c'' is the [[speed of light]];
:''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the separated [[nucleon]]s;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the bound [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]];
:''Z'' is the atomic number of the bound nucleus;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of one [[proton]];
:''N'' is the number of [[neutron]]s;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of one neutron.

=== Specific quantitative example: a deuteron ===
A deuteron is the nucleus of a [[deuterium]] atom, and consists of one [[proton]] and one [[neutron]]. The experimentally-measured masses of the constituents as free particles are

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007825 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]];
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;= 1.008665 u;
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007825 + 1.008665 = 2.01649 u.

The mass of the deuteron (also an experimentally measured quantity) is

: Atomic mass &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H = 2.014102 u.

The mass difference = 2.01649 - 2.014102 = 0.002388 u. Since the [[energy density|conversion between rest mass and energy]] is 931.494MeV/u, a deuteron's binding energy is calculated to be

: 0.002388 u × 931.494 MeV/u = 2.224 MeV.

Thus, expressed in another way, the binding energy is [0.002388/2.01649] x 100% = about 0.1184% of the total energy corresponding to the mass. This corresponds to 1.07 x &lt;math&gt;10^{14}&lt;/math&gt; J/kg = 107 TJ/kg.

== Nuclear binding energy curve ==
In the [[periodic table of elements]], the series of light elements from [[hydrogen]] up to [[sodium]] is observed to exhibit generally increasing binding energy per nucleon as the [[atomic mass]] increases. This increase is generated by increasing forces per nucleon in the nucleus, as each additional nucleon is attracted by all of the other nucleons, and thus more tightly bound to the whole.

The region of increasing binding energy is followed by a region of relative stability (saturation) in the sequence from [[magnesium]] through [[xenon]]. In this region, the nucleus has become large enough that nuclear forces no longer completely extend efficiently across its width. Attractive nuclear forces in this region, as atomic mass increases, are nearly balanced by repellant electromagnetic forces between protons, as [[atomic number]] increases. 

Finally, in elements heavier than xenon, there is a decrease in binding energy per nucleon as atomic number increases. In this region of nuclear size, electromagnetic repulsive forces are beginning to gain against the strong nuclear force. 

At the peak of binding energy, nickel-62 is the most tightly-bound nucleus, followed by iron-58 and iron-56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fewell | first = M. P. | title=The atomic nuclide with the highest mean binding energy | journal=American Journal of Physics | year=1995 | volume=63 | issue=7 | pages=653-658 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AmJPh..63..653F }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the basic reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since they are produced profusely as end products in [[supernova]]e).

The existence of a ''maximum'' in binding energy in medium-sized nuclei is a consequence of the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces which have different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force ([[strong nuclear force]]), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However, the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the additional repelling force of additional protons more than offsets any binding energy which results between further added nucleons as a result of additional strong force interactions; such nuclei become less and less tightly bound as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter) are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller nuclei.

[[Nuclear fusion]] produces energy by combining the very lightest elements into more tightly-bound elements (such as hydrogen into [[helium]]), and [[nuclear fission]] produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]) into more tightly-bound elements (such as [[barium]] and [[krypton]]). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.

=== Semiempirical formula ===
For a nucleus with A nucleons including Z protons, a semiempirical formula for the binding energy per nucleon is

&lt;math&gt;E/A=a-b/\sqrt[3]{A}-c(Z/\sqrt[3]{A^2})^2-d(N-Z)^2/\sqrt[3]{A^{3+3}}\pm e/\sqrt[4]{A^{3+4}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the binding energy is in MeV for the following numerical values of the constants: &lt;math&gt;a=14.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;b=13.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;c=0.585&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;d=19.3&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;e=33&lt;/math&gt;.

The first term &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is called the saturation contribution and ensures that the B.E. per nucleon is the same for all nuclei to a first approximation.

The term &lt;math&gt;-b/A^{1/3}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a surface tension effect and is proportional to the number of nucleons that are situated on the nuclear surface. It is largest for light nuclei.

The term &lt;math&gt;-cZ^2/A^{4/3}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the Coulomb electrostatic repulsion. This becomes more important as &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; increases.

The symmetry correction term &lt;math&gt;-d(N-Z)^2/A^2\,&lt;/math&gt; takes into account the fact that in the absence of other effects the most stable arrangement has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This is because the ''n-p'' interaction in a nucleus is stronger than either the ''n-n'' or ''p-p'' interaction.

The pairing term &lt;math&gt;\pm e/A^{7/4}&lt;/math&gt; is purely empirical. It is + for even-even nuclei and − for odd-odd nuclei.

The following table gives the binding energy per nucleon in MeV for selected isotopes.

=== Measuring the binding energy ===
As seen above in the example of deuterium, nuclear binding energies are large enough that they may be easily measured as fractional [[mass]] deficits, according to the equivalence of mass and energy. The atomic binding energy is simply the amount of energy (and mass) released, when a collection of free [[nucleons]] are joined together to form a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. All nuclei which last long enough to be weighed, are measurably lighter than a corresponding collection of free protons and neutrons. 

Nuclear binding energy can be easily computed from the easily measurable difference in mass of a nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the number of free neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus. Once this mass difference, called the '''mass defect''' or '''mass deficiency''', is known, Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''² can be used to compute the binding energy of any nucleus. (As a historical note, early nuclear physicists used to refer to computing this value as a &quot;packing fraction&quot; calculation.)

For example, the [[atomic mass unit]] (1.000000 '''u''') is ''defined'' to be 1/12 of the mass of a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom—but the atomic mass of a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H atom (which is a proton plus electron) is 1.007825 '''u''', so each nucleon in &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C has lost, on average, about 0.8% percent of its mass in the form of binding energy.

In '''physics''' and '''chemistry''', specifically in [[NMR]] (nuclear magnetic resonance) or [[MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), or [[ESR]] (electron spin resonance) the '''Bloch equations''' are a set of macroscopic equations that are used to calculate the nuclear magnetization '''M''' = (''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a function of time when [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation times]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are present. These are [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenological]] equations that were introduced by [[Felix Bloch]] in 1946.
&lt;ref&gt;F Bloch, ''Nuclear Induction'', Physics Review '''70''', 460-473 (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes they are called the [[equations of motion]] of nuclear magnetization. 

==Bloch equations in laboratory (stationary) frame of reference==
Let '''M'''(''t'') = (''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''), ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''), ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) be the nuclear magnetization. Then the Bloch equations read:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _x - \frac {M_x(t)} {T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _y - \frac {M_y(t)} {T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _z - \frac {M_z(t) - M_0} {T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where γ is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] and '''B'''(''t'') = (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;(t)) is the [[magnetic flux density]] experienced by the nuclei.
The ''z'' component of the magnetic flux density '''B''' is sometimes composed of two terms: 
*one, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is constant in time, 
*the other one, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;(t), is time dependent. It is present in [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]] and helps with the spatial decoding of the NMR signal. 
'''M'''(''t'') &amp;times; '''B'''(''t'') is the [[cross product]] of these two vectors.
''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the steady state nuclear magnetization (that is, for example, when t → ∞); it is in the ''z'' direction.


===Physical background===
With no relaxation (that is both ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞) the above equations simplify to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _z&lt;/math&gt;

or, in vector notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \bold {M}(t)} {d t} = \gamma  \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  &lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation for [[Larmor precession]] of the nuclear magnetization ''M'' in an external magnetic flux density '''B'''.

The relaxation terms, 

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( -\frac {M_x} {T_2},  -\frac {M_y} {T_2}, -\frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

represent an established physical process of transverse and longitudinal relaxation of nuclear magnetization '''M'''.

===Bloch equations are macroscopic equations===
These equations are not ''microscopic'': they do not describe the equation of motion of individual nuclear magnetic moments. These are governed and described by laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. 

Bloch equations are ''macroscopic'': they describe the equations of motion of macroscopic nuclear magnetization that can be obtained by summing up all nuclear magnetic moment in the sample.

===Alternative form of Bloch equations===
The above form is simplified assuming

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y \text{  and  } B_{xy} = B_x + iB_y &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' = &amp;radic;(-1). After some algebra one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \right ) -
\frac {M_{xy}} {T_2} &lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) \overline{B_{xy} (t)} - 
\overline {M_{xy}} (t) B_{xy} (t) \right )
- \frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\overline {M_{xy}} = M_x - i M_y &lt;/math&gt;.

The real and imaginary parts of ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' correspond to ''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.
''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' is sometimes called '''transverse nuclear magnetization'''.

==Bloch equations in rotating frame of reference (outline)==
In rotating frame of reference the it is easier to understand the behaviour of nuclear magnetization '''M'''. This is the motivation: 

===Solution of Bloch equations with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → &amp;infin;===
Assume that:
*at ''t'' = 0 the transverse nuclear magnetization ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(0) experiences a constant magnetic flux density '''B'''(''t'') = (0, 0, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;);
*''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is positive;
*there are no longitudinal and transverse relaxations (that is ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → &amp;infin;). 

Then the Bloch equations are simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \gamma  M_{xy} (t) B_{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

These are two (not coupled) [[linear differential equations]]. Their solution is:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \gamma B_{0} t}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;M_z(t) = M_0 = \text{const} \,&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!-- do not delete &quot;\,&quot;, it improved display of the formula on certain browsers. ---&gt;

Thus the transverse magnetization, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, rotates around the ''z'' axis with [[angular frequency]] ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = γ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in counterclockwise direction (this due to the negative sign in the exponent).
The longitudinal magnetization, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant in time. This is also how the transverse magnetization appears to an observer in the '''laboratory frame of reference''' (that is to a '''stationary observer''').

''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is translated in the following way into observable quantities of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''): Since

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \gamma B_{z0} t} = M_{xy} (0) \left [ \cos (\omega _0 t) - i \sin (\omega_0 t) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;M_{x}(t) = \text {Re} \left (M_{xy} (t) \right ) = M_{xy} (0) \cos (\omega _0 t)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;M_{y}(t) = \text {Im} \left (M_{xy} (t) \right ) = -M_{xy} (0) \sin (\omega _0 t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where Re(''z'') and Im(''z'') are functions that return the real and imaginary part of complex number ''z''. In this calculation it was assumed that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(0) is a real number.

===Transformation to rotating frame of reference===

This is the conclusion of the previous section: in a constant magnetic flux density ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; along ''z'' axis the transverse magnetization ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; rotates around the this axis in counterclockwise direction with angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If the observer were  around the same axis in  counterclockwise direction with angular frequency  Ω, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; it would appear to him 

It is often more convenient to describe the physics and mathematics of nuclear magnetization in a '''rotating frame of reference''': Let (''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;) be a Cartesian coordinate system that is rotating around the static magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (given in the '''laboratory reference system''' (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')) with angular frequency Ω. This is equivalent to assuming that:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = e^{-i \Omega t} M_{xy}'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{z}(t) = M_{z}'&lt;/math&gt;

What are the equations of motion of ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')&amp;prime; and ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')&amp;prime;?

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} = \frac {d M_{xy}(t) e^{+i \Omega t}} {d t} =
e^{+i \Omega t} \frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \Omega e^{+i \Omega t} M_{xy} =
e^{+i \Omega t} \frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \Omega M_{xy}'
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute from the Bloch equation in laboratory frame of reference:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} &amp; = e^{+i \Omega t} \left [-i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \right ) -
\frac {M_{xy}} {T_2} \right ] + i \Omega M_{xy}' = \\

&amp; = \left [-i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) e^{+i \Omega t} B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) e^{+i \Omega t}\right ) -
\frac {M_{xy} e^{+i \Omega t} } {T_2} \right ] + i \Omega M_{xy}' = \\

&amp; = -i \gamma \left ( M_{xy}' (t) B_z' (t) - M_z' (t) B_{xy}' (t) \right ) + i \Omega M_{xy}' -
\frac {M_{xy}'} {T_2}  = 

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple solutions of Bloch equations (outline)==

===Relaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''===

===Relaxation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''===

[[Image:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|Redshift and blue shift]]
'''Blue shift''' is the shortening of a transmitted signal's [[wavelength]], and/or an increase in its [[frequency]], due to the [[relativistic Doppler effect]], which indicates that the object is moving toward the observer. The name comes from the fact that the shorter-wavelength end of the optical [[spectrum]] is the [[blue]] (or [[Violet (color)|violet]]) end, hence, when visible [[light]] is compacted in wavelength, it is shifted towards the &quot;blue&quot; end of the spectrum. Since the longer-wavelength end of the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is ''[[red]]'', the opposite effect, of a lengthening of a signal's wavelength, is referred to as [[redshift]]ing.

While the terms &quot;redshifting&quot; and &quot;blueshifting&quot; imply significantly redder or bluer light, only the most distant galaxies and those moving at speeds far above average emit light that arrives with perceptible red or blue tinges. For the most part, shifting is not a visible phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Quest of the Universe|first=Karl F.|last=Kuhn|coauthors=Theo Koupelis|year=2004|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=0763708100|pages=122–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These terms and conventions (&quot;blue&quot; = compaction, &quot;red&quot;= diffusing) are used even when referring to signals outside the optical range (for instance, [[radio wave]]s, [[x-rays]] and [[gamma rays]]).

==Astronomy==
[[Redshift]] is much more noted due to its importance to modern [[astronomy]]. While the general [[redshift]] of starlight is seen as evidence for an expanding universe, there are a few examples of blue shift in astronomy:
* The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is moving towards our own [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] within the [[Local Group]]; thus, when observed from earth, its light is undergoing a blue shift.
* When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning towards us will have a slight blue shift (see [[Tully-Fisher relation]]).
* Also, [[Blazar]]s are known to propel [[relativistic jet]]s towards us, emitting [[synchrotron radiation]] and [[Bremsstrahlung]] that appears blue shifted.
* Nearby stars such as [[Barnard's Star]] are moving towards us, resulting in a very small blue shift.
===Cause of blueshift in astronomy===
These are the known possible causes of blue shift in astronomy:
# Movement of the source towards us, as seen in
## the edge of a rotating galaxy moving towards us
## In [[blazar]]s which propel [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Relativistic jet|jets]] towards us
## Some galaxies [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1969ApJ...157L.155B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c07726] and quasars [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005ApJ...618..601A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c07726]

[[Image:Bottom-up vs top down.svg|right|350px|thumb|Bottom-up versus top-down proteomics]]

[[Image:Bradbury-Nielsen_on.png|right|thumb|200 px|Schematic top view of a Bradbury-Nielsen shutter with voltages on (deflecting).]]
A '''Bradbury-Nielsen shutter''' (or '''Bradbury-Nielsen gate''') is a type of electrical ion gate, which was first proposed in an article by [[Norris Bradbury]] and Russel A. Nielsen, where they used it as an [[electron]] filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norris E. Bradbury and Russel A. Nielsen | title = Absolute Values of the Electron Mobility in Hydrogen  | year = 1936 | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 388–93 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.49.388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are used in the field of [[mass spectrometry]] where they are used in both [[time-of-flight|TOF]] mass spectrometers and in [[ion mobility spectrometer]]s, as well as [[Hadamard transform]] mass spectrometers (a variant of TOF-MS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joel R. Kimmel, Friedrich Engelke, and Richard N. Zare | title = Novel method for the production of finely spaced Bradbury–Nielson gates | year = 2001 | journal = [[Review of Scientific Instruments]] | volume = 72 | issue = 12 | pages = 4354–4357 | doi = 10.1063/1.1416109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;BNG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Oh Kyu Yoon, Ignacio A. Zuleta, Matthew D. Robbins, Griffin K. Barbula, and Richard N. Zare | title = Simple Template-Based Method to Produce Bradbury-Nielsen Gates | year = 2007 | journal = [[Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry]] | volume = 18 | pages = 1901-1908 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2007.07.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradbury-Nielsen shutter is ideal for injecting short pulses of ions and can be used to improve the mass resolution of TOF instruments by reducing the initial pulse size as compared to other methods of ion injection.

==Theory of Operation==
The concept behind the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter is to apply a [[high frequency]] [[voltage]] in an 180° out-of-phase manner to alternate wires in a grid which is orthogonal to the path of the ion beam. This results in [[charged particles]] only passing directly through the shutter at certain times in the voltage phase (φ=nπ/2), when the potential difference between the grid wires is zero. At other times the ion beam is deflected to some angle by the potential difference between the neighboring wires. This deflection is divergent with ions that pass through alternate slits being deflected in opposite directions.  The deflection angle &lt;ref name=&quot;BNG&quot; /&gt; can be calculated by 

tan α = k V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

where α is the deflection angle, k is a deflection constant, V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the wire voltage (+V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on one wire set and -V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on the other), and V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ion acceleration voltage in eV.  The deflection constant k can be calculated by

k = π / 2ln[cot(πR/2d)]

where R is the wire radius and d is the wire spacing. 

==Micromachined ion gates==
A Bradbury-Nielsen shutter [[micromachine]]d from a [[silicon wafer]] has been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17966990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zuleta IA, Barbula GK, Robbins MD, Yoon OK, Zare RN |title=Micromachined bradbury-nielsen gates |journal=Anal.

In astronomy, the broad iron K line is a spectral line that is an accurate measure of a black hole's immense gravitational force. The name refers to the shape, on a spectrogram, of light emitted by iron atoms near the black hole surface. The light loses energy as it climbs out of the black hole's gravitational well, causing the spectral line to be stretched toward lower frequencies.

A series of observations by the Japanese Suzaku satellite conducted in 2005 and 2006 demonstrates that the broad iron K line is found coming from almost all galaxies and that the signal is real, from strong gravity, and not noise due to poor resolution.  Recent data suggests a connection between quasi-periodic oscillations and the broad Iron K line.

Scientists believe that they will be able to use the broad iron K line to image black holes.

[[Image:Alpha calutron tank.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|An alpha calutron tank removed from the magnet for recovery of uranium-235.]]
A '''calutron''' is a [[mass spectrometer]] used for [[isotope separation|separating the isotopes]] of [[uranium]]. It was developed by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fepi2.htm |title=Lawrence and His Laborator |accessdate=2007-09-03 |year=1981 |work=LBL Newsmagazine |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Manhattan Project]] and was similar to the [[cyclotron]] invented by Lawrence. Its name is a [[concatenation]] of Cal. U.-tron, in tribute to the [[University of California]], Lawrence's institution and the contractor of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] laboratory.&lt;ref name='OSTI ID: 20699216'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The Uranium Bomb, the Calutron, and the Space-Charge Problem|journal=Physics Today|date=2005-05-01|first=William E.|last=Parkins|coauthors=|volume=58|issue=5|pages=45–51|doi= 10.1063/1.1995747}}|url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1947_ParkinsWE.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; They implemented industrial scale [[uranium enrichment]] at the [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] plant established during the war and provided much of the uranium used for the &quot;[[Little Boy]]&quot; [[nuclear weapon]], which was dropped onto [[Hiroshima]] in 1945.

In a mass spectrometer, a vaporized sample is bombarded with high energy [[electrons]], which cause the sample components to become positively charged [[ions]]. They are then accelerated and subsequently deflected by [[magnetic field]]s, ultimately colliding with a plate and producing a measurable [[electric current]].  Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are bent less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations.   The [[mass]] of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. An ordinary mass spectrometer is designed to analyse the composition of very small samples; the calutron uses the same principle, but is designed to separate substantial quantities of known isotopes.

Initially a type of calutron later called Alpha was used; it enriched uranium to about 15% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Another type, called Beta, was later designed to further enrich the output of Alpha, optimising the design for the smaller quantities of already enriched feedstock.

Due to the wartime copper shortage the electromagnets were made using thousands of tons of silver borrowed from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=THE SILVER LINING OF THE CALUTRONS | year=2002 | publisher=Oak Ridge National Lab | url =http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1sidebar6.htm | work =ORNL Review | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=D.

Calutrons use very substantial amounts of electrical power. It is estimated that calutrons built in [[Iraq]] by the [[Baath]] regime of [[Sadam Hussein]] required about 140MW for 90 calutrons&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25608 News article with estimate of power requirements of Iraq's calutrons by [[IAEA]]. Retrieved 22 Apr 09]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Magnetic separation was later abandoned in favor of the more complicated, but more effective, [[gaseous diffusion]] method.

==Calutrons and the Manhattan project==

===Uranium isotope separation===
The world did not lack methods for separating [[isotope]]s when it discovered the possible utility of a [[kilogram]] of [[uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U). Known techniques, pursued simultaneously in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], included [[Ultracentrifuge|ultra-centrifugation]], [[diffusion]] across thermal or [[osmotic]] pressure barriers, and deflection in [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] fields. The last method appealed to Lawrence, who had made his reputation on the precise control of beams of charged particles. The principle is simple: when passing between the poles of a magnet, a monoenergetic beam of ions of naturally occurring uranium splits into several streams according to their momentum, one per isotope, each characterized by a particular radius of curvature; collecting cups at the ends of the semicircular trajectories catch the homogeneous streams.

[[Image:Diagram of uranium isotope separation in the calutron.png|thumb|left|300px|Diagram of uranium isotope separation in the calutron.]] 
Most physicists in 1941 doubted that electromagnetic separation would succeed in practice because they expected that the mutual repulsion of the like-charged ions (the [[space charge]] effect) would prevent the formation of narrow beams. But Lawrence, who had seen a line of positively charged ions pour from his cyclotron, had the 37-inch (94&amp;nbsp;cm) cyclotron modified to demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic separation of uranium isotopes using the principle of the [[mass spectrograph]]. &quot;It will not be a calamity,&quot; he wrote Compton, if uranium turned out to have no military applications; but if &quot;fantastically positive and we fail to get them first, the results for our country may well be a tragic disaster.&quot; By December 1941 the uranium ion beam was passing 5 microamperes to the collector; a small amount, but enough to assure Lawrence that space charge would not be a formidable problem.

The fact that beams of uranium ions could be concentrated well enough to yield small quantities of [[isotope]]s suitable for laboratory research by no means assured that electromagnetic separation could be worked on the industrial scale necessary to make a kilogram of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. The process has little to work on, only the slight difference in mass: 1.25 percent-between uranium 235 and 238. Because the lighter ions respond slightly more to the magnetic field than the heavier, their trajectories bend in a tighter arc. At the end of their semicircular travel, the ions of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U are more plentiful on the inside than on the outside of the beam. But the maximum separation even in the ideal case is small, only one-tenth inch for an arc with a diameter of 37 inches (94&amp;nbsp;cm). Actual beams are far from ideal.

===The alpha calutron===
[[Image:Calutron emitter.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|[[Frank Oppenheimer]] (center right) and [[Robert Lyster Thornton|Robert Thornton]] (right) examine the 4-source emitter for the improved alpha calutron]]
Many technical problems had to be solved before even a prototype could be tested in the field of the nearly completed 184-inch (4.67 m) magnet. The beams, though of low power, could melt the collectors during long hours of operation; water cooling was installed for the collectors and tank liner. [[Electric arc]]s were contrived to ionize the [[uranium tetrachloride]] feed. Ways were devised to extract the enriched uranium that collected at the receiver, and the still valuable feed material that condensed along with [[chloride]] &quot;gunk&quot; all over the inside of the tank. Scrapers were made to clean the exit slits of the feed sources regularly to prevent the accumulated &quot;crud&quot; from reducing beam strength. Lawrence's optimistic conclusion: by the fall of 1942 ten calutrons, each with a 100-milliampere source and all operating within the 184-inch field, would produce four grams of [[enriched uranium]] a day. The [[S-1 Uranium Committee]] that oversaw the uranium project for [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] recommended expending $12 million to create a plant with 25 times that capacity before the fall of 1943. Lawrence did not doubt that other means, particularly reactor production of [[fissile]] [[plutonium]], might ultimately be the most efficient way to a bomb. But in mid-1942 no reactor worked, and the calutron did.

The calutron design settled on in 1942, called &quot;alpha,&quot; provided for enrichment of natural uranium to about 15 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Much effort went into designing powerful ion sources and aptly shaped, eventually [[Parabola|parabolic]] collecting slots. The many modifications and security codes proliferated whimsical names: sources Plato, Cyclops, Bicyclops, and Goofy mated with receivers Gloria, Irene, Mona, or Zulu. Ions from Plato and his friends traversed an arc 48 inches (1.22 m) in radius to reach collector slits placed 0.6 inch (15&amp;nbsp;mm) apart. The guiding magnetic field was [[shim (engineering)|shimmed]] not by the old black art, but in obedience to calculations. Accurately machined and installed, the shims greatly increased the usable beam that reached the collectors.

===Scaling up at Oak Ridge===
Among results obtained with the 184-inch magnet was a design superior to it for large-scale calutrons, the so-called &quot;XA.&quot; The prototype of the magnets to be installed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], XA was a rectangular, three-coil magnet giving a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side-by-side. It had room for four alpha tanks, each with a double source. By the spring of 1943, convinced that the Germans might be ahead, General [[Leslie Groves]] decided to skip the scheduled pilot plant: procedures for alpha operation at Oak Ridge came from the XA and a scale model of the production magnet alone. Tests of the first full-scale system installed there, the XAX, were scheduled for July.

The spring and early summer of 1943 brought hundreds of trainees to Berkeley from  [[Eastman Chemical Company|Tennessee Eastman Company]], the operator for the Oak Ridge plant. The Laboratory labored to ensure that the test XA magnet system and alpha units were working by April in spite of delays in delivery of steel. Between April and July the training sessions ran continuously. In June a migration that by 1944 would reach 200 started for Oak Ridge. Laboratory expenditures exceeded half a million dollars a month.

During the Manhattan Project the operators, mostly women, worked in shifts covering 24 hours a day. Gladys Owens is the young lady on the right above and closest to the camera, where she spent eight months of her life &quot;watching meters and adjusting dials&quot; without knowing what she was actually doing.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://smithdray1.net/angeltowns/or/go.htm |title=The Calutron Girls |accessdate=2007-09-01 |last=Smith |first=D. Ray }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The first wave of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] workers at Oak Ridge had to see that the XAX magnet worked. Then runs could begin on the first production system, or &quot;racetrack;&quot; a 24-fold magnification of the XA that could hold 96 calutron alpha tanks. To minimize magnetic losses and [[steel]] consumption, the assembly was curved into an oval 122 feet (37 m) long, 77 feet (23 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) high. Want of copper for the large coils to produce the magnetic fields prompted a solution possible only in wartime: Groves borrowed 14,700&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]]s (13,300&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s, 429 million [[troy ounce]]s) of pure silver from a government vault for the purpose; all was later returned, the last few tons in 1970. Late in the summer of 1943 the XAX was ready for testing. After a week of difficulty, it cleared the hurdle for full-scale racetrack runs.

The first two of five projected racetracks started up in November and failed from contaminated cooling oil; the second was limping in January, but produced 200 grams of uranium enriched to 12 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by the end of February 1944, its fifth of the total goal of one kilogram of enriched uranium per month. By April four racetracks were functioning, including the repaired number 1. They required constant attention. Many people from the Laboratory helped modify the units to reach production goals. 

The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. Then Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education took over. [[Kenneth Nichols]] compared unit production data, and pointed out to [[Ernest Lawrence]] that the young “hillbilly” girl operators were outproducing his Ph.Ds. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were trained like soldiers not to reason why, while “the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials” &lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Kenneth D. ‘’The Road to Trinity page 131 (1987, Morrow, New York) ISBN 068806910X  &lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for operation passed entirely to Tennessee Eastman after the spring of 1944, and the Laboratory staff at Oak Ridge turned their attention to redesigning the calutron system for higher efficiency.

===The beta calutron===
Many at the Laboratory, especially [[Edward Lofgren]] and [[Martin Kamen]], thought that a second stage would be necessary to reach the required enrichment. Groves approved the idea. In the spring of 1943, during training at Berkeley for alpha operations, design began on the second or beta stage. Because beta would have only the enriched product of alpha as feed, it would process proportionately less material; its beam therefore did not need to be as broad, nor its dimensions as large, as alpha's. Beta design emphasized recovery, not only of the further enriched output but also of the already enriched feed. The first units were tried at Oak Ridge in late February 1944, but the sources had to be redesigned, and even by June difficulties persisted in recovering the precious beta feed strewn throughout the calutron. Process efficiencies stayed low: only 4 or 5 percent of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U in the feed ended up in the output. A better source of enriched uranium feed would have to be found to create the 10 kilograms or so of 90 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U that [[Robert Oppenheimer]] thought necessary for a bomb.

The [[gaseous diffusion]] procedure for separation of uranium isotopes, which had consumed more money than the calutron, had not met its design goals by late 1944. Groves decided that it could not be counted on to produce high enrichment, and that whatever it did produce would have to be supplemented with other less enriched uranium and processed through beta calutrons. To augment the calutron feed, the [[Manhattan Engineering District]] constructed a further plant at Oak Ridge, this one working by [[thermal diffusion]], a method developed by [[Philip Abelson]].

===Weapons-grade uranium===
In the critical production period in the first months of 1945, the calutrons, particularly the six betas of 36 tanks each, produced weapons-grade &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U using feed from the modified alpha calutrons, the small output from the gaseous diffusion plant, and whatever the new thermal process had to offer. Virtually all the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U sent by courier on the train to [[Chicago]] and on to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] had passed through the beta calutrons. From these shipments Oppenheimer's physicists assembled the bomb that was to destroy [[Hiroshima]].

'''The Canadian Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer''' ('''CPT''') is one of the major pieces of experimental equipment that is installed on the [[Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System|ATLAS]] superconducting heavy-ion linac facility at the Physics Division of the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. It was developed and operated by physicist [[Guy Savard]] and a collaboration of other scientists at Argonne, the [[University of Manitoba]], [[McGill University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[State University of New York]]. 

== Development ==
The CPT was originally built for the [[TASCC|Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron]] (TASCC) facility at [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. However, it was transferred to Argonne National Laboratory when the TASCC accelerator was decommissioned in 1998 due to funding issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJN-41MHFHC-17&amp;_user=1722207&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000053990&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1722207&amp;md5=4c620ed80f2930d6ee677867c070647d&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CPT [[spectrometer]] is designed to provide high-precision mass measurements of [[radioactivity|short-lived]] [[isotopes]] using [[radio-frequency]] (RF) fields. Accurate mass measurements of particular isotopes such as [[selenium|selenium-68]] are important in the understanding of the detailed [[reaction mechanism]]s involved in the [[rp-process|rapid-proton capture process]], which occurs in astrophysical events like [[supernova|supernovae explosions]] and [[X-ray burst]]s. An X-ray burst is one possible site for the rp-process mechanism which involves the [[accretion]] of hydrogen and helium from one star onto the surface of its [[neutron star]] binary companion. Mass measurements are required as key inputs to network calculations used to describe this process in terms of the abundances of the nuclides produced, the [[Light curve|light-curve]] profile of the X-ray bursts, and the energy produced. In the current configuration, more than 100 [[radiation|radioactive]] isotopes have been measured with half-lives much less than a second and with a precision (Δm/m) approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recently, a novel injection system, the [[RFQ Beam Coolers|RF gas cooler]], has been installed on the CPT to allow fast reaction products to be decelerated, thermalized and bunched for rapid and efficient injection. This enhances the investigative capabilities of the CPT on isotopes around the [[Isotope#Nuclear properties and stability|N=Z line]] with particular emphasis on isotopes of interest to low-energy tests of the [[electroweak interaction]] and the rp-process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">Carbohydrate NMR is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to structural and conformational analysis of carbohydrate molecules. The study of carbohydrate chemistry today relies heavily on NMR spectroscopy. It is a tool that allows the carbohydrate chemist to determine the structure of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides from synthetic and natural sources. It is also a useful tool for determining sugar conformations. 



Modern high field strength NMR instruments used for carbohydrate samples, typically 500 MHz or greater, are able to run a suite of 1D and 2D experiments to determine primary structure and conformation of carbohydrate compounds. 

== Sensitivity and Sample Size ==
In addition to ever increasing magnet size several other factors determine the sensitivity of an NMR instrument. Shigemi tubes are ideal for small sample sizes and are available matched to a variety of deuterated NMR solvents. Cold probes are available that cryogenically cool the NMR systems radio frequency (rf) receiver coils and pre-amplifier to provide increased sensitivity, reducing thermal noise.

== Carbohydrate chemical shift ==
Common chemical shift ranges for nuclei within carbohydrate residues are:
*Typical &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts of carbohydrate ring protons are 3 – 6 ppm. 
*Typical &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR chemical shifts of carbohydrate ring protons are 60 – 110 ppm

In the case of simple monosaccharide molecules, all protons are typically separated at a high enough field strength (usually &gt; 500MHz).

=== Anomeric center ===
Typically the anomeric protons are found shifted further downfield (higher ppm) on the NMR spectrum then other ring protons, generally 4-6 ppm. This often makes these signals the most diagnostic component of the spectrum.

The equatorial anomeric proton of an α-pyranoside is found downfield of the axial anomeric proton of a β-pyranoside. This can be accounted for by the deshielding effect of the ring oxygen which has closer proximity to an equatorial anomeric proton. Additionally, the anisotropic effects of circulating σ electrons form a deshielded region around the equatorial proton.

The anomeric carbon is typically found at 90-110 ppm, typical of any acetal carbon. The use of chemical shift for determining C-1 stereochemistry is unreliable, but the carbon of a β-anomer is usually found downfield relative to the α-anomer.

=== Non-anomeric centers ===
Typically the non-anomeric protons are found from 3 - 4 ppm. As expected some spectral overlap is seen, but with today’s high field instruments individual resonances can usually be resolved for monosaccharides. 
Typically the non-anomeric carbons are found from 60 – 85 ppm. As expected the secondary carbons will be found further downfield from a primary carbon.

== Oligosaccharide NMR ==
Oligosaccharide &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectra tend to be a mess in the region of the spectra from 3 – 4 ppm. Quite often the individual signals are overlapped, and cannot be distinguished in the simple 1-D experiment. It is therefore advantageous to utilize 2D experiments

== COSY or Correlation spectroscopy ==
COSY, or Correlation SpectroscopY, is often useful for carbohydrate structures due to the extended spin systems found in these molecules. The cross peaks in a 2D - COSY spectrum indicate couplings (2 and 3 bond) between two protons. Using this coupling information we can “walk” around a monosaccharide ring determining each proton, provided there is an obvious entry point, usually the anomeric proton.

== TOCSY (Totally Correlated Spectroscopy) ==
The 2D - TOCSY experiment is similar to the 2D - COSY experiment, in that cross peaks of coupled protons are observed. However, the additional information obtained in a TOCSY is correlations for all the protons in the spin system. In the case of oligosaccharides, each sugar residue is an isolated spin system, so it is possible to differentiate all the protons of a specific sugar residue. A 1D version of TOCSY is also available and by irradiating a single proton the rest of the spin system can be revealed. 

Recent advances in this technique include the 1D - CSSF - TOCSY ('''C'''hemical '''S'''hift '''S'''elective '''F'''ilter - TOCSY) experiment. This produces higher quality spectra and allows coupling constants to be reliably extracted and used to help determine stereochemistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Carbon-13 NMR''' ('''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR''' or sometimes simply referred to as carbon NMR) is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to carbon. It is analogous to proton NMR  and allows the identification of carbon atoms in an organic molecule just as proton NMR identifies hydrogen atoms. As such &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR is an important tool in chemical structure elucidation in organic chemistry.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR detects only the Carbon-13 isotope of carbon, whose natural abundance is only 1.1%, because the main carbon isotope, Carbon-12, is not detectable by NMR since it has zero spin.

==Implementation==
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR has a number of complications that are not encountered in proton NMR.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR is much less sensitive to carbon than &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR is to hydrogen since the major isotope of carbon, the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, has a spin quantum number of zero and so is not magnetically active and therefore not detectable by NMR. Only the much less common &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, present naturally at 1.1% natural abundance, is magnetically active with a spin quantum number of 1/2 (like &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) and therefore detectable by NMR.  Therefore, only the few &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei present resonate in the magnetic field, although this can be overcome by isotopic enrichment of e.g. protein samples.  In&amp;nbsp;addition, the [[../gyromagnetic ratio/]] (6.728284 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; rad T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is only 1/4 that of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, further reducing the sensitivity.  The overall
''receptivity'' of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=R. M. Silverstein, G. C. Bassler and T. C. Morrill| title=Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds|publisher=Wiley| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''[[Vanillin]] C-13 NMR spectrum'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Another potential complication results from the presence of large one bond [[J-coupling]] constants between carbon and hydrogen (typically from 100 to 250 Hz).  In order to suppress these couplings, which would otherwise complicate the spectra and further reduce sensitivity, carbon NMR spectra are proton [[NMR decoupling|decoupled]] to remove the signal splitting. Couplings between carbons can be ignored due to the low natural abundance of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.  Hence in contrast to typical proton NMR spectra which show multiplets for each proton position, carbon NMR spectra show a single peak for each chemically non-equivalent carbon atom.   
 
In further contrast to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, the intensities of the signals are not normally proportional to the number of equivalent &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms and are instead strongly dependent on the number of surrounding [[Spin (physics)|spins]] (typically &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H). Spectra can be made more quantitative if necessary by allowing sufficient time for the nuclei to relax between repeat scans. 

High field magnets with internal bores capable of accepting larger sample tubes (typically 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter for &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR versus 5&amp;nbsp;mm for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR), the use of relaxation reagents &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Applications range from quantification of [[drug]] purity to determination of the composition of high molecular weight synthetic [[polymers]].  

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C [[chemical shift]]s follow the same principles as those of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, although the typical range of chemical shifts is much larger than for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H (by a factor of about 20).  The chemical shift reference standard for 
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is the carbons in [[../tetramethylsilane]] (TMS), whose chemical shift is considered to be 0.0 ppm.

&lt;/div&gt;

==DEPT spectra==
[[Image:DEPT spectra.jpg|thumb|300px|right|DEPT spectra of propyl benzoate]]
DEPT stands for '''D'''istortionless '''E'''nhancement by '''P'''olarization '''T'''ransfer. It is a very useful method for determining the presence of primary, secondary and [[tertiary carbon]] atoms. The DEPT experiment differentiates between CH, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups by variation of the selection angle parameter (the tip angle of the final &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H pulse): 
*45° angle gives all carbons with attached protons (regardless of number) in phase
*90° angle gives only CH groups, the others being suppressed
*135° angle gives all CH and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a phase opposite to CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
Signals from quaternary carbons and other carbons with no attached protons are always absent (due to the lack of attached protons). 

The polarization transfer from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C has the
secondary advantage of increasing the sensitivity over the normal &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C
spectrum (which has a modest enhancement from the [[Nuclear Overhauser effect|NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect)]] due to the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H decoupling).
===The peaks seen in a 13C NMR===
The peaks seen in a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectrum are a result of different '''Isotopomers'''. For example consider [[ethanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). Ethanol will have 2 simple '''isotopomers''' one in which the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is on the [[methyl]] group i.e. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and one isotopomer in which the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is on the [[methylene]] i.e. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH.

This gives rise to 2 peaks in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C [[NMR spectrum]].

Note the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms do not show up in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR. 

Also given that &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is only present in 1% abundance, there is a very small chance of also seeing the [[isotopologue]] in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, wherein both carbon atoms are &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms (i.e. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). These atoms would [[../J-coupling|couple]], giving satellites off the main peaks in a normal &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR spectrum and forming the basis for INADEQUATE (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C–&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C correlation) experiments.

'''Carbon satellites''' are small peaks that can be seen shouldering the main peaks in an [[NMR]] [[NMR spectrum|spectrum]].  These peaks can occur in the NMR spectrum of any NMR active atom (e.g. [[Fluorine-19 NMR|19F]] or [[Phosphorus-31 NMR|31P NMR]]) where those atoms adjoin a carbon atom (and where the spectrum is not 13C-decoupled, which is usually the case).  However, Carbon satellites are most often encountered in [[proton NMR]]. 

In the example of [[proton NMR]], these peaks are not the result of [[proton NMR|proton-proton coupling]], but result from the coupling of 1H atoms to an adjoining [[Carbon-13]] atom. These small peaks are known as carbon satellites as they are small and appear around the main 1H peak i.e. [[satellite]] (around) to them.  Carbon satellites are small because [[Carbon-13]] only makes up about 1% of the atomic carbon content of [[carbon]], the rest of the carbon atoms are predominantly NMR inactive [[Carbon-12]].  Carbon satellites always appear as an evenly spaced pair around the main 1H peak. This is because they are the result of 1% of the 1H atoms coupling to an adjoined [[Carbon-13|13C atom]] to give a wide doublet (Carbon-13 has a spin of a half).  Note, if the main 1H-peak has proton-proton coupling, then each satellite will be a miniature version of the main peak and will also show this 1H-coupling, e.g. if the main 1H-peak is a doublet, then the carbon satellites will appear as miniature doublets, i.e. one doublet on either side of the main 1H-peak.  

For other NMR atoms (e.g. 19F or 31P atoms), the same applies as above, but obviously where the proton atom is replaced with that oterh NMR active atom e.g. 31P. 

Sometime other peaks can be seen around 1H peaks, these are known as [[spinning sidebands]] and are related to the rate of spin of an [[NMR tube]].  

Carbon satellites (and spinning sidebands) should not be confused with impurity peaks. 

==Uses==
[[File:Stilbene_cis_structure.svg|thumb|right|[[(Z)-Stilbene|Cis-Stilbene]]]] [[File:Stilbene_trans_structure.svg|thumb|right|[[(E)-Stilbene|Trans-Stilbene]]]] '''Carbon satellites''' can be used to obtain structural information, which is not available by looking at the main peaks in the [[NMR]] [[NMR spectrum|spectrum]].

This usually occurs when the purely [[C-12]] compound is symmetrical but where the 1% of the compound which has a [[C-13]] atom in it is no longer symmetrical.

For example, you can not tell if [[stilbene]] (Ph-'''CH=CH'''-Ph) has a [[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]- or [[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]- [[double bond]] just by examining at the main peaks in the [[1H NMR]] spectrum.  The =CH- proton does not couple to the adjacent =CH- proton as the molecule is [[symmetrical]].  However 1% of the stilbene molecules will have a 13C atom on one of these double bond carbons (i.e. Ph-'''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH=&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CH'''-Ph). In this situation, the proton adjacent to 13C atom will [[NMR spectroscopy|couple]] to the 13C atom to give a wide [[NMR spectroscopy|doublet]]. Also, as this molecule is no longer symmetric the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;= proton will now couple to the adjacent &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;=  proton, causing a further doubleting.  Thus this additional coupling (additional to the 13C coupling) is diagnostic of the type of double bond, and will allow one to determine if the stilbene molecule has a cis- or trans- configuration i.e. by examining the size of the diagnostic [[NMR spectroscopy|J coupling constant]] from -CH=CH- bond. Thus only a single 1H NMR spectrum is need, albeit with close inspection of the satellite peaks, rather than any further complex [[NMR]] or derivative chemical experiments.

The same would be see for [[1,2-Dichloroethene]].&lt;ref name=Gunther1&gt;{{cite book

Luthria, Editor pp.241-273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;, and to images of planetary systems in astronomy, but different instrumentation is employed for making observations on such widely different systems.

Chemical imaging instrumentation is composed of three components: a radiation source to illuminate the sample, a spectrally selective element, and usually a detector array (the camera) to collect the images. When many stacked spectral channels ([[wavelength]]s) are collected for different locations of the microspectrometer focus on a line or planar array in the focal plane, the data is called hyperspectral; fewer wavelength data sets are called multispectral. The data format is called a hypercube. The data set may be visualized as a three-dimensional block of data spanning two spatial dimensions (x and y), with a series of wavelengths (lambda) making up the third (spectral) axis. The hypercube can be visually and mathematically treated as a series of spectrally resolved images (each image plane corresponding to the image at one wavelength) or a series of spatially resolved spectra. The analyst may choose to view the spectrum measured at a particular spatial location; this is useful for chemical identification. Alternatively, selecting an image plane at a particular wavelength can highlight the spatial distribution of sample components, provided that their spectral signatures are different at the selected wavelength.

Many materials, both manufactured and naturally occurring, derive their functionality from the spatial distribution of sample components. For example, extended release pharmaceutical formulations can be achieved by using a coating that acts as a barrier layer. The release of active ingredient is controlled by the presence of this barrier, and imperfections in the coating, such as discontinuities, may result in altered performance. In the semi-conductor industry, irregularities or contaminants in silicon wafers or printed micro-circuits can lead to failure of these components. The functionality of biological systems is also dependent upon chemical gradients – a single cell, tissue, and even whole organs function because of the very specific arrangement of components. It has been shown that even small changes in chemical composition and distribution may be an early indicator of disease. 

Any material that depends on chemical gradients for functionality may be amenable to study by an analytical technique that couples spatial and chemical characterization. To efficiently and effectively design and manufacture such materials, the ‘what’ and the ‘where’ must both be measured. The demand for this type of analysis is increasing as manufactured materials become more complex. Chemical imaging techniques not only permit visualization of the spatially resolved chemical information that is critical to understanding modern manufactured products, but it is also a non-destructive technique so that samples are preserved for further testing.

==History==
Commercially available laboratory-based chemical imaging systems emerged in the early 1990s (ref. 1-5). In addition to economic factors, such as the need for sophisticated electronics and extremely high-end computers, a significant barrier to commercialization of infrared imaging was that the focal plane array (FPA) needed to read IR images were not readily available as commercial items. As high-speed electronics and sophisticated computers became more commonplace, and infrared cameras became readily commercially available, laboratory chemical imaging systems were introduced.

Initially used for novel research in specialized laboratories, chemical imaging became a more commonplace analytical technique used for general R&amp;D, quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) in less than a decade. The rapid acceptance of the technology in a variety of industries (pharmaceutical, polymers, semiconductors, security, forensics and agriculture) rests in the wealth of information characterizing both chemical composition and morphology. The parallel nature of chemical imaging data makes it possible to analyze multiple samples simultaneously for applications that require high throughput analysis in addition to characterizing a single sample.

==Principles==
Chemical imaging shares the fundamentals of vibrational spectroscopic techniques, but provides additional information by way of the simultaneous acquisition of spatially resolved spectra. It combines the advantages of digital imaging with the attributes of spectroscopic measurements. Briefly, [[vibrational spectroscopy]] measures the interaction of light with matter. Photons that interact with a sample are either absorbed or scattered; photons of specific energy are absorbed, and the pattern of absorption provides information, or a fingerprint, on the molecules that are present in the sample. 

On the other hand, in terms of the observation setup, chemical imaging can be carried out in one of the following modes: (optical) [[absorption]], [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] (fluorescence), (optical) [[transmittance|transmission]] or [[scattering]] (Raman). A consensus currently exists that the fluorescence ([[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]) and Raman [[scattering]] modes are the most sensitive and powerful, but also the most expensive. 

In a transmission measurement, the radiation goes through a sample and is measured by a detector placed on the far side of the sample. The energy transferred from the incoming radiation to the molecule(s) can be calculated as the difference between the quantity of photons that were emitted by the source and the quantity that is measured by the detector. In a diffuse reflectance measurement, the same energy difference measurement is made, but the source and detector are located on the same side of the sample, and the photons that are measured have re-emerged from the illuminated side of the sample rather than passed through it. The energy may be measured at one or multiple wavelengths; when a series of measurements are made, the response curve is called a [[spectrum]]. 

A key element in acquiring spectra is that the radiation must somehow be energy selected – either before or after interacting with the sample. Wavelength selection can be accomplished with a fixed filter, tunable filter, spectrograph, an interferometer, or other devices. For a fixed filter approach, it is not efficient to collect a significant number of wavelengths, and multispectral data are usually collected. Interferometer-based chemical imaging requires that entire spectral ranges be collected, and therefore results in hyperspectral data. Tunable filters have the flexibility to provide either multi- or hyperspectral data, depending on analytical requirements. 

Spectra may be measured one point at a time using a single element detector (single-point mapping), as a line-image using a linear array detector (typically 16 to 28 pixels) (linear array mapping), or as a two-dimensional image using a Focal Plane Array (FPA)(typically 256 to 16,384 pixels) (FPA imaging). For single-point the sample is moved in the x and y directions point-by-point using a computer-controlled stage. With linear array mapping, the sample is moved line-by-line with a computer-controlled stage. FPA imaging data are collected with a two-dimensional FPA detector, hence capturing the full desired field-of-view at one time for each individual wavelength, without having to move the sample. FPA imaging, with its ability to collected tens of thousands of spectra simultaneously is orders of magnitude faster than linear arrays which are can typically collect 16 to 28 spectra simultaneously, which are in turn much faster than single-point mapping.

===Terminology===
Some words common in spectroscopy, optical microscopy and photography have been adapted or their scope modified for their use in chemical imaging. They include: resolution, field of view and magnification. There are two types of resolution in chemical imaging. The spectral resolution refers to the ability to resolve small energy differences; it applies to the spectral axis. The [[Angular resolution|spatial resolution]] is the minimum distance between two objects that is required for them to be detected as distinct objects. The spatial resolution is influenced by the [[field of view]], a physical measure of the size of the area probed by the analysis. In imaging, the field of view is a product of the magnification and the number of pixels in the detector array. The magnification is a ratio of the physical area of the detector array divided by the area of the sample field of view. Higher magnifications for the same detector image a smaller area of the sample.

=== Types of vibrational chemical imaging instruments===
Chemical imaging has been implemented for mid-infrared, near-[[infrared spectroscopy]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]]. As with their bulk spectroscopy counterparts, each imaging technique has particular strengths and weaknesses, and are best suited to fulfill different needs. 

====Mid-infrared chemical imaging====
Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy probes fundamental molecular vibrations, which arise in the spectral range 2,500-25,000 nm.  Commercial imaging implementations in the MIR region typically employ Fourier Transform Infrared ([[FT-IR]]) interferometers and the range is more commonly presented in [[wavenumber]], 4,000 – 400 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The MIR absorption bands tend to be relatively narrow and well-resolved; direct spectral interpretation is often possible by an experienced spectroscopist.  MIR spectroscopy can distinguish subtle changes in chemistry and structure, and is often used for the identification of unknown materials. The absorptions in this spectral range are relatively strong; for this reason, sample presentation is important to limit the amount of material interacting with the incoming radiation in the MIR region. Most data collected in this range is collected in transmission mode through thin sections (~10 micrometres) of material. Water is a very strong absorber of MIR radiation and wet samples often require advanced sampling procedures (such as [[attenuated total reflectance]]). Commercial instruments include point and line mapping, and imaging.  All employ an FT-IR interferometer as wavelength selective element and light source. 

[[Image:FIRST measurement of SF6 and NH3.jpg|thumb||300px|Remote chemical imaging of a simultaneous release of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at 1.5km using the FIRST imaging spectrometer&lt;ref&gt;M.

Legault, High-Performance Field-Portable Imaging Radiometric Spectrometer Technology For Hyperspectral imaging Applications, Proc. SPIE 5994, 59940N, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]For types of MIR microscope, see [[Microscopy#Infrared microscopy]].

[[Infrared window|Atmospheric windows]] in the infrared spectrum are also employed to perform chemical imaging remotely.  In these spectral regions the atmospheric gases (mainly water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) present low absorption and allow infrared viewing over kilometer distances.  Target molecules can then be viewed using the selective absorption/emission processes described above.  An example of the chemical imaging of a simultaneous release of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in the image.

====Near-infrared chemical imaging====
The analytical near infrared (NIR) region spans the range from approximately 700-2,500 nm. The absorption bands seen in this spectral range arise from overtones and combination bands of O-H, N-H, C-H and S-H stretching and bending vibrations. Absorption is one to two orders of magnitude smaller in the NIR compared to the MIR; this phenomenon eliminates the need for extensive sample preparation.  Thick and thin samples can be analyzed without any sample preparation, it is possible to acquire NIR chemical images through some packaging materials, and the technique can be used to examine hydrated samples, within limits. Intact samples can be imaged in transmittance or diffuse reflectance. 

The lineshapes for overtone and combination bands tend to be much broader and more overlapped than for the fundamental bands seen in the MIR. Often, multivariate methods are used to separate spectral signatures of sample components.  NIR chemical imaging is particularly useful for performing rapid, reproducible and non-destructive analyses of known materials&lt;ref&gt;Novel Techniques for Microspectroscopy and Chemical Imaging Analysis of Soybean Seeds and Embryos.(2002).  Baianu, I.C., Costescu, D.M., and You, T. ''Soy2002 Conference'', Urbana, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Chemical Imaging and NMR Analysis of Oil in Developing and Mutagenized Soybean Embryos in Culture. (2003). Baianu, I.C., Costescu, D.M., Hofmann, N., and Korban, S.S.  ''AOCS Meeting, Analytical Division''.&lt;/ref&gt;.  NIR imaging instruments are typically based on one of two platforms: imaging using a tunable filter and broad band illumination, and line mapping employing an FT-IR interferometer as the wavelength filter and light source.

====Raman chemical imaging====
The Raman shift chemical imaging spectral range spans from approximately 50 to 4,000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; the actual spectral range over which a particular Raman measurement is made is a function of the laser excitation frequency. The basic principle behind [[Raman spectroscopy]] differs from the MIR and NIR in that the x-axis of the Raman spectrum is measured as a function of energy shift (in cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) relative to the frequency of the laser used as the source of radiation. Briefly, the Raman spectrum arises from inelastic scattering of incident photons, which requires a change in polarizability with vibration, as opposed to infrared absorption, which requires a change in dipole moment with vibration. The end result is spectral information that is similar and in many cases complementary to the MIR. The Raman effect is weak - only about one in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; photons incident to the sample undergoes Raman scattering. Both organic and inorganic materials possess a Raman spectrum; they generally produce sharp bands that are chemically specific. [[Fluorescence]] is a competing phenomenon and, depending on the sample, can overwhelm the Raman signal, for both bulk spectroscopy and imaging implementations.

Raman chemical imaging requires little or no sample preparation. However, physical sample sectioning may be used to expose the surface of interest, with care taken to obtain a surface that is as flat as possible. The conditions required for a particular measurement dictate the level of invasiveness of the technique, and samples that are sensitive to high power laser radiation may be damaged during analysis. It is relatively insensitive to the presence of water in the sample and is therefore useful for imaging samples that contain water such as biological material.

===Fluorescence imaging (visible and NIR)===
This [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] microspectroscopy mode is the most sensitive
in both visible and FT-NIR microspectroscopy, and has therefore numerous biomedical, biotechnological and agricultural applications. There are several powerful, highly specific and sensitive fluorescence techniques that are currently in use, or still being developed; among the former are FLIM, FRAP, FRET and FLIM-FRET; among the latter are
NIR fluorescence and probe-sensitivity enhanced NIR fluorescence microspectroscopy and nanospectroscopy techniques (see &quot;Further reading&quot; section).

==Sampling and samples==
The value of imaging lies in the ability to resolve spatial heterogeneities in solid-state or gel/gel-like samples. Imaging a liquid or even a suspension has limited use as constant sample motion serves to average spatial information, unless ultra-fast recording techniques are employed as in fluorescence correlation microspectroscopy or FLIM obsevations where a single molecule may be monitored at extremely high (photon) detection speed. High-throughput experiments (such as imaging multi-well plates) of liquid samples can however provide valuable information. In this case, the parallel acquisition of thousands of spectra can be used to compare differences between samples, rather than the more common implementation of exploring spatial heterogeneity within a single sample.  

Similarly, there is no benefit in imaging a truly homogeneous sample, as a single point spectrometer will generate the same spectral information.  Of course the definition of homogeneity is dependent on the spatial resolution of the imaging system employed.  For MIR imaging, where wavelengths span from 3-10 micrometres, objects on the order of 5 micrometres may theoretically be resolved. The sampled areas are limited by current experimental implementations because illumination is provided by the interferometer. Raman imaging may be able to resolve particles less than 1 micrometre in size, but the sample area that can be illuminated is severely limited. With Raman imaging, it is considered impractical to image large areas and, consequently, large samples. FT-NIR chemical/hyperspectral imaging usually resolves only larger objects (&gt;10 micrometres), and is better suited for large samples because illumination sources are readily available. However, FT-NIR microspectroscopy was recently reported to be capable of about 1.2 micron (micrometer) resolution in biological samples&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Fluorescence Microspectroscopy,Infrared Chemical Imaging and High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis of Soybean  Seeds, Somatic Embryos and Single Cells., Baianu, I.C. et al. 2004., In ''Oil Extraction and Analysis.'', D. Luthria, Editor pp.241-273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two-photon excitation FCS experiments were reported to have attained 15 nanometer resolution on biomembrane thin films with a special coincidence photon-counting setup. 

===Detection limit===
The concept of the detection limit for chemical imaging is quite different than for bulk spectroscopy, as it depends on the sample itself. Because a bulk spectrum represents an average of the materials present, the spectral signatures of trace components are simply overwhelmed by dilution. In imaging however, each pixel has a corresponding spectrum. If the physical size of the trace contaminant is on the order of the pixel size imaged on the sample, its spectral signature will likely be detectable. If however, the trace component is dispersed homogeneously (relative to pixel image size) throughout a sample, it will not be detectable.  Therefore, detection limits of chemical imaging techniques are strongly influenced by particle size, the chemical and spatial heterogeneity of the sample, and the spatial resolution of the image.

===Data analysis===
Data analysis methods for chemical imaging data sets typically employ mathematical algorithms common to single point spectroscopy or to image analysis.  The reasoning is that the spectrum acquired by each detector is equivalent to a single point spectrum; therefore pre-processing, [[chemometrics]] and pattern recognition techniques are utilized with the similar goal to separate chemical and physical effects and perform a qualitative or quantitative characterization of individual sample components. In the spatial dimension, each chemical image is equivalent to a digital image and standard image analysis and robust statistical analysis can be used for feature extraction.

==Mechanism==
In a CI experiment, ions are produced through the collision of the analyte with ions of a reagent gas that are present in the [[ion source]].  Some common reagent gases include:  [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[isobutane]].  Inside the ion source, the reagent gas is present in large excess compared to the analyte.  Electrons entering the source will preferentially ionize the reagent gas.  The resultant collisions with other reagent gas molecules will create an ionization [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].  Positive and negative ions of the analyte are formed by reactions with this plasma.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPA&quot; /&gt;

Self chemical ionization occurs when the reagent ion is an ionized form of the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ac00226a011 | title = Chemical ionization in Fourier transform mass spectrometry | year = 1981 | author = Sahba.

===Negative chemical ionization (NCI)===
Chemical ionization for gas phase analysis is either positive or negative. Almost all neutral analytes can form positive ions through the reactions described above.

In order to see a response by negative chemical ionization, the analyte must be capable of producing a negative ion (stabilize a negative charge) for example by [[electron capture ionization]].  Because not all analytes can do this, using NCI provides a certain degree of selectivity that is not available with other, more universal ionization techniques (EI, PCI).  NCI can be used for the analysis of compounds containing acidic groups or electronegative elements (especially halogens).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=de Hoffmann|first=Edmond|coauthors=Vincent Stroobant|title=Mass Spectrometry:  Principles and Applications|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Toronto|date=2003|edition=Second| isbn = 0471485667|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the high electronegativity of [[halogen]] atoms, NCI is a common choice for their analysis.  This includes many groups of compounds, such as [[polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;J3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kontsas|first=Helena|coauthors=Kaija Pekari|date=2003-07-05|title=Determination of polychlorinated biphenyls in serum using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization for exposure estimation|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|publisher=Elsevier, Ltd.|volume=791|issue=1-2|pages=117–125|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6X0P-48B5FR8-D&amp;_user=1069125&amp;_coverDate=07%2F05%2F2003&amp;_alid=759548054&amp;_rdoc=3&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=7220&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=8&amp;_acct=C000051259&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1069125&amp;md5=a1aa7b8733e3fe4a2e0cb1bc49509fc0|accessdate=2008-06-26|doi=10.1016/S1570-0232(03)00216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[pesticides]]&lt;ref name=&quot;J2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rivera-Rodríguez|first=Laura B. |coauthors=Ricardo Rodríguez-Estrella, James Jackson Ellington and John J.

===Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)===
Chemical ionization in an atmospheric pressure electric discharge is called [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]]. The analyte is a gas or liquid spray and ionization is accomplished using an atmospheric pressure corona discharge. This ionization method is often coupled with [[high performance liquid chromatography]] where the mobile phase containing eluting analyte sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen and the aerosol spray is subjected to a corona discharge to create ions.

: It's indispensable element for running applications such as OpenOffice.org or Jalbum.&lt;br&gt;


== Installation from repositories ==
: Installation of proprietary Java version with it's web browser plug-in:&lt;br&gt;
 apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin
: When installator finish downloading it'll display the licence, just scroll it down to the end of it and agree typing &quot;yes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;


== Installation from package ==
:1. If you don't want to install Java from repositories. then:&lt;br&gt;
::a. Download &quot;self-extracting file&quot; from: [http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp?locale=pl&amp;host=www.java.com java.com].&lt;br&gt;
::b. Move the package to: &quot;/usr/lib/jvm&quot; folder.&lt;br&gt;
::c. Go to &quot;/usr/lib/jvm&quot; folder using Terminal as root:&lt;br&gt;
 cd /usr/lib/jvm
::d. Check is the package there:&lt;br&gt;
 ls
::e. Install it typing &quot;yes&quot; on the end of the licence:&lt;br&gt;
 sh jre-version-linux-i586.bin
::f. Create Java plug-in symbolic link to web browser plug-in folder:&lt;br&gt;
 cd /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
 ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-version/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
::g. You can make symbolic link using Midnight Commander, just mark &quot;libjavaplugin_oji.so&quot; and then choose&lt;br&gt;
:: File tab-&gt; SymLink to &quot;/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins&quot; folder. 
[[File:Java1en.png|center|550px]]


== OpenJava ==
: Open source Java version installation:&lt;br&gt;
 apt-get install openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre-lib
: and it's web browser plug-in:&lt;br&gt;
 apt-get install icedtea6-plugin


== Verification ==
: After installation you can check is your Java installed correctly or is the latest version: [http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp java.com]

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), the '''chemical shift''' describes the dependence of nuclear magnetic energy levels on the electronic environment in a [[molecule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spectrometric Identification of organic Compounds'' Silverstein, Bassler, Morrill 4th Ed. ISBN 047109700&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Spectroscopy'' William Kemp 3th Ed. ISBN 0333417674 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Basic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H - &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR spectroscopy'' Metin Balei ISBN 0444518118&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical shifts are relevant in [[NMR spectroscopy]] techniques such  [[proton NMR]] and [[carbon-13 NMR]].
 
An atomic nucleus can have a magnetic moment ([[nuclear spin]]), which gives rise to different energy levels and [[resonance]] frequencies in a [[magnetic field]]. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of the same type of nucleus (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, ...), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also ''chemical shift referencing''), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.
 
The chemical shift is of great importance for [[NMR spectroscopy]], a technique to explore molecular properties by looking at [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] phenomena.


==Operating frequency==
The operating frequency [[Omega|ω]] of a magnet is calculated from the [[Larmor equation]]
 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{0} = \gamma * B_0\,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the actual strength of the magnet in units like [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] or [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], and [[Gamma|γ]] is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the nucleus being tested which is in turn calculated from its [[magnetic moment]] [[Mu|μ]] and [[spin number]] I with the [[nuclear magneton]] μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[Planck constant]] h:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\mu\,\mu_N}{hI}\,&lt;/math&gt; 
 
Thus, the proton operating frequency for a 7 [[Tesla|T]] magnet is calculated as:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{0} = \frac{2.79*5.050\,10^{-27}\,J/T}{6.62\,10^{-34}\,J\cdot s*1/2}*7\,T*10^{-6}\, = 297 MHz\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Chemical shift referencing==
Chemical shift [[Delta (letter)|δ]] is usually expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) by [[frequency]], because it is calculated from: 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{\mbox{difference in precession frequency between two nuclei}}{\mbox{operating frequency of the magnet}}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Since the numerator is usually in [[hertz]], and the denominator in [[megahertz]], delta is expressed in ppm. 
 
The detected frequencies (in Hz) for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si nuclei are usually referenced against TMS ([[tetramethylsilane]]), which is assigned the chemical shift of zero.  Other standard materials are used for setting the chemical shift for other nuclei.
 
Thus, an NMR signal at 300 Hz from TMS at an applied frequency of 300MHz has a chemical shift of:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{300Hz}{300*10^6Hz}=1*10^{-6}= 1\,ppm \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although the frequency depends on the applied field the chemical shift is independent of it. On the other hand the resolution of NMR will increase with applied magnetic field resulting in ever increasing chemical shift changes.

==The induced magnetic field==
The electrons around a nucleus will circulate in a magnetic field and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by [[Lenz's law]] and the nucleus is therefore said to be '''shielded'''. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.
   
Nuclei are found to resonate in a wide range to the left (or more rare to the right) of the internal standard. When a signal is found with a higher chemical shift:
* the applied effective magnetic field is lower, if the resonance frequency is fixed, (as in old traditional CW spectrometers)
* the frequency is higher, when the applied magnetic field is static, (normal case in FT spectrometers)
* the nucleus is more deshielded
* the signal or shift is '''downfield''' or at '''low field''' or paramagnetic
 
Conversely a lower chemical shift is called a '''diamagnetic shift''', and is '''upfield''' and more shielded.

==Factors causing chemical shifts==
Important factors influencing chemical shift are electron density, [[electronegativity]] of neighboring groups and anisotropic induced magnetic field effects. 

Electron density shields a nucleus from the external field. For example in proton NMR the electron-poor [[tropylium]] ion has its protons downfield at 9.17 ppm, those of the electron-rich [[cyclooctatetraenyl]] anion move upfield to 6.75 ppm and its dianion even more upfield to 5.56 ppm.

A nucleus in the vicinity of an [[electronegative]] atom experiences reduced electron density and the nucleus is therefore deshielded. In [[proton NMR]] of [[alkyl halide|methyl halides]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;X) the chemical shift of the methyl protons increase in the order I &gt; Br &gt; Cl &gt; F from 2.16 ppm to 4.26 ppm reflecting this trend. In [[carbon NMR]] the chemical shift of the carbon nuclei increase in the same order from around -10 ppm to 70 ppm. Also when the electronegative atom is removed further away the effect diminishes until it can be observed no longer.  
 
[[Anisotropic]] induced magnetic field effects are the result of a local induced magnetic field experienced by a nucleus resulting from circulating electrons that can either be paramagnetic when it is parallel to the applied field or diamagnetic when it is opposed to it. It is observed in [[alkene]]s where the double bond is oriented perpendicular to the external field with pi electrons likewise circulating at right angles. The induced magnetic field lines are parallel to the external field at the location of the alkene protons which therefore shift downfield to a 4.5 ppm - 7.5 ppm range. The three-dimensional space where a nucleus experiences diamagnetic shift is called the shielding zone with a cone-like shape aligned with the external field.   

:[[Image:NMR alkenes.png|400px|Induced magnetic field of alkenes in external magnetic fields, field lines in grey]]

The protons in [[aromatic]] compounds are shifted downfield even further with a signal for [[benzene]] at 7.73 ppm as a consequence of a [[diamagnetic ring current]]. 

[[Alkyne]] protons by contrast resonate at high field in a 2-3 ppm range. For alkynes the most effective orientation in the external field in parallel with electrons circulation around the triple bond. In this way the acetylenic protons are located in the cone-shaped shielding zone hence the upfield shift.

==Magnetic properties of most common nuclei==
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C aren't the only nuclei susceptible to NMR experiments. A number of different nuclei can also be detected, although the use of such techniques is generally rare due to small relative sensitivities in NMR experiments (compared to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) of the nuclei in question, the other factor for rare use being their slender representation in nature/organic compounds.

CIDNP (Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), often pronounced like &quot;kidnap&quot;, is a non-Boltzmann nuclear spin state distribution produced in thermal or photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or disproportionation of radical pairs, and detected by NMR spectroscopy as enhanced absorption or emission signals. CIDNP was discovered in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found that in many cases DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied on the ability of nuclear spin interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the Radical Pair Mechanism is currently accepted as the most common cause of CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.

==Radical Pair Mechanism==

The generation of CIDNP in a typical photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and approximately half of the molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.



The radical pair may either cross over to a singlet electron state and then recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two pathways for a given radical pair depends on the nuclear spin state and leads to the nuclear spin state sorting and observable nuclear polarization.

==Applications==

Detected as enhanced absorptive or emissive signals in the NMR spectra of the reaction products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this '''photo-CIDNP technique''', as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains.

Although usually observed in liquids, the photo-CIDNP effect has also been detected in solid state, for example on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei in photosynthetic reaction centres, where significant nuclear polarization can accumulate as a result of spin selection processes in the electron transfer reactions.

'''Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy''', also called Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy (CARS), is a form of [[spectroscopy]] used primarily in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related fields. It is sensitive to the same vibrational signatures of molecules as seen in [[Raman spectroscopy]], typically the nuclear vibrations of chemical bonds. Unlike Raman spectroscopy, CARS employs multiple photons to address the molecular vibrations, and produces a signal in which the emitted waves are coherent with one another. As a result, CARS is orders of magnitude stronger than spontaneous Raman emission. CARS is a third-order [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] process involving three [[laser]] beams: a pump beam of frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] beam of frequency 
ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and a probe beam at frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;. These beams interact with the sample and generate a coherent optical signal at the [[anti-Stokes]] frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference between the pump and the Stokes beams (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) coincides with the frequency of a [[Raman resonance]], which is the basis of the technique's intrinsic [[vibrational contrast mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Review of the Theory and Application of Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sas/sas/1977/00000031/00000004/art00001 Applied Spectroscopy, Volume 31, Number 4, July/August 1977, pp. 253-271(19)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering: from
proof-of-the-principle experiments to femtosecond CARS and higher order wave-mixing generalizations [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/73500427/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, Volume 31, Issue 8-9 , pp. 653 - 667]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The acronym CARS, which invokes a seemingly inadvertent relation to automobiles, is actually closely related to the birth story of the technique. In 1965, a paper was published by two researchers of the Scientific Laboratory at the [[Ford Motor Company]], P. D. Maker and R. W. Terhune, in which the CARS phenomenon was reported for the first time.&lt;ref&gt; Study of Optical Effects Due to an Induced Polarization Third Order in the Electric Field Strength [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v137/i3A/pA801_1 Physical Review, Volume 137, Issue 3A, pp. 801-818]&lt;/ref&gt;  Maker and Terhune used a pulsed ruby laser to investigate the third order response of several materials. They first passed the ruby beam of frequency ω through a [[Raman shifter]] to create a second beam at ω-ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and then directed the two beams simultaneously onto the sample. When the pulses from both beams overlapped in space and time, the Ford researchers observed a signal at ω+ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the blue-shifted CARS signal. They also demonstrated that the signal increases significantly when the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; between the incident beams matches a Raman frequency of sample. Maker and Terhune called their technique simply 'three wave mixing experiments'. The name coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy was assigned almost ten years later, by Begley et al. at Stanford University in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000025000007000387000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Applied Physics Letters, Volume 25, Issue 7 , pp. 387-390]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this vibrationally sensitive nonlinear optical technique is commonly known as CARS.

==Principle==
[[Image:CARS diagram.png|thumb|right|250 px|CARS energy diagram]]
The CARS process can be physically explained by using either a classical [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillator]] model or by using a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) [[harmonic oscillator]] with a characteristic frequency of ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the difference frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low combination tone when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the difference frequency of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the difference frequency of two optical waves. When the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the [[refractive index]] of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the probe beam. When the probe beam is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt; will now get modified to ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the probe beam, and can be detected in a separate direction.

While intuitive, this classical picture does not take into account the quantum mechanical energy levels of the molecule. Quantum mechanically, the CARS process can be  understood as follows. Our molecule is initially in the [[Stationary state|ground state]], the lowest energy state of the molecule. The pump beam excites the molecule to a [[Virtual State (physics)|Virtual State]]. A [[virtual state]] is not an [[eigenstate]] of the molecule and it can not be occupied but it does allow for transitions between otherwise uncoupled real states. If a Stokes beam is simultaneously present along with the pump, the [[virtual state]] can be used as an instantaneous gateway to address a vibrational eigenstate of the molecule. The joint action of the pump and the Stokes has effectively established a coupling between the ground state and the vibrationally excited state of the molecule. The molecule is now in two states at the same time: it resides in a coherent [[superposition]] of states. This coherence between the states can be probed by the probe beam, which promotes the system to a virtual state. Again, the molecule cannot stay in the virtual state and will fall back instantaneously to the ground state under the emission of a photon at the anti-Stokes frequency. The molecule is no longer in a superposition, as it resides again in one state, the ground state. In the quantum mechanical model, no energy is deposited in the molecule during the CARS process. Instead, the molecule acts like a medium for converting the frequencies of the three incoming waves into a CARS signal (a parametric process). There are, however, related coherent Raman process that occur simultaneously which do deposit energy into the molecule.

==Comparison to Raman spectroscopy==
CARS is often compared to Raman spectroscopy as both techniques probe the same Raman active modes. Raman can be done using a single continuous wave (CW) laser whereas CARS requires (generally) two pulsed laser sources. The Raman signal is detected on the red side of the incoming radiation where it might have to compete with other fluorescent processes. The CARS signal is detected on the blue side, which is free from fluorescence, but it comes with a non-resonant contribution. 
The differences between the signals from Raman and CARS (there are many variants of both techniques) stems largely from the fact that Raman relies on a spontaneous transition whereas CARS relies on a coherently driven transition. The total Raman signal collected from a sample is the incoherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. It is therefore linear in the concentration of those molecules and the signal is emitted in all directions. The total CARS signal comes from a coherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. For the coherent addition to be additive, phase-matching must be fulfilled. For tight focusing conditions this is generally not a restriction. Once phase-matching is fulfilled the signal amplitude grows linear with distance so that the power grows quadratically. This signal forms a collimated beam that is therefore easily collected. The fact that the CARS signal is quadratic in the distance makes it quadratic with respect to the concentration and therefore especially sensitive to the majority constituent. The total CARS signal also contains an inherent non-resonant background. This non-resonant signal can be considered as the result of (several) far off-resonance transitions that also add coherently. The resonant amplitude contains a phase shift of Pi over the resonance whereas the non-resonant part does not. The spectral line shape of the CARS intensity therefore resembles a Fano-profile which is shifted with respect to the Raman signal. To compare the spectra from multi-component compounds, the (resonant) CARS spectral amplitude should be compared to the Raman spectral intensity. 

Theoretically Raman spectroscopy and CARS spectroscopy are equally sensitive as they use the same molecular transitions. However, given the limits on input power (damage threshold) and detector noise (integration time), the signal from a single transition can be collected much faster in practical situation (a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) using CARS. Imaging of known substances (known spectra) is therefore often done using CARS. 
Given the fact that CARS is a higher order nonlinear process, the CARS signal from a single molecule is larger than the Raman signal from a single molecule for a sufficiently high driving intensity. However at very low concentrations, the advantages of the coherent addition for CARS signal reduces and the presence of the incoherent background becomes an increasing problem. 

Since CARS is such a nonlinear process there are not really any 'typical' experimental numbers. One example is given below under the explicit warning that just changing the pulse duration by one order of magnitude changes the CARS signal by three orders of magnitude. The comparison should only be used as an indication of the order of magnitude of the signals. 200 mW average power input (CW for the Raman), in a 0.9NA objective with a center wavelength around 800&amp;nbsp;nm, constitutes a power density of 26 MW/cm,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (focal length = 1.5 micrometre, focal volume = 1.16 micrometre&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, photon energy = 2.31 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J or 1.44 eV). The Raman cross section for the vibration of the aromatic ring in Toluene around 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-29&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/molecule*steradian. Therefore the Raman signal is around 26 10&lt;sup&gt;-22&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule*steradian or 3.3 10&lt;sup&gt;-21&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule (over 4Pi). That is 0.014 photon/sec*molecule. The density of Toluene = 0.8668 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Molecular mass = 92.14 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/mol. Therefore the focal volume (~1 cubic micrometre) contains 6 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules. Those molecules together generate a Raman signal in the order of 2 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; W (20pW) or roughly one hundred million photons/sec (over a 4Pi solid angle). A CARS experiment with similar parameters (150 mW at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm, 200 mW at 803.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 15ps pulses at 80Mhz repetition frequency, same objective lens) yields roughly 17.5 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; W (on the 3000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; line, which has 1/3 of the strength and roughly 3 times the width). This CARS power is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; higher than the Raman but since there are 6 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules, the signal per molecule from CARS is only 4 10&lt;sup&gt;-25&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule*sec or 1.7 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; photons/molecule*sec. If we allow for two factors of three (line strength and line width) than the spontaneous Raman signal per molecule still exceeds the CARS per molecule by a more than two orders of magnitude. The coherent addition of the CARS signal from the molecules however yields a total signal that is much higher than the Raman.

The sensitivity in many CARS experiments is not limited by the detection of CARS photons but rather by the distinction between the resonant and non-resonant part of the CARS signal.

==Applications==

CARS is used for species selective microscopy and combustion diagnostics. The first exploits the selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy whereas the latter is aimed at temperature measurements; the CARS signal is temperature dependent. The strength of the signal scales (non-linearly) with the difference in the ground state population and the vibrationally excited state population. Since the population of states follows the temperature dependent [[Boltzmann Distribution]], the CARS signal carries an intrinsic temperature dependence as well. This temperature dependence makes CARS a popular technique for monitoring the temperature of hot gases and flames.

The '''Collaborative Computing Project for NMR''' (CCPN) is a project that aims to bring together computational aspects of the  scientific community involved in [[NMR spectroscopy]], especially those who work in the field of [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]]. The general aims are to link new and existing NMR software via a common data standard and provide a forum within the community for the discussion of NMR software and the scientific methods it supports. CCPN was initially started in 1999 in the [[United Kingdom]] but collaborates with NMR and software development groups worldwide.

==The Collaborative Project for the NMR Community==
The Collaborative Computing project for [[NMR spectroscopy]]  was set up in with three main aims; to create a common standard for representing NMR spectroscopy related data, to create a suite of new open-source NMR software packages and to arrange meetings for the NMR community, including conferences, workshops and courses in order to discuss and spread best-practice within the NMR community, for both computational and non-computational aspects. Primary financial support for CCPN comes from the BBSRC; the UK [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]]. CCPN is part of an array of collaborative computing projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccp.ac.uk/ BBSRC Collaborative Computational Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; (CCP) and follows in a similar vein to the successful and well-established [[Collaborative Computational Project Number 4|CCP4]] project for [[X-ray crystallography]]. CCPN is also supported by [[European Union]] grants, most recently as part of the Extend-NMR project;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extend-nmr.eu The Extend-NMR project]&lt;/ref&gt; which links together several software producing groups from across Europe.

CCPN is governed by an executive committee which draws its members from academics throughout the UK NMR community. This committee is chosen at the CCPN Assembly Meeting where all UK based NMR groups may participate and vote. The day-to-day work of CCPN, including the organisation of meetings and software development, is handled by an informal working group, coordinated by Ernest Laue at the [[University of Cambridge]], which comprises the core group of staff and developers, as well as a growing number of collaborators throughout the world who contribute to coordinated NMR software development.

==NMR Data Standards==
The many different software packages available to the [[NMR spectroscopy]] community have traditionally employed a number of different data [[File format|formats]] and standards to represent computational information. The inception of CCPN was partly to look at this situation and to develop a more unified approach. It was deemed that multiple, informally connected data standards not only made it more difficult for a user to move from one program to the next, but also adversely affected data fidelity, harvesting and database deposition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The CCPN project: an interim report on a data model for the NMR community.&quot; (2002) ''Nat Struct Biol''.  '''9'''(6):416-8&lt;/ref&gt; To this end CCPN has developed a common data standard for NMR, referred to as the CCPN data model, as well as software routines and libraries that allow access, manipulation and storage of the data. The CCPN system works alongside the Bio Mag Res Bank&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ Bio Mag Res Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to handle archiving NMR database depositions; the CCPN standard is for active data exchange and in-program manipulation.

Although NMR spectroscopy remains at the core of the data standard it naturally expands into other related areas of science that support and complement NMR. These include [[Molecule|molecular]] and [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] description, three-dimensional [[Structural biology|biological structures]], sample preparation, [[workflow]] management and software setup. The CCPN libraries are created using the principles of [[model-driven architecture]] and [[Automatic programming|automatic code generation]]; the CCPN data model provides a specification for the automatic generation of [[Application programming interface|APIs]] in multiple languages. To date CCPN provides APIs to its data model in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] programming languages. Through its collaborations, CCPN continues to link new and existing software via its data standards. To enable interaction with as much external software as possible, CCPN has created a format conversion program. This allows data to enter from outside the CCPN scheme and provides a mechanism to translate between existing data formats. The open-source CcpNmr FormatConverter software was first released in 2005 and is available for download (from CCPN and [[SourceForge]]) but is also recently accessible as a [[web application]].

==CCPN Software Suite==
[[Image:CCPN Hncoca.png|thumb|right|150px|Three dimensional protein [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR spectra]] viewed with CCPN software. The illustrated spectra are from [[HNCOCA experiment|HNcoCA]] and [[HNCA experiment|HNCA]] experiments; used here to assign the sequence of [[amino acid]]s in a [[protein]] chain. ]]

As well as enabling data exchange, CCPN aims to develop software for processing, analysis and interpretation of [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] NMR data. To this end CCPN has created CcpNmr Analysis; a graphical program for spectrum visualisation, assignment and NMR data analysis. Here, the requirement was for a program that used a modern [[graphical user interface]] and could run on many types of computer. It would be supported and maintained by CCPN and would allow modification and extension, including for new NMR techniques. The first version of Analysis was released in 2005 and is now at version 2.1. Analysis is built directly on the CCPN data model and its design is partly inspired by the older ANSIG.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Kraulis, &quot;ANSIG: A Program for the Assignment of Protein 1H 2D NMR spectra by Interactive Graphics&quot; (1989) ''J. Magn. Reson'' 24, pp 627-633&lt;/ref&gt;  and SPARKY&lt;ref&gt;T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; programs, but it has continued to develop from the suggestions, requirements and computational contributions of its user community. Analysis is freely available to academic and non-profit institutions. Commercial users are required to subscribe to CCPN for a moderate fee. CCPN software, including Analysis, is available for download at the CCPN web site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/ccpn/software/downloads-v2/ CCPN Downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by an active [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] email discussion group.

==CCPN Meetings==
Through its meetings CCPN provides a forum for the discussion of computational and experimental NMR techniques. The aim is to debate and spread best practice in the determination of macromolecular information, including structure, dynamics and biological chemistry. CCPN continues to arrange annual conferences for the UK NMR community (the current being the ninth) and a series of workshops to discuss and promote data standards. Because it is vital to the success of CCPN as a software project and as a coordinated NMR community, its software developers run courses to teach the use of CCPN software and its development framework. They also arrange visits to NMR groups to introduce the CCPN program suite and to gain an understanding of the requirements of users.

CCPN is especially keen to enable young scientists to contribute to and attend its meetings. Accordingly, wherever possible CCPN tries to keep conference fees at a minimum by using contributions that come from our industrial sponsorship and software subscriptions.

The DRC is characterized by the following parameters, that can be modified: RPq (the corresponding q parameter from the Mathieu equation), RPa (the corresponding a parameter from the Mathieu equation), which refer to the voltage applied to the quadrupole rods and the gas flow of the reaction gas.

Ammonia gas is the best solution for the majority of interferences, but it is far for being the perfect gas. Sometimes, for specific isotopes, other gas must be used for better results or even mathematical correction, if no gas offers a satisfactory advantage.

==Collisional reaction interface (CRI)==
The proprietary collisional reaction interface (CRI)  &lt;ref&gt; I. Kalinitchenko, Patent Application under the Patents Cooperation Treaty WO 2004/012223 A1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Wang'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.varianinc.com/image/vimage/docs/products/spectr/icpms/articles/adv_note_1.pdf |title=Principles and performance of the Collision Reaction Interface for the |accessdate=2009-01-20 |last=Wang |first=XueDong |coauthors=Iouri Kalinitchenko |format=PDF |publisher=Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the Bruker ICP-MS  destroying interfering ions. These ions are removed by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. Supplying the reactive/collisional gas into the tip of the skimmer cone and/or into the tip of the sampler cone induces extra collisions and reactions that destroy polyatomic ions in the passing plasma.

==Axial field technology==
Axial field technology (AFT) is a patented improvement of DRC made by Perkin-Elmer, which consists in two supplementary rods placed in the DRC cell, smaller than normal quadrupole's rods, with the purpose of &quot;pushing&quot; the ions faster to the exit by generating a supplementary electric potential, minimizing the time needed for the gas to be in the DRC and improving analysis speed. The suplimetary potential of the AFT rods does not contribute significantly to the global energy, but drastically improve ion passage time.

==Collision cell technology with kinetic energy discrimination==
Thermo Scientific's XSeries2 instrument utilizes a collision/reaction cell for interference removal, consisting of a non-consumable hexapole and chicane ion deflector, which takes the ion beam off-axis and leads to low instrument backgrounds of &lt;0.5 integrated counts per second (icps) at vacant masses such as 5 and 220.  This hexapole is inherently part of the Thermo lens system and is present in the ion path, regardless of the use of the collision cell.  The collision/reaction gas mixtures can be 1% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in He, 7% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in He and 100% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are reactive gasses and the He is a collisional gas.  The 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; generation cell utilizes kinetic energy discrimination, which employes running the quadrupole bias slightly less negative (more positive) than the hexopole bias. Polyatomic ions generated within the plasma can have larger atomic radii than analyte ions of similar mass, i.e. the interferent NaAr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (mass 63) is larger than the analyte Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (mass 63). Thus, when using a collisional/reactive gas mixture, these larger species undergo more collisions/reactions in the cell, in which they lose increasingly more energy, and are then excluded from the quadrupole mass filter by the kinetic energy barrier.

==Octopole reaction system==
Another implementation of this type of interference removal is an octopole (instead of a quadrupole) collision cell, implemented by Agilent's 7500 series. The octopole reaction system (ORS)) uses only helium or hydrogen and the volume of the cell is smaller than that of a DRC. The small molecules of helium and hydrogen collide with the large, unwanted polyatomic ions formed in the plasma and break them up into other ions that can be separated in the quadrupole mass analyser. However, unlike the DRC the OCR system is based only on collision reactions and not on chemical reactions.

'''Collisional excitation''' is a process in which the [[translational energy]] of a collision partner is converted into the [[internal energy]] of a reactant species.

==Astronomy==
In astronomy, collisional excitation gives rise to [[spectral line]]s in the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[astronomical object]]s such as [[planetary nebula]]e and [[H II region]]s.

In these objects, most [[atom]]s are [[ionisation|ionised]] by [[photon]]s from hot [[star]]s embedded within the nebular [[gas]], stripping away [[electrons]]. The emitted electrons, (called [[photoelectron]]s), may collide with atoms or ions within the gas, and [[excitation|excite]] them.  When these excited atoms or ions revert to their [[ground state]], they will emit a photon.  The spectral lines formed by these photons are called ''collisionally excited lines'' (often abbreviated to CELs).

CELs are only seen in gases at very low densities (typically less than a few thousand particles per cm³).  At higher densities, the reverse process of '''collisional de-excitation''' suppresses the lines.  Even the hardest [[vacuum]] produced on earth is still too dense for CELs to be observed.  For this reason, when CELs were first observed by [[William Huggins]] in the spectrum of the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], he did not know what they were, and attributed them to a hypothetical new element called ''Nebulium''.  However, the lines he observed were later found to be emitted by extremely rarefied [[oxygen]].

CELs are very important in the study of gaseous nebulae, because they can be used to determine the density and temperature of the gas.

==Mass spectrometry==
Collisional excitation in mass spectrometry is the process where an ion collides with an atom or molecule and leads to an increase in the internal energy of the ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=collisional excitation|file=C01159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular ions are accelerated to high kinetic energy and then collide with neutral gas molecules (e.g. helium, nitrogen or argon). In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy which results in fragmentation in a process known as collision-induced dissociation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consolidated Engineering Corporation was a chemical instrument manufacturer from 1937 to 1960 when it became a subsidiary of Böwe Bell &amp; Howell.

==History==
CEC was founded in 1937 by Herbert Hoover, Jr. as sole proprietor.  Dr. Harold Washburn was hired in 1938 as VP for Research, with a mandate to develop instruments applicable to petroleum prospecting.

Mr. Hoover was trained as a mining engineer and Dr. Washburn had a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.   His thesis Professor was E.O. Lawrence, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.  Four physicists from California Institute of Technology were hired into the Research Dept. in a project to develop a mass spectrometer.  The initial product was the 21-101 Mass Spectrometer delivered in December 1942, installed in early 1943, initial price $12,000, with no options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reminiscences of the early days of mass spectrometry in the petroleum|journal=Organic Mass Spectrometry|year=1986|first=Seymour|last=Meyerson|coauthors=|volume=21|issue=4|pages=197–208|doi= 10.1002/oms.1210210406|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110438931/ABSTRACT|format=|accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CEC_103C_HRes'&gt; {{Citation| first=Charles | last=Judson| coauthors=| contribution=Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation CEC 100 Series mass Spectrometers| title=American Society for Mass Spectrometry| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.asms.org/portals/0/CEC_103C_HRes.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Consolidated MS.gif|thumb|left|300 px|Consolidated Engineering Corporation Mass Spectrometer, Patent 2341551]]

CEC became a publicly held corporation in 1945, with Mr. Hoover selling all of his stock.  Philip Fogg became President.  The name changed to Consolidated Electrodynamics Corp. in 1955, because some states required that a service engineer for an engineering company be a licensed engineer in that state.  

The mass spectrometer products and other analytical instrument products were separated from other product lines in a “Chemical Instruments” marketing department sometime between 1945 and 1948 with Harold Wiley as Manager for Chemical Instruments. The Chemical Instruments Department became the Analytical and Control Division in about 1959 with Harold Wiley as General Manager.  This name was later changed to the Analytical Instruments Div.    

CEC became a subsidiary of Bell and Howell Corp. in 1960.  In 1968 the CEC Corporation was dissolved and CEC became the Electronics Instrument Group of Bell and Howell. In the mid-1970s the Analytical Instruments Div. of Bell and Howell was sold to the Instrument Div. of duPont.

Over the years, mass spectrometry proved to be a widely used and powerful analytical technique and a variety of laboratory instruments became available from several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grayson, Michael A. |title=Measuring mass: from positive rays to proteins |publisher=Chemical Heritage Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-941901-31-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DuPont abandoned the analytical instruments business in the late 1970s, however, CEC’s mass spectrometer heritage did not end there.

In the mid-1950s, CEC had split off a subsidiary, Consolidated Systems Corporation, to produce custom instruments and systems.  Lawrence G. Hall carried CEC mass spectrometer know-how to CSC and led their team to put the first mass spectrometer in space on a National Aeronautics and Space Administration upper atmosphere research satellite, Explorer 17, in 1963.  Nine more satellites and the Pioneer Venus spacecraft carried CSC magnetic sector and quadrupole mass spectrometer analyzers built for NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Empirical Model of Global Thermospheric Temperature and Composition Based on Data From the Ogo 6 Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer|journal= J.

In 1967, this business became Perkin-Elmer Corporation’s Applied Sciences Division, located in Pomona, CA. ASD mass spectrometers monitored the respiratory function of returning Apollo astronauts and were evaluated in NASA and U.S. Navy test programs for manned atmosphere monitoring.   They were deployed on Skylab (the first U.S. space laboratory),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Skylab experiment M-171, Metabolic Activity: results of the first manned mission|journal=Acta Astronautica|year=1975|first=E.L.|last=Michel|coauthors= J.A.

In the early 1970’s, General Manager Bliss M. Bushman led ASD’s expansion as a manufacturer of mass spectrometer-based submarine atmosphere monitors and commercial products. Their Central Atmosphere Monitoring System, now in its third generation, has been standard equipment on U.S. Navy submarines for over three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=No More Loose Fillings Or Slow Embalming.

They are deployed in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, steel and oil refining industires, among others.

ASD became Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Sensor Systems Division in 1993 and developed the Major Constituent Analyzer for the International Space Station's atmosphere. SSD was sold again in 2001, becoming Hamilton Sundstrand Space, Land and Sea, Pomona Site, a few months after SSD's MCA began continuous on-orbit operation aboard Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Space Station (ISS) Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) On-Orbit Performance|journal=SAE International Journal of Aerospace |year=2009|first= Souzan|last=Maleki Thoresen|coauthors=George Steiner, John Granahan|volume=1|issue=1|pages=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pomona Site is updating and expanding the MCA for Orion, NASA’s new manned spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Orion Air Monitor; an Optimized Analyzer for Environmental Control and Life Support|journal=SAE International Journal of Aerospace |year=2009|first= David E.|last= Burchfield|coauthors=William Niu, George Steiner|volume=1|issue=1|pages=201–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Pomona Site developed an ion trap mass spectrometer chemical detection system for chemical warfare agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Spectrometer Can Detect Weapons of Mass Destruction|journal=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review|year=2000|first|last=|coauthors=|volume=33|issue=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these units are now being deployed on U.S. Army reconnaissance vehicles.   When fitted for bio-aerosol sampling, CBMS II has also demonstrated effective biological warfare agent detection.

To this day, Hamilton Sundstrand Pomona Site continues the heritage of CEC, the company that pioneered the development and sale of mass spectrometers for chemical analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) is one of several types of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  Other types of two-dimensional NMR include J-spectroscopy, exchange spectroscopy (EXSY), and Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY).  Two-dimensional NMR spectra provide more information about a molecule than one-dimensional NMR spectra and are especially useful in determining the structure of a molecule, particularly for molecules that are too complicated to work with using one-dimensional NMR.  The first two-dimensional experiment, COSY, was proposed by Jean Jeener, a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, in 1971.  This experiment was later implemented by Walter P. Aue, Enrico Bartholdi and Richard R. Ernst, who published their work in 1976.&lt;!-- {{ref|2D_NMR}} --&gt;

== Principles ==
A two-dimensional NMR experiment involves a series of one-dimensional experiments.  Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.  It is the timing, frequencies, and intensities of these pulses that distinguish different NMR experiments from one another.  During some of the delays, the nuclear spins are allowed to freely precess (rotate) for a determined length of time known as the '''evolution time'''.  The frequencies of the nuclei are detected after the final pulse.  By incrementing the evolution time in successive experiments, a two-dimensional data set is generated from a series of one-dimensional experiments.&lt;!-- {{ref|2D_NMR_time_incrementation}} --&gt;

An example of a two-dimension NMR experiment is the homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) sequence, which consists of a pulse (p1) followed by an evolution time (t1) followed by a second pulse (p2) followed by a measurement time (t2).  A computer is used to compile the spectra as a function of the evolution time (t1).  Finally, the Fourier transform is used to convert the time-dependent signals into a two-dimensional spectrum.

The two-dimensional spectrum that results from the COSY experiment shows the frequencies for a single isotope (usually hydrogen, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) along both axes.  (Techniques have also been devised for generating heteronuclear correlation spectra, in which the two axes correspond to different isotopes, such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.)  The intensities of the peaks in the spectrum can be represented using a third dimension.  More commonly, intensity is indicated using contours or different colors.  The spectrum is interpreted starting from the diagonal, which consists of a series of peaks.  The peaks that appear off of the diagonal are called cross-peaks.  The cross-peaks are symmetrical (both above and below) along the diagonal and indicate which hydrogen atoms are spin-spin coupled to each other.  One can determine which atoms are connected to one another by only a few chemical bonds by matching the center of a cross-peak with the center of each of two corresponding diagonal peaks.   The peaks on the diagonal when matched with cross-peaks are coupled to each other.

For example:  a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule 2-butanone would show three peaks on the diagonal, due to the three distinct hydrogen groups.  By drawing a line straight down from a cross-peak to the point on the diagonal directly above or below it, and then drawing a line from the cross-peak directly across to another peak on the diagonal, one can determine which peaks are coupled.  This is done in such a way that the lines from the cross-peak form a 90° angle between the two peaks on the diagonal. The matching peaks, as determined by using the cross-peaks, indicate which hydrogens are coupled, giving a clearer understanding of the structure of the molecule under examination.

[[Image:progesteroneCOSY.png|300px|right|thumb|2D proton-COSY experiment on Progesterone]] 

To the right is an example of a COSY NMR spectrum of progesterone in DMSO-d6.  The spectrum that appears along both the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axes is a regular one dimensional &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H NMR spectrum.  The COSY is read along the diagonal - where the bulk of the peaks appear.  Cross-peaks appear symmetrically above and below the diagonal.

== COSY NMR ==
COSY-90 is the most common COSY experiment.  In COSY-90, the sample is irradiated with a radio frequency pulse, p1, which tilts the nuclear spin by 90°. After p1, the sample is allowed to freely precess during an evolution period (t1). A second 90° pulse, p2, is then applied, after which the experimental data are acquired. This is done repeatedly using a series of different evolution periods (t1). At the conclusion of data acquisition the data is Fourier transformed in each dimension to generate the two dimensional spectrum. It is only because the evolution period is varied that cross-peaks appear in the spectrum.

[[Image:Pulsefrequency1.png|400px|right|thumb|In COSY NMR, the resonance signal from the sample is read in period t2 following two experimental magnetic pulses p1 and p2 separated by a variable period t1.]]

Cross-peaks result from a phenomenon called '''magnetization transfer'''. Depending on the experiment, this transfer can be achieved through space or bonds, or even through chemical or physical means.  In COSY, magnetization transfer occurs through the bonds.  

Another member of the COSY family is '''COSY-45'''.  In COSY-45 a 45° pulse is used instead of a 90° pulse for the first pulse, p1.  The advantage of a COSY-45 is that the diagonal-peaks are less pronounced, making it simpler to match cross-peaks near the diagonal in a large molecule.  Additionally, the relative signs of the coupling constants can be elucidated from a COSY-45 spectrum.  This is not possible using COSY-90.{{ref|COSY45_vs_COSY90}}  Overall, the COSY-45 offers a cleaner spectrum while the COSY-90 is more sensitive.  Related COSY techniques include double quantum filtered COSY and multiple quantum filtered COSY.

COSY NMR has useful applications.  Organic chemists often use COSY to elucidate structural data on molecules that are not satisfactorily represented in a one-dimensional NMR spectrum.  Using cross-peaks, along with the diagonal spectrum, one can often discover much about the structure of an unknown molecule.

== NOESY ==
In NOESY, the Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between nuclear spins is used to establish the correlations.
Hence the cross-peaks in the resulting two-dimensional spectrum connect resonances from spins that are spatially close.  NOESY spectra from large biomolecules can often be assigned using Sequential Walking.

The NOESY experiment can also be performed in a one-dimensional fashion by pre-selecting individual resonances. The spectra are read with the pre-selected nuclei giving a large, negative signal while neighboring nuclei are identified by weaker, positive signals.   This only reveals which peaks have measurable NOEs to the resonance of interest but obviously takes much less time than the full 2D experiment. In addition, if a pre-selected nucleus changes environment within the time scale of the experiment, multiple negative signals may be observed. This offers exchange information similar to EXSY (i.e. exchange spectroscopy) NMR spectroscopy.

== HMBC &amp; HMQC ==
HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) and HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence) are 2D inverse correlation techniques that allow for the determination of connectivity between two different nuclear species. HMQC is selective for direct coupling and HMBC gives longer range couplings (2-4 bond coupling).

'''3''', ''31'', 264-267 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after its inventor Norman Richard Daly. Daly detectors are typically used in mass spectrometers.

==How it works==
Ions that hit the doorknob release secondary electrons. A high voltage (ca. -20,000 V) between the doorknob and the scintillator accelerates the electrons onto the phosphor screen where they are converted to photons. These photons are detected by the photomultiplier.

The advantage of the Daly detector is that the photomultiplier can be separated by a window, which lets the photons through from the high vacuum of the mass spectrometer, which an otherwise possible contamination prevented and which extends detector life span. The Daly detector also allows for a higher acceleration after the field free region of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer flight tube, which can improve the sensitivity for high mass ions.

'''Delayed extraction''' is a method used with a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] in which the accelerating voltage is applied after some short time delay following pulsed [[laser desorption/ionization]] from a flat surface of target plate or, in other implementation, pulsed  [[electron ionization]] or [[Resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization]] in some narrow space between two plates of the ion extraction system. The extraction delay can produce time-of-flight compensation for ion energy spread and improve [[mass resolution]].

== Implementation ==
Resolution can be improved in time-of-flight mass spectrometer with ions produced at high vacuum conditions (better than few microTorr) by allowing the initial packet ions to spread in space due to their translational energy before being accelerated into the flight tube. With ions produced by [[electron ionization]] or laser ionization of atoms or molecules from a rarefied gas, this is referred to as &quot;time-lag focusing&quot;&lt;ref name=Wiley1955&gt;{{citation | last = Wiley | first =  W.

M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a conductive surface of target plate, this is referred as  &quot;delayed extraction.&quot;

With delayed extraction, the [[mass resolution]] is improved due to the correlation between velocity and position of the ions after those have been produced in the ion source. Ions produced with greater [[kinetic energy]] have a higher [[velocity]] and during the delay time move closer to the extraction electrode before the accelerating voltage is applied across the target or pulsed electrode. The slower ions with less kinetic energy stay closer to a surface of the target electrode or pulsed electrode when the accelerating voltage is applied and therefore start being accelerated at a greater potential compared to the ions farther from the target electrode. With the proper delay time, the slower ions will receive enough extra potential energy to catch the faster ions after flying some distance from the pulsed acceleration system. Ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will then drift through the flight tube to the detector in the same time.

'''Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI)''' is an atmospheric-pressure ionization technique for mass spectrometry. DAPPI enables direct analysis of solid samples without pretreatment and analysis of samples deposited on surfaces by means of a jet of hot solvent vapour and vacuum ultraviolet light. The hot jet thermally desorbs the sample from a surface and the vaporized sample is ionized by the vacuum ultraviolet light and consequently sampled into a mass spectrometer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Arvola V, Kotiaho T, Ketola RA, Franssila S, Kauppila TJ, Kostiainen R |title=Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=79 |issue=20 |pages=7867–7872 |year=2007 |doi=10.1021/ac071152g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desorption and ionization mechanisms==
The main desorption mechanism in DAPPI is thermal desorption due to rapid heating of the surface. Therefore DAPPI only works well for surfaces of low thermal conductivity. The ionization mechanism depends on the analyte and solvent used and for example the following analyte (M) ions may be formed: [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [M - H]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;-•&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Luosujärvi L, Arvola V, Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Franssila S, Kotiaho T, Kostiainen R, Kauppila TJ |title=Desorption and Ionization Mechanisms in Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=80 |issue=19 |pages=7460–7466 |year=2008 |doi=10.1021/ac801186x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
DAPPI has the potential to analyze both polar (e.g. verapamil) and nonpolar (e.g. anthracene) compounds. Performance of DAPPI has also been demonstrated on direct analysis of illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kauppila TJ, Arvola V, Haapala M, Pól J, Aalberg L, Saarela V, Franssila S, Kotiaho T, Kostiainen R |title=Direct analysis of illicit drugs by desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization |journal=Rapid Commun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is an ambient ionization technique that can be used in mass spectrometry for chemical analysis.  It is an atmospheric pressure ion source that ionizes gases, liquids and solids in open air under ambient conditions.  It was developed in 2004 by Professor Graham Cooks ''et al.''. from Purdue University and is now available commercially by Prosolia Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Z. Takáts, J.M. Wiseman, B. Gologan, R.G. Cooks|title=Mass Spectrometry Sampling Under Ambient Conditions with Desorption Electrospray Ionization|journal=Science|volume=306|pages=471–473 |year=2004 |doi=10.1126/science.1104404 |pmid=15486296 |issue=5695}}&lt;/ref&gt; DESI is a similar ionization technique to Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) in its versatility, applications and analysis time.  It is different in that some sample preparation is required; liquid samples have to be deposited on a desired surface and allowed to dry and gases have to be adsorbed unto a material.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:DESI ion source.jpg|thumb|right|400 px|Schematic diagram of the DESI ion source]]
DESI is a combination of electrospray (ESI) and desorption (DI) ionization methods.
Ionization takes place by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takáts Z, Wiseman JM, Cooks RG |title=Ambient mass spectrometry using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI): instrumentation, mechanisms and applications in forensics, chemistry, and biology |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1261–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16237663 |doi=10.1002/jms.922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrospray mist is attracted to the surface by applying a voltage on the sample holder.  After ionization, the ions travel through air into the atmospheric pressure interface which is connected to the mass spectrometer.  DESI is a technique that allows for ambient ionization of a trace sample at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation.

===Ionization mechanism===

In DESI there are two kinds of ionization mechanism, one that applies to low molecular weight molecules and another to high molecular weight molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;/&gt; High molecular weight molecules, such as proteins and peptides show electrospray like spectra where multiply charged ions are observed.  This suggests desorption of the analyte, where multiple charges in the droplet can easily be transferred to the analyte.  The charged droplet hits the sample, spreads over a diameter greater than its original diameter, dissolves the protein and rebounces.  The droplets travel to the mass spectrometer inlet and are further desolvated.  The solvent typically used for the electrospray is a combination of methanol and water.

For the low molecular weight molecules, ionization occurs by charge transfer: an electron or a proton.  There are three possibilities for the charge transfer.  First, charge transfer between a solvent ion and an analyte on the surface.  Second, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and analyte on the surface; in this case the solvent ion is evaporated before reaching the sample surface.  This is achieved when the spray to surface distance is large.  Third, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and a gas phase analyte molecule. This occurs when a sample has a high vapour pressure.

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(aq)} + S_{(s)} \to A_{(aq)} + S^-_{(s)}\,\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(g)} + S_{(s)} \to A_{(g)} + S^-_{(s)}\,\qquad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(g)} + S_{(g)} \to A_{(g)} + S^-_{(g)}\,\qquad(3)&lt;/math&gt;

The ionization mechanism of low molecular weight molecules in DESI is similar to DART’s ionization mechanism, in that there is a charge transfer that occurs in the gas phase.

==Ionization efficiency==
[[Image:DESI side view.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Side view of DESI ion source along with a table containing typical values for the geometric parameters]]
The ionization efficiency of DESI is complex and depends on several parameters such as, surface effects, electrospray parameters, chemical parameters and geometric parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;/&gt; Surface effects include chemical composition, temperature and electric potential applied.  Electrospray parameters include electrospray voltage, gas and liquid flow rates.
Chemical parameters refers to the sprayed solvent composition, e.g. addition of NaCl.  Geometric parameters are α, β, d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see figure on the right).

Furthermore, α and d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; affect the ionization efficiency, while β and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affect the collection efficiency.  Results of a test performed on a variety of molecules to determine optimal α and d1 values show that there are two sets of molecules: high molecular weight (proteins, peptides, oligosaccharide etc.) and low molecular weight (dizazo dye, stereoids, caffeine, nitroaromatics etc.).  The optimal conditions for the high molecular weight group are high incident angles (70-90º) and short d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distances (1–3&amp;nbsp;mm).  The optimal conditions for the low molecular weight group are the opposite, low incident angles (35-50º) and long d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distances (7–10&amp;nbsp;mm).  These test results indicate that each group of molecules has a different ionization mechanism; described in detail in the Principle of operation section.

The sprayer tip and the surface holder are both attached to a 3D moving stage which allow to select specific values for the four geometric parameters: α, β, d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Deuterated dichloromethane (CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a form (called an isotopologue) of [[dichloromethane]] (DCM, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in which the hydrogen atoms (&quot;H&quot;) are replaced with deuterium (heavy hydrogen) isotope (&quot;D&quot;). Deuterated DCM is not a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy as it is reasonably expensive.

'''Deuterium NMR''' is NMR spectroscopy of deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D), an isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium is an isotope with spin = 1, unlike hydrogen which is spin = 1/2.  Deuterium NMR has a range of chemical shift similar to proton NMR but with poor resolution.  It may be used to verify the effectiveness of deuteration: a deuterated compound will show a peak in deuterium NMR but not proton NMR.&lt;ref&gt;http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/row1/h.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Direct-EI LC-MS interface''' is a simple coupling technique between [[liquid chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]) developed by Achille Cappiello and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniurb.it/SA/italiano/achilleweb/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, E. Pierini, P. Palma, H. Trufelli, ''Advanced Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Interface Based on Electron Ionization''. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 5364-5372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the direct and efficient introduction of a liquid effluent into an [[electron ionization]] (EI) source where typical, library searchable [[mass spectra]] are generated. The gas-phase principle of EI offers plenty of application possibilities for the detection of a wide range of [[HPLC]] amenable compounds showing, at the same time, a valid opposition to adverse [[matrix effects]]. In fact, although atmospheric pressure ionization techniques have revolutionized the role of LC-MS, the related analytical methods are often plagued by inaccurate quantitative results due to unavoidable and unpredictable effects from matrix components. The technology illustrated here provides a robust and straightforward access to classical, well-characterized electron ionization data for a variety of LC applications and readily interpretable spectra from electronic libraries for different areas of research interest such as environment, [[food safety]], [[pharmaceutical]], [[biomedical]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, E. Pierini, P. Palma, H. Trufelli Advanced Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Interface Based on Electron Ionization. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 5364-5372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS) are two analytical techniques that, in principle, seem to be incompatible. However, because these two approaches share a great deal of applications in the analysis of suitable molecules, typically less than 1000 u, a large effort has been devoted by the scientific community to develop a reliable, easy-to-use, and flawless interface. The first successful and commercially available device to combine EI and HPLC was designed by Willoughby and Browner in 1984&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Willoughby, R.F. Browner 1984. Monodisperse aerosol generation interface for coupling liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Anal. Chem. 1984, 56, 2625-2632.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was based on the conversion of the solute into a beam of particles, after the formation of spray droplets and the elimination of the [[solvent]] vapors through a multi-stage [[momentum]] separator. Although its efficient interfacing mechanism and a unique trait, particle beam performance was sometimes inadequate to an increasing number of new, demanding applications and was quickly replaced by a family of [[atmospheric pressure ionization]]-based interfaces (API) when they became commercially available. However, the possibility to record an EI spectrum from an HPLC application remained a challenge for a long time. The first Direct-EI prototype was first presented in 2002&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, F. Mangani, P. Palma A Simple Approach for Coupling Liquid Chromatography and Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002, 13, 265–273&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed an innovative approach that improved interfacing performance compared to that of particle beam and opened new opportunities for LC-MS applications.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Direct-EI v2.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=full|Scheme of a Direct-EI, LC-MS interface.]]
The interfacing mechanism is contained inside a common EI source, like that found in any GC-MS system. The liquid phase from a nano HPLC column is admitted from the capillary column port, where the connection tubing and the [[nebulizer]] are first introduced and sealed to prevent vacuum loss. The mechanism is based on the formation of an [[aerosol]] in high-vacuum conditions, followed by a quick droplet desolvation and final vaporization of the solute prior to the ionization. The completion of the process is quick and complete and reduces chances of thermal decomposition as reported in the Figure,where a scheme of the interface is shown. The core of the interface is represented by the micro-nebulizer. The nebulizer tip protrudes into the ion source so that the spray expansion is completely contained inside the ion volume. The eluate emerges as liquid phase at a flow rate of 300-500 nL/min, and any premature in-tube solvent evaporation is prevented by a convenient thermal insulation of the nebulizer and the connecting tubing from the surrounding source heat. The high temperature of the [[ion source]], between 300 and 400°C, has a double function: to compensate for the [[latent heat of vaporization]] during the droplet desolvation, and to convert the solute into the gas phase. If all components of this simple interface are correctly placed and sized, then each substance separated by the nano-column is smoothly converted into the gas phase, the peak profile is nicely reproduced, and high quality mass spectra are generated. Major advantages of this technical solution are the following:
* It delivers high-quality, fully library matchable mass spectra of most sub-1 kDa molecules amenable by HPLC.
* It is a [[chemical ionization]] free interface (unless operated intentionally) with accurate reproduction of the expected [[isotope]] ion abundances.
* Response is never influenced by matrix components in the sample or in the [[mobile phase]].
* It can be considered a universal detector for small molecules because response is not related to compound polarity.

==Performance and applications==
=== Mass spectral quality ===

A key feature of this interface is to produce top quality EI spectra from compounds dissolved in a liquid phase. In this case, quality is intended as a measure of the degree of success in a virtual comparison with thousands of spectra stored in the electronic libraries. Identification capability in real-world applications, when peaks are small and noise is high, can be greatly influenced by the quality of ionization. A [[NIST]] library version 2.0d was used for comparison. In this case, identification capability is not compromised by the presence of solvent vapor residues and matching quality tops that of a typical [[GC-MS]] system.

===Response versus matrix composition===
In [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), coeluted matrix components can influence signal intensity through a competition for available charges and for the access to the droplet surface for gas-phase emission, thus creating the so-called matrix effects. Matrix effects can occur at different stages of the interfacing process leading to unpredictably enhanced or suppressed signal response. Direct-EI interface, using a gas phase ionization technique, can eliminate most matrix effects observed with ESI. In fact, it is influenced neither by the mobile phase nor by other matrix components so that the signal response is always proportional only to [[analyte]] concentration. This simplifies sample preparation procedures that can be very complex and time consuming prior to ESI&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, P. Palma, E. Pierini, V. Termopoli, H. Trufelli Overcoming Matrix Effects in Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 9343–9348&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Other performance aspects===
The evaluation of the performance cannot be considered complete without considering the [[limit of detection]], the range of linear response and the signal [[reproducibility]]. EI is known as a low-efficiency ionization technique. Because less than 1/10 000 of the gas-phase sample molecules are ionized, impressive detection limits cannot be expected. However, the efficient interfacing mechanism of this interface allows [[picogram]]-level detection limit in [[selected ion monitoring]] (SIM) for most substances. On the other hand, soft ionization techniques such as ESI are, in some cases, far more efficient but generate fewer fragment ions. The cost of this attitude is paid in terms of structural information so that a second analyzer to generate [[MS/MS]] spectra is an obligation. A typical EI spectrum, in general, has extensive structural information, and a cheaper, single-stage mass spectrometer might be sufficient for analyte characterization or identification. As a rule of the thumb, [[nanogram]]-level sensitivity is obtained in full-scan mode for most substances. Linearity and reproducibility are two point of strength of the interface. Up to four orders of magnitude linearity with RSD lower than 10% are common values in many applications.

===Applications===
Direct-EI may offer a clear advantage over ESI in several applications, but it may excel in the following cases:
*Large number of compounds of different polarities and chemical properties:&lt;ref&gt;G. Famiglini, P. Palma, V. Termopoli, H. Trufelli, A. Cappiello Single-step LC-MS method for the simultaneous determination of GC-amenable organochlorine and LC-amenable phenoxy acids pesticides Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 7373–7378&lt;/ref&gt; EI can offer a shortcut, do-it-all solution when hard-to-detect substances are included or and when a combination of positive and negative ion detection runs are required for complete coverage of analyte detection.
*Characterization of unknowns: library matching offer an unquestionable and invaluable tool for compound identification.
*Detection  of non [[chromophoric]] compounds that also give poor or no signal with API: for these compounds additional HPLC detectors such as [[evaporative light scattering detector]] (ELSD), [[refractive index]] (RI) or [[corona discharge]] aerosol detector (CAD) are also available but each of them has limitations which restrain obtaining a universal detection with reasonable sensitivity. EI-MS would offer a suitable solution for this type of compounds, in terms of sensitivity and universal response. GC is anyway feasible only for compounds with high to medium volatility and therefore cannot be adopted for a full characterization of mixtures of complex nature. The possibility of hyphenating EI to HPLC separation represents an ideal solution.
*Quantitative analyses in presence of matrix effects: EI-MS offers a superior performance compared to ESI or [[APCI]] when intruding interferences from complex matrices pass clean up procedure and cause signal suppression or enhancement.

[[Image:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Diagram showing how a smaller object (such as an [[extrasolar planet]]) orbiting a larger object (such as a [[star]]) could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common [[center of mass]] (red cross).]]

'''Doppler spectroscopy''', also known as [[radial velocity]] measurement, is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] method for finding extrasolar planets.  It involves the observation of [[Doppler shift]]s in the [[spectrum]] of the star around which the [[planet]] orbits.

It is extremely difficult to directly observe extrasolar planets directly because they are very faint at interstellar distances, although the first claims of direct observations were made in 2004 and 2005.  As a result, planets outside of our [[solar system]] are usually discovered using indirect methods, through the effect of the planet on an object that is easier to observe, such as the parent star.  Successful methods include Doppler spectroscopy, [[astrometry]], [[pulsar]] timing, [[Astronomical transit|transits]], and [[Gravitational microlensing]].  Almost all of the known extrasolar planets have been discovered using Doppler spectroscopy.

== History ==
[[Otto Struve]] proposed in 1952 the use of powerful [[spectrograph]]s to detect distant planets. He described how a very large planet, as large as [[Jupiter]], for example, would cause its parent star to wobble slightly as the two objects orbit around their center of mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBSERV&quot;&gt;[[Otto Struve]], &quot;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1952Obs....72..199S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES Proposal for a project of high-precision stellar radial velocity work]&quot; ''[[The Observatory]]'' 72 (1952): 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted that the small Doppler shifts to the light emitted by the star, caused by its continuously varying radial velocity, would be detectable by the most sensitive spectrographs as tiny [[red shift]]s and [[blue shift]]s in the star's emission. However, the technology of the time produced radial velocity measurements with errors of 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[m/s]] or more, making them useless for the detection of orbiting planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;&gt;[[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], &quot;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/radialvelmeth.html radial velocity method]&quot; ''The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Space Flight'', April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The expected changes in radial velocity are very small – Jupiter causes the [[Sun]] to change velocity by about 13&amp;nbsp;m/s over a period of 12 years, and the [[Earth]]'s effect is only 0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s over a period of 1 year – so long-term observations by instruments with a very high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] are required.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolszczan&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/alex/astro497_2.pdf Doppler spectroscopy and astrometry - Theory and practice of planetary orbit measurements]&quot;, [http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/alex/Teaching_spring06.html Astronomy 497: Astronomy of Extrasolar Planets], [[Alex Wolszczan]], Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, [[Penn State University]], Spring 2006. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in spectrometer technology and observational techniques in the 1980s and 1990s produced instruments capable of detecting the first of many new extrasolar planets. [[51 Pegasi b]], the first extrasolar planet to be detected, was discovered in October 1995 using Doppler spectroscopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNE&quot;&gt;[[R. Paul Butler|R. P. Butler]], et al. &lt;!--R. P. Butler, J. T. Wright, G. W. Marcy, D. A Fischer, S. S. Vogt, C. G. Tinney, H. R. A. Jones, B. D. Carter, J. A. Johnson, C. McCarthy, A. J. Penny,--&gt; &quot;[http://exoplanets.org/cne.pdf Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets]&quot; ''[[Astrophysical Journal]].'' Vol. 646 (2006):2-3, 25-33. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, nearly 300 exoplanet candidates have been identified, and most have been detected by Doppler search programs based at
the [[Keck Observatory|Keck]], [[Lick Observatory|Lick]], and [[Anglo-Australian Observatory|Anglo-Australian]] Observatories (respectively, the California, Carnegie and Anglo-Australian planet searches), and teams based at the [[Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNE&quot;/&gt;

The Bayesian Kepler periodogram is a mathematical [[algorithm]], used to detect single or multiple [[extrasolar planets]] from successive [[radial velocity]] measurements of the star they are orbiting.  It was probably been founded in 2005.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} It involves a [[Bayesian statistical analysis]] of the radial velocity data, using a [[Prior probability|prior]] [[probability distribution]] over the space determined by one or more sets of Keplerian orbital parameters.  This analysis may be implemented using the [[Markov chain]] [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) method.

The method has been applied to the [[HD 208487]] system, resulting in an apparent detection of a second planet with a period of approximately 1000 days; however, this may be an artifact of stellar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gregory | title=A Bayesian Kepler periodogram detects a second planet in HD 208487 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | month=February | year=2007 | volume=374 | issue=4 | pages=1321–1333 | accessdate=2008-12-19 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.11240.x | bibcode=2007MNRAS.374.1321G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wright et al. |  title=Four New Exoplanets and Hints of Additional Substellar Companions to Exoplanet Host Stars | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=657 | issue=1 | pages=533–545 | year=2007 | month=March | day=1 | doi=10.1086/510553 | bibcode=2007ApJ...657..533W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method was also applied to the [[HD 11964]] system, where it found an apparent planet with a period of approximately 1 year; this was not found in re-reduced data, suggesting that this detection was an artifact of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Bayesian periodogram finds evidence for three planets in HD 11964|author=Gregory, P.

== Procedure ==
A series of observations is made of the spectrum of light emitted by a star. Periodic variations in the star's spectrum may be detected, with the [[wavelength]] of characteristic [[spectral line]]s in the spectrum increasing and decreasing regularly over a period of time. These variations may be indicative of the radial velocity of the star being altered by the presence of planet orbiting the star, causing Doppler shifts in the light emitted by the star.

If an extrasolar planet is detected, its [[mass]] can be determined from the changes in the star's radial velocity. A graph of measured radial velocity versus time will give a characteristic curve ([[sine curve]] in the case of a circular orbit), and the amplitude of the curve will allow the planet's mass to be calculated.

===Example===
[[Image:Doppler Shift vs Time.jpg|frame]]

The graph to the right illustrates the [[sine curve]] created using Doppler spectroscopy to observe the radial velocity of an imaginary star which is being orbited by a planet in a circular orbit. Observations of a real star would produce a similar graph, although [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] in the orbit will distort the curve and complicate the calculations below.

This theoretical star's velocity shows a periodic variance of ±1&amp;nbsp;m/s, suggesting an orbiting mass that is creating a gravitational pull on this star. Using [[Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|third law of planetary motion]], the observed period of the planet's orbit around the star (equal to the period of the observed variations in the star's spectrum) can be used to determine the planet's distance from the star (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;r^3=\frac{GM_{star}}{4\pi^2}P_{star}^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''r'' is the distance of the planet from the star
*''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]]
*''M&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the star &lt;!-- how is this determined?--&gt;
*''P&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed period of the star

Having determined &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity of the planet around the star can be calculated using [[Newton]]'s [[law of gravitation]], and the [[orbit equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;V_{PL}=\sqrt{GM_{star}/r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_{PL}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of planet.

The mass of the planet can then be found from the calculated velocity of the planet:

&lt;math&gt;M_{PL}=\frac{M_{star}V_{star}}{V_{PL}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the observed velocity of parent star. The observed Doppler velocity, &lt;math&gt;K = V_{star}\sin(i)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the [[inclination]] of the planet's orbit to the line perpendicular to the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]].

Thus, assuming a value for the inclination of the planet's orbit and for the mass of the star, the observed changes in the radial velocity of the star can be used to calculate the mass of the extrasolar planet.

== Problems ==

[[Image:dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|270px|A representation of a star orbited by a planet. All the movement of the star is along the viewer's line-of-sight; Doppler spectroscopy will give a true value of the planet's mass.]]
[[Image:doppspec-above.gif|thumb|270px|In this case none of the star's movement is along the viewer's line-of-sight and the Doppler spectroscopy method will not detect the planet at all.]]

The major problem with Doppler spectroscopy is that it can only measure movement along the line-of-sight, and so depends on a measurement (or estimate) of the inclination of the planet's orbit to determine the planet's mass. If the orbital plane of the planet happens to line up with the line-of-sight of the observer, then the measured variation in the star's radial velocity is the true value. However, if the orbital plane is tilted away from the line-of-sight, then the true effect of the planet on the motion of the star will be greater than the measured variation in the star's radial velocity, which is only the component along the line-of-sight. As a result, the planet's [[true mass]] will be higher than expected.

To correct for this effect, and so determine the true mass of an extrasolar planet, radial velocity measurements must be combined with [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations, which track the movement of the star across the plane of the sky, perpendicular to the line-of-sight. Astrometric measurements allows researchers to check whether objects that appear to be high mass planets are more likely to be [[brown dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;/&gt;

A further problem is that the gas envelope around certain types of stars can expand and contract, and some stars are [[variable star|variable]]. This method is unsuitable for finding planets around these types of stars, as changes in the stellar emission spectrum caused by the intrinsic variability of the star can swamp the small effect caused by a planet.

The method is best at detecting very massive objects close to the parent star - so-called &quot;[[hot Jupiter]]s&quot; - which have the greatest gravitational effect on the parent star, and so cause the largest changes in its radial velocity. Observation of many separate spectral lines and many orbital periods allows the [[signal to noise ratio]] of observations to be increased, increasing the chance of observing smaller and more distant planets, but planets like the Earth remain undetectable with current instruments.

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) in the [[geomagnetic field]] is conventionally referred to as '''Earth's field NMR (EFNMR)'''. Note that the same acronym is used for [[electric field NMR]].

EFNMR is a special case of [[low field NMR]].

When placed in a constant magnetic field and stimulated (perturbed) by a pulsed or alternating magnetic field, NMR active nuclei (such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) resonate at frequencies characteristic of the [[isotope]]. The resonant frequencies and signal strengths are proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. Thus in the 21 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic field that may be found in high resolution laboratory [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR spectrometers]], protons resonate at 900 MHz. However in the Earth's magnetic field the same nuclei resonate at audio frequencies of around 2 kHz, generating very weak signals. 

The location of a nucleus within a complex molecule affects the chemical environment experienced by the nucleus. Thus different [[hydrocarbon]] molecules containing NMR active nuclei in different positions within the molecule produce slightly different patterns of resonant frequencies. Analysis of the frequency spectrum allows the structure of the molecule to be determined.

== Applications ==

Applications of EFNMR include:

* [[Proton precession magnetometer]]s (PPM) or [[proton magnetometer]]s, which produce magnetic resonance in a known sample in the magnetic field to be measured, measure the sample's resonant frequency, then calculate and display the field strength. 

* EFNMR spectrometers, which use the principle of [[NMR spectroscopy]] to analyse molecular structures in a variety of applications, from investigating the structure of ice crystals in polar ice-fields, to rocks and hydrocarbons in the field.

* Earth's field [[MRI]] scanners, which use the principle of [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

The advantages of the Earth's field instruments over conventional (high field strength) instruments include the portability of the equipment giving the ability to analyse substances on site, and their lower cost. The much lower geomagnetic field strength, that would otherwise result in poor signal-to-noise ratios, is compensated by homogeneity of the Earth's field giving the ability to use much larger samples. Their relatively low cost and simplicity make them good educational tools. 

Examples (illustrated) are the [http://www.teachspin.com/instruments/earths_field_NMR/index.shtml TeachSpin] and [http://www.magritek.com/terranova.html Terranova MRI] instruments.

Although those commercial EFNMR spectrometers and MRI instruments aimed at universities etc. are necessarily sophisticated and are too costly for most hobbyists, internet search engines find data and designs for basic proton precession magnetometers which claim to be within the capability of reasonably competent electronic hobbyists or undergraduate students to build from readily available components costing no more than a few tens of US dollars.

== Mode of operation ==

[[Free Induction Decay]] (FID) is the magnetic resonance due to [[Larmor precession]] that results from the stimulation of nuclei by means of either a ''pulsed dc magnetic field'' or a ''pulsed resonant frequency (rf) magnetic field'', somewhat analogous respectively to the effects of plucking or bowing a stringed instrument. Whereas a pulsed rf field is usual in conventional (high field) NMR spectrometers, the pulsed dc polarising field method of stimulating FID is usual in EFNMR spectrometers and PPMs. 

EFNMR equipment typically incorporates several coils, for stimulating the samples and for sensing the resulting NMR signals. Signal levels are very low, and specialised electronic [[amplifiers]] are required to amplify the EFNMR signals to usable levels. The stronger the polarising magnetic field, the stronger the EFNMR signals and the better the [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. The main trade offs are performance versus portability and cost.

Since the FID resonant frequencies of NMR active nuclei are directly proportional to the magnetic field affecting those nuclei, we can use widely available NMR spectroscopy data to analyse suitable substances in the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

For more context and an explanation of NMR principles, please refer to the main articles on [[NMR]] and [[NMR spectroscopy]].

== Proton EFNMR frequencies ==

The geomagnetic field strength and hence precession frequency varies with location and time.

: Larmor precession frequency =  [[magnetogyric ratio]] x magnetic field
: Proton magnetogyric ratio =  42.576&amp;nbsp;Hz/μT (also written 42.576&amp;nbsp;MHz/T or 0.042576&amp;nbsp;Hz/nT)
: Earth's magnetic field:  30 μT near Equator to 60 μT near Poles, around 50 μT at mid-latitudes.

Thus [[proton]] (hydrogen nucleus) EFNMR frequencies are [[audio frequencies]] of about 1.3&amp;nbsp;kHz near the Equator to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz near the Poles, around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz being typical of mid-latitudes. These frequencies are in the [[ULF]] [[radio frequency]] band.

Examples of molecules containing hydrogen nuclei useful in proton EFNMR are [[water]], [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], and [[carbohydrates]].

== History ==
Early NMR instruments were developed in the 1950s using [[thermionic valve]] ([[vacuum tube]]) circuits (see for example Scientific American's, Amateur Scientist, by C. L. Stong April, 1959). Sir [[Peter Mansfield]]'s first acquaintance with NMR was an undergraduate project to develop a [[transistorized]] EFNMR spectrometer in the late 1950's [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/mansfield-autobio.html]. Following that introduction to NMR, he went on to invent an [[MRI]] scanner, for which he shared a Nobel prize.

The '''Eckart conditions'''&lt;ref&gt; C. Eckart, ''Some studies concerning rotating axes and polyatomic molecules'', Physical Review,
vol. 47, pp. 552-558 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the  molecular Schrödinger equation  that arises in the second step of the  [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]]. They allow the separation of the nuclear center of mass motion and (partly) the rotational motion from the internal vibrational motions. 
Although the rotational and vibrational motions of the nuclei in a molecule cannot be fully separated, the Eckart conditions minimize the (Coriolis) coupling between these motions. 

== Definition Eckart conditions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_A&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate vector of nucleus ''A'' (&lt;math&gt;A=1,\ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;) 
with respect to a special body-fixed frame with origin in the center of mass of the molecule, a so-called Eckart frame.&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Biedenharn and J. D. Louck, ''Angular Momentum in Quantum Physics'', Addison-Wesley, Reading (1981) p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; The  mass of nucleus ''A'' is ''M''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. We suppose that the [[potential energy surface]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{R}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{R}_N)&lt;/math&gt; has a (deep) minimum for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A=1,\ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;); this means that the molecule is assumed to have a well-defined geometry (a ''semi-rigid'' molecule). The equilibrium coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt; are expressed with respect to the Eckart frame.

We define ''displacement coordinates'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_A\equiv\mathbf{R}_A-\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt;.
The displacement coordinates satisfy the  ''translational'' Eckart conditions, if:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A \mathbf{d}_A = 0 .
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''rotational'' Eckart conditions for the displacements are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A \mathbf{R}^0_A \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; indicates a [[vector product]].

==Separation of external and internal coordinates==
Displacement coordinates that satisfy the Eckart conditions
are usually referred to as ''internal molecular coordinates''. To clarify this nomenclature
we define first ''external molecular coordinates''. 

The nuclear configuration space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3N&lt;/sup&gt; arising in the second step of the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]] is a linear space of dimension 3''N''. One can renormalize its basis and obtain so-called ''mass-weighted'' coordinates, or one can introduce a generalized inner product with
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{M} \equiv \operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{M}_1, \mathbf{M}_2, \ldots,\mathbf{M}_N)
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{M}_i\equiv  \operatorname{diag}(M_i, M_i, M_i)
&lt;/math&gt;
playing the role of positive definite metric. That is, an inner product in the space is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{f}|\mathbf{d}\rangle \equiv  \mathbf{f}^\mathrm{T}\, \mathbf{M}\, \mathbf{d} =
\sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{\alpha=x,y,z} M_A 
f_{A\alpha} \,d_{A\alpha}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We will follow the second route. 

The following 3''N''-dimensional vectors are '''external coordinates'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} \equiv \operatorname{col}(\mathbf{t},\, \mathbf{t},\ldots, \mathbf{t})
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{S}\equiv \operatorname{col}( \mathbf{s}\times\mathbf{R}_1^0,\,  \mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{R}_2^0,\ldots,\mathbf{s}\times\mathbf{R}_N^0 ), 
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''t''' and '''s''' are arbitrary triplets of real numbers (3-dimensional column vectors). 
The subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3N&lt;/sup&gt; of all vectors '''T''' and '''S''' is of dimension 6, for it
is easy to show that the 6 vectors obtained from unit vectors '''t''' and '''s''' ['''t'''=(1,0,0),
'''t'''=(0,1,0),  '''s''' = (1,0,0), etc.] are orthogonal and hence linearly independent.
We write this 6-dimensional subspace as '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; and the total configuration space
becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{R}^{3N} = \mathbf{R}_\textrm{ext}\oplus\mathbf{R}_\textrm{int},
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; is the 3''N'' - 6 dimensional [[orthogonal complement]] of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. The elements of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; are '''internal coordinates'''. We 
show that they obey the Eckart conditions. We also show that, conversely, vectors obeying the Eckart conditions are in the space '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{T}| \mathbf{d}\rangle =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \mathbf{d}_A =
\mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
because 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}\equiv \operatorname{col}(\mathbf{d}_1, \mathbf{d}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{d}_N)
&lt;/math&gt;
is in the orthogonal complement of '''T'''. Now, since '''t''' is arbitrary,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0 \Longleftrightarrow 
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
which are the translational Eckart conditions. In a very similar manner,
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{S}| \mathbf{d}\rangle =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A (\mathbf{s} \times\mathbf{R}_A^0 )^\textrm{T}\, \mathbf{d}_A =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{s}^\textrm{T}\, \left(\mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A\right) = 
\mathbf{s}^\textrm{T}\,\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
because 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}\,&lt;/math&gt;
is in the orthogonal complement of '''S'''. Finally, since '''s''' is arbitrary
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A    \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0 \Longleftrightarrow 
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
which are the rotational Eckart conditions.

== Relation to the harmonic approximation ==

In the harmonic approximation to the nuclear vibrational problem, expressed in displacement coordinates, one must solve the [[generalized eigenvalue problem ]]
:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{H}\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{M} \mathbf{C} \boldsymbol{\Phi},
&lt;/math&gt;
where  '''H''' is a 3''N'' x 3''N'' symmetric matrix of second derivatives of the potential &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{R}_1, \mathbf{R}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{R}_N)&lt;/math&gt;. '''H''' is the [[Hessian matrix]] of ''V'' in the equilibrium &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_1^0,\ldots,  \mathbf{R}_N^0&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal matrix '''M''' contains the masses on the diagonal. 
The  diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; contains the eigenvalues, while
the columns of '''C''' contain the eigenvectors.

It can be shown that the  invariance  of ''V'' under simultaneous translation over '''t'''  of all nuclei implies that the vectors '''T''', introduced above,  are eigenvectors
of eigenvalue zero. From the invariance of ''V'' under an infinitesimal rotation of all nuclei  around '''s''' it can been shown that also the vectors
'''S''' are eigenvectors of eigenvalue zero.  Thus, the 6 columns of '''C''' corresponding to eigenvalue zero, are determined  algebraically. (If the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved numerically, one will find in general 6 linearly independent linear combinations of '''S''' and '''T'''). 
The eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue zero is at least of dimension 6 (often it is exactly of dimension 6, since the other eigenvalues, which are [[force constant]]s, are never zero for molecules in their ground state). Thus, '''T''' and '''S''' correspond to the overall (external) motions: translation and rotation, respectively. They are ''zero-energy modes'' because space is homogeneous (force-free) and isotropic (torque-free).

By the definition in this article the non-zero frequency modes are internal modes, since they   are within the orthogonal complement of  '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. The generalized orthogonalities:
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{I} &lt;/math&gt; 
applied to the &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; (zero-eigenvalue) columns of '''C'''
are in fact the Eckart conditions.

An einzel lens is a charged particle lens that focuses without changing the energy of the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular tubes in series along an axis. It is used in ion optics to focus ions in flight which is accomplished through manipulation of the electric field in the path of the ions. 

The lens elements are symmetric so the ions will regain their initial energy on exiting the lens although the velocity of the outer particles will be altered such that they converge on to the axis.  This causes the outer particles to arrive at the focus intersection slightly later than the ones that travel along a straight path as they have to travel an extra distance.

==Theory==
[[Image:Einzel_lens_3d.png|thumb|right|250 px|A perspective view of an einzel lens.]]
The equation for the change in radial velocity for a particle as it passes between any pair of cylinders in the lens is:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta v_r = \int \frac{qE_r(r,z)}{m_0v_z} dz&lt;/math&gt;

z is the axis passing through the middle of the lens. r is the direction normal to z.  If the lens is constructed with cylindrical plates, the field is symmetrical around z.  &lt;math&gt;E_r(r,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the electric field in the radial direction for a particle at a particular radial distance and distance across the gap, &lt;math&gt;m_o&lt;/math&gt; the rest mass of the particle passing through the field, &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle and q is the charge of the particle. The integral occurs over the gap between the plates. This is also the interval where the lensing occurs.  

The pair of plates is also called an electrostatic immersion lens, thus an einzel lens can be described as two or more electrostatic immersion lenses.  Solving the equation above twice to find the change in radial velocity for each pair of plates can be used to calculate the focal length of the lens.   

==Application to television tubes==
[[Image:Einzel_lens_ions.png|thumb|right|300px|Path of ions as they travel through an einzel lens. The ion mass is 200 kDa accelerated to 40 kV, the middle plate potential is at 200 V and the plate size is 1m (note that these values are atypical for illustrative purposes).]]
The einzel lens principle in a simplified form was also used as a focusing mechanism in modern display and television cathode ray tubes,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Radio and Television&quot; by C. A. Quarrington, 1952-1963.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Television Receiver Servicing&quot; by E. A. W. Spreadbury, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  and has the advantage of providing a good sharply focused spot throughout the useful life of the tube's electron gun, with minimal or no readjustment needed (many mono TVs did not have or need focus controls), although in high-resolution mono displays and all colour CRT displays an (engineer-adjustable) focus potentiometer control is provided.

'''Electric field NMR''' (EFNMR) spectroscopy differs from conventional [[NMR]] in that a sample containing suitable [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] is polarised by a strong dc [[electric field]] instead of a constant [[magnetic field]]. The nuclei are stimulated (perturbed) by means of an alternating magnetic field, generated by passing an alternating current through a set of coils. The resulting magnetic resonance signal is small, and as in conventional NMR is typically sensed using a second set of coils and an amplifier.

Note that the same acronym is used for [[Earth's field NMR]].

The shifting and splitting of [[spectral line]]s of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external static [[electric field]] is referred to as the [[Stark effect]].

'''Electrical mobility''' is the ability of charged particles (such as [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s) to move through a medium in response to an [[electric field]] that is pulling them. The separation of ions according to their mobility in gas phase is called [[Ion mobility spectrometry]], in liquid phase it is called [[electrophoresis]].

==Theory==
When a [[charged particle]] in a [[gas]] or [[liquid]] is acted upon by a uniform [[electric field]], it will be accelerated until it reaches a constant [[drift velocity]] according to the formula:
: &lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt; 

where 
: &lt;math&gt;\, v_d&lt;/math&gt; is the drift velocity (m/s)
: &lt;math&gt;\, E&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the applied electric field (V/m)
: &lt;math&gt;\, \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V.s))

In other words, the electrical mobility of the particle is defined as the ratio of the drift velocity to the magnitude of the electric field:
: &lt;math&gt;\,\mu = \frac{v_d}{E}&lt;/math&gt;

Electrical mobility is proportional to the net [[electric charge|charge]] of the particle.  This was the basis for [[Robert Millikan]]'s demonstration that electrical charges occur in discrete units, whose magnitude is the charge of the [[electron]].

Electrical mobility of spherical particles much larger than the mean free path of the molecules of the medium is inversely proportional to the [[diameter]] of the particles; for spherical particles much smaller than the mean free path, the electrical mobility is inversely proportional to the square of the particle diameter.

==Mobility in gas phase==
Mobility is defined for any species in the gas phase, encountered mostly in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics and is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{m\, \nu_m}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\, q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the species,

:&lt;math&gt;\, \nu_m&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum transfer collision frequency, and

:&lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass.

Mobility is related to the species' '''diffusion coefficient''' &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; through an exact (thermodynamically required) equation known as the [[Einstein relation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{k\, T}D&lt;/math&gt;,

where

:&lt;math&gt;\, k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\, T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas]] temperature, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is a measured quantity that can be estimated. If one defines the [[mean free path]] in terms of [[momentum transfer]], then one gets:

&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{\pi}{8}\lambda^2 \nu_m&lt;/math&gt;.

But both the ''momentum transfer mean free path'' and the ''momentum transfer collision frequency'' are difficult to calculate. Many other mean free paths can be defined. In the gas phase, &lt;math&gt;\, \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as the diffusional mean free path, by assuming a simple approximate relation is exact:

&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{2}\lambda \,v&lt;/math&gt;, 

when &lt;math&gt;\, v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[root mean square]] speed of the gas molecules: 

&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {{3\, k\, T}\over{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the diffusing species. This approximate equation becomes exact when used to define the diffusional mean free path.

==Applications==
Electrical mobility is the basis for [[electrostatic precipitation]], used to remove particles from exhaust gases on an industrial scale.  The particles are given a charge by exposing them to ions from an [[electrical discharge]] in the presence of a strong field.  The particles acquire an electrical mobility and are driven by the field to a collecting electrode.

Instruments exist which select particles with a narrow range of electrical mobility, or particles with electrical mobility larger than a predefined value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=E. O. Knutson and K. T. Whitby | title=Aerosol classification by electric mobility: Apparatus, theory, and applications | journal=J. Aerosol Sci. | year=1975 | volume=6 | pages=443–451 | doi=10.1016/0021-8502(75)90060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are generally referred to as &quot;differential mobility analyzers&quot;.  The selected mobility is often identified with the diameter of a singly-charged spherical particle, thus the &quot;electrical-mobility diameter&quot; becomes a characteristic of the particle, regardless of whether it is actually spherical.

'''Electromagnetic radiation''' (often abbreviated '''E-M radiation''' or '''EMR''') is a [[phenomenon]] that takes the form of [[wave propagation|self-propagating]] [[wave]]s in a [[vacuum]] or in [[matter]]. It comprises [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]] components, which [[oscillate]] in phase perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy [[Wave propagation|propagation]]. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into several types according to the [[frequency]] of its wave; these types include (in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength): [[radio waves]], [[microwave]]s,  [[infrared|infrared radiation]], [[visible spectrum|visible light]], [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. A small and somewhat variable window of frequencies is [[sense]]d by the [[eye]]s of various [[organism]]s; this is what is called the [[visible spectrum]]. The [[photon]] is the quantum of the electromagnetic interaction and the basic &quot;unit&quot; of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation and is also the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. The photon is, in a sense, what's waving.

EM radiation carries [[energy]] and [[momentum]] that may be imparted to [[matter]] with which it interacts.

== Physics ==
=== Theory ===
[[Image:Visible EM modes.png|thumb|Shows three electromagnetic modes (blue, green and red) with a distance scale in micrometres along the x-axis.]]
{{main|Maxwell's equations}}
'''Electromagnetic waves''' were first postulated by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and subsequently confirmed by [[Heinrich Hertz]]. Maxwell derived a [[Electromagnetic wave equation|wave form of the electric and magnetic equations]], revealing the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields, and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured [[speed of light]], Maxwell concluded that [[light]] itself is an EM wave.

According to [[Maxwell's equations]], a spatially-varying [[electric field]] generates a time-varying [[magnetic field]] and ''vice versa''. Therefore, as an oscillating electric field generates an oscillating magnetic field, the magnetic field in turn generates an oscillating electric field, and so on.  These oscillating fields together form an electromagnetic wave.

A [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

=== Properties ===
[[Image:Light-wave.svg|thumb|left|350px|Electromagnetic waves can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from right to left. The electric field is in a vertical plane and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane.]]
[[Image:Onde electromagnetique.svg|thumb|left|350px]]

The [[physics]] of electromagnetic radiation is [[electrodynamics]]. [[Electromagnetism]] is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of [[superposition principle|superposition]] so that a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field will contribute to the fields present in the same space due to other causes: as they are [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For instance, a travelling EM wave incident on an atomic structure induces oscillation in the [[atom]]s of that structure, thereby causing them to emit their own EM waves, [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissions]] which alter the impinging wave through interference. These properties cause various phenomena including [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]].

Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by travelling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum.  However in nonlinear media, such as some [[crystal]]s, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields&amp;nbsp;— these interactions include the [[Faraday effect]] and the [[Kerr effect]].

In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different [[density]] alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by [[Snell's law]]. Light disperses into a visible [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] as light is shone through a prism because of the wavelength dependent refractive index of the prism material ([[Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion]]).

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and [[Subatomic particle|particle]] properties at the same time (see [[wave-particle duality]]). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in a large number of experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. Upon absorption of light, it is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy. Strictly speaking, however, this alone is not evidence of &quot;particulate&quot; behavior of light, rather it reflects the quantum nature of ''matter''&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.qo.phy.auckland.ac.nz/talks/photoelectric.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt; 

There are experiments in which the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves appear in the same experiment, such as the self-interference of a single [[photon]]. ''True'' single-photon experiments (in a quantum optical sense) can be done today in undergraduate-level labs.&lt;sup&gt;[http://people.whitman.edu/~beckmk/QM/grangier/Thorn_ajp.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt; When a single photon is sent through an [[interferometer]], it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a [[photomultiplier]] or other sensitive detector only once.

=== Wave model ===
[[Image:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|right|White light being [[dispersion (optics)|separated]] into its components.]]
An important aspect of the nature of light is [[frequency]]. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in [[hertz]], the [[SI]] unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per [[second]]. Light usually has a spectrum of frequencies which sum together to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction.

A wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the [[wavelength]]. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the speed of the wave (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.

[[Interference (wave propagation)|Interference]] is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference.

The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called [[radiant energy]].

=== Particle model ===
{{seealso|Quantization (physics)|Quantum optics}}

Electromagnetic radiation has particle-like properties as discrete packets of energy, or [[quanta]], called [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The frequency of the wave is proportional to the particle's energy.  Because photons are emitted and absorbed by charged particles, they act as transporters of [[energy]].  The energy per [[photon]] can be calculated from the [[Planck–Einstein equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;

As a photon is absorbed by an [[atom]], it excites an [[electron]], elevating it to a higher [[energy level]]. If the energy is great enough, so that the electron jumps to a high enough energy level, it may escape the positive pull of the nucleus and be liberated from the atom in a process called [[photoionisation]]. Conversely, an electron that descends to a lower energy level in an atom emits a photon of light equal to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies.

Together, these effects explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[light]]. The dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in the intervening medium absorbing different frequencies of the light. The composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption spectrum. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant [[star]] are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. A similar phenomenon occurs for [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]. As the electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons. This is manifested in the [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] spectrum of [[nebula]]e. Today, scientists use this phenomenon to observe what elements a certain star is composed of. It is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the [[red shift]].

=== Speed of propagation ===
{{main|Speed of light}}

Any electric charge which accelerates, or any changing magnetic field, produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates a concept known as [[retarded time]] (as opposed to advanced time, which is unphysical in light of [[causality]]), which  adds to the expressions for the electrodynamic [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]]. These extra terms are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. When any wire (or other conducting object such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) conducts [[alternating current]], electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the electric current. At the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a [[stationary state]] do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in oscillation, which is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle.

Depending on the circumstances, electromagnetic radiation may behave as a [[wave]] or as [[photon|particle]]s.  As a wave, it is characterized by a velocity (the [[speed of light]]), [[wavelength]], and [[frequency]].   When considered as particles, they are known as [[photon]]s, and each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by [[Max Planck|Planck's]] relation ''E = hν'', where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''h'' = 6.626 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J·s is [[Planck's constant]], and ''ν'' is the frequency of the wave.

One rule is always obeyed regardless of the circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum always travels at the [[speed of light]], ''relative to the observer'', regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to [[Albert Einstein]]'s development of the theory of [[special relativity]].)

In a medium (other than vacuum), [[velocity of propagation|velocity factor]] or [[refractive index]] are considered, depending on frequency and application.  Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.

== Thermal radiation and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat ==
{{main|Thermal radiation}}

The basic structure of [[matter]] involves charged particles bound together in many different ways. When electromagnetic radiation is incident on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the situation. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may also get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to [[thermal equilibrium]] and manifesting itself as thermal energy in the material. With a few exceptions such as [[fluorescence]], [[harmonic generation]], [[photochemical reaction]]s and the [[photovoltaic effect]], absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens both for infrared and non-infrared radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared [[lasers]], sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can also easily set paper afire. Ionizing electromagnetic radiation can create high-speed electrons in a material and break chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms in the material eventually most of the energy gets downgraded to thermal energy, this whole process happening in a tiny fraction of a second. That infrared radiation is a form of heat and other electromagnetic radiation is not, is a widespread [[misconception]] in physics. ''Any'' electromagnetic radiation can heat a material when it is absorbed.

The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is responsible for thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material. Radiation is an important mechanism of [[heat transfer]].

The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum [[entropy|radiation entropy]]. The [[thermodynamic potentials]] of electromagnetic radiation can be well-defined as for matter. Thermal radiation in a cavity has energy density (see [[Planck's Law]]) of

:&lt;math&gt;{U\over V} = \frac{8\pi^5(kT)^4}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above with respect to temperature, we may say that the electromagnetic radiation field has an effective volumetric [[heat capacity]] given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{32\pi^5 k^4 T^3}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and [[near and far field|near fields]]) is classified by wavelength into [[radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], the [[visible region]] we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]]. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can always be expressed by [[Fourier analysis]] in terms of sinusoidal monochromatic waves which can be classified into these regions of the spectrum. 

The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength.  Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.
[[Spectroscopy]] can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400&amp;nbsp;nm to 700&amp;nbsp;nm.  A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2&amp;nbsp;nm to 2500&amp;nbsp;nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. It is widely used in [[astrophysics]]. For example, [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emit]] [[radio wave]]s of [[wavelength]] 21.12 [[centimetre|cm]].

'''Soundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation.''' At the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 20 Hz to about 20kHz, are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range, however, electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human ears. Sound waves are the osscilating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic radiation must be converted to air pressure waves, or if the ear is submerged, water pressure waves.

=== Light ===
{{main|Light}}

EM radiation with a [[wavelength]] between approximately 400 [[nanometre|nm]] and 700&amp;nbsp;nm is directly detected by the [[human]] [[eye]] and perceived as visible [[light]]. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700&amp;nbsp;nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when visibility to humans is not relevant.

If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off of an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes our eyes, this results in our [[visual perception]] of the scene. Our brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this not-entirely-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.

At most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses.  Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and our technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. [[Optical fiber]] transmits light which, although not suitable for direct viewing, can carry data that can be translated into sound or an image. The coding used in such data is similar to that used with radio waves.

=== Radio waves ===
Radio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the [[amplitude]], frequency and phase of the wave within a frequency band.

When EM radiation impinges upon a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], it couples to the conductor, travels along it, and [[radio frequency induction|induces]] an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material. This effect (the [[skin effect]]) is used in antennas. EM radiation may also cause certain molecules to absorb energy and thus to heat up; this is exploited in [[microwave oven]]s.

== Derivation ==
Electromagnetic waves as a general phenomenon were predicted by the classical laws of [[electricity]] and magnetism, known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. If you inspect Maxwell's equations without sources (charges or currents) then you will find that, along with the possibility of nothing happening, the theory will also admit nontrivial solutions of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell's equations for [[free space]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0  \qquad \qquad \qquad \ \ (1)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  \qquad \qquad \ (2)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad \ \ (3)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}  \qquad \quad \ (4)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is a vector differential operator (see [[Del]]).

One solution,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
is trivial.

To see the more interesting one, we utilize [[List of vector identities|vector identities]], which work for any vector, as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right) = \nabla \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

To see how we can use this take the curl of equation (2):

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \ (5) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the left hand side:

::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} =  - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} \qquad \ \ (6) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where we simplified the above by using equation (1).

Evaluate the right hand side:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right) = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} \quad \ \ \ \ (7)&lt;/math&gt;

Equations (6) and (7) are equal, so this results in a vector-valued [[differential equation]] for the electric field, namely

::{|cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border:2px solid #ccccff&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Applying a similar pattern results in similar differential equation for the magnetic field:

::{|cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border:2px solid #ccccff&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

These differential equations are equivalent to the [[wave equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of the wave in free space and
::''f'' describes a displacement

Or more simply:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box f = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is [[d'Alembert operator|d'Alembertian]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in the case of the electric and magnetic fields, the speed is:

::&lt;math&gt;c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which, as it turns out, is the [[speed of light]] in free space. Maxwell's equations have unified the permittivity of free space &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, the permeability of free space &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the speed of light itself, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Before this derivation it was not known that there was such a strong [[Electromagnetic wave equation|relationship]] between light and electricity and magnetism.

But these are only two equations and we started with four, so there is still more information pertaining to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. Let's consider a generic vector wave for the electric field.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant amplitude, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is any second differentiable function, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{x}} &lt;/math&gt;is a position vector. We observe that &lt;math&gt;f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
for a generic wave traveling in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

This form will satisfy the wave equation, but will it satisfy all of Maxwell's equations, and with what corresponding magnetic field?

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first of Maxwell's equations implies that electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c_0} \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

The second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field. The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Not only are the electric and magnetic field waves traveling at the speed of light, but they have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, &lt;math&gt;E_0 = c_0 B_0&lt;/math&gt;, which can be seen immediately from the [[Poynting vector]]. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left; but this picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. On a quantum level, it is described as [[photon polarization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electron ionization (EI, formerly known as electron impact) is an ionization method in which energetic electrons interact with gas phase atoms or molecules to produce ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=electron ionization|file=E01999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is widely used in mass spectrometry, particularly for gases and volatile organic molecules.

==Principle of operation==

[[Image:Schematic diagram of an EI ion source.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Diagram representing an electron ionization ion source]]

The following gas phase reaction describes the electron ionization process &lt;ref&gt;R. Davis, M. Frearson, (1987). ''Mass Spectrometry – Analytical Chemistry by Open Learning'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, London.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;M + e^- \to M^{+\bullet} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;

where M is the analyte molecule being ionized, e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is the electron and M&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt; is the resulting ion.

In an EI ion source, electrons are produced through thermionic emission by heating a wire filament that has electric current running through it. The electrons are accelerated to 70 eV in the region between the filament and the entrance to the ion source block.  The accelerated electrons are then concentrated into a beam by being attracted to the trap electrode. The sample under investigation which contains the neutral molecules is introduced to the ion source in a perpendicular direction to the e- beam.  Close passage of highly energetic electrons, referred to as a &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; ionization source, causes large fluctuations in the electric field around the neutral molecules and induces ionization and fragmentation &lt;ref&gt;K. Robinson &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; Undergraduate Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed. Marcel Drekker, New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;. The radical cation products are then directed towards the mass analyzer by a repeller electrode.  The ionization process often follows predictable cleavage reactions that give rise to fragment ions which, following detection and signal processing, convey structural information about the analyte. 

The ionization efficiency and production of fragment ions depends strongly on the chemistry of the analyte and the energy of the electrons. At low energies (around 20 eV), the interactions between the electrons and the analyte molecules do not transfer enough energy to cause ionization. At around 70 eV, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons matches the length of typical bonds in organic molecules (about 0.14 nm) and energy transfer to organic analyte molecules is maximized, leading to the strongest possible ionization and fragmentation. Under these conditions, about 1 in 1000 analyte molecules in the source are ionized. At higher energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons becomes smaller than the bond lengths in typical analytes; the molecules then become &quot;transparent&quot; to the electrons and ionization efficiency decreases.

[[Image:Cont dynode detector.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|Continuous dynode electron multiplier]]
An '''electron multiplier''' is a vacuum-tube structure that multiplies incident charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1740838 | title = An Improved Electron Multiplier Particle Counter | year = 1947 | last1 = Allen | first1 = James S. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 18 | pages = 739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a process called [[secondary emission]], a single [[electron]] can, when bombarded on secondary emissive material, induce emission of roughly 1 to 3 [[electron]]s. If an [[electric potential]] is applied between this metal plate and yet another, the emitted electrons will accelerate to the next metal plate and induce [[secondary emission]] of still more electrons. This can be repeated a number of times, resulting in a large shower of electrons all collected by a metal anode, all having been triggered by just one. 

==Operation==

The avalanche can be triggered by any charged particle hitting the starting electrode with sufficient energy to cause secondary emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.966 | title = The Detection of Single Positive Ions, Electrons and Photons by a Secondary Electron Multiplier | year = 1939 | last1 = Allen | first1 = James | journal = Physical Review | volume = 55 | pages = 966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the electron multiplier is often used as an ion detector.  It could also be triggered by a photon causing vacuum photoemission of at least one electron.  In a [[photomultiplier]] tube, a photo-emissive surface is followed by an electron multiplier with several sequential multiplying electrodes called dynodes. Because these electrodes are separate from each other, this might be called a &quot;discrete-dynode&quot; multiplier. A voltage divider chain of resistors is usually used to place each dynode at a potential 100-200v more positive than the previous one.

[[File:Electron multiplier.svg|thumb|right|The Continuous Electron Multiplier]]

A &quot;continuous-dynode&quot; structure is feasible if the material of the electrodes has a high resistance, so that the functions of secondary-emission and voltage-division are merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1716957 | title = Resistance Strip Magnetic Photomultiplier for the Extreme Ultraviolet | year = 1960 | last1 = Heroux | first1 = L. | last2 = Hinteregger | first2 = H. E. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 31 | pages = 280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often built as a funnel of glass coated inside with a thin film of semi-conducting material, with negative high voltage applied at the wider input end, and positive voltage near ground applied at the narrower output end.  Electrons emitted at any point are accelerated a modest distance down the funnel before impacting the surface, perhaps on the opposite side of the funnel.  At the destination end a separate electrode (anode) remains necessary to collect the multiplied electrons. This structure is also known as (single) channel electron multiplier (CEM), and one of the most common is sold under the trade name Channeltron.

Another geometry of continuous-dynode electron multiplier is called the [[microchannel plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1683743 | title = Collection Efficiency of Continuous Dynode Electron Multiple Arrays | year = 1969 | last1 = Burroughs | first1 = E. G. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 40 | pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1016/0029-554X(79)90734-1 | title = Microchannel plate detectors | year = 1979 | last1 = Ladislas Wiza | first1 = J | journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods | volume = 162 | pages = 587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be considered a 2-dimensional parallel array of very small continuous-dynode electron multipliers, built together and powered in parallel too. Each microchannel is generally parallel-walled, not tapered or funnel-like.

==Applications==

In [[mass spectrometry]] electron multipliers are often used as a detector of ions that have been separated by a mass analyzer of some sort. They can be of the continuous-dynode type, and may have a curved horn-like funnel shape, or they can have discrete dynodes as in a [[photomultiplier]].

'''Electron paramagnetic resonance''' (EPR) or '''electron spin resonance''' (ESR) [[spectroscopy]] 
is a technique for studying [[chemical species]] that have one or more unpaired [[electron]]s, such as organic and inorganic [[free radical]]s or [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] possessing a [[transition metal]] [[ion]]. The basic physical concepts of EPR are analogous to those of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of [[spin (physics)|spin]]s of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].  Because most stable molecules have all their electrons paired, the EPR technique is less widely used than NMR.  However, this limitation to [[paramagnetic]] species also means that the EPR technique is one of great specificity, since ordinary chemical solvents and matrices do not give rise to EPR spectra.

EPR was first observed in [[Kazan State University]] by the [[Soviet]] physicist [[Yevgeniy Zavoyskiy]] in 1944, and was developed independently  at the same time by [[Brebis Bleaney]] at [[Oxford University]].

[[Image:EPR spectometer.JPG|thumb|right|300px||EPR [[spectrometer]]]]

==EPR theory==
=== Units and constants ===

* [[Magnetic field]] strength is denoted by ''B'' or ''B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (T) in the [[SI]] system. However, in EPR spectroscopy fields are commonly reported using the [[CGS]] unit the [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] (G), where 1 G = 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; T.
* [[Planck's constant]] ''h'' = 6.6261 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s
* [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'' = 1.3807 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Bohr magneton]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.2740 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; J T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Origin of an EPR signal ===

Every electron has a [[magnetic moment]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[quantum number]] s = 1/2, with magnetic components m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 and m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2.  In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either parallel (m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2) or antiparallel (m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy (see the [[Zeeman effect]]). The parallel alignment corresponds to the lower energy state, and the separation between it and the upper state is &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''E = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron's so-called [[g-factor]] (see also the [[Landé g-factor|Landé ''g''-factor]]).  This equation implies that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the [[magnetic field]]'s strength, as shown in the diagram below.
[[Image:EPR splitting.jpg|centre|300 px||Splitting of electron spin states]]

An unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting  electromagnetic radiation of energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; such that the resonance condition, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;E, is obeyed.  Substituting in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''E = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: ''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Experimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000 &amp;ndash; 10000&amp;nbsp;MHz (9 &amp;ndash; 10&amp;nbsp;GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 G (0.35 T).  See below for other field-frequency combinations.

In principle, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant, or doing the reverse.  In practice, it is usually the frequency which is kept fixed. A collection of [[paramagnetic]] centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency.  By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 and m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2 energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double-arrow in the diagram above.  At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states.  Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption which is monitored and converted into a spectrum.

As an example of how ''&lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be used, consider the case of a free electron, which has ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0023,&lt;ref&gt;B. Odom et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''97''', 030801 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and the simulated spectrum shown at the right in two different forms.  For the microwave frequency of 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, the predicted resonance position is a magnetic field of about ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; / ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3350 tesla = 3350 gauss, as shown.  Note that while two forms of the same spectrum are presented in the figure, most EPR spectra are recorded and published only as first derivatives.

Because of electron-nuclear mass differences, the [[magnetic moment]] of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths.  For example, for the field of 3350 G shown at the right, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3&amp;nbsp;MHz for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei.  (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is ''&lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''g&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' depend on the nucleus under study.)

===Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution===

In practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers. If the population of radicals is in thermodynamic equilibrium, its statistical distribution is described by the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ n_\text{upper} }{ n_\text{lower} } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ E_\text{upper}-E_\text{lower} }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \Delta E }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \epsilon }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ h\nu }{ kT }\right) }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_\text{ upper }&lt;/math&gt; is the number of paramagnetic centers occupying the upper energy state, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in [[Kelvin]]. At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 9.75&amp;nbsp;GHz) give &lt;math&gt;n_\text{upper} / n_\text{lower}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a smaller population than the lower one.  Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy. 

The sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimum number of detectable spins &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt;) depends on the photon frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{min}} = \frac{k_1V}{Q_0k_f \nu^2 P^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the sample's volume, &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the unloaded [[Q factor|quality factor]] of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; is the cavity filling coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; being constants, &lt;math&gt;N_min&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;(Q_0\nu^2)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;\nu^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.5. In practice, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can change vary from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size. In other words, the higher the spectrometer frequency the lower the detection limit (&lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt;), meaning greater sensitivity.

==EPR spectral parameters==

In real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:
# An unpaired electron can gain or lose angular momentum, which can change the value of its ''g''-factor, causing it to differ from ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is especially significant for chemical systems with transition-metal ions.
# If an atom with which an unpaired electron is associated has a non-zero nuclear spin, then its magnetic moment will affect the electron. This leads to the phenomenon of [[hyperfine coupling]], analogous to [[J-coupling]] in NMR, splitting the EPR resonance signal into doublets, triplets and so forth.
# Interactions of an unpaired electron with its environment influence the shape of an EPR spectral line.  Line shapes can yield information about, for example, rates of chemical reactions.
# The ''g''-factor and hyperfine coupling in an atom or molecule may not be the same for all orientations of an unparied electron in an external magnetic field.  This [[anisotropy]] depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

===The ''g'' factor===

Knowledge of the ''g''-[[lande g-factor|factor]] can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; experienced by an electron is thus written

&lt;center&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'' includes the effects of local fields (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative).  Therefore, the ''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:

&lt;center&gt;''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - σ) &lt;/center&gt;

The quantity ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - σ) is denoted ''g'' and called simply the ''g''-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes

&lt;center&gt;''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = gμ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;

This last equation is used to determine ''g'' in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If ''g'' does not equal ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free electron value.  Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through spin-orbit coupling.  Because the mechanisms of spin-orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

===Hyperfine coupling===

Since the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra would consist of a single line.  However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra.  In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei.  The [[hyperfine coupling]] constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.

Two common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are Fermi-contact interaction and dipolar interaction.  The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field).  Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion.  The symbols &quot;a&quot; or &quot;A&quot; are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants while &quot;B&quot; is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, &quot;a&quot; refers to the hyperfine splitting constant, a line spacing measured in magnetic field units, while A and B refer to hyperfine coupling constants measured in frequency units.  Splitting and coupling constants are proportional, but not identical.  The book by Wertz and Bolton has more information (pp. 46 and 442).&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.  

* For a radical having M equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I, the number of EPR lines expected is 2MI + 1.  As an example, the methyl radical, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is 2MI + 1 = 2(3)(1/2) + 1 = 4, which is as observed.

* For a radical having M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and a group of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of lines expected is (2M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)(2M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1).  As an example, the methoxymethyl radical, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), has two equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2 and three equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is (2M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)(2M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1) = [2(2)(1/2) + 1][2(3)(1/2) + 1] = [3][4] = 12, again as observed.

[[Image:EPR methyl.jpg|right|400px||Simulated EPR spectrum of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical]]

* The above can be extended to predict the number of lines for any number of nuclei.

While it is easy to predict the number of lines a radical's EPR spectrum should show, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.  

In the oft-encountered case of I = 1/2 nuclei (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing M equivalent nuclei, will follow [[Pascal's triangle]].  For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical give rise to 2MI + 1 = 2(3)(1/2) + 1 = 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio.  The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of a&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 23 G for each of the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei.  Note again that the lines in this spectrum are ''first derivatives'' of absorptions.    

[[Image:EPR methoxymethyl.jpg|right|400px||Simulated EPR spectrum of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) radical]]
As a second example, consider the methoxymethyl radical,  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  The two equivalent methyl hydrogens will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3 x 4 = 12 lines, a triplet of quartets.  A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right, and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities.  Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron.  It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Resonance linewidth definition===

Resonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction ''B'', and its corresponding units, and are measured along the ''x'' axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called halfwidths and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of [[resonance]] line. First inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is a distance from center of  the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2} = 2\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt;, and full inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{max} = 2\Delta B_{1s}&lt;/math&gt;

== EPR applications ==

EPR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], for the detection and identification of [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s and paramagnetic centers.  EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying radicals thought to be formed in chemical reactions, and to identify the reactions themselves.  For example, when water ice (frozen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO2 are produced.  Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR.  Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to UV light.  In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron.  

[[medicine|Medical]] and [[biology|biological]] applications of EPR also exist.  Although radicals are very reactive, and so do not normally occur in high concentrations in biology, special reagents have been developed to spin-label molecules of interest.  These reagents are particularly useful in biological systems.  Specially-designed nonreactive radical molecules can attach to specific sites in a [[cell (biology)|biological cell]], and EPR spectra can then give information on the environment of these so-called [[spin label|spin-label]] or [[spin probe|spin-probes]].
 
EPR spectroscopy can only be applied to systems in which the balance between radical decay and radical formation keep a free radical's concentration above the detection limit of the spectrometer used.  This can be a particularly severe problem in studying reactions in liquids.  An alternative approach is to slow down reactions by studying samples held at [[cryogenic]] temperatures, such as 77 K ([[liquid nitrogen]]) or 4.2 K (liquid helium).  An example of this work is the study of radical reactions in single crystals of amino acids exposed to x-rays, work that leads to [[activation energy|activation energies]].

EPR also has been used by anthropologists for the dating of teeth.  Radiation damage over long periods of time creates free radicals in tooth enamel, which can then be examined by EPR and, after proper calibration, dated.

Radiation-sterilized foods have been examined with EPR spectroscopy, the aim being to develop methods to determine if a particular food sample has been irradiated and to what dose.

== High-field-high-frequency measurements ==

High-field-high-frequency EPR measurements are sometimes needed to detect subtle spectroscopic details. However, for many years the use of electromagnets to produce the needed fields above 1.5 T was impossible, due principally to limitations of traditional magnet materials. The first multifunctional millimeter EPR spectrometer with a superconducting solenoid was described in the early 1970s by Prof. Y. S. Lebedev's group (Russian [[Institute of Chemical Physics]], [[Moscow]]) in collaboration with L. G. Oranski's group (Ukrainen Physics and Technics Institute, Donetsk) which began working in the [[Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics]], [[Chernogolovka]] around 1975.[http://hf-epr.nytka.org] Two decades later, a W-band EPR spectrometer was produced as a small commercial line by the German [[Bruker|Bruker Company]] [http://www.bruker.de], initiating the expansion of W-band EPR techniques into medium-sized academic laboratories.  Today there still are only a few scientific centers in the world capable of high-field-high-frequency EPR, among them are the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in [[Grenoble]], [[France]], the [[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] in [[Tallahassee]], [[USA]], the [[Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung Dresden|IFW]] in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], the Institute of Physics of Complex Matter in [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], and the Huygens Laboratory of [[Leiden University]] in [[the Netherlands]].

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The EPR waveband is stipulated by the frequency or wavelength of a spectrometer's microwave source (see Table).  

EPR experiments often are conducted at X and, less commonly, Q bands, mainly due to the ready availability of the necessary microwave components (which originally were developed for radar applications).  A second reason for widespread X and Q band measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over ''g''-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters.  Measurements at &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 40&amp;nbsp;GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages:
 
# EPR spectra are simplified due to the reduction of second-order effects at high fields.
# Increase in orientation selectivity and sensitivity in the investigation of disordered systems.
# The informativity and precision of pulse methods, e.g., [[ENDOR]] also increase at high magnetic fields.
# Accessibility of spin systems with larger zero-field splitting due to the larger microwave quantum energy ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.
# The higher spectral resolution over ''g''-factor, which increases with irradiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and external magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is used to investigate the structure, polarity, and dynamics of radical microenvironments in spin-modified organic and biological systems through the [[spin label]] and probe method. The figure shows how spectral resolution improves with increasing frequency.
# Saturation of paramagnetic centers occurs at a comparatively low microwave polarizing field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, due to the exponential dependence of the number of excited spins on the radiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. This effect can be successfully used to study the relaxation and dynamics of paramagnetic centers as well as of superslow motion in the systems under study.
# The cross-relaxation of paramagnetic centers decreases dramatically at high magnetic fields, making it easier to obtain more-precise and more-complete information about the system under study.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://hf-epr.nytka.org High-Frequency EPR Group] of the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences for more information about high-field EPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''emission spectrum''' of a chemical element or chemical compound is the relative intensity of each frequency of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the element's atoms or the compound's molecules when they are returned to a ground state.

Each element's emission spectrum is unique. Therefore, spectroscopy can be used to identify the elements in matter of unknown composition. Similarly, the emission spectra of molecules can be used in chemical analysis of substances.

==Emission (Light)==
In [[physics]], '''emission''' is the process by which [[energy]] in the form of a [[photon]] is released by a particle, for example, by an [[atom]] whose [[electron]]s make a transition between two electronic [[energy level]]s. The emitted energy is in the form of a photon with a specific frequency.
The [[Beam emittance|emittance]] of an object quantifies how much light is emitted by it. This may be related to other properties of the object through the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]].
For most substances, the amount of emission varies with the [[temperature]] and the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic composition]] of the object, leading to the appearance of [[color temperature]] and [[emission lines]]. Precise measurements at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via [[emission spectroscopy]].

==Origins==
When the [[electrons]] in the atom are excited, for example by being heated, the additional [[energy]] pushes the electrons to higher energy orbits. When the electrons fall back down and leave the excited state, energy is re-emitted in the form of a [[photon]].  The wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency) of the photon is determined by the difference in energy between the two states.  These emitted photons form the element's emission spectrum.  

The fact that only certain colors appear in an element's atomic emission spectrum means that only certain frequencies of light are emitted. Each of these frequencies are related to energy by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{photon}} = h\nu,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''ν'' is its [[frequency]], and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].
This concludes that only [[photon]]s having certain energies are emitted by the atom. The principle of the atomic emission spectrum explains the varied colors in [[neon sign]]s, as well as chemical [[flame test]] results mentioned above.

The frequencies of light that an atom can emit are dependent on states the electrons can be in. When excited, an electron moves to a higher energy level/orbital. When the electron falls back to its ground level the light is emitted.

===Radiation from molecules===
As well as the electronic transitions discussed above, the energy of a molecule can also change via [[Rotational transition|rotational]], [[Vibrational transition|vibrational]], and [[Vibronic transition|vibronic]] (combined vibrational and electronic) transitions.  These energy transitions often lead to closely-spaced groups of many different spectral lines, known as [[spectral bands]].  Unresolved band spectra may appear as a spectral continuum.

Molecular emission is the mechanism behind the [[sulfur lamp]] and the [[deuterium arc lamp]].

==Emission spectroscopy==
Light consists of electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. Therefore, when the elements or their compounds are heated either on a flame or by an electric arc they emit energy in form of light. Analysis of this light, with the help of [[spectroscope]] gives us a discontinuous spectrum. A spectroscope or a spectrometer is an instrument which is used for separating the components of light, which have different wavelengths. The spectrum appears in a series of lines called the line spectrum. This line spectrum is also called the Atomic Spectrum because it originates in the element. Each element has a different atomic spectrum. The production of line spectra by the atoms of an element indicate that an atom can radiate only a certain amount of energy. This leads to the conclusion that electrons cannot have just any amount of energy but only a certain amount of energy.

The emission spectrum can be used to determine the composition of a material, since it is different for each [[Chemical element|element]] of the [[periodic table]]. One example is [[astronomical spectroscopy]]: identifying the composition of [[star]]s by analysing the received light.
The emission spectrum characteristics of some elements are plainly visible to the naked eye when these elements are heated. For example, when platinum wire is dipped into a [[strontium]] nitrate solution and then inserted into a flame, the strontium atoms emit a red color. Similarly, when [[copper]] is inserted into a flame, the flame becomes green. These definite characteristics allow elements to be identified by their atomic emission spectrum. Not all lights emitted by the spectrum are viewable to the naked eye, it also includes ultra violet rays and infra red lighting,
an emission  is formed when an excited gas is viewed directly though a spectroscope.

[[Image:AtomicLineSpEm.png|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of [[spontaneous emission]]]]
'''Emission spectroscopy''' is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technique which examines the wavelengths of [[photon]]s emitted by atoms or molecules during their transition from an [[excited state]] to a lower energy state. Each element emits a characteristic set of discrete wavelengths according to its [[electronic structure]], by observing these wavelengths the elemental composition of the sample can be determined. Emission spectroscopy developed in the late 19th century and efforts in theoretical explanation of atomic emission spectra eventually led to [[quantum mechanics]].

There are many ways in which atoms can be brought to an excited state. Interaction with electromagnetic radiation is used in [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], protons or other heavier particles in [[Particle-Induced X-ray Emission]] and electrons or X-ray photons in [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[X-ray fluorescence]]. The simplest method is to heat the sample to a high temperature, after which the excitations are produced by collisions between the sample atoms. This method is used in [[flame emission spectroscopy]], and it was also the method used by [[Anders Jonas Ångström]] when he discovered the phenomenon of discrete emission lines in 1850s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Although the emission lines are caused by a transition between quantized energy states and may at first look very sharp, they do have a finite width, i.e. they are composed of more than one wavelength of light. This [[spectral line broadening]] has many different causes.

'''Emission spectroscopy''' is often referred to as '''optical emission spectroscopy''', due to the light nature of what is being emitted.

==History==

Emission lines from hot gases were first discovered{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} by [[Anders Jonas Ångström|Ångström]], and the technique was further developed by [[David Alter]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].

See [[spectrum analysis]] for details.

==Experimental technique in flame emission spectroscopy==

The solution containing the relevant substance to be analysed is drawn into the burner and dispersed into the flame as a fine spray.  The solvent evaporates first, leaving finely divided [[solid]] particles which move to hottest region of the flame where gaseous [[atoms]] and [[ions]] are produced.  Here [[electrons]] are excited as described above.  It is common for a [[monochromator]] to be used to allow for easy detection.

On a simple level, flame emission spectroscopy can be observed using just a [[Bunsen burner]] and samples of metals.  For example, [[sodium]] metal placed in the flame will glow yellow, whilst [[calcium]] metal particles will glow red, and [[copper]] placed into the flame will create a green flame.

==Emission coefficient==
'''Emission coefficient''' is a [[coefficient]] in the power output per unit time of an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] source, a calculated value in [[physics]]. It is also used as a measure of [[natural environment|environmental]] emissions (by mass) per MWh of [[electricity generation|electricity generated]], see: [[Emission factor]].

=== Scattering of light ===

In [[Thomson scattering]] a charged particle emits radiation under incident light. The particle may be an ordinary atomic electron, so emission coefficients have practical applications.

If '''''X''''' d''V'' dΩ dλ is the energy scattered by a volume element d''V'' into solid angle dΩ between wavelengths λ and λ+dλ per unit time then the Emission [[coefficient]] is '''''X'''''.

The values of '''''X''''' in Thomson scattering can be [[Thomson scattering|predicted]] from incident flux, the density of the charged particles and their Thomson differential cross section (area/solid angle).
   
=== Spontaneous Emission ===

A warm body emitting photons has a monochromatic emission coefficient relating its temperature and total power radiation, this is sometimes called the second &quot;Einstein coefficient&quot;, and can be deduced from quantum mechanical theory.

==Energy spectrum==
An '''energy spectrum''' is a distribution energy among a large assemblage of particles.    It is a statistical representation of the wave energy as a function of the wave frequency, and an empirical estimator of the spectral function. For any given value of energy, it determines how many of the particles have that much energy.

The particles may be atoms, photons or a flux of elementary particles.

The [[Schrödinger equation]] and a set of boundary conditions form an eigenvalue problem. A possible value ('''''E''''') is called an eigenenergy. A non-zero solution of the [[wave function]] is called an eigenenergy state, or simply an [[eigenstate]]. The set of eigenvalues {'''''E'''''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} is called the energy spectrum of the particle. 

The electromagnetic spectrum can also be represented as the distribution of electromagnetic radiation according to energy. The relationship among the wavelength (usually denoted by Greek &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&quot;), the frequency (usually denoted by Greek &quot;&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;&quot;), and the energy '''''E''''' are:

: &lt;math&gt;E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light and ''h'' is Planck's Constant.

An example of an energy spectrum in the physical domain is ocean waves breaking on the shore. For any given interval of time it can be observed that some of the waves are larger than others. Plotting the number of waves against the amplitude (height) for the interval will yield the energy spectrum of the set.&lt;ref name=energy-spectrum/&gt; 

=== Optical Spectroscopy and Astrophysics Application ===
Energy spectra are often used in astrophysical spectroscopy.  &lt;blockquote&gt;
The quantity plotted, energy units, is the wavelength times the energy per unit wavelength and thus accurately represents the amount of energy at any wavelength. The energy per unit wavelength and the energy per unit frequency peak at significantly different wavelengths due the reciprocal relation between frequency and wavelength. Using energy units avoids this problem, since (wavelength * flux per unit wavelength) = (frequency * flux per unit frequency). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some modern spectrophotometers, such as the Perkin Elmer 950, include an energy scan option.  This is additionally useful in cases where a reference cell is not practical or when absorbance / transmittance is off-scale.

=== Description ===

A comprehensive set of measures is developed to assess an innovation’s locus, type, and characteristics. The measure described on this page is one of these measures. It is found that the concepts of competence destroying and competence enhancing are composed of two distinct constructs that, although correlated, separately characterize an innovation: new competence acquisition and competence enhancement/destruction. Scales are developed to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types.

Following the typical process of scale construction, the empirical analysis is divided into four stages:
#content face validity analysis with expert judges.
#scale puriﬁcation through exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis.
#assessment of discriminant and convergent validity through analysis of covariance structures.
#nomological validity through the analysis of the effect of innovation characteristics on time to introduction and commercial success.

=== Definition ===

New competence acquisition concerns the extent to which the innovation requires the ﬁrm to reach beyond its existing experience base to acquire new competences.

=== Items ===

*INNOVATION involved fundamentally new concepts or principles for BUSINESS UNIT.
*INNOVATION required new skills which BUSINESS UNIT did not possess.

== Discussion on talk page of bookshelf ==
 
For several years the main place to discuss language books has been the
[[Wikibooks_talk:Languages_bookshelf]]. However, since the bookshelves are phased out, we might consider to close that discussion and continue here? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:45, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

Agreed
[[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:27, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

== Standards and Problems ==

I have to admit that I'm very skeptical about the idea of standardizing language learning books. There has been quite some discussion on this on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Languages_bookshelf]] but I think these are good ideas and suggestions, but nothing more, not even guidelines. 

For example, I have worked a lot on the German wikibook about Spanish, which is a grammar book instead of a language course. Nonetheless, it is one of the most successful German wikibooks. I also worked on the English wikibook [[Spanish_by_Choice]], which is far from a language course, but which is rather popular in the form of PDFs distributed via a podcast. 

In my opinion, instead of focusing on a standard for language learning books, we should focus on the real problems: How to get authentic, interesting content? How to get audio files? How to implement exercises? There are many difficult challenges when writing a language learning book on wikibooks; establishing a standard is not part of it. 

--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:45, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I'm trying to take ideas that most of the wikibooks I've seen have attempted to do already.  For those guidelines I'm referring to the general language course style books, rather than grammar books or those teaching more specific topics.  I don't want to make drastic changes to anything, I want to make a sort of 'aim' for any new wikibooks to make it easier to get them written, and to create a clear direction for those being improved, as many of the original contributors are no longer around.  It seems to me as if the books are mostly going to be edited by newcomers now, and because they can't start books from scratch with their own ideas (because they've already been half-written for years), wikibooks are more attractive if it looks like there's an active community for their topic and they have a clear idea of what improvements they should be making.  So rather than a standard, I see it more as a goal for newcomers who are daunted by the task of a half-written book in someone else's style.

:--[[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:23, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Well, one 'aim' would be to have more recordings by native speakers. And a cleaner layout. I think I should shut up and start working on the [[German]] wikibook. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:40, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

Complete standardization of such a widely varied topic is sure to be damn near impossible. Structures in some languages are more complex than in others, and structures commonly used in one language may be rare in another. It makes more sense in Esperanto, for example, to introduce past and future tenses of verbs before basic prepositions, which is not true in most languages. Providing sections with phrases and vocabulary relating to travelling (getting a taxi, asking directions, etc.) make perfect sense in languages like Spanish, French and Japanese, but make no sense in Esperanto (where in the world are you ever going to find a use for hiring a taxi in Esperanto?). Providing sections with phrases and vocabulary relating to asking people how they feel and how they are doing make sense in Spanish, French and Esperanto, but due to the nature of Japanese culture they avoid such probing questions more often than not. And so on and so forth. I agree with Mr. Kraus: ideas and suggestions, but nothing more - not even guidelines.

However, there are ''other'' ways you can promote standardization across language books that will be useful to both writers and readers. For example, it may be a good idea to create a set of standard language markup templates. In the Esperanto book I use {{tlx|lang eo}}. All it does is mark up whatever you supply in span tags that tell the browser what language the enclosed text is (eo is Esperanto), which may assist in font selection for display, and optionally adds some formatting to visually mark the word as non-English (italics). (It could also add whatever page it is used on to a category of pages that use that language, allowing experts to review whether the language is used correctly. There are a number of other possibilities for this trick.)

What I have been thinking of doing is creating a base &quot;language markup&quot; template (possibly {{tlx|lang}}) that is a standard base for all other language mark up templates - so that {{tlx|lang eo}} could be defined as simply as {{tlx|lang|eo}} (with all parameters being passed through: {{tlx|lang eo|style{{=}}whatever}} would be {{tlx|lang|eo|style{{=}}whatever}}). All other language books can then either use {{tlx|lang}} directly (as in: {{tlx|lang|fr}} for French), or, better yet, derive their own template based on it (as in: {{tlx|lang fr}} which in turn calls {{tlx|lang|fr}}).

If we do this, then, by default, all language books (that use such templates) could have a consistent look-and-feel whenever they display text in the other language (for example, the text could be italicized, unless specifically set not to), yet, if necessary, specific languages could override the default look-and-feel if they need to. It's not quite &quot;standardization&quot;, but it helps authors (by providing them an easy and consistent way to mark up foreign languages, and at the same time giving notice to experts that the language was used and thus might need to be checked) and it helps readers (by providing them with a consistent look-and-feel when foreign language phrases or words are used, and by giving their browser a clue how to render the text better).

Following on this logic, other templates could be created to mark up things like other-language-to-English translations in a consistent and pseudo-standardized way: {{tlx|translation eo|libro|book}} could expand to ''libro'' (&quot;book&quot;) and {{tlx|translation ja|本|book|translit=hon}} could expand to 本 (''hon'', &quot;book&quot;), both by way of a common {{tlx|translation}} template. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 13:11, 19 July 2010 (UTC)

:I goofed on the template display code for that Japanese example. It should be {{tlx|translation ja|本|book|translit{{=}}hon}}. I am going to be bold and create the templates, so that I can demonstrate with working examples. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 16:10, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::Alright, this is how the basic {{tlx|lang}} template works, with {{tlx|lang|es|¡Hola!}}: {{lang|es|¡Hola!}}
::This is the {{tlx|lang fr}} template, which is based on {{tlx|lang}}, with {{tlx|lang fr|Salut!|style{{=}}color:green}}: {{lang fr|Salut!|style=color:green}}
::And this is how to turn off italicizing, with {{tlx|lang|de|Hallo!|style{{=}}font-style:normal}}: {{lang|de|Hallo!|style=font-style:normal}}
::All are marked up in the (X)HTML properly as the language they are supposed to be. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 16:42, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Good idea; I'll add this to {{tlx|French/Inline word}} and possibly to {{tlx|French/Translations table}} instances via JavaScript. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 17:17, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::::{{tlx|French/Translations table}} is another example of a useful language template that can be &quot;standardized&quot; - eventually (I'm not ready for it yet) I'll want something similar for the Esperanto wikibook, at which point I'll probably use {{tlx|French/Translations table}} as a base. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 12:55, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

==Sources==

Would it be useful to draw up a common list of reliable sources for each language? (including printed and online resources.) Books sometimes reference Wikipedia but I see that some articles have been tagged as lacking sufficient sources e.g. [[Wikipedia:French_articles_and_determiners]]. I also find forums like about.com and Wordreference.com very useful, but can they be used as sources? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I use about.com a lot.  For vocabulary I mostly use wiktionary because I deem it more useful that non-collaborative dictionaries.  Grammar should be lying around in dictionary appendices. But I think a list of online sources at least would be good. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: I suppose the advantage of Wikipedia is that we are free to copy the material with suitable attributions. It just becomes a problem if it is deleted over there. Printed reference books have the advantage of stability over time, so I would say that they should be used in preference to online resources when naming sources for particular points of language. I have just bought &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; by Glanville Price which I think is the kind of authoritative text that all contributors should have to hand. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:43, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: A resource with content useful to all language books would make sense, but information regarding specific languages might be more useful on a contributor's guide for that book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:56, 25 December 2010 (UTC)

==Terminology==
I think the grammatical terminology in many references (including Wikipedia) is over-technical for direct use in our textbooks. Would it be useful to draw up a table mapping grammatical terminology onto plainer English phrases, which would be less offputting for the readers? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I'm not a native English speaker; thus, I'm very interested in this. I once wrote an introduction to Spanish grammar: [[Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_grammar]]. What do you think of its terminology? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:43, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Assuming that your target audience is the same as for the podcasts (people with credit cards), then I think your terminology is fine. Though perhaps &quot;denote&quot; sounds a bit mathematical, and you could use &quot;are used for&quot; or &quot;indicate&quot; instead. One GCSE school text book I have seen, goes to great pains to avoid technical terminology, even avoiding terms like &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;conjugation&quot;! You probably don't need to go that far for your audience, and if you have followed the style of the podcasts themselves then everything can be justified with reference to those. For material aimed at a younger audience, a bit of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; might be appropriate. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:58, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Do you think that it makes sense to avoid terms like &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;conjugation&quot;? After all, it doesn't hurt to learn the most basic grammar terms, does it? And no, the audience is not limited to people with credit cards (the only reason I am linking to a commercial web site is that the Creative Commons Attribution license requires me to do so). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 01:06, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Which terms to use depends on the target audience for each book, and conversely the terms used contribute to defining the target audience. I am just suggesting that we could label different grammatical terms as say &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;high&quot; difficulty and authors here could choose whatever level they thought was suitable for their book. Then if people were using source references with a more academic style than the style chosen for their book, they could easily map the terminology onto the appropriate level. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:34, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

: I doubt that would be productive. Decide whether the use of that term is useful and if so, then add a description to the language book directly, or improve Wikipedia if you reference it. If it can't be explained in-line, simpler terms won't cut it and a proper article with a detailed description and examples will be needed. There is a reason why we have the terminology.
: That said, this is a volunteer project. If you want to start such a reference, by all means do. Just realise the immense task and the small number of contributors. I'd encourage you to fix what we have rather than start another unfinished palace... --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:17, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

== Suggestions ==

Right off the bat, I'm sorry if creating this is a faux pas. I'm relatively new to the workings of Wiki sites, and I'm not familiar with the rules.
If everything's alright, I'll start. Other than the numerical ratings we're allowed to give, I haven't seen any areas where learners have given feedback on the content available at Wikibooks. There's no way to bring attention to the areas that need it. Provided that it's not some cardinal sin of Wikimedia, I'd like to start one so that those able to write may better know what to write.

Most sections of the [[Ukrainian]] book are heavier on examples than they are on rules. There are no guides to masculine/feminine, singular/plural, infinitive/past/present/future/command, and so on, and I find myself having to work with the (usually unclear) lessons I get from a Google search. If somebody familiar with the language could add more rules and exceptions to the book, especially the [[Ukrainian/Words|Ukrainian Words]] chapter, that would be much appreciated.
[[User:Ismailzali|Ismailzali]] ([[User talk:Ismailzali|talk]]) 15:12, 12 December 2010 (UTC)

: Welcome to Wikibooks and the world of wikis. There are few [[WB:PAG|rules]] but the best place to provide feedback is on the discussion page for the module (i.e. page) you're commenting on, or the main book talk page, should there be one. That said, most of the Wikibooks language books are dormant and lacking contributors. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:37, 15 December 2010 (UTC)

== A [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals#WikProject:_Linguistics|WikiProject Linguistics]]? ==

Would anybody be interested in starting one? --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 22:05, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

What about a wikibook about IPA? [[User:Galzigler|Galzigler]] ([[User talk:Galzigler|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Galzigler|contribs]]) 16:45, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

== Bengali Common Phrases on Wikibooks ==

It seems to me that the second column is actually the phonetic transcription of the Bengali phrase, and the fourth column is the transliteration of the Bengali Script.  Please verify.

=Introduction=

The physical nature of engineering materials can be described by a set of measurable properties.  This chapter defines these measures and discusses their implications in a broad sense.  It also covers Material Science, i.e. the science of producing materials with intended properties, and outlines different types of engineering materials and their characteristic qualities.  Later in the book, some of these matters will be further investigated by the powerful theories of Continuum Mechanics, FEM etc., which will bring a much more potent and general understanding of solid materials.

=Introduction=

This section covers both qualitative and quantifiable physical properties of solids.

A viable knowledge of mechanical engineering rests on a basic understanding of engineering materials; and the behavior of such materials is the empirical foundation upon which the entire science of solid mechanics is built.  Although this is the very beginning, a basin of information is presented that facilitate powerful and sophisticated reasoning by even the simplest means.

=Introduction=

All solid materials display an approximately linear response to moderate loads.  This is manifested in Hooke's law:

 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x = \frac{\sigma_x - \nu (\sigma_y + \sigma_z)}{E} &lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_y = \frac{\sigma_y - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_z)}{E}  &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_z = \frac{\sigma_z - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_y)}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=&lt;/math&gt; the normal stress&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E=&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus (Young's modulus)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=&lt;/math&gt; the normal tension

The figure below illustrates the stress-strain curve of some material.  Hooke's law is valid in the linear interval marked &quot;Elastic region&quot;.  The term elastic, as in elastic deformation, refers to the absence of energy dissipation and permanent deformation.  Elastic deformations retract upon unloading.  &lt;br&gt;

Young's modulus can be measured by tensile testing of specimens such as the one in the picture below.  

[[File:Traction sample.png|thumb|center|300px|Tensile testing.]]&lt;br&gt;

Equation (1) gives

 &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \epsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

Although, the procedure may seem perfectly straight forward at a glimpse, there are certain things that should be noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Broad Implications=

As is the case with many elementary physical laws, Hooke's law, stating the linear correlation between load and deformation, spans the small and simple, and the big and complex.  For instance, the theory is a good approximation of simple test specimens subjected to axial loading.  Naturally, it is also an accurate physical model for linear springs.  And it is even valid for very complex structures, so long as they respond linearly.  These are all trivial and perhaps self-evident statements, yet they are powerful and important.   

==Load and Stress==

To expand on this, let's consider an initially stress free quasi-static linear-elastic mechanical system that is subjected to one load &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; which has some fixed direction and point of application.  The global equilibrium of the system is sustained by a pattern of internal stresses in the structure.  The specific shape of the stress pattern is required to achieve equilibrium at each point in the structure.  That is, if the stress magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; at some point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; differed from the equilibrium state &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; by a factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the system would automatically strive to reach the unique pattern of equilibrium.  One could however obtain a new equilibrium state that abides the new condition at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by altering the stress levels in the material surrounding &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by the same factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  A state of equilibrium is thus reached if

\begin{equation} \sigma_i = k \sigma_{i0} \end{equation}

If the refactoring of the stress magnitudes is propagated throughout the system, including the point at which the load is applied, global equilibrium will be achieved.  Consequently, also the magnitude of the load itself would have to be altered by the factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in this scenario.  Hence we can write

&lt;math&gt; F = k F_0 &lt;/math&gt;     (2)

Equation () and () yields

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_{i0} F}{F_0} = k_i F&lt;/math&gt;     (3)

Where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. &lt;br&gt;

Equation () is only true if the normalized stress pattern is unaffected by the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; in the considered interval.  If instead, the system is nonlinear, i.e. responds differently depending on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt;, equation () is not be true/reliable.

==Load and Strain==

Moreover, Hookes law and equation () gives us

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{xi} = \frac{\sigma_{xi} - \nu (\sigma_{yi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{xi} - \nu (k_{yi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{xi} &lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{yi} = \frac{\sigma_{yi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{yi} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{zi} = \frac{\sigma_{zi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{yi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{yi})}{E} = F k'_{zi} &lt;/math&gt;

==Load and Displacement==

Let's consider a path &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; that runs through a continuous linear elastic body.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; has two endpoints &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The relative change &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; in distance in some direction between the two points can be formulated

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F \int_{P_1}^{P_2} \! k(s) \, ds = F k_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Strain==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k'_i} \epsilon_i = k'_{i12} \epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Stress==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k_i} \sigma_i = k_{i12} \sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalization==

Moving on to a more general point of view, we state the following definition 

&lt;math&gt;\psi = C \psi' &lt;/math&gt;     (3) 

Where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi'&lt;/math&gt; are some linearly dependent structural measures at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

From equation (3) and the superposition principle we conclude that

 &lt;math&gt;\psi = c_0 + c_1 \psi'_1 + c_2 \psi'_2 +...+ c_{n-1} \psi'_{n-1} + c_n \psi'_n&lt;/math&gt;     (4) 

The independent parameters of (4) can be obtained by performing &lt;math&gt;&gt;=n&lt;/math&gt; tests/calculations.  It follows that it is easy to, for instance, scale linear test results according to different safety factors.

It is important to know whether or not the structure is linear before drawing any critical conclusions from the theory of elasticity.  Common sources of non-linear behavior in a structure are material, geometric, contact and dynamic effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Additional Aspects=

The simplistic view on elasticity presented in this section is useful in many ways. It should be noted however, that it is incomplete. The chapter &lt;i&gt;Continuum Mechanics&lt;/i&gt; presents a theory of how 2D and 3D stress and strain fields interact.  Moreover, the material property &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, may be influenced by several factors, including: temperature, aging and rate of deformation. Therefore, keep in mind that there is more to come on this subject later on in the book.

A material's capacity to endure plastic deformation without breaking is called ductility.  Mild steel, copper and gold are all examples of ductile materials.  

The picture to the left displays a test specimen which has undergone a ductile failure during tensile load.

This looks to me like a violation of [[WB:HOST]].  So I'm bringing it here to get a reading on the question from the Wikibooks community. [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:35, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''': I've been studying the [[WB:HOST]], and I agree, in a strict sense it violate the paragraph of not publishing original research, there is text in the book which has never been published before. On the other hand most of the material in the book has been published in newspapers, radio programs, music articles and program notes for the scores, and the book is an attempt to collect all the different material in one place. We are very few who contributes to the book, and the main purpose of my contribution is to illustrate the text with scores and sound samples, which needs to be given the right license etc. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 07:55, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''': Relevance of the book: An important tool in a composers development is the study of contemporary techniques of other composer, for inspiration or rejection, which makes a few but dedicated readers to the book. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 08:07, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} I think the operative text is '''Wikibooks pages are not Personal homepages.''' The issue is, I think, that we have a user with the name &quot;Martin Lohse&quot; writing a book about one &quot;Martin Lohse&quot;, a still-living composer. We do not know that the two &quot;Martin Lohse&quot;'s are the same person; a researcher could have taken his subject's name as a form of tribute. Not that that matters much; given the name similarity, we can assume identity for the nonce. In that case, is this work on Martin Lohse of academic value? Are there courses outside of Martin Lohse's studio that teach his music, and could this text be of use in such courses? I think that is what would distinguish a self-published academic work from a vanity homepage. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 08:15, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} While the concerns about [[WB:HOST]] are justified, I feel the proposal of the book is not necessarily a violation of project scope. It is definitely possible to present and discuss a topic starting from a particular application or a case study. Two loosely-related examples:
:* In a teacher-formation university course (don't know what the proper English term for that is) one could have a course on psychology of education entitled &quot;Psychoanalysis, Education and Culture&quot;. While the works on education written from the perspective of psychoanalysis are just a small subset of the overall body of knowledge in the area of psychology of education, studying them provides a framework for reflections about general, overarching questions on the subject.
:* Compare the following two wikibooks on the Haskell programming language: [[Haskell]] and [[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]]. Both of them are intended to be tools for learning the language. While the former follows a more conventional textbook style, the latter proposes a rather arcane concrete task and presents the features and workings of Haskell as they are needed to perform the task. The approaches are very different, and aimed at different audiences, but are perfectly valid (both books are featured, BTW).
:In this spirit, a book that presented an overview and discussion of composition techniques in contemporary classical music using the works of Martin Lohse as a case study would, if properly referenced, be a valid proposition. That would probably require important changes in writing tone in some of the pages in order to &quot;de-personalize&quot; the text (and of course a renaming of the book), but such changes sound quite feasible at this point.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 19:14, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} There is some valid content there but the name and scope should be altered. Something in the lines &quot;The classical composer&quot;. I mostly agree with [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] but there are some particularities that make this even more problematic than the examples given. Sadly the author decided to focus the work only on this one subject recent creations, this can be seen as blatant self promotion or at least not having a NPOV and being OR, that puts in check any validity the project could have as an educational aid. There is still few content in there so I would be happy in having the book tagged as a breaking NPOV to see if the editor understands and fixes the issues, the project with the right editor could be extremely useful...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:53, 29 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' - I have warned the author of OR, so I hope he will cite his sources to avoid being accused of it. However, OR and NPOV seem to be the only problems that I see. To a certain extent it can act as a self-study book for music enthusiasts. If it ''is'' a personal homepage, though, the book would focus on his life rather than his musical techniques.

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity. The book could be improved and has valid content separating it from the strict scope it has is fundamental to be of any value here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:37, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity - it would have the additional benefit of giving the authors more leeway to structure the contents and interaction with &quot;developing composers&quot;. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 12:42, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:'''Transwiki''' - gee, why hadn't I thought of that? :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity. It's a good idea, what is the best way to make the transfer? For now, it would be nice to make the book with the contents as it is, and maybe later it would be possible to use some of the contents for a more general book about contemporary techniques in classical music, which, I think, could be a great book on wikibook.

I personally don't like this book. It is filled with nothing but four pictures. The first one is a funny-looking copyleft picture. The second one is a strange public domain pirate. The third one is a really odd mad scientist picture - looks like a copyvio of Dr Twobrains of WordGirl, in fact. &lt;/sarcasm&gt; The last one is the Wikipe-tan which I personally dislike and is not that suitable for Wikijunior. There is no target scope defined. Also, as a reference for everyone the previous nomination is at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Wikijunior:Coloring Book]], which I unfortunately was unable to participate in as I was at Wikipedia at the time. Also, as a 'reply' to Swift's comment in that discussion, I don't think colouring is anything but a preschool activity, which is intended to be fun for kids rather than educational.

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. My position remains the same as before; see the previous discussion for details, but it boils down to this not being textbook material.  ''What does it teach?''  The answer: nothing.  Why don't we make a book with crossword puzzles or a book with [[w:Sudoku|Sudoku]] puzzles?  That's not what Wikibooks is and I don't support this book, unchanged since a single creation edit in May 2007, being kept. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' nothing has changed since the last discussion in 3 March 2010. It seems to me that rehashing the discussion to be premature at this time, with all considerations to Kayau and Adrignola opinions. It was established that the work was inside the parameters of acceptable content (textbook is not a requirement of Wikijunior). Taste even if an acceptable argument will always have a low impact on the outcome of RfDs (consider what could happen otherwise) and regarding the educational value of this type of books it has also been addressed in the previous discussion.
:In any case since all images are now on commons, so no content will be lost, if we get a participation on this discussion of a similar size of the previous one, if I'm blocking, I'll change my vote.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:29, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I agree that nothing has changed since last time. Wikijunior does not require that books be textbooks, or in fact require books to be educational. Wikijunior books are only required to be fun for kids, which this book is for the right age group. I could also urge that for the right age group this book is educational because kids learn to color and to use their imagination. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:05, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
::Wikijunior is for educational material, period.  The original grant on which it was established was for education, and {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:What is Wikijunior]]}} still makes it IMO quite clear that the purpose of Wikijunior is educational.  A non-educational project would be something completely different from the current project.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:36, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:Non-binding [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - There are two separate issues to consider here. The first one is that pre-school activities like colouring ''are'' educational. Otherwise why would teachers have the kids doing them? From my non-specialist point of view, I would go as far as saying that teaching colours and having the children exercise their creativity are just as important goals as, say, introducing them to maths. The &quot;not a textbook&quot; argument does not apply either - not standing as a standalone reading material for kids is not a problem; after all, pretty much any educational material for small kids will be meant to be used with supervision of teachers/parents/etc. That being said, I agree that this book qualifies as an undeveloped stub, given that it has just pictures without elaborating any useful context for kids or educators (and the pictures don't look that great for their intended purpose, either). For that reason, I state my vote as weak/non-binding, in the same spirit of Panic's. An alternative possibility to a keep/delete outcome would be a merge to some book in the vein of [[Wikijunior:Colors]], maybe as a page discretely linked from the [[Wikijunior:Colors/For Parents|For Parents]] page as an &quot;additional resource&quot;. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 14:45, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  Reason for nomination last time was that this book is not educational, and the general sense seemed to be that coloring books are somewhat educational, some more than others, and this one needs improvement.  This seemed reasonable to me, as nominator that time around.  No book should be subjected to frequent RFDs for a non-urgent reason (for one thing it's apt to generate a certain level of background sympathy for the book), but especially not when the prospect of eventual improvement was woven into the arguments for keeping it.  It wouldn't be taken amiss if, at ''very'' long intervals (think, four or six months), one were to ping the community at the projects reading room about the need to improve this book.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:36, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Tanks for putting it into words. I would support an addition to the deletion policy to protect books being repeatedly nominated for RfD. Not only is the reasons you state above valid, but it also unbalances the RfD process. Considering that after a deletion it is required to open a undeletion process and a Keep can be simply restarted. Some time protection could work, but consider the work under discussion, no change was made to the work or project rules, the statement made in the first discussion remain valid (probably making the arguments on past discussion count to the renewed process would work). I think putting some stronger words on the policy so to avoid rehashing would suffice, since this discussion outcome would probably be expected by a more experienced Wikibookian. As the active majority, extra care is needed to avoid creating unbalances and inconsistencies as they will always be unfair and disruptive.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:22, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

[[File:Definition of equivalent width.jpg|thumb|A diagram indicating the equivalent width corresponding to the absorption line, which is shown in red.]]

The '''equivalent width''' of a [[spectral line]] is a measure of the of the area of the line on plot of [[luminous intensity|intensity]] versus [[wavelength]]. It is found by forming a rectangle with a height equal to that of continuum emission, and finding the width such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area in the spectral line. It is a measure of the strength of spectral features that is primarily used in [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;co&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Carroll, Bradly; Ostlie, Dale | title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics | publisher = Pearson Addison-Wesley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0321442849 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zaSpQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Formally, the equivalent width is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;W_\lambda = \int (1 - F_\lambda / F_0) d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;formation_of_stars&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Stahler, Steven; Palla, Francesco | title = The Formation of Stars | publisher = Wiley-VCH | isbn = 3527405593 | year = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Cx98QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; represents the continuum intensity on either side of the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] (or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]) feature, while &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the intensity across the entire wavelength range of interest. Then &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the width of a hypothetical line which drops to an intensity of zero and has the &quot;same integrated flux deficit from the continuum as the true one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;formation_of_stars&quot;/&gt; This equation can be applied to either emission or absorption, but when applied to emission, the value of &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and so the absolute value is used.

==Applications==
The equivalent width is used as a quantitative measure of the strength of spectral features. The equivalent width is a convenient choice because the shapes of spectral features can vary depending upon the configuration of the system which is producing the lines. For instance, the line may experience [[Doppler broadening]] due to motions of the gas emitting the photons. The photons will be shifted away from the line center, thus rendering the height of the emission line a poor measure of its overall strength. The equivalent width, on the other hand, &quot;measures the fraction of energy removed from the spectrum by the line,&quot; regardless of the broadening intrinsic to the line or a detector with poor [[spectral resolution|resolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spitzer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Spitzer, Lyman | title = Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 1998 | isbn = 0471022322 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YPG3AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the equivalent width can in many conditions yield the number of absorbing or emitting atoms.&lt;ref name = &quot;co&quot;/&gt;

Measurements of the equivalent width of the [[Balmer series|Balmer alpha]] transition in [[T Tauri star]]s are used in order to classify individual T Tauri stars as being classical or weak-lined.&lt;ref name=&quot;formation_of_stars&quot;/&gt; The equivalent width can also be used in studying [[star formation]] in [[Lyman series|Lyman alpha]] [[galaxy|galaxies]], as the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha line is related to the star formation rate in the galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;lae&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dijkstra, Mark; Westra, Eduard | title = Star formation indicators and line equivalent width in Lya galaxies | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 401 | issue = 4 | pages = 2343–2348 | year = 2010 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.401.2343D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ernst angle  is the flip angle (a.k.a. &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;nutation&quot; angle) for a particular spin that gives the maximal signal in the least amount of time when signal averaging over many transients. This relationship was developed by Richard Ernst, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1991/|title=1991 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1719961|title=Application of Fourier transform spectroscopy to magnetic resonance (1966) Rev. Sci. Inst. v.37, p.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following equation relates the Ernst angle, theta, to the experimental interpulse delay, d1; the duration of the free induction decay, aka &quot;acquisition time&quot;, or &quot;at&quot;; and the longitudinal relaxation time of the spin in question, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;cos(\theta)=e^{-(d1+at)/T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if one wishes to get the best signal from a resonance with T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=3 sec, and one wishes to use d1=1sec and at=2sec, the optimal tip angle is 68 degrees.

This relationship is especially important in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where interscan delays (d1) and acquisition times (at) are often short relative to the signal's T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; value. In MRI, there is typically just one resonance being observed - H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O - and the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O depends on its local environment. Note that d1 and at together may be referred to collectively as TR in the MRI community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''excitation wavelength''' describes the light shone on a sample to transfer energy to (&quot;to excite&quot;) a light-reactive chemical group in any compound. Its unit is usually given in nanometers (nm). 

An example is the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which can be excited with light of 488&amp;nbsp;nm, to induce a fluorescence at 509&amp;nbsp;nm.

Excitation wavelength is based upon how much energy a specific group can absorb and reemit.  Energy, however, can only be transferred in discrete units called quanta.  Based upon the electron configuration of each chemical group, its electrons will be able to absorb a certain amount of quanta and move up in energy level.  Upon returning to their original states, the electrons release more of these packets of energy, though at a different level.  The release of this energy is the level of fluorescence achieved.

Can someone clean up this bit under Timers, please?
&quot;You can see some of the 8086 compatible timer chips like 8253/54 also they are the same have three independent timers internally but 8254 can work with higher frequencies and is used to generate interrupt like Memory refresh interrupt ,Time of day TOD interrupt and the last one is used to generate the speaker frequencies.&quot;

: Using an e-mail client you may send out and receive messages from all your e-mail accounts.
: Most e-mail applications have a lot of useful additional functions such as: message management,
: junk filtering, spell checking, more skins, security, and add-ons.


== Thunderbird ==
: One of e-mail clients is Mozilla Thunderbird, for Debian known as Icedove.
: Installation:
 apt-get install icedove
: Run it from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Icedove Mail/News.

:1. Type your name, e-mail address and password, then press &quot;Continue&quot;. 
[[File:Mail1.png|center|600px]]
::a. Account creator will find your e-mail server details itself.
[[File:Mail2.png|center|600px]]
::b. If not enter to Manual configuration and type your server details manually. 
[[File:Mail3.png|center|600px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Mail4.png|center|600px]]
:: If you don't know that, check it on your e-mail account help web side.
:2. Click on &quot;Get Mail&quot; to receive your messages.
:3. You may change all setting entering: Local Folders-&gt; View settings for this account:
::a. Server settings: change Connection security for SSL/TLS or STARTTLS.

: Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird


== E-mail panel applet ==
: If you want to be up to date with your e-mails all the time I suggest to use Mail Watcher applet.

:5. External Programs-&gt; Run on click: choose an e-mail application to run: icedove (or any).
[[File:Mail8.png|center|300px]]
: In a case the applet is not installed do it yourself:
 apt-get install xfce4-mailwatch-plugin


== Others ==
: You can choose different application of course such as:
# For GNOME environment - Evolution: http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/,on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_%28software%29

Pluggable functions were introduced in [[Version 1.5.1|WordPress 1.5.1]] These functions let you override certain core functions via [[Plugin API|plugins]]. The most up-to-date list of core functions that WordPress allows plugins to override is available in &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/pluggable.php&lt;/code&gt;. WordPress loads the built-in functions only if they are undefined after all plugins have been loaded.

'''Note:''' A function can only be reassigned this way once, so you can’t install two plugins that plug the same function for different reasons. For safety, it is best to always wrap your functions with &lt;code&gt;if ( !function_exists() )&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise you '''will''' produce fatal errors on plugin activation.

== Reference ==

; [[Function_Reference/get_currentuserinfo|&lt;tt&gt;get_currentuserinfo()&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Grabs the information of the current logged in user, if there is one.  Essentially a wrapper for get_userdata(), but it also stores information in global variables.
; [[Function_Reference/get_userdata|&lt;tt&gt;get_userdata($userid)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Pulls user information for the specified user from the database.
; &lt;tt&gt;get_userdatabylogin($user_login)&lt;/tt&gt; : Pulls user information for the specified user from the database.
; [[Function Reference/wp_mail|&lt;tt&gt;wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : A convenient wrapper for PHP's mail function.
; &lt;tt&gt;wp_login($username, $password, $already_md5 = false)&lt;/tt&gt; : Returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if the specified username and password correspond to a registered user.
; &lt;tt&gt;auth_redirect()&lt;/tt&gt; : If a user is not logged in, he or she will be redirected to WordPress' login page before being allowed to access content on the page from which this function was called.  Upon successfully logging in, the user is sent back to the page in question.
; [[Function Reference/wp_redirect|&lt;tt&gt;wp_redirect($location)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Redirects a browser to the ''absolute URI'' specified by the &lt;tt&gt;$location&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;wp_setcookie($username, $password, $already_md5 = false, $home = '', $siteurl = '')&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; : Sets the WordPress cookies for a logged in user.  See [[WordPress Cookies]].

== Example ==
 
An example of what you can do with a pluggable function is replace the default email handler. To do this, you'd need to write a plugin that defines a &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; function. The default &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; function looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
function wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = '') {
  if( $headers == '' ) {
    $headers = &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0\n&quot; .
      &quot;From: &quot; . get_settings('admin_email') . &quot;\n&quot; . 
      &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\&quot;&quot; . get_settings('blog_charset') . &quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  return @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

But, for example, if you wanted to CC all your mail to another address, you could use this code in a plugin:

&lt;pre&gt;
if(!function_exists('wp_mail')) :
function wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = '') {
  if( $headers == '' ) {
    $headers = &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0\n&quot; .
      &quot;From: &quot; . get_settings('admin_email') . &quot;\n&quot; . 
      &quot;Cc: dummy@example.com\n&quot;;
      &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\&quot;&quot; . get_settings('blog_charset') . &quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  return @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
}
endif;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that if you plug a core function like this the original is no longer available. I.e., the elegant solution here would have been to write a function that tacks our Cc header on the end of the exising &lt;tt&gt;$headers&lt;/tt&gt; string then call the original &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; with the extra header. However this would not work as the original &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist if you plug it.</text>

Hello, and thanks for removing the duplicate note I had left in &quot;Next Steps&quot;. As you probably noticed, Haskell Basics is a bit of
a mess due to active refurbishing going on. Feedback and/or contributions are more than welcome :)

WPBannerMeta can be used at varying levels of complexity, from the very simple to the extremely complicated. Simple options are listed here first, with complexity increasing down the page. 

WPBannerMeta takes two different types of parameters, formatting and display. The formatting parameters customise the meta-template for a particular project, defining link targets, categories, images and text. All formatting parameters use UPPERCASE and underscores (_), instead of spaces (eg. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|PROJECT=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|NOTE_1_CAT= &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). Display parameters customize the template output for each individual ''page'' that the banner is displayed on. These are the parameters which are entered on the talk page (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|quality=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|priority=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and they must be 'passed through' the project banner to the meta-template underneath. To 'pass' the parameter &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, you need to include the code {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;foo={{{foo|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}.

In the examples below, a WikiProject banner will be constructed for the WikiProject Languages.  

===Simple options===
*&lt;code&gt;'''PROJECT'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)''&amp;nbsp;– the name of the project without the word &quot;WikiProject&quot;, used in a variety of contexts; first letter should usually be capitalized. {{nowrap|''Eg: &lt;code&gt;'''Tulips'''&lt;/code&gt;''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''substcheck'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this allows the template to detect if it has been substituted instead of transcluded and give an error message. '''''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;substcheck=&lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;substcheck}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''
**&lt;code&gt;'''small'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the size parameter ''must'' be passed through the template to enable the correct display. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;small={{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''category'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'category' parameter ''must'' be passed through the template to enable category optout. ''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;category={{{category|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''.
**&lt;code&gt;'''listas'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'listas' parameter ''must'' be passed through the template. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;listas={{{listas|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;BANNER_NAME={{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the full page name of the banner. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Template:WikiProject Languages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''PROJECT_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; it is assumed that the project is located at '''&lt;code&gt;&quot;Wikibooks:WikiProject &amp;lt;PROJECT&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;'''. If this is not the case, then define the full link to the project page in this parameter. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_LEFT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the location of an image to use in the top-left corner of the banner. '''''Do not''''' include the &quot;''File:''&quot; prefix. Images used on WikiProject banners '''''must''''' be free images&amp;nbsp;– [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free_use|fair use]] images are '''''not''''' permitted. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;[[:File:Globe of letters.svg|Globe of letters.svg]]&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_LEFT_SMALL'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of &lt;code&gt;IMAGE_LEFT&lt;/code&gt;, when the banner is displayed in 'small style'. Default is 40px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;25px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_LEFT_LARGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of &lt;code&gt;IMAGE_LEFT&lt;/code&gt; in normal display. Default is 80px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;50px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_RIGHT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the location of an image to use in the top-right corner of the banner. '''''Do not''''' include the &quot;''File:''&quot; prefix. Images used on WikiProject banners '''''must''''' be free images&amp;nbsp;– [[WB:FU|fair use]] images are '''''not''''' permitted. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;[[:File:Globe of letters.svg|Globe of letters.svg]]&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_RIGHT_SMALL'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of &lt;code&gt;IMAGE_RIGHT&lt;/code&gt;, when the banner is displayed in 'small style'. Default is 40px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;25px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_RIGHT_LARGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of &lt;code&gt;IMAGE_RIGHT&lt;/code&gt; in normal display. Default is 80px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;50px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}

===Assessment===
Many projects use an assessment schema to grade their pages by quality and a corresponding priority scale to place their pages in order of priority.
*&lt;code&gt;'''quality'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)''&amp;ndash; the quality parameter must be passed through, if the quality scale is used. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;quality={{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''QUALITY_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; configures the quality scale; possible options are:
***standard &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' quality scale (FB, A, B, C, Start, Stub, NB). (This is the default behavior, if the ''quality'' parameter is used.)
***extended &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' quality scale plus some additional values (Category, Subject, Project and Template).
***inline &amp;ndash; allows for a simple custom quality scale to be used, generally used with {{tl|Quality mask}}.
***subpage &amp;ndash; allows for a more complex custom quality scale to be used using a subpage called ''/quality''. See [[#Custom masks|custom masks]] below for further details.
*&lt;code&gt;'''priority'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the standard priority scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, NB, Unknown). {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''importance'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the standard importance scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, NB, Unknown). {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}} Only one of the priority/importance parameters should be used.
**&lt;code&gt;'''priority_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; configures the priority/importance scale, if used. The possible options are:
***standard &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' priority scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, Bottom, NB and Unknown). (This is the default behavior.)
***inline &amp;ndash; allows for a simple custom priority or importance scale to be defined, generally with {{tl|Priority mask}}.
***subpage &amp;ndash; allows for a more complex custom priority/importance scale to be used using a subpage called ''/priority''.
*&lt;code&gt;'''ASSESSMENT_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the link to a WikiProject-specific quality (and/or priority) scale. If there is a page at '''&lt;code&gt;&quot;Wikibooks:WikiProject &amp;lt;PROJECTLINK&gt;/Assessment&quot;&lt;/code&gt;''' then this will be used by default. To override this, you can set this parameter to '''no'''.
*&lt;code&gt;'''ASSESSMENT_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pages are sorted into categories based on their quality; so pages in featured books on languages would be categorized by default into ''Category:FB-quality languages pages''. If this parameter is defined, featured pages would instead be categorized into Category:FB-quality &lt;code&gt;ASSESSMENT_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:FB-quality language pages]]''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''COMMENTS'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; some projects may want to use a subpage of the page's talk page to post brief, assessment-related comments about the page. If these comments are placed in a &quot;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FULLPAGENAME}}/Comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''&quot; subpage, then this parameter will cause the banner to automatically display. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''COMMENTS_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if this parameter is defined, pages which have comments are sorted into Category:&lt;code&gt;COMMENTS_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, these pages are categorized into Category:&lt;tt&gt;PROJECT&lt;/tt&gt; pages with comments. {{nowrap|''Eg: (alternate) '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages with comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → Category:Language pages with comments}}''. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.

===Alerts and notes===
Built into WPBannerMeta is the ability to display a number of other fields that contain useful information about the page. There are also three predefined fields for:
# pages in need of immediate attention;
# pages in need of an |infobox.
The parameters are:
*&lt;code&gt;'''attention'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to enable the use of the attention note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;attention={{{attention|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|attention=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page.
**&lt;code&gt;'''ATTENTION_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying the attention note will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;ATTENTION_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, they are categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;PROJECT&lt;/code&gt; pages needing attention. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing attention&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing attention]]''}}. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.
*&lt;code&gt;'''infobox'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to enable the use of the needs-infobox note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;infobox={{{needs-infobox|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|needs-infobox=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page.
**&lt;code&gt;'''INFOBOX_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying the needs-infobox note will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;INFOBOX_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, they are categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;PROJECT&lt;/code&gt; pages needing infoboxes. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing infoboxes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing infoboxes]]''}}. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.
*&lt;code&gt;'''note 1'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to trigger any defined note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;note 1={{{needs-photo|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|needs-photo=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page. Up to ten notes can be specified in the core banner.
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_TEXT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the text of note 1. ''Eg: This page needs a sound bite from a native speaker''. If this is left blank there is no visual output.
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_IMAGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an image can be defined for each note. Remember that all images '''''must''''' be free, not fair-use.  {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Crystal Clear app kaboodle.png&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_FORMAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; optional formatting (color, etc.) for the table cell which contains the image, if any, for the note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:blue&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying note 1 will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;NOTE_1_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing sound bites&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing sound bites]]}}''
*&lt;code&gt;'''COLLAPSED'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; when more than a threshold number of notes and alerts are triggered on a page, they are automagically collapsed into a show/hide box.  The threshold number can be customized by setting this parameter to the maximum number of notes on a page that will ''not'' trigger the collapse.  The default is 3, so if three notes are triggered on a page, they will not be collapsed, but if a fourth is also triggered, the collapse box appears.  So setting {{para|COLLAPSED|0}} will ''always'' create a collapse box (if there are any notes to fill it), while {{para|COLLAPSED|999}} will never trigger a collapse box. See also the [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter|/notecounter hook]]. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;6&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of the image used for the icons. (It is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width, which results in a neater banner because all rows have equal height.) The default is a height of 25px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}

===Task forces===
WPBannerMeta can accommodate up to five task forces, each with its own image, links and importance scale, if desired. The following parameters are available:
*&lt;code&gt;'''tf 1'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this parameter ''must'' be passed through to enable and trigger the display of the task force section. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1={{{french|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the full page name of the task force's project page. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/French language task force&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_NAME'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the way the task force's name will appear in its piped link; redundant when {{para|TF_1_TEXT}} is used. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the French language task force&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_NESTED'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, a link of the form &quot;'''/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{{TF_1_LINK}}}|{{{TF_1_NESTED}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&quot; is added after the main project's name when the banner is collapsed inside a {{tl|WikiProjectBannerShell}}. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_TEXT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, replaces the default &quot;This page is supported by...&quot; text. ''Eg:&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;This page is within the scope of the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/French task force|French task force]]. New members are always welcome!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''''' If defined to be &quot;none&quot;, then no output will be displayed, although appropriate categories will still be added.
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_IMAGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an image can be defined for each task force. Remember that all images '''''must''''' be free, not fair-use. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_QUALITY'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, enables the quality categorizations for the main project (eg: Category:FB-quality language pages) to be duplicated for the task force. The quality arising from {{para|quality}} and {{para|QUALITY_SCALE}} will be used; {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''tf 1 priority'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the use of a separate priority (or importance, if used) scale for the task force.{{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1 priority={{{french-priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_ASSESSMENT_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required if quality or priority assessments are used)'' &amp;ndash; the assessment category to be used for the task force-specific quality and priority assessments. Identical in syntax to {{para|ASSESSMENT_CAT}}. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:FB-quality French language pages]]}}''
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_MAIN_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying &quot;tf 1&quot; will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;TF_1_MAIN_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:French language pages]]''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''TF_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of the taskforce icons. (It is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width, which results in a neater banner because all rows have equal height.) The default is a height of 25px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}

==Advanced features==
===Hooks===
{{see also|Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks}}
WPBannerMeta incorporates a number of 'hooks' where advanced or customized features can be added. These should take the form of a subtemplate passed to the relevant hook parameter. Any relevant parameters should then be passed to the hook template &amp;ndash; it may be necessary to repeat parameters that are already passed to the main template ({{para|category|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{category|¬}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{para|quality|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are commonly used). If you write a hook that you think other projects could use, please copy or move it to a subpage of [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks]] and add it to the list on that page.

===Custom masks===
{{see also|Template:Quality mask/doc}}
WPBannerMeta uses a mask to normalize the values given to the {{para|quality}} parameter, to ensure that invalid inputs are discarded (e.g. {{para|quality|cheesecake}}) and that equivalent inputs appear the same (eg {{para|quality|FB}} and {{para|quality|fB}}).  This mask effectively controls which extended assessment scale values are accepted by the template (eg &quot;Template-quality&quot;, &quot;Project-quality&quot;, etc).  Projects which want to use more obscure assessment qualities or to ''not'' use all of the standard qualities (e.g. not using &quot;C-quality&quot;) can define their own custom mask, which will override WPBannerMeta's default.

==Other details==
This meta-template ''automatically'' categorizes all instances (i.e. specific project banners) into a subcategory of [[:Category:WikiProject banners]]. It is not necessary to include a category link in the documentation for each project banner.

The core WPBannerMeta template:
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/core|/core]]

To reduce the byte-count of banners that do not make full use of WPBannerMeta's features, most of the optional features are broken out into subpages:
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/comments|/comments]] &amp;ndash; the message which is displayed when {{para|COMMENTS|yes}} is defined.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/doc|/doc]] &amp;ndash; the documentation you are now reading.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/priorityscale|/priorityscale]] &amp;ndash; the priority classification system.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/priority|/priority]] &amp;ndash; used in conjunction with [[Template:Priority mask]] to normalize the value of the {{para|priority}} parameter.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/istemplate|/istemplate]] &amp;ndash; tests the type of the current page (i.e. book talk page, templatepage, or demonstration).
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/locwarning|/locwarning]] &amp;ndash; warns when the banner template is used on a non-talk page.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/substwarning|/substwarning]] &amp;ndash; warns when a banner template is substituted.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/note|/note]] &amp;ndash; an individual note.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/taskforce|/taskforce]] &amp;ndash; the code for each task force display.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/templatepage|/templatepage]] &amp;ndash; the categories and notes that only appear on the template page.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/qualityscale|/qualityscale]] &amp;ndash; the quality classification system.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/quality|/quality]] &amp;ndash; used in conjunction with [[Template:Quality mask]] to normalize the {{para|quality}} input.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|template shortcut}} template.

It can be used to show the names of shortcuts to a template.

It can take up to six shortcuts as parameters. 

=== Usage ===

If you want to indicate that &lt;nowiki&gt;{{uw-vandalism1}} has shortcuts named {{uw-v1}}, {{uw-vandal1}}, and {{uw-vand1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then you could use one of:

{{template shortcut|uw-v1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1}}
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1|uw-vandal1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1|uw-vandal1}}
{{clear}}

=== Additional parameters ===

This template has some additional parameters. 

&quot;float=left&quot; makes this template flow to the left of the page instead:

{{template shortcut|float=left|uw-v1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|float=left|uw-v1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

&quot;pre=something&quot;, &quot;pre2=something&quot; and &quot;pre3=something&quot; feeds some text to show before the shortcut links but within the braces. This is mostly used to indicate that the template should be used with substitution. Then you can do like this:

{{template shortcut|pre=subst:|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|pre=subst:|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|pre2=subst:|uw-vand1|pre3=subst:|uw-vandal1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|uw-v1|pre2=subst:|uw-vand1|pre3=subst:|uw-vandal1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Usage ===

This template inserts a left-floating transparent div that matches the right-floating div created by the CollapsibleTables javascript code.  It can be added to the header cells of tables to ensure that the header text remains centrally-aligned; otherwise the right-floating div can 'push' the header text slightly to the left.

''Please note that this is a hack.''

Template to produce single or multiple non-breaking spaces (&quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;s). Uses {{tl|loop}}.

; Syntax : &lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{spaces|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''N''}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where the optional parameter ''N'' is the desired number of consecutive non-breaking spaces (numeric, with a range of 1 to 15).

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{spaces}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;produces a single non-breaking space. You may also use {{tl|nbsp}} (which redirects to this template) as a shortcut for a single non-breaking space.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template is designed for use in WikiProject banners, and provides an easy way to construct a bespoke class mask. The ''class'' parameter must be passed to the template as the first unnamed parameter.

===Implementation in [[Template:WPBannerMeta]]===
The template provides the default classification masks for a WikiProject's quality scales, and is also used by the majority of projects which use a custom quality mask. It can be used in two different ways:
*with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|subpage}} and placed on the /quality subpage of the WikiProject's banner template. In this case, specific guidance on how the template works with the chosen parameters is displayed on this page.
*with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}} and placed directly inside the ''quality'' parameter. However this method is ''not'' suitable for projects which use either of the following:

=== Use on subpages ===
When used on a /quality subpage (e.g. with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|subpage}}) the template should be called in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt; | {{{quality|}}}
 |topic=
 |optional parameters
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
This allows the [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage|/templatepage]] to be displayed which provides useful documentation and category prompts on the subpage.
* the ''topic'' parameter defines the main naming scheme of the assessment categories used by the project and is used to check the existence of the categories that are required. For example, if your project uses categories such as ''Category:B-Class mathematics pages'', etc. then set {{para|topic|mathematics}}.
** if the template uses taskforces, parameters ''topic1'', ''topic2'', ''topic3'', ''topic4'' and ''topic5'' can be used to check for the necessary categories.
 
Neither of the above are required for the {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}} version.

=== Inline use ===
When used &quot;inline&quot; (e.g. with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}}), the call to /templatepage and the ''topic'' parameters are not required, and the template should be called in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask | {{{quality|}}} | optional parameters }}&lt;/pre&gt;
Bear in mind that if the banner uses any hooks, you will need to set the options each time ''quality'' is used. Therefore the subpage method may be more useful in these cases.

=== Optional parameters ===
* ''FQS'' - if set to &quot;yes&quot;, switches on the following additional classifications. Individual classifications may then be switched off by setting their respective lowercase parameters (see below) to &quot;no&quot;.
** Project

* ''forceNB'' - if set to &quot;yes&quot;, will automatically classify pages tagged as {{para|quality|NB}} depending on the namespace of the page. The default setting is &quot;no&quot;.

=== The lowercase parameter syntax ===
Add a classification in '''lowercase''' as the name of a parameter followed by the value &quot;yes&quot;. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|project=yes&lt;/pre&gt;
would add the Project-classification. This is the simplest way of adding a classification but has the following two limitations:
* The name of the classification must have an initial capital letter and all following letters in lowercase. In other words, the capitalization must be of the form Xxxxxx.
* It is not possible to use this method to add a shortcut or alternative alias for a different classification, for example &quot;Sub&quot; for Subject-class.
If either of these are required, the upperclass parameter syntax must be used (see below).

If {{para|FQS|yes}} is used, then a value of &quot;no&quot; may be used to switch off that individual classification. Thus
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask|{{{quality|}}}
 |topic=physics
 |FQS=yes
 |subject=no
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
would support all of the additional classifications listed above ''except'' Subject-class.

=== The UPPERCASE parameter syntax ===
Add a classification in '''uppercase''' as the name of a parameter followed by the ''exact name'' of the classification (including the required case) as the value of the parameter. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|SL=SL&lt;/pre&gt;
would add SL-class and
&lt;pre&gt;|CHEESECAKE=CheeseCake&lt;/pre&gt;
would add CheeseCake-class.

You can use this method to add a shortcut or alias for a classification. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|bplus = yes
|B+ = Bplus&lt;/pre&gt;
would have the effect that an input of either B+ or Bplus would result in Bplus-class.

=== Example 1: subpage ===
The following code is placed in the banner template:
&lt;pre&gt;
|QUALITY_SCALE = subpage
 |quality = {{{quality|}}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
and on the /quality subpage, the following code is used:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{quality mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt; | {{{quality|}}}
 |topic=Zimbabwe
 |FQS=yes
 |redirect=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this case all of the &quot;extended&quot; quality classifications are used, plus the additional Redirect-class. Because the {{para|topic}} parameter is set, specific documentation will be displayed on the /quality subpage.

=== Example 2: inline ===
The following code is placed in the banner template:
&lt;pre&gt;
|QUALITY_SCALE = inline
 |quality = {{quality mask | {{{quality|}}} | category=yes }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the standard quality classifications are used, plus the additional Category-class.

=== Subtemplates ===
* [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage|/templatepage]] - the documentation that is displayed on /quality subpages
** [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage/row|/templatepage/row]] - used by /templatepage
* [[Template:Quality mask/doc|/doc]] - the documentation you are reading now
** [[Template:Quality mask/doc/custom|/doc/custom]] - for information on building your own quality mask

      <text xml:space="preserve">This template subpage contains a mask which normalizes the input passed to {{para|quality}}.  This can be thought of as the 'default' mask, but it is possible for banners to define their own individual masks with wider or fewer choices of acceptable inputs.  

If the page corresponding to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{BANNER_NAME}}}/quality&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; exists and &lt;code&gt;QUALITY_SCALE=subpage&lt;/code&gt; is set in the banner, then control is passed to the code on that page to normalize the input, and no modification is performed by the WPBannerMeta itself. The following parameter is available to be used:
*{{para|quality}}

Some caveats:
*{{tl|WPBannerMeta/qualityscale}} treats a null output from the mask as &quot;unassessed&quot;
*{{tl|WPBannerMeta/importancescale}} handles importance ratings differently when the mask outputs &quot;&lt;tt&gt;NB&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

Any alternative mask needs to be carefully designed to handle all inputs correctly, with care given to case-insentivity, etc.

{{important|Please '''do not''' just copy the contents of this subpage to create a custom mask.  If the banner does not need to have a significantly different handling of the {{para|quality}} inputs, then leave the default mask in place.}}

===Examples===

The following code accepts only the standard assessment scale with a few extras:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch:{{lc:{{{quality|}}}}}
 |fb       = FB
 |a        = A
 |b        = B
 |c        = C
 |start    = Start
 |stub     = Stub
 |template = Template
 |subject  = Subject
 |category = Category
 |project  = Project
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example using all classifications and namespace detection:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}
 |fb   = FB
 |a    = A
 |b    = B
 |c    = C
 |start= Start
 |stub = Stub
 |nb                   = NB
 |category|cat|categ   = Category
 |template|temp|templ  = Template
 |project              = Project
 |#default={{#switch:{{NAMESPACE}}
  |Category talk       = Category
  |Wikibooks talk      = Project
  |Subject talk        = Subject
  |Template talk       = Template
 }}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Generic self-documentation===
A minor problem with the examples above is that someone clicking the link from the banner template to see the custom mask will be presented with a blank page (you have to edit the page to see there's actually code). A simple solution is to add a local wrapper to your code, replacing the basic structure:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}

...

}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
with this one:
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;noinclude&gt;:''[[Template:WPBannerMeta#Custom masks|Custom mask]]
used by {{tl|{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}:''
&amp;lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt;{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}

...

}}&amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt;

--&gt;{{documentation|content=This page holds the custom quality mask for the [[Template:{{BASEPAGENAME}}]]. It uses {{tl|quality mask}}, a template for constructing quality masks according to individual WikiProjects' wishes. The following table shows the output of the mask, with the current parameter definitions, for different inputs and namespaces.

=== Classification based on ''quality'' parameter ===
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Input&lt;br /&gt;(not case-specific)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Icon&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Quality&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

}}&lt;/table&gt;

=== Classification based on namespace ===
In addition, if ''quality'' {{#ifeq:{{{forceNB}}}|yes|is equal to NB, or&amp;#32;}}is empty, undefined or unrecognized, then the classification will be deduced from the namespace of the page when possible.

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Namespace&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Icon&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Quality&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template is designed to be used by WikiProject banner templates to normalize the ''importance'' parameter.

The priorities ''top'', ''high'', ''mid'', and ''low'' may be enabled or disabled. However ''NB'' and ''Unknown'' may not be disabled.

=== Syntax ===
Typically this template should be placed on the /priority subpage of a WikiProject banner template.
&lt;pre&gt;{{priority mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt;
 |1={{{priority|}}}
 |quality={{{quality|}}}
 |top=
 |high=
 |mid=
 |low=
 |bottom=
 |no=
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
*&lt;code&gt;'''priority'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' this parameter must be passed as the first unnamed parameter in all cases.
*&lt;code&gt;'''quality'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'quality' parameter must be passed to allow the mask to automatically set the priority of non-book pages to NB. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;quality={{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
{{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''top'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Top-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''high'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''High-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''mid'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Mid-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''low'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Low-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.

The '''triple bowline''' can be used to make an improvised rope chair. The legs go in two loops and the torso goes in the third. To tie it, tie a [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]] with a [[Knots/Parts of the knot|bight]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all, thanks for checking out this book on DarkBASIC. It's the first WikiBook on the subject of DarkBASIC Programming. Not everyone can program, but in the information age I believe that it's necessary for everyone to gain the skills to use different types of technology. Especially, computers and programming. Today and for the next 30 days you'll learn a lot about DarkBASIC Programming and a lot about what you can accomplish using a computer. DarkBASIC is all about making DirectX do your evil bidding and your domination of the world of computer game programming. I hope you read and contribute to this book, as well as rant because then I can fix stuff others will insult. I hope you enjoy!

In this tutorial I'm going to assume you have no prior programming experience, or else you wouldn't be reading this book. You would pick up the manual, compare it to C++, and program in DarkBASIC easily. First of all not to scare you but game programming is not easy and secondly you are not going to make a &lt;insert copycat blockbuster game here&gt; killer or clone or whatever in DarkBASIC for a long time. I'm also going to assume you have v1.0 of the &quot;classic&quot; or non-pro edition of DarkBASIC or else with another version you'll have some problems running this code unfortunately. Programming is not a new concept, and there are many hundreds of languages such as DarkBASIC out there, one such programming language comparable to DarkBASIC is BlitzBASIC, and you may have heard of Visual Basic.

== So what is programming?  ==

This isn't a stupid question. Programming is not just making applications for Windows, or talking a language your computer understands. Programming is input, process, and output. If you take computer sciences, chances are you'll be doing program outlines, but right now you're a hobbyist programmer so let's keep it simple. Not all of us know VC++ or Pascal. DarkBASIC is game oriented. You can make applications in it, but it's harder.  There are no message boxes in the version we'll be using. But DarkBASIC is easy and fun, especially for beginner's and junior programmers. Instead of having to write 1000+ lines of code to put a 2d character on screen you'll write one, instead of writing a massive program to make a cube spin you'll write a simple and human readable one in 20 or less lines. If you have no patience, take it slow and easy and don't move on until you understand it all or else you'll be bald by the time you finish this wikibook. I will say this: this book is a work in progress. I'll be finished as soon as possible so, bare with me please. Programming is simply entering lines of code that once compiled, or is run, tells the computer to follow out a task until it's done. What's involved is input, or you programming; processing or computing; and finally output, what you get to see. 
[[Image:Input-process-output.JPG]]


'''Figure 1.1'''(This is the Model of Input, Process and Output.)
'''So you know:''' A coder is another word for a programmer.



All programs follow the above method, since every program is (1) certainly programmed, (2) is certainly compiled, and (3) certainly displays results. Now, just what is code then? Code is the recipe for your program. Computers won't do a task wrong. You'll do the task 
wrong. To keep your program from doing things that could harm computers, the compiler(or program that checks to see if the program works) runs the program and generates syntax errors (if there's something wrong). These syntax errors, tell you that you made a mistake and you must fix it before you can see your program(in most cases). So, computers don't make mistakes.

There are many sorts of errors also! The most common is called ''' a syntax error '''. A syntax error are mistakes in your program's code. A programming language like a written language is incorrect if it contains things that are gibberish. Like in English, asdfjdj is not a word, it's gibberish. Just like in DarkBASIC, print is a command, where as printf is not. Another kind of error is called a run-time error, this is when your program compiles but you don't get the results you want. Such as if your writing is sloppy, the word &quot;hello&quot; may look like jello and the person will get the wrong information from it. Run-time errors are things that aren't suppose to happen, like when in your favorite video game, when a character can sometimes walk through a wall, or the program crashing when this happens.


The process of fixing your mistakes is called debugging. You'll get familiar with this; half your time or more will be spent doing debugging. So as much as possible, save, compile, debug, and run. It'll save you lots of anger, and stress. Finally remember this: with computers, the language goes through assembly or getting put into binary, and sent back to your programming language. If the binary pattern is correct, then you have no syntax errors. Remember, 0s are off or false, and 1s are on or true. Remember when I said assembly above? 


Well, here's how it works. First off, you compile or check syntax, then the code you entered passes through what's called machine language or assembly (its name changes depending on what its doing when it's compiling its assembler). Then it becomes pure binary (which is not human readable but meant for computers; they cannot understand anything other than 0s and 1s). Then it is sent back to the compiler where if the binary matches what's correct, it gets executed. If it doesn't, you get a syntax error and must debug. Now, don't quote me on that but that's basically what happens. So now you're ready to begin programming in DarkBASIC and will know what I talk about.

One more thing: DarkBASIC is not case sensitive.  If you don't know what this means, it means that DarkBASIC does not distinguish between upper-case letters and lower-case ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alrighty, you came back. Good, let's hope you have played around with the DarkBASIC editor. Before you find out what the hello world tradition is (older programmers don't spoil it for them!), I think I should tell you something. The DarkBASIC editor is not very windows friendly, so make sure you download an IDE you like and then link it to the DarkBASIC. 

'''So you know:''' an IDE is an integrated development environment. It allows programming to be easier for professionals and beginners alike. For now, don't worry what an IDE is too much, you're only beginning after all.

Okay, now then time to get to the tradition.


''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;This is Dbtutor's wikibook on DarkBASIC Programming!!&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

Copy and paste this source code into the IDE or editor (whichever) and run it. What you get is the easiest program you'll ever write in DarkBASIC. The hello world example is proud tradition of beginning programmers, so let's carry it on. Hello World Program puts the text hello world on the screen. But what are the quotation marks for? The quotation marks are used to show what you want to put on the screen. Otherwise, it would look like one big command. 

'''Your Assignment:'''

Replace Hello World with any text you want&lt;br&gt;



First of all, I hope you completed the assignment above.  In case you haven't, or had problems with this program I'll show you how. Okay, let's say you want to print a couple of things and you need it spaced for readability. Remember I said that print, prints the things inside the quotes? Well they're called strings, now strings are characters that you can change and manipulate. With no string to technically print, you'll just get a blank space. Now for all on one line you use a semi-colon(;). Experiment with these two methods above until you understand them. In DarkBASIC, your program already ends on its own doesn't it? 



But, it's good practice if you use the command &quot;end&quot; where your program needs to quit. So after the print commands in hello world, insert the command &quot;end&quot;. Now, go to file and build EXE, save the EXE in whatever folder you want and run it. Technically it should just be a flash so quick you cannot see it. That's where you need some sort of waiting system, or input just to let you see the results. So delete the exe and open up DarkBASIC again, in our hello world before the end command insert a wait key. What a wait key does is allow the famous press of any key for the program to end, so rebuild the exe of this program and now run it. The program isn't very windows friendly is it? At the top of the program put in these commands:

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set window on
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set Window title &quot;Hello World - A Friendly Greeting From DarkBASIC&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code ''

Now run the hello world program, see what happens? We now have a nice little window friendly environment. But hey, if you're on a different computer with different settings you'll miss some of the text, and what on earth are all those numbers for anyways? Okay the numbers are the X coordinates and the Y coordinates in case you didn't do math in school X is horizontal and Y is vertical. In case, you don't know what those words are X runs left and right or across, and Y runs up and down. So X &amp; Y are 2 axes so we have 2 dimensions, when we get to 3d expect to get dimensional for a paragraph or two. Now then for our last part of the day, let's find out how to change the position of where our text goes.

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set cursor 1,50

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

----


Insert this piece of code above, right above the first Print statement. Our program is long now and we may also forget what some of the things above do. Welcome to comments, the Rem command lets you make notes, anything after Rem is ignored. You should always comment your code, so that others can understand it, and so you can know what you where thinking when you coded it and why you coded it the way you did. Remember, comment heavily!!

'''So you know:''' Rem is short for Remark, and if I haven't told you yet BASIC stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.  

Here's what your program should look like in the end, roughly:


'''Hello World Program Results'''

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem Setup the window
Set window on 
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set window title &quot;Hello World Program&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

Rem put the first line of text 50 pixels down
Set cursor 1,50
Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;A friendly greeting from DarkBASIC!&quot;

Rem wait for the press of any key
Wait key
Rem then end
End

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''End of the Program'''


Before we go here's a quiz:


:'''In DarkBASIC Strings Start With a:'''
:A)#
:B)*
:C)'
:D)&quot;

:'''And they end with a:'''
:A)%
:B)^
:C)&amp;

:'''BASIC stands for:'''
:A)Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
:B)Bears Are Purposely Stealing International Cookies

:'''In 2d there are 2 axis which are they:'''
:A)U &amp; V
:B)X &amp; Y
:C)U &amp; V(in textures), X &amp; Y also
:D)Z &amp; U

:'''Rem can make comments for how many lines:'''
:A)1 or More
:B)1 or less
:C)Single Line
:D)Double Line



'''Okay Here Are the Answers, no cheating!'''
:1 &amp; 2 is obviously D.
:3 is A.
:4 If you said anything but Z &amp; U you should be on the right track but C is the best answer while
:B can be considered the most correct one.
:5 is C.

====Assignment:====

Experiment with the IDE and the DarkBASIC window commands.
Comment the hello world program when done.
Make a program that contains only comments.
Look up IDE on wikipedia.
Look around the DarkBASIC website(http://www.thegamecreators.com).

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, we're almost at the end of your first week  
experiencing DarkBASIC programming or at least this book! Okay, 
the fundamentals are all about logic, developing programs, design, 
setting outlooks and the building blocks. This is not application 
oriented, it's more game oriented as DarkBASIC is for game programming. 
You'll find out about conditions, variables, logic and more. Remember, 
awhile ago when I brought up 0s and 1s, well a better way of looking at 
them is TRUE and FALSE. DarkBASIC is simple, so there are no boolean operators 
or are there? Let's say you declare a variable called, oh, let's say A. For 
now A = 0 until we say A = 1, there's another value called B and it's equal 
to 1. If we had C = 1 when A or B is true or if C = 1 when A and B equal true, 
but what if neither of these values are true? Then we'd have to use 
another value and our program quickly looks like this:


:if A or B = 1
:C = 1
:else
:D = 1
:endif



That's logic, that's conditions, that's the if/endif command. Now I 
didn't indent above which I should have so anytime you use if/endif I 
want you to indent for the statements used okay? If you copied / pasted 
the above snippet in DarkBASIC and compiled it, you'd get no errors but 
if you'd ran this program you'd just get nothing. Why? They're just values 
and there is really no output to the screen involved, so let's change 
this program a bit.


'''Simple Conditional Statements Program''' 

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem we can also use a ` to comment quickly I will do that
Rem from now on!

`Declare some variables
a = 1
b = 0

`The conditional statement
if a or b = 1
   c = 1
else
   d = 1
endif

if c = 1 then Print &quot;Condition C is Met&quot;
if d = 1 then Print &quot;Condition D is Met&quot;
wait key
end

&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw I used variables above, in case you didn't know variables 
are a way of storing data which can change. As you saw above if I changed 
the OR operator to a AND b = 1 then we'd have a whole new ball game on our 
hands. But let's sidetrack a little, if you wanted to remove the text on the 
screen you have to use this command &quot;cls&quot; which means clear screen. You can also change the
transparency value of cls by simply putting a value ranging from 
0 to 255 after the cls command. And I'll show you in a few lessons on how you can change the 
screen color to whatever you wish! You may be wondering about variables 
in DarkBASIC there are roughly three data types

&lt;pre&gt;
Rem Clear the Screen
cls
Rem String Data
&quot;Wikibooks rock!&quot;
&quot;My name is John Smith&quot;
&quot;Look I'm a string!&quot;
Rem the number below is a real number or a floating point decimal
35.5555
Rem the number below that is an integer number
12345
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! For, good practice at the start of all your programs 
put cls, in other languages until you clear the screen you have text on 
the screen. For example, in pascal unless you clear the screen you get the
same text leftover from your last modification. Indenting is also important 
but we'll get to that later. So why comment or indent? In team efforts or 
open source projects it makes your program more human readable, also it's 
easier to read and locate, plus you'll need to remember what's happening 
when you come back to your project later on and you might forget. Back to variables, 
you can name variables whatever you want but make sure they're not 
to long and they briefly describe what it does or used for. 

Here are some variable examples

&lt;pre&gt;
string$ = &quot;Hey I'm a string and I love it!&quot;
float# = 333.445
integer = -11111
&lt;/pre&gt;

So why are there symbols in front of the variables? This shows what 
kind of variable we're dealing with, a $ is a string? A real or float 
is a #, in some languages there is no symbol in front of the values which 
can be a bit confusing. So again this makes it more human readable. So when designing software make sure it's source code is human readable! Get into good habits in programming like indenting - it'll save you and others time. 
For now, clear your mind and come back again tomorrow.



Alright it's time for some input other than press any key. Wouldn't you like 
to make your own game like Mad Libs? I'm trying to make one now in Visual C++, well in DarkBASIC you have to use the Input command. The input command needs a prompt(optional) and then a variable to store the input taken in. 
So what would this look like?

&lt;pre&gt;

Remstart
Input Example
By Dbtutor
Yes you can have groups of comments
Remend

Input &quot;Insert Name Here &quot;,name$
Print name$;&quot; is your name&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember semi-colons? Well they can also separate your string 
from a variable(even if it is another string strange eh?). You can also 
have input as just a variable input so it would look like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input a$
&lt;/pre&gt;

Oh yes you can use floats and integers also using input! Above where 
I use a comma you can also use a semi-colon if you prefer. Remstart means everything after it is a comment so beware, it will make everything 
a comment until you use the Remend command. What if you're database 
programming in DarkBasic(not a good practice use Visual Basic instead I advise!) and you have a hundred clients that need to be stored in variables? 
You can use the Dim command!

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim arrayname(arrayvalue,arrayvalue2(optional),arrayvalue3(optional)
arrayname(arrayvalue) = value
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let me show a more indepth example, and you can still use 
strings, integers and floats as long as you follow the 
rules(remember which symbol if any goes in front!).

A good dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(0) = &quot;Milk&quot;
list$(1) = &quot;Bread&quot;
list$(2) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
Etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A bad dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(1) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
list$(11) = &quot;This is a no no - you can't exceed the array declared value!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hopefully you've been using these methods now, if not go 
review everything and put them into practice. 

'''Your Assignment'''

Write a Mad Libs game

Quiz is coming up! For now write that Mad Libs game and 
take it easy for awhile.



Before we start here's a quiz! Told ya!

'''#6 Corrected by: Cody C Oebel'''

Note: if A = 1, and B = 0,Without knowing the expression for what
C will equal if A =1, and B = 0 tell's nothing of what C should equal . 
I Corrected answer for # 6 which should be D, or N/A.

'''Quiz Answers Cheating Won't Help You Be a Better Programmer'''



1 is A

2 is A

3 is C

4 is C

Correct answer for 6 is N/A , or D  






Okay, nice job if you didn't cheat and got a good mark or else try 
again until you do so. Let's take some time now to learn about game design 
a tad. Okay, let's take Donkey Kong Country it's a great graphical game and 
it's very fun. But some say that it has bad game design, in a sense it does 
you collect things that have no real value, does nothing special for the player. Let's look at Super Mario Bros.


You collect coins to give the player an extra life and a higher score, 
you collect green mushrooms to also get a quick extra life, your main attack 
is jumping and you must avoid falling off the platforms, there is lots for 
the player to discover on their own, you finally collect big mushrooms to be stronger and if your lucky a flower to get a sort of hippy firepower. 
That's a good outlook when designing a platform game, it's alright to 
loosely base design on other successful games but don't outright 
copycat it.


Now let's look at some Apogee games, Biomenace for example is like 
mario only more matured you have a gun but the basis for a good platformer 
is there. The game is based around the new advantage for the player as your 
gun is your survival. In space invaders, you do not collect things but 
it's a classic survival game, the arcade basis is survive as long as 
possible, get the highest score, with limited resources and powerups 
to temporarily allow prolonged survival through the hard parts. Let's look 
at an RPG, for example Final Fantasy is about your character 
growing and learning, it also has focus on the story. 


There are no real levels as you build your character until he's the ultimate 
in the universe and then defeat the main baddy, so really it's you the man. 
Focus on the main area of your game and build around it, I have done this for awhile and generally my games are liked. Do not make the game too hard, and if you find it fun after millions of test phases it's good. If you the 
designer feel any lukewarmness around any part of the game, change it until 
you feel happy. try to imagine what a total stranger will feel! Design is as important 
as making it work, without design how will you create a game? You have nothing 
to go on except making it up as you go. Remember, before all else is gameplay, then multimedia, then story and finally test your game and put it all together. Play games to see what makes them fun!


Now, let's look at some operators. These are things that help us use math and logic in
Dark Basic, they should be straightforward.

'''Operators'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; is Greater Than
&lt; is Less Than
&gt;= is Greater than or equal to
&lt;= is Less than or equal to
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's apply the above to condition statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
`10 = 9 is not 1 it's 0 
`So no text will be printed
if 10 = 9 then print &quot;That'll never happen&quot;
`But 10 is greater then or equal to itself
if 10 &gt;= 10 then Print &quot;This will always happen&quot;
`10 is greater then 8 
if 10 &gt; 8 then Print &quot;10 is bigger then 8 no doubt&quot;  
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In number crunching we'll see square roots and all the math commands in DarkBASIC but for now we'll just deal with the rnd command.

Here's the Syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;
variable = rnd(value)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately rnd runs from 0 to the set range value, I do not know 
how to change it I'm afraid but if you need help consider asking a 
question on the DarkBASIC forums: [http://www.thegamecreators.com 
The Game Creators]. This link takes you to the homepage of DarkBASIC I 
have no username on the forum but did before, but since everyone was too 
eager to cut each other's throats I stopped visiting. Follow the rules to 
a tee or they'll bury you, and make sure you know what you're posting 
and expect the worst. Sorry, for scaring you but sometimes it's the truth 
I've had lots of feelings hurt and been angered at the sheer cruelness of 
the users before. Now then let's make a guessing game!!




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from a reader: You can get around this problem by simply using &quot;value&quot;
as one less than the highest number you want to get to, and then adding 1,
for example, if I want to generate a random number from 1 to 6 (like a
standard 6-sided dice):

variable = rnd(5) + 1

We use the value of 5 because that is one less than 6 (the number that we want).
This will generate a number from 0 to 5, and then add one, creating a number
from 1 to 6. Hope this helps, and I would have asked before adding this, but I
didn't see your contact info anywhere.

endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wowzers! You started off programming hello world and now you've made 
a guessing game! Keep up the good work, if you're brave enough to show off 
your program at the newcomer's corner at the DarkBASIC forums. Now what 
does gosub do? Gosub stands for Go Subroutine, it's just a shorter geekier 
way of saying it. You need to have a label to jump too, and the label must be declared like so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I have noticed that if you write the following line
&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
The game will choose a number, and then increase it until it reaches 10. All you have to do is to press 10 when you're asked for the number and you won. To correct the problem, write the program as this:
&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin

cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`Create a random number let's change the range a bit
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the game will only choose a number from 1 to 9, all you have to do next is to quess it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I found that there is an easier way to do the correction above.
Dbtutor wanted a number one through ten and your correction only brought the number through 1 to 9.
Also because of the way you wrote this, the probability of getting a 1 is higher 
now than getting any other number. An easier way to fix this is like this...
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin


cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`To solve the 0 being a value problem just add 1 instead 
value = rnd(9)+1
`the value down here is now no longer needed making the program less sloppier
`executes the command better now.

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a much easier way to take 0 out of the options of random numbers
while not affecting your probability at all. In the future, if you need a 
random number then use

&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(x)+1 
'with x being one less than you want to go to, I hope that helped.
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;pre&gt;
gosub mylabel

mylabel:
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are, experiment a bit with labels to see what they can do. 
You can return to the last label you leaped to by using the return 
command.

Okay that's a day, go take a nap or something lol! :D



I think I said the lesson would end with Day 7, I was wrong. Now let's 
learn about functions. Functions are used to make your own commands that 
are absent from DarkBASIC. They are also used to perform functions isn't 
it obvious. DarkBASIC has no object oriented programming or OOP so you can 
use functions to substitute if you are a very decent programmer. 
So how do you use a function?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: DarkBASIC Professional supports OOP with user defined
types and with pointers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a Simple Function:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(1)
wait key
end

function hello_world(1)
  Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note from a reader: The above code includes a parameter to the function that is technically illegal in the BASIC language! The (1) following the function name should produce an error because the '1' would be considered to be the parameter's variable name and variable names can not start with a numeral. For DarkBASIC to allow such errors through promotes sloppy programming and would confuse new programmers if they were to 'upgrade' to more professional BASIC programming languages such as Microsoft's Visual BASIC (Ok, semi-professional!)
Also, given the nature of the function, no parameters are needed so the correct code should be as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world()
wait key
end

function hello_world()
   Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Functions go at the end of your program and if your program runs into a function 
declaration beware! You can use exitfunction to exit a function easily. 
The brackets that follow a function's name can contain a list of parameters required by the function.
The list should be made up of the variable names to be used for each parameter.
Let's say we would like to place the &quot;Hello World&quot; message anywhere on the screen. We could provide
the x &amp; y coordinates as parameters to the hello_world() function as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(20,10)
wait key
end

function hello_world(x,y)
   set cursor x,y
   print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example you can see when we called the hello_world function at the start we provided
2 numbers. When the function is called, these numbers are placed into x and y so that x = 20 and y = 10.
These parameter variables are local only to the function which means they will not change any other variables
of the same name that are outside the function (unless those variables are made global which starts to make
this introduction to functions get more complicated so we will leave that until later).
The best way to use functions is by creating a library with your own commands/procedures.
For example, you can make your own output command by modifying our hello_world function:

&lt;pre&gt;
function output(x,y,msg$)
   set cursor x,y
   print msg$
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using this you can in a sense use Object Oriented Programming, if your a more advanced user.

Example of a Library in DarkBASIC

&lt;pre&gt;
`Basic Function Example

#include &quot;myfunctionlib.dba&quot;
x = 100
y = 10
hello_world(x,y)

`Now we have our own command!

Rem #####################################################################################

`Note the example below was not included in the above program it was in a different file named my
`functionlib.dba
`A little function library

function hello_world(x,y)
set cursor x,y
Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

The #include command in VC++ works like so: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In DarkBASIC a library works similarly but not exactly like the 
C++ example. Now you've learned what a function is and does!

Assignment:

Use functions and libraries to make a Mad Libs game.
Make your own command, like one for adding and so on.



This will probably be the last day in the life of lesson 3. We have 
been doing most of the time application and software programming. But 
soon enough we will write a game per day starting with Pong going to 
BreakOut and more. Unfortunately we won't write a Role Playing Game, for 
development of a role playing game takes months and roughly 5,000 or so
lines of code including tools we need to create. 


The Design Process of Software Is Like So

&lt;pre&gt;
The Software I want to Develop Is
It's Main Purpose Is
Problems That Need to be Solved
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In fact there's a method that involves a series of pictures 
that I cannot recall and another method similar to the one above. 
I hope you learned something about DarkBASIC programming during the 
course of Lesson 3. Day 9 will continue in the next lesson...

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Day 9 Cont'd&lt;/center&gt;===
 
This lesson is all but one day long. When it's done, we'll move on 
to 2d don't expect mario or pong yet first thing we'll be doing is 
learning string manipulation, in about a day or so then we'll move on 
to images and whatnot. Who likes math? Not me, that's why we'll be 
getting DarkBASIC to do math for us. It'll be easier then using 
a calculator you won't even have to think about it.

Typical Math Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ is Increment of a value
= is equal to
- is decrement of a value
÷ is the division symbol. (ALT + 246 to create the ASCII symbol for division)

X multipying
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay, first of all by increment I mean increasing a value by 
whatever and vice versia with decrement as you decrease values. 

Typical Programming Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ still addition
= is equal to
- is subtraction
/ is division
* is Multiplication
&lt; is less than
&gt; is greater than
&lt;&gt; is not equal to
&lt;= is less than or equal to
&gt;= is greater than or equal to
:= is assigned the value of...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the above like you remember Christmas or you'll have 
problems doing math in programming! I can go on with more operators 
but it's not needed in a simple language like DarkBASIC as most of 
the math is taken care of by easier commands like wrapvalue.

This example may be easy but here it is

&lt;pre&gt;
`Math Example
`By Dbtutor

a = 1+2
b = 3-7
c = 9/3
d = 10*2

Print a
Print b
Print c
Print d
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most people have already known what was going to happen 
and what was going on. 

Here's some easy stuff!

&lt;pre&gt;
`Few math examples

a = 67

hexofa$ = hex$(a) ` hex$ returns value of 'a' as a hexdecimal string.
binaryofa$ = bin$(a) ` bin$ returns value of 'a' as a binary string.

b = 3

c = sqr(b)

inc d
dec e

Print a
Print hexofa$
Print binaryofa$
Print b
Print c
Print d
Print e
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why you'd need these above commands is beyond me, you only 
need them in rare situations, for more examples of math in 
DarkBASIC consult the DarkBASIC editor's command reference under math.
For now it's over with...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 10 ===

Trust me loops are useful, they do tedious tasks and they're easy to work with.

Take for example a lottery program

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim lottery(100)
lottery(1) = 1
lottery(2) = 2
lottery(3) = 3
lottery(4) = 4
etc...
Print Lottery(1)
Print lottery(2)
Print Lottery(3)
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above way is for squares, and people without loop knowledge.

Done with a loop
&lt;pre&gt;
`Let's image the dim command above is down here
for a = 1 to 100
     Print lottery(a)
next a
&lt;/pre&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: You can't print &quot;lottery(a)&quot; as it does not exist, instead write this:                                                    
                                                                
dim lottery(100)
for a = 1 to 100
print a
next a
wait key
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using loops remember to indent it makes the program more 
human readable for others. With loops we can finally have more 
advanced input, input without variables, well some variables. Let's 
look at some loops then.

Repeat/Until

&lt;pre&gt;
Repeat
   `what the loop does here
until conditionmet
&lt;/pre&gt;

While/Endwhile

&lt;pre&gt;
While conditionmet
   `What the loop does
endwhile
&lt;/pre&gt;

Do/Loop

&lt;pre&gt;
do
    `task here
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the only way to exit a loop is by quitting which is a no|no, 
the exit command which is the best way, or a gosub command. In some loops, 
the loop ends once a condition is met, and in others after a task is done 
it exits. If you paid attention you should know what I'm talking about. 
Day's over go eat, sleep, take a walk, whatever come back tomorrow!

=== Day 11 ===

This is the advanced input section, if we want a system key we 
can easily use commands like spacekey(), etc. Go have a look at them, 
they are the easiest to understand, find out how to disable them from being 
able to be pressed in DarkBASIC also while you are there. For other keys 
there's two ways basically scancode(value) which is different per country's keyboard, a Spanish keyboard is different then a British one, and you have to find a value! Or you can use ASCII values, which has a humorous pronunciation(it's pronounced ass key :P). Find out what ASCII stands for at Wikipedia, just type it in the search box and there you go. You can find Wikipedia at[http://www.wikipedia.org CLICK HERE TO GO TO WIKIPEDIA] in case your just curious because I forget I believe it's American Standard Character 
Something Something. We will be using the ASCII because it's the same for every computer 
and no need to use numeric values.

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Loops are needed for input BTW
do
   if inkey$() = &quot;charhere&quot; then exit
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a key example

&lt;pre&gt;
do
  if inkey$() = &quot;a&quot; then print &quot;Lowercase A&quot;
  if inkey$() = &quot;A&quot; then Print &quot;Uppercase A&quot;
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember A is different from a when using inkey$(). Now the lesson's 
over with, for an assignment find out what ASCII stands for and experiment
with the inkey$().

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 12 ===

Day 12 already, you're progressing towards a great career in programming 
DarkBASIC and programming in general! Lots of people have trouble writing 
files in DarkBASIC, and some have problems with Data types and more. This 
lesson will take a lot of time to cover, I'm going to say 5 days for you and 
about 2 weeks for me to write them. Hopefully, I'll get them done before but 
if not well you just have to wait for me or another to contribute. Today, 
we'll learn how to save a file.

Take for example this scenario

&lt;pre&gt;
text$ = &quot;Hey guess what open me up in notepad and see what happens!&quot;
set dir &quot;C:/&quot;
if file exist(&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;) = 1  
   delete file &quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
endif
open to write 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
write string 1,text$
close file 1
open to read 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
read string 1,newtext$
Print newtext$
close file 1
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

What a mouth full! In machine language it takes several thousand lines 
to do this same exact thing crazy or what! As you found out, the code 
above creates a string variable, moves the directory we'll be working in 
to c drive, if the file exist deletes it(or else we cannot overwrite it as 
it already exists), writes the file, closes it, opens it to read the contents, uses a new string to contain the line of text, then Prints it and finally you have to press any key before it ends. Now that's great! But remember 
the extension? You can change it to create your own files. You can also write 
various things such as: bytes, characters, and so on. To see more of what 
you can write view the command reference under the DarkBASIC help file. We'll just be using string for now and later byte.

This example will generate a syntax error and I'll tell you why now

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
delete file &quot;wrong.txt&quot;
open to write 1,&quot;wrong.txt&quot;
write string 1,a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember numbers are not strings, to make a number a string we can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
a$ = str$(a)
b = val(a$)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command str$ changes a number into a value, and the command val 
changes a string into a value. There are many other odd things you can 
do with strings as well which you can see under the DarkBASIC help file 
command reference of strings. See some examples and change them around a bit. 

Here's a useless kinda piece of software for strings

&lt;pre&gt;
`Crazy Strings
`By Dbtutor

cls
message$ = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;ASC() returns the ASCII number of the first letter in the str&quot;
Print asc(message$)
Print &quot;Len counts how many characters in a string&quot;
Print len(message$)
Print &quot;Mid gets the middle write characters of a string&quot;
midval = 3
Print mid$(message$,midval)
Print &quot;Here's the binary of the number 678&quot;
Print bin$(678)
Print &quot;Here's the hex of that number&quot;
Print hex$(678)
Print &quot;There are many more ways of destroying strings&quot;
Print &quot;Much are useless, but take a gander at them&quot;
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw above manuiplating strings is easy but pretty much useless. 
In some situations they are useful like a file manager tool which 
we'll be making very soon along with some other file stuff. In the 2d 
tutorial's final part we'll use files to make a very simple tool 
very much like ZZT or MegaZeux. There's lots to cover so bear with me! 
On day 13 we'll be learning more ways of writing files, remember byte? 
Well you can use it to write a value to a file. I used txt has my 
extension, try using .dat, .ini, etc. You can even make one up! Using write, 
you can also write word or an integer value, a long or long integer value, 
and even a float. Why I don't know. 

Good Example of Writing A File:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
b$ = str$(a)
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then delete file &quot;a&quot;
open to write &quot;a&quot;,1
write string 1,b$
close file 1
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then readit = 1
if readit = 1
   open to read 1,&quot;a&quot;
   read string 1,c$
   d = val(c$)
   Print d
   Print &quot;Same thing! Use val and str! Their better!&quot;
   wait key
   end
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note: from Cody Oebel'''

the above code fails to work properly, and will not compile and run.

I found the If file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 ...  the = 1 is ambiguous, and is not needed.

below is my version of this code snippet

&lt;pre&gt;
`Edit by Cody C Oebel:
 
 g = 11
 set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
 b$ = str$(g)
 if file exist(&quot;a.txt&quot;) then delete file &quot;a.txt&quot;
 open to write 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 write string 1, b$
 close file 1
 if file exist (&quot;a.txt&quot;)
 open to read 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 read string 1, z$
 d = val(z$)
 print d
 print &quot;This should work now, and is smaller amount of code&quot;
 wait key
 endif
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, see what I mean? Later we'll be using current directories and 
file branching statements to make a simple file browser. Very simple! 
Write byte is sometimes used for example in tilemappers and so on but the 
standard is write string because it's simple. Remember keep it 
simple stupid!

Let's write an array
&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;

save array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

load array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''NOTE: Again this code above did not work: By Cody Oebel'''

Here is my working version for other readers to see the minor mistakes.

Also note at the bottom of the compiler it shows you the format

for save array, and load array e.g. Filename, array.

I also added the variable stringname filename$ to contain &quot;array.ini&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
filename$ = &quot;array.ini&quot;
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;
set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
save array filename$, a$(10)

load array filename$, a$(10)

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can save big ole arrays, database programming anyone? 
Remember our guessing game? Go back and fix it up a bit so that you 
can include this newly learned code in it. You've learned a lot about 
files so far. Perpare for directories on Day 13!

=== Day 13 ===

Day 13 arrived and we're only two days away from the half way point. 
That's great news, as soon as you can be a master programmer in 
DarkBASIC the better! Well, really DarkBASIC takes awhile to master, not 
to scare you but I'm not a master programmer either. If you know somebody with 
a good game it's usually not that they're the best programmer but 
just a great game maker. Some DarkBASIC users have gone on to make 
commercial games such as: Dumbo &amp; Cool, Star Wraith, etc. DarkBASIC 
is great for games and team efforts. Not so for applications as you'll 
find out today.

Here's a simple file manager

&lt;pre&gt;
Input &quot;Set directory to: &quot;;direct$
set dir direct$
&lt;/pre&gt;

You don't get to see files do you? We can easily view files and 
whatever using some simple commands. Remember some are tedious, but 
when in use with loops! Now this is a file manager, you change dirs, 
view files, and whatnot, it's not a professional tool, it's showing you 
the ropes. But before we do it's time to have a look at a better 
file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Manager
`By Dbtutor

`Get the directory to use
setdirect$ = get dir$()

`Set the directory to the current directory
set dir setdirect$

`Current amount of items
items = 10

find first
Print get file name$(1)

for a = 2 to items
  find next
  Print get file name$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Wow, that's cool and all but there's no user input and no file 
manipulation dus this program is file system viewer. Just like 
windows explorer! Really nowadays writing a file manager is pretty 
much useless especially if it's ugly. But file managers in your program 
in DarkBASIC allows better productivity then in typing in the file 
name or directory and whatnot. We're not going back to the DOS days 
God forbid type in a command and hope it works! Remember I said tedious? 
Well there is a much better way to write the following program above. Don't 
worry we'll be writing a file manager later! Before I show you a more 
productive way.

Follow these instructions:

&lt;pre&gt;
Go to http://www.computechtenerife.com/
Register as a user.
Click on Dark Basic Support and then Downloads
Scroll down and find the function libraries
Click on the Db file selector
Download and extract the files for usage later
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay now that's done we can see a better way of doing things in 
the file system viewer world. We're only a few blocks away from 
the file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Viewer
`By Dbtutor

set dir &quot;C:\&quot;

Perform checklist for files
for a = 1 to checklist quantity()
  Print checklist string$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

See how many lines less we have? There is other perform checklist for 
things such as directories and devices. Go have a look and change 
perform checklist for files command with a few of them.


Now remember that file manager library you downloaded, if you 
haven't guessed we'll be modding some of the code inside the include 
file(not the function library) to make our own modded file manager. Remember 
the library is copyright to a DarkBASIC user known as TDK_MAN one of the 
best DarkBASIC programmers out there besides you(just flattering) I'm sure 
you could beat him at his game after 30 years. Just kidding if your reading 
this TDK no offense. He's made lots of DarkBASIC programs including MatEdit 
which we'll be using later on in the 3d chapters along with a 3d moddler and whatnot. 

Here's the Source Code

There you are a easy file manager thanks to other peoples function 
libraries! You can find lots on TDK's site(http://www.matedit.com/db.htm). 
Along with tutorials for functions and more. That's all for Day 13, there 
was no quiz for awhile so expect a lot of quizzes later on. I couldn't 
find anything worth quizzing you on. There will be lotsa data going on 
in Day 14.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 14&lt;/center&gt;===

We already know what variables are, but you haven't used data 
statements yet. Data statements work very easily, you just put 
data, space and then put all the types of data.

Examples of Data

&lt;pre&gt;
data &quot;strings&quot;,12,5.6,&quot;and integers and floats tooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!&quot;
data 12
data &quot;string me&quot;
data 5.50
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have lots of data types in one statement as long as you 
separate them with commas. That's useful but how can we read the data? 
Well we can use read.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Read Example
data 4
read var1
Print var1
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use restore to reset the data pointer you'll see what I'm 
talking about later. It's good practice to use different labels to 
store different data.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Big Data Example
gosub datastored

datastored:
data 1234
data 12
data 1
data 4
data 56 
gosub readdata

readdata:
read var1
read var2
read var3
read var4
read var5

print var1
Print var2
Print var3
print var4
Print var5
&lt;/pre&gt;

First it stores data then reads it, you can do this backwards 
if you want. Whichever way you read and store data it works. Now we're
into games, no explaining(well some) just pure games programming. 
We'll program a game a day woohoo let's go now!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 15 ===

The half way point, finally after all that coding and reading and days. 
This chapter we'll be making a text adventure using more text commands 
you'll now learn. Plus you'll learn how to clear the screen in various 
colors, and oh boy you're gonna enjoy this lesson. 

You probably thought, my God does the text always have to be white!

&lt;pre&gt;
`NOPE
ink rgb(0,255,0),1
Print &quot;OMG FINALLY COLOR!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! I'm a Canadian but I still spell color as color instead 
of colour. What's the RGB for? It stands for Red, Green, Blue, look 
at your monitor with a lens you'll see lots of those pixels in those 
colors. The rgb must be separated by brackets and then a comma for the transparentcy value. The transparentcy ranges from 0 to 255. RGB values 
range from 0 to 255 also.

Here's Some Colors to Remember

&lt;pre&gt;
255,0,0 - red
0,255,0 - green
255,255,0 - yellow
0,0,255 - blue
0,255,255 - cyan
255,255,255 - white
0,0,0 - black
255,0,255 - pink
192,192,192 - light grey
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see more have a look in paint, view the rgbs values and fool 
around that's the way I found out, so you should find out too. Using 
these above values you should be able to make nice colors. The lower the 
value the darker, the higher the lighter.

Now after that you want a better way to Print right?

&lt;pre&gt;
text x,y,string$
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using text, you need to use + instead of a semi-colon to 
separate variables. All values must be a string, remember to convert a
value to a string use the str$ command as seen in Lesson 6.

The Right Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is no syntax error &quot;+str$(a)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Wrong Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is a syntax error you won't see this text until you fix &quot;+a
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change the font easily 

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font fontnameasstring$
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can make our text opaque easily too or allow us to write over
other text values

&lt;pre&gt;
set text opaque
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's style changes

&lt;pre&gt;
set text bold
set text italic
set text bolditalic
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how to change the size

&lt;pre&gt;
set text size integernumber
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay here's all those in a program

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font &quot;Times New Roman&quot;
set text size 30
set text bold
text 1,100,&quot;Hey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You assignment is to fool around with text values and 
colors, come back tomorrow

===&lt;center&gt;Day 16&lt;/center&gt;===

Okay, now we've learned lots about changing text values it's 
time to write your own text adventure. We'll call it 
&quot;Dungeons of Doom&quot;, it'll have the player to escape the 
dank dungeons of a castle using numerous data commands 
and whatnot.

First let's do an outline:

[[Image:outline6ql.th.jpg]]

Now we have an outline let's write a simple story:

Evil Elves have captured you in their prison, now you must escape 
the Dungeon of Doom. Beware some turns lead to doom, others lead 
to a way out. 

There is only two ways to die in our game, since it's more like 
a maze anyways. 

Now Let's Do Some Data For It:

Now then your assignment to show you know what's going on is to go 
back and add in comments describing what's happening in each. The final 
part in your assignment is to edit all the code and data statements to 
make a sequel, add rooms, and more. No this game is not a text role 
playing game, we'll make a text role playing game in the next lesson. I 
think tomorrow your gonna have a break-out of game programming.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 17&lt;/center&gt;===

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We're going to make a Pong game today, a BreakOut 
game today, and your going to learn about images, sprites and more! Okay, 
so how can we load multimedia in DarkBASIC? Remember in the file manager 
program we had some confusing formats of files in there. One thing I 
didn't add was animations unfortunately. 

Multimedia Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Image
`Supports bmps and jpgs only
id = 1
string$ = &quot;myimage.bmp&quot;
load image string$,id
x = 1
y = 1
paste image id,x,y

`Music
`Sound works the same way, only instead the word music is replaced with the word `sound
`Supports are: wav, mp3, and midi
musid = 1
musstring$ = &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;
load music musstring$,musid
play music musid
stop music musid
loop music musid

`Animation
`Supports gif, avi, may support other formats
animid = 1
animstring$ = &quot;myanimation.gif&quot;
load animation animstring$,animid
play animation animid

`Bitmap
`Works same as image only supports bitmaps, you can load only 32
bmpid = 1
bmp$ = &quot;mybmp.bmp&quot;
load bitmap bmp$
`This pastes the bitmap, but the id can be used to create bitmaps at certain `locations 
`see bmps under the command reference for those details

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go look at some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC, some more 
are 3dsound, and you can play music off your cd too. We'll be using 
some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC in later chapters for 
now we'll be focusing on the said above in the example.

Your main question may be what is a sprite? A sprite is a 
2d character that is used in games. Basically a sprite is a 
image that does more, in DarkBASIC sprites are the lifeblood 
of the system.

Sprite Works Like

&lt;pre&gt;
sprite spriteid,x,y,imageid
&lt;/pre&gt;

You cannot use load bitmap and use that as an image for your sprite, 
you can only use images loaded by the load image command.


Before you did not manipulate the x,y cords of a image in DarkBASIC 
well that's about to change. Before we start, if we leave the computer 
to take care of our game's framerate then our game will run slow and 
differently on different paced computers. Use sync on, to turn the 
framerate over too you and away from the computer. Every time the 
sync command is used the screen is updated constantly. Use 
the sync rate command, to set the rate the frame refreshes, 
mostly 30 is good for 3d games in DarkBASIC, and 40 for 2d games 
is also good too, but use 30 to make sure. There are a 
few commands in darkbasic that draws crude graphics, the commands 
we'll use are: line(line startingx,toendingx,startingy,toendingy), 
circle(x,y,radius), and dot(dot x,y). They draw these graphics in 
the default ink, if the ink is not set it'll use cyan as a default. 
There are more commands that draw different basic 2d shapes, but 
we won't be using them. If your curious go check them out 
under BASIC2d under the DarkBASIC command reference.


Here's an example of you being able to move a circle
&lt;pre&gt;
`Moving Circle
`By Dbtutor

`Hide the mouse
hide mouse

`Setup sync rate
sync on
sync rate 30

`Make the screen grey
cls rgb(192,192,192) 

`Select an ink color for us, make it all transparent
ink rgb(0,155,0),0

`Draw the circle at cordinates provided
xpos = 100
ypos = 200
circle xpos,ypos,10

`Start the main loop
do
   `Clean up mess left over, and re-draw circle
   cls rgb(192,192,192)
   circle xpos,ypos,10

   `User control
   if upkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if downkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   if rightkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if leftkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos - 7
   `Allow no leaving the screen
   if xpos &gt; 600 then xpos = xpos - 7
   if xpos &lt; 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if ypos &gt; 400 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if ypos &lt; 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   `Refresh the screen
   sync
loop
   
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wow that worked out great eh? Let's get some sleep for now.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 18&lt;/center&gt;===

Before we start I'd just like to thank everybody for visiting 
this wikibook, taking time to read it and for knowing when I google 
&quot;DarkBASIC Programming&quot; I see my book on the first page. That's a great 
feeling! I hope you learn something, I'll try and get this book done very 
soon but I've been very busy with learning new things and my schoolwork. 
I've been learning Assembly, C++, Pascal, &amp; Visual Basic I'm also 
considering buying a console building kit &quot;The XGameStation&quot; by 
Mr Lamothe or as you may know him Andre' Lamothe or Lord Necron. 
He's one my biggest inspirations for programming besides 
Lee Bamber(the visionary behind DarkBASIC). Okay let's start with the 
pong game, I must say it's been a challenge writing this pong game, 
I've had lots of bugs with it. You must use your own images, 
only the source code is included.

'''Understanding the Material'''
Before I go ahead with the Pong game there is some things that I 
must, nay, need to explain to you. First, of all you need to 
understand what a &quot;sprite&quot; is, yes I know I mentioned it but not has 
in depth as I need to now, again that was just a basic example. Basically, 
put a sprite is nothing but an active image that allows more manipulation
then standard bitmaps. In our terms, speaking a sprite is in most cases 
nothing but a 2d character. We can do more with sprites in DarkBASIC 
then we can simply using just plain images.

You already know how to setup a sprite. But you do not know how to 
delete sprites, how to detect collision with sprites, and have not used 
them very much yet. The syntax of deleting a sprite is simple: delete 
sprite spriteid. The sprite obviously must exist if not you'll get a 
runtime error stating that the &quot;bob&quot; or sprite does not exist. The same 
works for collisions with sprites: the precise and best way is by using 
this command sprite collision(spriteid1,spriteid2). Again they must exist 
has I stated, and you must have two, again I'm stating the obvious but 
there are pretty dumb people out there. 

The other way works the same thing except it's not has precise and 
goes like this: sprite hit(spriteid1,spriteid2). Easy! What may not be 
so easy after reading the code below is what the random numbers are for. 
These random numbers simply put are so that the computer generates a 
number from 0 to 1 in which direction the ball should go. They are for 
both X axis and Y axis and you should know what those are already.

The Pong Game -

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 19 ===

Okay, so we've made Pong the next step is to make a Break-Out game. Just giving you,
the source code of the game would prove you didn't code the pong game by yourself.
So what I'm going to do is let you program your own break-out game, and I will give some
guided examples. After this quick break-out game exercise I will be discussing multimedia!

Collisions

''if sprite collision(paddle,ball) = 1 then bouncball = 1''

Possible Solutions to Make the Ball Bounce :S

-Setup a variable called ballmovex, set it's value to random 1 or 0.
-if the ball strikes 0 make it move left, and in the case of 1 right
-do the same thing with a variable called ballmovey, except in this
-case moving up or down.

Possible Solutions of Setting Up Blocks

-Setup an array which holds the x positions of your bricks, and the 
y positions of your bricks. Then one for if the brick has been struck,
so if the brick has been struck it will equal 1 or true and then have
conditional statements(if and thens) for the action to break the brick.

''if if sprite collision(paddle,brickhit(bricknum)) = 1 then destroybrick = 1''



if destroybrick = 1

  brickx(bricknum) = -1
  bricky(bricknum) = -1

endif



Something to Remember:
   Remember you need a do loop to accept advanced input such as inkey$(), returnkey(), etc.



I've given lots of suggestions as to how to complete the Break-Out game, hopefully this 
will go down nice and easy without heartburn. If you have a case of &quot;what thes&quot; then 
I suggest you visit the codebase on the official DarkBASIC home page: http://www.thegamecreators.com, it has everything a DarkBASIC coder shall need.

 '''Multimedia In DarkBASIC - Audio'''
Not many people can say that they hate music, in fact most people love hearing ambient
music in games, I know I do! Above, I used some strange commands, play sound, play music,
load music, play music. Well, DarkBASIC has three audio supports, MP3, Wave, and Midi.
Loading music is very simple, and sound works the same way. So I'm going to give you a
code example, you bring the sounds, I'll bring the code!




'''Code Example for Audio:'''
 Rem Audio Example
 `Load audio
 load sound &quot;mysound.wav&quot;,1
 load music &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;,1
 `Play audio once
 play sound 1
 `Loop music
 loop music 1
 `wait key
 wait key
 stop music 1
 loop sound 1


So what are the numbers at the end? Remember in images, well this number is a numeric ID 
given. Remember the location of your audio, and extension!

 '''Multimedia in DarkBASIC - Animations'''
This will probably be the last multimedia entry, unless someone does one on dlls, 
I won't be, since I have an older version of DarkBASIC.

Animations at this point in time do not include those such as mario walking, however
they do include those such as animated GIFs(Graphic Interchange Format), and
AVIs(Audio Video Interleave). So far I believe there are two formats for
animation .gif, and .avi please tell me so if otherwise. Animations can
be useful for game over screens and maybe even some Mortal Kombat style
finishers!!







'''Code Sample'''
 load animation &quot;animation1.avi&quot;,1
 play animation 1
 wait key
 stop animation 1
 load animation &quot;animation2.gif&quot;,2
 play animation 2
 loop animation 2

This is about 2D Games.  This Wiki helped me become the programmer I am today.  No, I am not DBTutor, but I will contribute.  I am IRON 
PROGRAMMER!!  Talk to me on the DarkBASIC Forums if you have a question.

I challenge YOU to create a 2D Melee Game.  These are simple.  Here is an example:
&lt;pre&gt;
''cls rgb(150,150,150)

&lt;/pre&gt;
That is a simple format for a multiplayer melee game in 2D.  Notice
I have cleverly not supplied the media!  Hahahahahaaaa!  Now get programming!

A controlable cube:
&lt;pre&gt;
SYNC RATE 60

MAKE OBJECT CUBE 1,1
DO

==&lt;center&gt;Foreword&lt;/center&gt;==
First of all, thanks for checking out this book on DarkBASIC. It's the first WikiBook on the subject of DarkBASIC Programming. Not everyone can program, 
but in the information age I believe that it's necessary for everyone to 
gain the skills to use different types of technology. Especially, 
computers and programming. Today and for the next 30 days you'll learn 
a lot about DarkBASIC Programming and a lot about what you can accomplish 
using a computer. DarkBASIC is all about making DirectX do your 
evil bidding and your domination of the world of computer game programming. 
I hope you read and contribute to this book, as well as rant 
because then I can fix stuff others will insult. I hope you enjoy!

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 1 - Introduction to Programming&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
In this tutorial I'm going to assume you have no prior programming experience, 
or else you wouldn't be reading this book. You would pick up the manual, 
compare it to C++, and program in DarkBASIC easily. First of all not to 
scare you but game programming is not easy and secondly you are not going to 
make a &lt;insert copycat blockbuster game here&gt; killer or clone or whatever 
in DarkBASIC for a long time. I'm also going to assume you have v1.0 of the &quot;classic&quot; or non-pro edition of DarkBASIC or else with another version you'll have 
some problems running this code unfortunately. Programming is not a 
new concept, and there are many hundreds of languages 
such as DarkBASIC out there, one such programming language comparable 
to DarkBASIC is BlitzBASIC, and you may have heard of Visual Basic.

== So what is programming?  ==

This isn't a stupid question. Programming is not just making applications for Windows, or talking a language your computer understands. Programming is input, process, and output. If you take computer sciences, chances are you'll be doing program outlines, but right now you're a hobbyist programmer so let's keep it simple. Not all of us know VC++ or Pascal. DarkBASIC is game oriented. You can make applications in it, but it's harder.  There are no message boxes in the version we'll be using. But DarkBASIC is easy and fun, especially for beginner's and junior programmers. Instead of having to write 1000+ lines of code to put a 2d character on screen you'll write one, instead of writing a massive program to make a cube spin you'll write a simple and human readable one in 20 or less lines. If you have no patience, take it slow and easy and don't move on until you understand it all or else you'll be bald by the time you finish this wikibook. I will say this: this book is a work in progress. I'll be finished as soon as possible so, bare with me please. Programming is simply entering lines of code that once compiled, or is run, tells the computer to follow out a task until it's done. What's involved is input, or you programming; processing or computing; and finally output, what you get to see. 
[[Image:Input-process-output.JPG]]


'''Figure 1.1'''(This is the Model of Input, Process and Output.)
'''So you know:''' A coder is another word for a programmer.



All programs follow the above method, since every program is (1) certainly programmed, (2) is certainly compiled, and (3) certainly displays results. Now, just what is code then? Code is the recipe for your program. Computers won't do a task wrong. You'll do the task 
wrong. To keep your program from doing things that could harm computers, the compiler(or program that checks to see if the program works) runs the program and generates syntax errors (if there's something wrong). These syntax errors, tell you that you made a mistake and you must fix it before you can see your program(in most cases). So, computers don't make mistakes.

There are many sorts of errors also! The most common is called ''' a syntax error '''. A syntax error are mistakes in your program's code. A programming language like a written language is incorrect if it contains things that are gibberish. Like in English, asdfjdj is not a word, it's gibberish. Just like in DarkBASIC, print is a command, where as printf is not. Another kind of error is called a run-time error, this is when your program compiles but you don't get the results you want. Such as if your writing is sloppy, the word &quot;hello&quot; may look like jello and the person will get the wrong information from it. Run-time errors are things that aren't suppose to happen, like when in your favorite video game, when a character can sometimes walk through a wall, or the program crashing when this happens.


The process of fixing your mistakes is called debugging. You'll get familiar with this; half your time or more will be spent doing debugging. So as much as possible, save, compile, debug, and run. It'll save you lots of anger, and stress. Finally remember this: with computers, the language goes through assembly or getting put into binary, and sent back to your programming language. If the binary pattern is correct, then you have no syntax errors. Remember, 0s are off or false, and 1s are on or true. Remember when I said assembly above? 


Well, here's how it works. First off, you compile or check syntax, then the code you entered passes through what's called machine language or assembly (its name changes depending on what its doing when it's compiling its assembler). Then it becomes pure binary (which is not human readable but meant for computers; they cannot understand anything other than 0s and 1s). Then it is sent back to the compiler where if the binary matches what's correct, it gets executed. If it doesn't, you get a syntax error and must debug. Now, don't quote me on that but that's basically what happens. So now you're ready to begin programming in DarkBASIC and will know what I talk about.

One more thing: DarkBASIC is not case sensitive.  If you don't know what this means, it means that DarkBASIC does not distinguish between upper-case letters and lower-case ones.

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 2 - The Hello World Tradition&lt;/center&gt;==
                         


Alrighty, you came back. Good, let's hope you have played around with the DarkBASIC editor. Before you find out what the hello world tradition is (older programmers don't spoil it for them!), I think I should tell you something. The DarkBASIC editor is not very windows friendly, so make sure you download an IDE you like and then link it to the DarkBASIC. 

'''So you know:''' an IDE is an integrated development environment. It allows programming to be easier for professionals and beginners alike. For now, don't worry what an IDE is too much, you're only beginning after all.

Okay, now then time to get to the tradition.


''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;This is Dbtutor's wikibook on DarkBASIC Programming!!&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

Copy and paste this source code into the IDE or editor (whichever) and run it. What you get is the easiest program you'll ever write in DarkBASIC. The hello world example is proud tradition of beginning programmers, so let's carry it on. Hello World Program puts the text hello world on the screen. But what are the quotation marks for? The quotation marks are used to show what you want to put on the screen. Otherwise, it would look like one big command. 

'''Your Assignment:'''

Replace Hello World with any text you want&lt;br&gt;



First of all, I hope you completed the assignment above.  In case you haven't, or had problems with this program I'll show you how. Okay, let's say you want to print a couple of things and you need it spaced for readability. Remember I said that print, prints the things inside the quotes? Well they're called strings, now strings are characters that you can change and manipulate. With no string to technically print, you'll just get a blank space. Now for all on one line you use a semi-colon(;). Experiment with these two methods above until you understand them. In DarkBASIC, your program already ends on its own doesn't it? 



But, it's good practice if you use the command &quot;end&quot; where your program needs to quit. So after the print commands in hello world, insert the command &quot;end&quot;. Now, go to file and build EXE, save the EXE in whatever folder you want and run it. Technically it should just be a flash so quick you cannot see it. That's where you need some sort of waiting system, or input just to let you see the results. So delete the exe and open up DarkBASIC again, in our hello world before the end command insert a wait key. What a wait key does is allow the famous press of any key for the program to end, so rebuild the exe of this program and now run it. The program isn't very windows friendly is it? At the top of the program put in these commands:

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set window on
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set Window title &quot;Hello World - A Friendly Greeting From DarkBASIC&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code ''

Now run the hello world program, see what happens? We now have a nice little window friendly environment. But hey, if you're on a different computer with different settings you'll miss some of the text, and what on earth are all those numbers for anyways? Okay the numbers are the X coordinates and the Y coordinates in case you didn't do math in school X is horizontal and Y is vertical. In case, you don't know what those words are X runs left and right or across, and Y runs up and down. So X &amp; Y are 2 axes so we have 2 dimensions, when we get to 3d expect to get dimensional for a paragraph or two. Now then for our last part of the day, let's find out how to change the position of where our text goes.

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set cursor 1,50

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

----


Insert this piece of code above, right above the first Print statement. Our program is long now and we may also forget what some of the things above do. Welcome to comments, the Rem command lets you make notes, anything after Rem is ignored. You should always comment your code, so that others can understand it, and so you can know what you where thinking when you coded it and why you coded it the way you did. Remember, comment heavily!!

'''So you know:''' Rem is short for Remark, and if I haven't told you yet BASIC stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.  

Here's what your program should look like in the end, roughly:


'''Hello World Program Results'''

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem Setup the window
Set window on 
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set window title &quot;Hello World Program&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

Rem put the first line of text 50 pixels down
Set cursor 1,50
Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;A friendly greeting from DarkBASIC!&quot;

Rem wait for the press of any key
Wait key
Rem then end
End

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''End of the Program'''

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 3 - Fundamentals of DarkBASIC&lt;/center&gt;==
                         


Well, we're almost at the end of your first week  
experiencing DarkBASIC programming or at least this book! Okay, 
the fundamentals are all about logic, developing programs, design, 
setting outlooks and the building blocks. This is not application 
oriented, it's more game oriented as DarkBASIC is for game programming. 
You'll find out about conditions, variables, logic and more. Remember, 
awhile ago when I brought up 0s and 1s, well a better way of looking at 
them is TRUE and FALSE. DarkBASIC is simple, so there are no boolean operators 
or are there? Let's say you declare a variable called, oh, let's say A. For 
now A = 0 until we say A = 1, there's another value called B and it's equal 
to 1. If we had C = 1 when A or B is true or if C = 1 when A and B equal true, 
but what if neither of these values are true? Then we'd have to use 
another value and our program quickly looks like this:



:if A or B = 1
:C = 1
:else
:D = 1
:endif




That's logic, that's conditions, that's the if/endif command. Now I 
didn't indent above which I should have so anytime you use if/endif I 
want you to indent for the statements used okay? If you copied / pasted 
the above snippet in DarkBASIC and compiled it, you'd get no errors but 
if you'd ran this program you'd just get nothing. Why? They're just values 
and there is really no output to the screen involved, so let's change 
this program a bit.


'''Simple Conditional Statements Program''' 

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem we can also use a ` to comment quickly I will do that
Rem from now on!

`Declare some variables
a = 1
b = 0

`The conditional statement
if a or b = 1
   c = 1
else
   d = 1
endif

if c = 1 then Print &quot;Condition C is Met&quot;
if d = 1 then Print &quot;Condition D is Met&quot;
wait key
end

&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw I used variables above, in case you didn't know variables 
are a way of storing data which can change. As you saw above if I changed 
the OR operator to a AND b = 1 then we'd have a whole new ball game on our 
hands. But let's sidetrack a little, if you wanted to remove the text on the 
screen you have to use this command &quot;cls&quot; which means clear screen. You can also change the
transparency value of cls by simply putting a value ranging from 
0 to 255 after the cls command. And I'll show you in a few lessons on how you can change the 
screen color to whatever you wish! You may be wondering about variables 
in DarkBASIC there are roughly three data types

&lt;pre&gt;
Rem Clear the Screen
cls
Rem String Data
&quot;Wikibooks rock!&quot;
&quot;My name is John Smith&quot;
&quot;Look I'm a string!&quot;
Rem the number below is a real number or a floating point decimal
35.5555
Rem the number below that is an integer number
12345
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! For, good practice at the start of all your programs 
put cls, in other languages until you clear the screen you have text on 
the screen. For example, in pascal unless you clear the screen you get the
same text leftover from your last modification. Indenting is also important 
but we'll get to that later. So why comment or indent? In team efforts or 
open source projects it makes your program more human readable, also it's 
easier to read and locate, plus you'll need to remember what's happening 
when you come back to your project later on and you might forget. Back to variables, 
you can name variables whatever you want but make sure they're not 
to long and they briefly describe what it does or used for. 

Here are some variable examples

&lt;pre&gt;
string$ = &quot;Hey I'm a string and I love it!&quot;
float# = 333.445
integer = -11111
&lt;/pre&gt;

So why are there symbols in front of the variables? This shows what 
kind of variable we're dealing with, a $ is a string? A real or float 
is a #, in some languages there is no symbol in front of the values which 
can be a bit confusing. So again this makes it more human readable. So when designing software make sure it's source code is human readable! Get into good habits in programming like indenting - it'll save you and others time. 
For now, clear your mind and come back again tomorrow.



Alright it's time for some input other than press any key. Wouldn't you like 
to make your own game like Mad Libs? I'm trying to make one now in Visual C++, well in DarkBASIC you have to use the Input command. The input command needs a prompt(optional) and then a variable to store the input taken in. 
So what would this look like?

&lt;pre&gt;

Remstart
Input Example
By Dbtutor
Yes you can have groups of comments
Remend

Input &quot;Insert Name Here &quot;,name$
Print name$;&quot; is your name&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember semi-colons? Well they can also separate your string 
from a variable(even if it is another string strange eh?). You can also 
have input as just a variable input so it would look like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input a$
&lt;/pre&gt;

Oh yes you can use floats and integers also using input! Above where 
I use a comma you can also use a semi-colon if you prefer. Remstart means everything after it is a comment so beware, it will make everything 
a comment until you use the Remend command. What if you're database 
programming in DarkBasic(not a good practice use Visual Basic instead I advise!) and you have a hundred clients that need to be stored in variables? 
You can use the Dim command!

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim arrayname(arrayvalue,arrayvalue2(optional),arrayvalue3(optional)
arrayname(arrayvalue) = value
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let me show a more indepth example, and you can still use 
strings, integers and floats as long as you follow the 
rules(remember which symbol if any goes in front!).

A good dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(0) = &quot;Milk&quot;
list$(1) = &quot;Bread&quot;
list$(2) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
Etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A bad dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(1) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
list$(11) = &quot;This is a no no - you can't exceed the array declared value!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hopefully you've been using these methods now, if not go 
review everything and put them into practice.

Correct answer for 6 is N/A , or D  






Okay, nice job if you didn't cheat and got a good mark or else try 
again until you do so. Let's take some time now to learn about game design 
a tad. Okay, let's take Donkey Kong Country it's a great graphical game and 
it's very fun. But some say that it has bad game design, in a sense it does 
you collect things that have no real value, does nothing special for the player. Let's look at Super Mario Bros.


You collect coins to give the player an extra life and a higher score, 
you collect green mushrooms to also get a quick extra life, your main attack 
is jumping and you must avoid falling off the platforms, there is lots for 
the player to discover on their own, you finally collect big mushrooms to be stronger and if your lucky a flower to get a sort of hippy firepower. 
That's a good outlook when designing a platform game, it's alright to 
loosely base design on other successful games but don't outright 
copycat it.


Now let's look at some Apogee games, Biomenace for example is like 
mario only more matured you have a gun but the basis for a good platformer 
is there. The game is based around the new advantage for the player as your 
gun is your survival. In space invaders, you do not collect things but 
it's a classic survival game, the arcade basis is survive as long as 
possible, get the highest score, with limited resources and powerups 
to temporarily allow prolonged survival through the hard parts. Let's look 
at an RPG, for example Final Fantasy is about your character 
growing and learning, it also has focus on the story. 


There are no real levels as you build your character until he's the ultimate 
in the universe and then defeat the main baddy, so really it's you the man. 
Focus on the main area of your game and build around it, I have done this for awhile and generally my games are liked. Do not make the game too hard, and if you find it fun after millions of test phases it's good. If you the 
designer feel any lukewarmness around any part of the game, change it until 
you feel happy. try to imagine what a total stranger will feel! Design is as important 
as making it work, without design how will you create a game? You have nothing 
to go on except making it up as you go. Remember, before all else is gameplay, then multimedia, then story and finally test your game and put it all together. Play games to see what makes them fun!


Now, let's look at some operators. These are things that help us use math and logic in
Dark Basic, they should be straightforward.

'''Operators'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; is Greater Than
&lt; is Less Than
&gt;= is Greater than or equal to
&lt;= is Less than or equal to
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's apply the above to condition statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
`10 = 9 is not 1 it's 0 
`So no text will be printed
if 10 = 9 then print &quot;That'll never happen&quot;
`But 10 is greater then or equal to itself
if 10 &gt;= 10 then Print &quot;This will always happen&quot;
`10 is greater then 8 
if 10 &gt; 8 then Print &quot;10 is bigger then 8 no doubt&quot;  
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In number crunching we'll see square roots and all the math commands in DarkBASIC but for now we'll just deal with the rnd command.

Here's the Syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;
variable = rnd(value)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately rnd runs from 0 to the set range value, I do not know 
how to change it I'm afraid but if you need help consider asking a 
question on the DarkBASIC forums: [http://www.thegamecreators.com 
The Game Creators]. This link takes you to the homepage of DarkBASIC I 
have no username on the forum but did before, but since everyone was too 
eager to cut each other's throats I stopped visiting. Follow the rules to 
a tee or they'll bury you, and make sure you know what you're posting 
and expect the worst. Sorry, for scaring you but sometimes it's the truth 
I've had lots of feelings hurt and been angered at the sheer cruelness of 
the users before. Now then let's make a guessing game!!




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from a reader: You can get around this problem by simply using &quot;value&quot;
as one less than the highest number you want to get to, and then adding 1,
for example, if I want to generate a random number from 1 to 6 (like a
standard 6-sided dice):

variable = rnd(5) + 1

We use the value of 5 because that is one less than 6 (the number that we want).
This will generate a number from 0 to 5, and then add one, creating a number
from 1 to 6. Hope this helps, and I would have asked before adding this, but I
didn't see your contact info anywhere.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor

cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`Create a random number let's change the range a bit
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wowzers! You started off programming hello world and now you've made 
a guessing game! Keep up the good work, if you're brave enough to show off 
your program at the newcomer's corner at the DarkBASIC forums. Now what 
does gosub do? Gosub stands for Go Subroutine, it's just a shorter geekier 
way of saying it. You need to have a label to jump too, and the label must be declared like so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I have noticed that if you write the following line
&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
The game will choose a number, and then increase it until it reaches 10. All you have to do is to press 10 when you're asked for the number and you won. To correct the problem, write the program as this:
&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin

cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`Create a random number let's change the range a bit
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the game will only choose a number from 1 to 9, all you have to do next is to quess it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I found that there is an easier way to do the correction above.
Dbtutor wanted a number one through ten and your correction only brought the number through 1 to 9.
Also because of the way you wrote this, the probability of getting a 1 is higher 
now than getting any other number. An easier way to fix this is like this...
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin


cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`To solve the 0 being a value problem just add 1 instead 
value = rnd(9)+1
`the value down here is now no longer needed making the program less sloppier
`executes the command better now.

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a much easier way to take 0 out of the options of random numbers
while not affecting your probability at all. In the future, if you need a 
random number then use

&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(x)+1 
'with x being one less than you want to go to, I hope that helped.
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;pre&gt;
gosub mylabel

mylabel:
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are, experiment a bit with labels to see what they can do. 
You can return to the last label you leaped to by using the return 
command.

'''Assignment'''

Show off your work at the forums(optional)!

Make the hints more precise.

Give a limited number of lives.

Okay that's a day, go take a nap or something lol! :D



I think I said the lesson would end with Day 7, I was wrong. Now let's 
learn about functions. Functions are used to make your own commands that 
are absent from DarkBASIC. They are also used to perform functions isn't 
it obvious. DarkBASIC has no object oriented programming or OOP so you can 
use functions to substitute if you are a very decent programmer. 
So how do you use a function?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: DarkBASIC Professional supports OOP with user defined
types and with pointers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a Simple Function:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(1)
wait key
end

function hello_world(1)
  Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

First of all the brackets denote the parameter list, functions go at 
the end of your program and if your program runs into a function 
declaration beware! You can use exitfunction to exit a function easily. 
The best way to use functions is by creating a library with your own commands/procedures.
The above function, as the line number as a parameter. You can make your own, output
command using functions too.

function output(x,y,msg$)
   set cursor x,y
   print msg$
endfunction

Using this you can in a sense use Object Oriented Programming, if your a more advanced user.

Example of a Library in DarkBASIC

&lt;pre&gt;
`Basic Function Example

#include &quot;myfunctionlib.dba&quot;
x = 100
y = 10
hello_world(x,y)

`Now we have our own command!

Rem #####################################################################################

`Note the example below was not included in the above program it was in a different file named my
`functionlib.dba
`A little function library

function hello_world(x,y)
set cursor x,y
Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

The #include command in VC++ works like so: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In DarkBASIC a library works similarly but not exactly like the 
C++ example. Now you've learned what a function is and does!

Assignment:

Use functions and libraries to make a Mad Libs game.
Make your own command, like one for adding and so on.



This will probably be the last day in the life of lesson 3. We have 
been doing most of the time application and software programming. But 
soon enough we will write a game per day starting with Pong going to 
BreakOut and more. Unfortunately we won't write a Role Playing Game, for 
development of a role playing game takes months and roughly 5,000 or so
lines of code including tools we need to create. 


The Design Process of Software Is Like So

&lt;pre&gt;
The Software I want to Develop Is
It's Main Purpose Is
Problems That Need to be Solved
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In fact there's a method that envolves a series of pictures 
that I cannot recall and another method similar to the one above. 
I hope you learned something about DarkBASIC programming during the 
course of Lesson 3. Day 9 will continue in the next lesson...

                              == End of Lesson ==

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 4 - Number Crunching&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 9 Cont'd&lt;/center&gt;===
 
This lesson is all but one day long. When it's done, we'll move on 
to 2d don't expect mario or pong yet first thing we'll be doing is 
learning string manipulation, in about a day or so then we'll move on 
to images and whatnot. Who likes math? Not me, that's why we'll be 
getting DarkBASIC to do math for us. It'll be easier then using 
a calculator you won't even have to think about it.

Typical Math Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ is Increment of a value
= is equal to
- is decrement of a value
÷ is the division symbol. (ALT + 246 to create the ASCII symbol for division)

X multipying
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay, first of all by increment I mean increasing a value by 
whatever and vice versia with decrement as you decrease values. 

Typical Programming Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ still addition
= is equal to
- is subtraction
/ is division
* is Multiplication
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the above like you remember Christmas or you'll have 
problems doing math in programming! I can go on with more operators 
but it's not needed in a simple language like DarkBASIC as most of 
the math is taken care of by easier commands like wrapvalue.

This example may be easy but here it is

&lt;pre&gt;
`Math Example
`By Dbtutor

a = 1+2
b = 3-7
c = 9/3
d = 10*2

Print a
Print b
Print c
Print d
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most people have already known what was going to happen 
and what was going on. 

Here's some easy stuff!

&lt;pre&gt;
`Few math examples

a = 67

hexofa$ = hex$(a) ` hex$ returns value of 'a' as a hexdecimal string.
binaryofa$ = bin$(a) ` bin$ returns value of 'a' as a binary string.

b = 3

c = sqr(b)

inc d
dec e

Print a
Print hexofa$
Print binaryofa$
Print b
Print c
Print d
Print e
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why you'd need these above commands is beyond me, you only 
need them in rare situations, for more examples of math in 
DarkBASIC consult the DarkBASIC editor's command reference under math.
For now it's over with...

                             ==End of Lesson==

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 5 - Loops&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 10&lt;/center&gt;===

Trust me loops are useful, they do tedious tasks and they're easy to work with.

Take for example a lottery program

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim lottery(100)
lottery(1) = 1
lottery(2) = 2
lottery(3) = 3
lottery(4) = 4
etc...
Print Lottery(1)
Print lottery(2)
Print Lottery(3)
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above way is for squares, and people without loop knowledge.

Done with a loop
&lt;pre&gt;
`Let's image the dim command above is down here
for a = 1 to 100
     Print lottery(a)
next a
&lt;/pre&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: You can't print &quot;lottery(a)&quot; as it does not exist, instead write this:                                                    
                                                                
dim lottery(100)
for a = 1 to 100
print a
next a
wait key
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using loops remember to indent it makes the program more 
human readable for others. With loops we can finally have more 
advanced input, input without variables, well some variables. Let's 
look at some loops then.

Repeat/Until

&lt;pre&gt;
Repeat
   `what the loop does here
until conditionmet
&lt;/pre&gt;

While/Endwhile

&lt;pre&gt;
While conditionmet
   `What the loop does
endwhile
&lt;/pre&gt;

Do/Loop

&lt;pre&gt;
do
    `task here
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the only way to exit a loop is by quitting which is a no|no, 
the exit command which is the best way, or a gosub command. In some loops, 
the loop ends once a condition is met, and in others after a task is done 
it exits. If you paid attention you should know what I'm talking about. 
Day's over go eat, sleep, take a walk, whatever come back tomorrow!

===&lt;center&gt;Day 11&lt;/center&gt;===

This is the advanced input section, if we want a system key we 
can easily use commands like spacekey(), etc. Go have a look at them, 
they are the easiest to understand, find out how to disable them from being 
able to be pressed in DarkBASIC also while you are there. For other keys 
there's two ways basically scancode(value) which is different per country's keyboard, a Spanish keyboard is different then a British one, and you have to find a value! Or you can use ASCII values, which has a humorous pronunciation(it's pronounced ass key :P). Find out what ASCII stands for at Wikipedia, just type it in the search box and there you go. You can find Wikipedia at[http://www.wikipedia.org CLICK HERE TO GO TO WIKIPEDIA] in case your just curious because I forget I believe it's American Standard Character 
Something Something. We will be using the ASCII because it's the same for every computer 
and no need to use numeric values.

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Loops are needed for input BTW
do
   if inkey$() = &quot;charhere&quot; then exit
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a key example

&lt;pre&gt;
do
  if inkey$() = &quot;a&quot; then print &quot;Lowercase A&quot;
  if inkey$() = &quot;A&quot; then Print &quot;Uppercase A&quot;
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember A is different from a when using inkey$(). Now the lesson's 
over with, for an assignment find out what ASCII stands for and experiment
with the inkey$(). 

                              == End of Lesson ==

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 6 - File Control &amp; Data&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 12&lt;/center&gt;===

Day 12 already, you're progressing towards a great career in programming 
DarkBASIC and programming in general! Lots of people have trouble writing 
files in DarkBASIC, and some have problems with Data types and more. This 
lesson will take a lot of time to cover, I'm going to say 5 days for you and 
about 2 weeks for me to write them. Hopefully, I'll get them done before but 
if not well you just have to wait for me or another to contribute. Today, 
we'll learn how to save a file.

Take for example this scenario

&lt;pre&gt;
text$ = &quot;Hey guess what open me up in notepad and see what happens!&quot;
set dir &quot;C:/&quot;
if file exist(&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;) = 1  
   delete file &quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
endif
open to write 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
write string 1,text$
close file 1
open to read 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
read string 1,newtext$
Print newtext$
close file 1
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

What a mouth full! In machine language it takes several thousand lines 
to do this same exact thing crazy or what! As you found out, the code 
above creates a string variable, moves the directory we'll be working in 
to c drive, if the file exist deletes it(or else we cannot overwrite it as 
it already exists), writes the file, closes it, opens it to read the contents, uses a new string to contain the line of text, then Prints it and finally you have to press any key before it ends. Now that's great! But remember 
the extension? You can change it to create your own files. You can also write 
various things such as: bytes, characters, and so on. To see more of what 
you can write view the command reference under the DarkBASIC help file. We'll just be using string for now and later byte.

This example will generate a syntax error and I'll tell you why now

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
delete file &quot;wrong.txt&quot;
open to write 1,&quot;wrong.txt&quot;
write string 1,a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember numbers are not strings, to make a number a string we can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
a$ = str$(a)
b = val(a$)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command str$ changes a number into a value, and the command val 
changes a string into a value. There are many other odd things you can 
do with strings as well which you can see under the DarkBASIC help file 
command reference of strings. See some examples and change them around a bit. 

Here's a useless kinda piece of software for strings

&lt;pre&gt;
`Crazy Strings
`By Dbtutor

cls
message$ = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;ASC() returns the ASCII number of the first letter in the str&quot;
Print asc(message$)
Print &quot;Len counts how many characters in a string&quot;
Print len(message$)
Print &quot;Mid gets the middle write characters of a string&quot;
midval = 3
Print mid$(message$,midval)
Print &quot;Here's the binary of the number 678&quot;
Print bin$(678)
Print &quot;Here's the hex of that number&quot;
Print hex$(678)
Print &quot;There are many more ways of destroying strings&quot;
Print &quot;Much are useless, but take a gander at them&quot;
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw above manuiplating strings is easy but pretty much useless. 
In some situations they are useful like a file manager tool which 
we'll be making very soon along with some other file stuff. In the 2d 
tutorial's final part we'll use files to make a very simple tool 
very much like ZZT or MegaZeux. There's lots to cover so bear with me! 
On day 13 we'll be learning more ways of writing files, remember byte? 
Well you can use it to write a value to a file. I used txt has my 
extension, try using .dat, .ini, etc. You can even make one up! Using write, 
you can also write word or an integer value, a long or long integer value, 
and even a float. Why I don't know. 

Good Example of Writing A File:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
b$ = str$(a)
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then delete file &quot;a&quot;
open to write &quot;a&quot;,1
write string 1,b$
close file 1
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then readit = 1
if readit = 1
   open to read 1,&quot;a&quot;
   read string 1,c$
   d = val(c$)
   Print d
   Print &quot;Same thing! Use val and str! Their better!&quot;
   wait key
   end
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note: from Cody Oebel'''

the above code fails to work properly, and will not compile and run.

I found the If file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 ...  the = 1 is ambiguous, and is not needed.

below is my version of this code snippet

&lt;pre&gt;
`Edit by Cody C Oebel:
 
 g = 11
 set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
 b$ = str$(g)
 if file exist(&quot;a.txt&quot;) then delete file &quot;a.txt&quot;
 open to write 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 write string 1, b$
 close file 1
 if file exist (&quot;a.txt&quot;)
 open to read 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 read string 1, z$
 d = val(z$)
 print d
 print &quot;This should work now, and is smaller amount of code&quot;
 wait key
 endif
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, see what I mean? Later we'll be using current directories and 
file branching statements to make a simple file browser. Very simple! 
Write byte is sometimes used for example in tilemappers and so on but the 
standard is write string because it's simple. Remember keep it 
simple stupid!

Let's write an array
&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;

save array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

load array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''NOTE: Again this code above did not work: By Cody Oebel'''

Here is my working version for other readers to see the minor mistakes.

Also note at the bottom of the compiler it shows you the format

for save array, and load array e.g. Filename, array.

I also added the variable stringname filename$ to contain &quot;array.ini&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
filename$ = &quot;array.ini&quot;
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;
set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
save array filename$, a$(10)

load array filename$, a$(10)

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can save big ole arrays, database programming anyone? 
Remember our guessing game? Go back and fix it up a bit so that you 
can include this newly learned code in it. You've learned a lot about 
files so far. Perpare for directories on Day 13!

===&lt;center&gt;Day 13&lt;/center&gt;===

Day 13 arrived and we're only two days away from the half way point. 
That's great news, as soon as you can be a master programmer in 
DarkBASIC the better! Well, really DarkBASIC takes awhile to master, not 
to scare you but I'm not a master programmer either. If you know somebody with 
a good game it's usually not that they're the best programmer but 
just a great game maker. Some DarkBASIC users have gone on to make 
commercial games such as: Dumbo &amp; Cool, Star Wraith, etc. DarkBASIC 
is great for games and team efforts. Not so for applications as you'll 
find out today.

Here's a simple file manager

&lt;pre&gt;
Input &quot;Set directory to: &quot;;direct$
set dir direct$
&lt;/pre&gt;

You don't get to see files do you? We can easily view files and 
whatever using some simple commands. Remember some are tedious, but 
when in use with loops! Now this is a file manager, you change dirs, 
view files, and whatnot, it's not a professional tool, it's showing you 
the ropes. But before we do it's time to have a look at a better 
file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Manager
`By Dbtutor

`Get the directory to use
setdirect$ = get dir$()

`Set the directory to the current directory
set dir setdirect$

`Current amount of items
items = 10

find first
Print get file name$(1)

for a = 2 to items
  find next
  Print get file name$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Wow, that's cool and all but there's no user input and no file 
manipulation dus this program is file system viewer. Just like 
windows explorer! Really nowadays writing a file manager is pretty 
much useless especially if it's ugly. But file managers in your program 
in DarkBASIC allows better productivity then in typing in the file 
name or directory and whatnot. We're not going back to the DOS days 
God forbid type in a command and hope it works! Remember I said tedious? 
Well there is a much better way to write the following program above. Don't 
worry we'll be writing a file manager later! Before I show you a more 
productive way.

Follow these instructions:

&lt;pre&gt;
Go to http://www.computechtenerife.com/
Register as a user.
Click on Dark Basic Support and then Downloads
Scroll down and find the function libraries
Click on the Db file selector
Download and extract the files for usage later
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay now that's done we can see a better way of doing things in 
the file system viewer world. We're only a few blocks away from 
the file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Viewer
`By Dbtutor

set dir &quot;C:\&quot;

Perform checklist for files
for a = 1 to checklist quantity()
  Print checklist string$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

See how many lines less we have? There is other perform checklist for 
things such as directories and devices. Go have a look and change 
perform checklist for files command with a few of them.


Now remember that file manager library you downloaded, if you 
haven't guessed we'll be modding some of the code inside the include 
file(not the function library) to make our own modded file manager. Remember 
the library is copyright to a DarkBASIC user known as TDK_MAN one of the 
best DarkBASIC programmers out there besides you(just flattering) I'm sure 
you could beat him at his game after 30 years. Just kidding if your reading 
this TDK no offense. He's made lots of DarkBASIC programs including MatEdit 
which we'll be using later on in the 3d chapters along with a 3d moddler and whatnot. 

Here's the Source Code

&lt;pre&gt;

There you are a easy file manager thanks to other peoples function 
libraries! You can find lots on TDK's site(http://www.matedit.com/db.htm). 
Along with tutorials for functions and more. That's all for Day 13, there 
was no quiz for awhile so expect a lot of quizzes later on. I couldn't 
find anything worth quizzing you on. There will be lotsa data going on 
in Day 14.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 14&lt;/center&gt;===

We already know what variables are, but you haven't used data 
statements yet. Data statements work very easily, you just put 
data, space and then put all the types of data.

Examples of Data

&lt;pre&gt;
data &quot;strings&quot;,12,5.6,&quot;and integers and floats tooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!&quot;
data 12
data &quot;string me&quot;
data 5.50
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have lots of data types in one statement as long as you 
separate them with commas. That's useful but how can we read the data? 
Well we can use read.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Read Example
data 4
read var1
Print var1
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use restore to reset the data pointer you'll see what I'm 
talking about later. It's good practice to use different labels to 
store different data.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Big Data Example
gosub datastored

datastored:
data 1234
data 12
data 1
data 4
data 56 
gosub readdata

readdata:
read var1
read var2
read var3
read var4
read var5

print var1
Print var2
Print var3
print var4
Print var5
&lt;/pre&gt;

First it stores data then reads it, you can do this backwards 
if you want. Whichever way you read and store data it works. Now we're
into games, no explaining(well some) just pure games programming. 
We'll program a game a day woohoo let's go now!

                      ==End of Lesson==

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 7 - 2D Game Programming Pt 1&lt;/center&gt;==
===&lt;center&gt;Day 15&lt;/center&gt;===

The half way point, finally after all that coding and reading and days. 
This chapter we'll be making a text adventure using more text commands 
you'll now learn. Plus you'll learn how to clear the screen in various 
colors, and oh boy you're gonna enjoy this lesson. 

You probably thought, my God does the text always have to be white!

&lt;pre&gt;
`NOPE
ink rgb(0,255,0),1
Print &quot;OMG FINALLY COLOR!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! I'm a Canadian but I still spell color as color instead 
of colour. What's the RGB for? It stands for Red, Green, Blue, look 
at your monitor with a lens you'll see lots of those pixels in those 
colors. The rgb must be separated by brackets and then a comma for the transparentcy value. The transparentcy ranges from 0 to 255. RGB values 
range from 0 to 255 also.

Here's Some Colors to Remember

&lt;pre&gt;
255,0,0 - red
0,255,0 - green
255,255,0 - yellow
0,0,255 - blue
0,255,255 - cyan
255,255,255 - white
0,0,0 - black
255,0,255 - pink
192,192,192 - light grey
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see more have a look in paint, view the rgbs values and fool 
around that's the way I found out, so you should find out too. Using 
these above values you should be able to make nice colors. The lower the 
value the darker, the higher the lighter.

Now after that you want a better way to Print right?

&lt;pre&gt;
text x,y,string$
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using text, you need to use + instead of a semi-colon to 
separate variables. All values must be a string, remember to convert a
value to a string use the str$ command as seen in Lesson 6.

The Right Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is no syntax error &quot;+str$(a)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Wrong Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is a syntax error you won't see this text until you fix &quot;+a
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change the font easily 

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font fontnameasstring$
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can make our text opaque easily too or allow us to write over
other text values

&lt;pre&gt;
set text opaque
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's style changes

&lt;pre&gt;
set text bold
set text italic
set text bolditalic
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how to change the size

&lt;pre&gt;
set text size integernumber
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay here's all those in a program

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font &quot;Times New Roman&quot;
set text size 30
set text bold
text 1,100,&quot;Hey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You assignment is to fool around with text values and 
colors, come back tomorrow

===&lt;center&gt;Day 16&lt;/center&gt;===

Okay, now we've learned lots about changing text values it's 
time to write your own text adventure. We'll call it 
&quot;Dungeons of Doom&quot;, it'll have the player to escape the 
dank dungeons of a castle using numerous data commands 
and whatnot.

First let's do an outline:

[[Image:outline6ql.th.jpg]]

Now we have an outline let's write a simple story:

Evil Elves have captured you in their prison, now you must escape 
the Dungeon of Doom. Beware some turns lead to doom, others lead 
to a way out. 

There is only two ways to die in our game, since it's more like 
a maze anyways. 

Now Let's Do Some Data For It:

back and add in comments describing what's happening in each. The final 
part in your assignment is to edit all the code and data statements to 
make a sequel, add rooms, and more. No this game is not a text role 
playing game, we'll make a text role playing game in the next lesson. I 
think tomorrow your gonna have a break-out of game programming.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 17&lt;/center&gt;===

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We're going to make a Pong game today, a BreakOut 
game today, and your going to learn about images, sprites and more! Okay, 
so how can we load multimedia in DarkBASIC? Remember in the file manager 
program we had some confusing formats of files in there. One thing I 
didn't add was animations unfortunately. 

Multimedia Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Image
`Supports bmps and jpgs only
id = 1
string$ = &quot;myimage.bmp&quot;
load image string$,id
x = 1
y = 1
paste image id,x,y

`Music
`Sound works the same way, only instead the word music is replaced with the word `sound
`Supports are: wav, mp3, and midi
musid = 1
musstring$ = &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;
load music musstring$,musid
play music musid
stop music musid
loop music musid

`Animation
`Supports gif, avi, may support other formats
animid = 1
animstring$ = &quot;myanimation.gif&quot;
load animation animstring$,animid
play animation animid

`Bitmap
`Works same as image only supports bitmaps, you can load only 32
bmpid = 1
bmp$ = &quot;mybmp.bmp&quot;
load bitmap bmp$
`This pastes the bitmap, but the id can be used to create bitmaps at certain `locations 
`see bmps under the command reference for those details

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go look at some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC, some more 
are 3dsound, and you can play music off your cd too. We'll be using 
some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC in later chapters for 
now we'll be focusing on the said above in the example.

Your main question may be what is a sprite? A sprite is a 
2d character that is used in games. Basically a sprite is a 
image that does more, in DarkBASIC sprites are the lifeblood 
of the system.

Sprite Works Like

&lt;pre&gt;
sprite spriteid,x,y,imageid
&lt;/pre&gt;

You cannot use load bitmap and use that as an image for your sprite, 
you can only use images loaded by the load image command.


Before you did not manipulate the x,y cords of a image in DarkBASIC 
well that's about to change. Before we start, if we leave the computer 
to take care of our game's framerate then our game will run slow and 
differently on different paced computers. Use sync on, to turn the 
framerate over too you and away from the computer. Every time the 
sync command is used the screen is updated constantly. Use 
the sync rate command, to set the rate the frame refreshes, 
mostly 30 is good for 3d games in DarkBASIC, and 40 for 2d games 
is also good too, but use 30 to make sure. There are a 
few commands in darkbasic that draws crude graphics, the commands 
we'll use are: line(line startingx,toendingx,startingy,toendingy), 
circle(x,y,radius), and dot(dot x,y). They draw these graphics in 
the default ink, if the ink is not set it'll use cyan as a default. 
There are more commands that draw different basic 2d shapes, but 
we won't be using them. If your curious go check them out 
under BASIC2d under the DarkBASIC command reference.


Here's an example of you being able to move a circle
&lt;pre&gt;
`Moving Circle
`By Dbtutor

`Hide the mouse
hide mouse

`Setup sync rate
sync on
sync rate 30

`Make the screen grey
cls rgb(192,192,192) 

`Select an ink color for us, make it all transparent
ink rgb(0,155,0),0

`Draw the circle at cordinates provided
xpos = 100
ypos = 200
circle xpos,ypos,10

`Start the main loop
do
   `Clean up mess left over, and re-draw circle
   cls rgb(192,192,192)
   circle xpos,ypos,10

   `User control
   if upkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if downkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   if rightkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if leftkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos - 7
   `Allow no leaving the screen
   if xpos &gt; 600 then xpos = xpos - 7
   if xpos &lt; 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if ypos &gt; 400 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if ypos &lt; 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   `Refresh the screen
   sync
loop
   
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wow that worked out great eh? Let's get some sleep for now.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 18&lt;/center&gt;===

Before we start I'd just like to thank everybody for visiting 
this wikibook, taking time to read it and for knowing when I google 
&quot;DarkBASIC Programming&quot; I see my book on the first page. That's a great 
feeling! I hope you learn something, I'll try and get this book done very 
soon but I've been very busy with learning new things and my schoolwork. 
I've been learning Assembly, C++, Pascal, &amp; Visual Basic I'm also 
considering buying a console building kit &quot;The XGameStation&quot; by 
Mr Lamothe or as you may know him Andre' Lamothe or Lord Necron. 
He's one my biggest inspirations for programming besides 
Lee Bamber(the visionary behind DarkBASIC). Okay let's start with the 
pong game, I must say it's been a challenge writing this pong game, 
I've had lots of bugs with it. You must use your own images, 
only the source code is included.

'''Understanding the Material'''
Before I go ahead with the Pong game there is some things that I 
must, nay, need to explain to you. First, of all you need to 
understand what a &quot;sprite&quot; is, yes I know I mentioned it but not has 
in depth as I need to now, again that was just a basic example. Basically, 
put a sprite is nothing but an active image that allows more manipulation
then standard bitmaps. In our terms, speaking a sprite is in most cases 
nothing but a 2d character. We can do more with sprites in DarkBASIC 
then we can simply using just plain images.

You already know how to setup a sprite. But you do not know how to 
delete sprites, how to detect collision with sprites, and have not used 
them very much yet. The syntax of deleting a sprite is simple: delete 
sprite spriteid. The sprite obviously must exist if not you'll get a 
runtime error stating that the &quot;bob&quot; or sprite does not exist. The same 
works for collisions with sprites: the precise and best way is by using 
this command sprite collision(spriteid1,spriteid2). Again they must exist 
has I stated, and you must have two, again I'm stating the obvious but 
there are pretty dumb people out there. 

The other way works the same thing except it's not has precise and 
goes like this: sprite hit(spriteid1,spriteid2). Easy! What may not be 
so easy after reading the code below is what the random numbers are for. 
These random numbers simply put are so that the computer generates a 
number from 0 to 1 in which direction the ball should go. They are for 
both X axis and Y axis and you should know what those are already.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 19&lt;/center&gt;===

 Okay, so we've made Pong the next step is to make a Break-Out game. Just giving you,
the source code of the game would prove you didn't code the pong game by yourself.
So what I'm going to do is let you program your own break-out game, and I will give some
guided examples. After this quick break-out game exercise I will be discussing multimedia!

Collisions

''if sprite collision(paddle,ball) = 1 then bouncball = 1''

Possible Solutions to Make the Ball Bounce :S

-Setup a variable called ballmovex, set it's value to random 1 or 0.
-if the ball strikes 0 make it move left, and in the case of 1 right
-do the same thing with a variable called ballmovey, except in this
-case moving up or down.

Possible Solutions of Setting Up Blocks

-Setup an array which holds the x positions of your bricks, and the 
y positions of your bricks. Then one for if the brick has been struck,
so if the brick has been struck it will equal 1 or true and then have
conditional statements(if and thens) for the action to break the brick.

''if if sprite collision(paddle,brickhit(bricknum)) = 1 then destroybrick = 1''



if destroybrick = 1

  brickx(bricknum) = -1
  bricky(bricknum) = -1

endif





Something to Remember:
   Remember you need a do loop to accept advanced input such as inkey$(), returnkey(), etc.



I've given lots of suggestions as to how to complete the Break-Out game, hopefully this 
will go down nice and easy without heartburn. If you have a case of &quot;what thes&quot; then 
I suggest you visit the codebase on the official DarkBASIC home page: http://www.thegamecreators.com, it has everything a DarkBASIC coder shall need.

 '''Multimedia In DarkBASIC - Audio'''
Not many people can say that they hate music, in fact most people love hearing ambient
music in games, I know I do! Above, I used some strange commands, play sound, play music,
load music, play music. Well, DarkBASIC has three audio supports, MP3, Wave, and Midi.
Loading music is very simple, and sound works the same way. So I'm going to give you a
code example, you bring the sounds, I'll bring the code!




'''Code Example for Audio:'''
 Rem Audio Example
 `Load audio
 load sound &quot;mysound.wav&quot;,1
 load music &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;,1
 `Play audio once
 play sound 1
 `Loop music
 loop music 1
 `wait key
 wait key
 stop music 1
 loop sound 1


So what are the numbers at the end? Remember in images, well this number is a numeric ID 
given. Remember the location of your audio, and extension!

 '''Multimedia in DarkBASIC - Animations'''
This will probably be the last multimedia entry, unless someone does one on dlls, 
I won't be, since I have an older version of DarkBASIC.

Animations at this point in time do not include those such as mario walking, however
they do include those such as animated GIFs(Graphic Interchange Format), and
AVIs(Audio Video Interleave). So far I believe there are two formats for
animation .gif, and .avi please tell me so if otherwise. Animations can
be useful for game over screens and maybe even some Mortal Kombat style
finishers!!







'''Code Sample'''
 load animation &quot;animation1.avi&quot;,1
 play animation 1
 wait key
 stop animation 1
 load animation &quot;animation2.gif&quot;,2
 play animation 2
 loop animation 2

I challenge YOU to create a 2D Melee Game.  These are simple.  Here is an example:

  if playertwolives = 0
  delete sprite 2 
  end
endif
endif
hide sprite 4

gosub mainloop''
&lt;/pre&gt;
That is a simple format for a multiplayer melee game in 2D.  Notice
I have cleverly not supplied the media!  Hahahahahaaaa!  Now get programming!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}
==Ablative Absolute==

The ablative absolute construction is used in a sentence to provide a background for the main action in the sentence. An ablative absolute is formed with a noun and an adjective or participle in the ablative case.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;convivis ingressis&lt;/b&gt; ille cenam parat&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With the guests having entered&lt;/b&gt;, he prepares dinner.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;viris in taberna bibentibus&lt;/b&gt; feminae diligenter laborabant&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With the men drinking in the tavern&lt;/b&gt;, the women worked diligently.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;omnibus ieiunis&lt;/b&gt; multos panes parare debuit&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With everyone (being) hungry&lt;/b&gt;, he had to prepare lots of bread.

==Accusative Infinitive==

The accusative infinitive construction is used to indirectly report speech or thoughts. An accusative infinitive construction is formed by taking the indirect clause and putting the subject in the accusative and the verb in the infinitive.

&lt;i&gt;ille credit &lt;b&gt;pueros stultos esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

He believes the boys to be fools = He believes &lt;b&gt;that the boys are fools&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;magister parentibus dicit &lt;b&gt;pueros stultos esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The teacher says to the parents &lt;b&gt;that the boys are fools&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori dicit &lt;b&gt;se confectum esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The farmer says to his wife &lt;b&gt;that he is exhausted&lt;/b&gt;.

In this sentence, note how the reflexive &lt;i&gt;se&lt;/i&gt; refers to the main subject of the sentence.

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori &lt;b&gt;dixit&lt;/b&gt; se confectum esse&lt;/i&gt;

The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;was&lt;/b&gt; tired.

Note how esse, despite being a present infinitive, is translated into the past tense. This is because the infinitive uses the action of the main verb, in this case &lt;i&gt;dixit&lt;/i&gt; as a reference point instead of the present.

But what about sentences such as &quot;the farmer &lt;b&gt;says&lt;/b&gt; to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;worked&lt;/b&gt; diligently&quot;? For those, you need to use the &lt;b&gt;past infinitive&lt;/b&gt;.

===Overview of infinitives in all tenses===

|amatum iri
|moniturus, -a, -um esse
|monitum iri
|recturus, -a, -um esse
|rectum iri

|auditum iri
|}

The sentence &quot;The farmer says to his wife that he worked diligently&quot; would thus translate as:

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori dicit se diligenter laboravisse&lt;/i&gt;

The following examples show how different infinitives with the main verb in the past and present would appear in English:

      <comment>/* Usage */ wording</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}

This is the documentation for {{tl|shortcut}}.

=== Usage ===
# Insert the shortcut.  If it is to a section, put it on the line above the section title.
# Create a redirect page with the name of the page based on your shortcut name.  Include the namespace name in both the shortcut name and the redirect page name. For example, substituting your own shortcut name as the title of the page, and substituting the proper namespace, add the following as the top-line on your redirect page:
#:&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Namespace'':''Title of page with''#''Optional very long section name'']]
# Verify operation.  Note that shortcut templates should display in all capitals.

These templates are mainly used on user pages and talk pages in reference to Wikibooks, Help, and Category namespaces. These templates inform about the shortcuts available to the page they are on. For example, [[WB:RFD]] redirects to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] and therefore Wikibooks:Requests for deletion renders a shortcut box listing WB:RFD. 

The point of these templates is not to list every single redirect for a page (indeed, that's what &quot;[[Special:WhatLinksHere|What links here]]&quot; is for), instead they should list only one or two common and easily-remembered redirects.

The ''shortcut'' template can take up to five shortcuts as parameters.

=== Examples ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code
! Result
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; | {{tlx|shortcut|WB:AA}}
| {{shortcut|WB:AA}}
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;  | {{tlx|shortcut|WB:CHAT|WB:RR/G}}
| {{shortcut|WB:CHAT|WB:RR/G}}
|}

=== Anchors ===
These templates automatically add anchors. If a shortcut box with the shortcut [[WB:RFD]] is placed on the page [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] then the link [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#WB:RFD]] will take you to the position in the page where that shortcut box is placed.

For instance, try this link: [[#WB:AA]]

Thus if you make a shortcut for a section of a page then you can use the anchor in the shortcut redirect itself. Like this:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[Pagename#WB:RFD]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== See also ===
* [[Help:Shortcuts]] – The how-to guide and guideline about how and when to create shortcuts and shortcut boxes. A must-read for anyone handling shortcuts.
* {{tl|anchor}} - a way to overcome the otherwise permanent fact that section titles are the only way to link to a section
* {{tl|template shortcut}} – Use this one to show the names of shortcuts/redirects to a template.

__TOC__

== String type ==

=== Usage ===

The String type is defined in the core module lang/types. String literals such as &quot;abc&quot;, are of this type.

 str := &quot;This is a string literal&quot;

On the right hand side a String object is created represented by the string literal. Its reference is assigned to the str variable.

A few operators are overloaded for strings by default. For example, ( + ) is used as a string concatenation operator. For example:

 str := &quot;I love&quot; + &quot; french cheese&quot;
 {{ooc///|is the same as}}
 str := &quot;I love french cheese&quot;

( + ) is overloaded for pretty much every type inherited from C (strings, chars, numeric types) so that you can do

 str := &quot;The answer is &quot; + 42

Also overloaded in the standard SDK is '''[ ]''', used as a slicing operator

 &quot;Sand&quot; println()
 {{ooc///|is the same as}}
 &quot;Sandwich&quot;[0..4] println()

Note: the slicing operator applies on bytes, not characters. See the UTF-8 Support section below for more informations.

Many more operators are overloaded on strings, such as '''==''' for comparison, '''*''' for repeating, '''[ ]=''' for bound-checked modification, etc.

Strings in ooc aren't immutable, but every method in the standard type '''String''' returns a copy of the given string, and never modifies the original.

The standard type '''String''' provides a nice set of methods for string manipulation. Since they all return copies, you should do things like that

  name = name trim() {{ooc///|remove whitespace at both ends}}

But never:

  name trim() {{ooc///|wrong!}}

This would create a new trimmed string and throw it away. It is good to study the String type and know its methods in order not to reinvent the wheel.

=== UTF-8 support ===

At the time of this writing, there is no built-in UTF-8 support in ooc. The '''length'''() function returns the number of bytes used to store the String, never the number of characters.

The reason for that is that there is no clearly defined boundaries between character in the Unicode standard. One can roughly determinate 'grapheme clusters', ie. associate modifiers with glyphs that correspond to characters, etc. but it's a very difficult problem, and there are edge cases with non-European/non-American languages.

Therefore, for now, there's no UTF-8 character, nor codepoint, etc. but that doesn't prevent one from using UTF-8 in ooc programs. The ICU and utf8proc libraries seem especially interesting for handling such encoding matters in an ooc codebase.

Note that the language design on this issue is not definitive, and is subject to changes in the future, as soon as other, more pressing matters are decided upon.

=== Length in bytes ===

As a consequence of the lack of UTF-8 support, the '''length'''() methods returns the number of bytes so that:

 &quot;o/&quot; length()

is 2, but

 &quot;漢字&quot; length()

is 6, because 3 bytes are used to store each of the characters that make up the Japanese word &quot;Kanji&quot;

=== Creating new strings ===

You can create a new String from a char:

 str := String new('\n')

or just allocate a fixed number of chars:

 str := String new(128)

A String literal, such as &quot;abc&quot;, is also of type String

 str := &quot;Curiosity killed the cat.&quot;

=== Iterating through a string ===

You can iterate over the bytes of a String, because it implements the '''iterator'''() method.

 {{ooc/kw|for}} (c in &quot;Hello, vertical world!&quot;) {
   c println()
 }

=== Comparing strings ===

You can use the '''==''' operator to compare two Strings, because it's overloaded in the SDK. It calls the equals() method, so that, in ooc:

  name == &quot;JFK&quot;
  {{ooc///|is the same as}}
  name equals(&quot;JFK&quot;)

This behavior greatly enhances the readability of ooc code, as opposed to, say, [[Java Programming/Strings|Java]].

You can still compare the addresses of Strings by casting them to Pointers first:

  {{ooc///|equals won't be called here}}
  name as Pointer == otherName

The '''compare''' method can be used to test parts of strings for equality, for example:

  &quot;awesome&quot; compare(&quot;we&quot;, 1, 2) {{ooc///|is true}}
  &quot;Turn right&quot; compare(&quot;Turn left&quot;, 0, 6) {{ooc///|is false}}

=== Substrings and slicing ===

The '''[ ]''' operator can be used with a range to obtain the same effect as calling substring

  {{ooc///|both these statements are true}}
  &quot;happiness&quot;[3..6] == &quot;pin&quot;
  &quot;happiness&quot; substring(3, 6) equals(&quot;pin&quot;)

=== Searching in a string ===

The '''indexOf'''() and '''lastIndexOf'''() methods allow to search for the first and last occurence, respectively, of a byte or a string in another string.

  str := &quot;Proud of you, son.&quot;
  {{ooc///|returns 6}}
  str indexOf(&quot;of&quot;) toString() println()
  {{ooc///|returns 15}}
  str lastIndexOf('o') toString() println()

=== Repeating a string ===

A String can be repeated multiple time using the overloaded ( * ) operator, or with the times() method:

  {{ooc///|these lines print the same thing}}
  println(&quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; * 5)
  &quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; times(5) println()

Note that because of precedence, we can't write:

  {{ooc///|wrong!}}
  &quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; * 5 println()

Because the compiler would read that as:

  &quot;The cake is a lie&quot; * (5 println())

Which is definitely not what we intended.

=== Reversing a string ===

A String can be reversed using the '''reverse''' method.

  {{ooc///|prints 'lebon nob el'}}
  &quot;le bon nobel&quot; reverse() println()

Be aware that '''reverse'''() works on bytes, not characters. See the UTF-8 Support section for more information.

=== Appending strings ===

You can use either the '''( + )''' operator or the '''append'''() and '''prepend'''() methods:

  {{ooc///|results in the string &quot;indirect&quot;}}
  &quot;in&quot; + &quot;direct&quot;
  &quot;in&quot; append(&quot;direct&quot;)
  &quot;direct&quot; prepend(&quot;in&quot;)

As with all other string methods, a copy is returned, the original string is not modified.

However, if you are building a string from many smaller parts, it is better to use a Buffer instead, as detailed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to generate large XForms using a REST service for doing performance tests for large forms.  The primary item being tested is how long does the form take to become &quot;ready&quot; after the form is loaded.

== Method ==
We will use an XQuery to create XForms files.  This XQuery will take a single URL parameter that has a count of the number of elements it will generate.  The XForms will have one input field and two select1 fields for each count.  Each input control will have its own instance in the model.

== Sample of Instance in the model. ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;input1&gt;input 1&lt;/input1&gt;
   &lt;input2&gt;input 2&lt;/input2&gt;
   &lt;country-code1&gt;country-code 1&lt;/country-code1&gt;
   &lt;country-code2&gt;country-code 2&lt;/country-code2&gt;
   &lt;state-code1&gt;state-code 1&lt;/state-code1&gt;
   &lt;state-code2&gt;state-code 2&lt;/state-code2&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Instance Generator ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $count := xs:positiveInteger(request:get-parameter('count', '20'))

return
&lt;root&gt;
    {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('input', $counter)} {concat('input ', $counter)}
    }

    {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('country-code', $counter)} {concat('country-code ', $counter)}
    }

   {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('state-code', $counter)} {concat('state-code ', $counter)}
    }

&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Autogeneration of Input Fields ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
for $counter in (1 to $input-count)
   return
      (&lt;xf:input ref=&quot;input{$counter}&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Input {$counter}:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:input&gt;,
      &lt;br/&gt;)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Autogeneration of Select1 Fields ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
for $counter in (1 to $select1-count)
  return
     (&lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;country-code{$counter}&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Country {$counter}:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;xf:itemset nodeset=&quot;instance('code-tables')/code-table[name='country-code']/items/item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label ref=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;xf:value ref=&quot;value&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xf:itemset&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;,
         &lt;br/&gt;
     )
&lt;/source&gt;

The code tables are stored in a static XML file called &quot;code-tables.xml&quot;.  The format is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-tables&gt;
    &lt;code-table&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;country-code&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;items&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Select a Country...&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;value/&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;value&gt;af&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Albania&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;value&gt;al&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
...etc....
        &lt;/items&gt;
    &lt;/code-table&gt;
&lt;/code-tables&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Source Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

=== Items ===

*We have laid out the shop floor so that processes and machines are in close proximity to each other.
*We have organized our plant floor by means of manufacturing cells.
*Our machines are grouped according to the product family to which they are dedicated.
*The layout of the shop floor facilitates  low inventories and fast throughput.
*Our processes are located close together, so that material handling and part storage are minimized.

*We make an effort, in the design process, to list only the specifications that are really needed.
*There is a strong customer focus in our design process.
*The emphasis in part design is on minimizing the part count.
*Our engineers make an effort to simplify our product designs.
*The parts we produce are designed for ease in manufacturability and assembly.

Extent to which we have simplified and reduced parts counts in main product over the last five years.

=== Items ===

*We use attitude/desire to work in a team as a criterion in employee selection.
*We use problem-solving aptitude as a criterion in selection of employees.
*We use work values and behavioral attitudes as a criterion in employee selection.
*We select employees who can provide ideas to improve the manufacturing process.
*We select employees who are able to work well in small groups.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to identify what kind of page it or its subject page is.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre&gt;{{pagetype | classification | page= }}&lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
;''classification''
This ''unnamed'' parameter is optional and is used to distinguish between different non-book pages in mainspace (e.g. disambiguation pages and redirects). See below for details.

;''page''
The name of a page. The default is the current page.

;''subjectspace''
If set to ''yes'' then subjectspace pages will be treated the same as talkspace pages.

===Output===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Data Editor window of SPSS has two tabs that provide different information, the data, and data on that data (the metadata).  This page explores the former, the Data View tab. 

The tabs are shown in the bottom left corner of the Data Editor window, as shown:
[[File:04dataview01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The Data View tab shows the raw data in your data set.  The rows represent individual ''cases''.  If your level of analysis is people, then each case represents one person.  Here are three:
[[File:04dataview03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The columns represent variables.  Each column contains all individual case data on that particular variable.  The &quot;id&quot; column:
[[File:04dataview02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A cell, at the intersection of a row and a column, represents one observation/measurement/datum.

Depending on the size of your data set, as with a spreadsheet, you may need to scroll up or down to see more cases or left or right to see more variables.  

The Data View tab in SPSS also allows you to modify your raw data.  You can do so by simply clicking on any cell in the Data View tab:
[[File:04dataview04.png|center|thumb|400px]]


Once you click on the cell, if you begin typing, you will replace all of the information in the cell.  If you double-click on a cell, you can modify the contents without replacing them:
[[File:04dataview05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

While a nice feature of SPSS, the ability to modify your raw data is dangerous to the cavalier, as it makes it easy to change your raw data.  Changing your raw data should never be undertaken lightly or without backup as it will change your analyses.  Recent versions of SPSS include an &quot;undo&quot; feature, but not all changes in SPSS can be undone.  

It is good practice to work on copies of original data, only, and to keep backup files so that you can restore your data to good condition in the case of mishap.

Additionally, you should know that the Data View can be manipulated much like a spreadsheet. E.g., by clicking a column or row header, then re-clicking it, you can move columns and rows to rearrange them:
[[File:04dataview06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Moving through the data can be accomplished using the arrow keys, the page up and down keys, and the home and end keys as you might expect.  One useful habit is to use the ''tab'' key to move right across a case's variable values.  The tab key wraps around the data when it encounters an empty, undefined column, moving down to the start of the next case.

Additionally, you can sort by variable values, which is illustrated in [[../Sorting_Variables|sorting data]].

&lt;div style=text-align:right&gt;Continue to [[../Understanding the Variable View]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Variable View tab is another tab in the Data Editor window in addition to the Data View tab, which was discussed in the last chapter.  Again, you can select between the tabs at the bottom left corner of the Data Editor Window:
[[File:05variableview01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

In Variable View, the rows correspond to variables, not cases.  This view does not show raw data but rather metadata, information/settings/characteristics of the variables included in the data set.  The metadata of two variables:
[[File:05variableview03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The columns provide information about the various characteristics of the variables. The &quot;name&quot; column with part of the &quot;type&quot; column:
[[File:05variableview02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

There are 10 metadata columns total.  Each explained:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Column !! What it Means
|-
| Name || The variable's name.  Older versions of SPSS were limited to 8 character names.  New versions of SPSS are not, but lengthy descriptions better belong in the Label column.
|-
| Type || The data type of the variable.  There are 8 options: Numeric, Comma, Dot, Scientific notation, Date, Dollar, Custom currency, and String.  Most variables that beginning users will encounter will be either Numeric or String.  Numeric variables are numbers that either map to a value (e.g., 1=Catholic) or are the value of interest (height=73 inches).  String numbers are text and can only be treated as such.  As a result, very few manipulations can be performed on them.
|-
| Width || This column indicates the number of characters available for the variable values.
|-
| Decimals || This column allows you to control the number of numerals after the decimal place.
|-
| Label || This column allows you to provide a more extensive description of the variable.
|-
| Values || This column allows you to provide a key for what the numbers of a numeric variable may represent (e.g., 1=Catholic, 2=Protestant).
|-
| Missing || This column allows you to indicate which values mean ''missing''.  Values marked as missing are excluded from analyses in SPSS.
|-
| Columns || This column indicates the total number of columns a variable's values may have.
|-
| Align || This column indicates the alignment of the variable in the Data View, viz., Left, Right, or Center.
|-
| Measure || This last column indicates the level of measurement of the variable, viz., Nominal, Ordinal, or Scale. ''See next page.''
|}

Every variable in your data set should have all columns that are relevant for it filled out.  An example of an irrelevant column would be &quot;Values&quot; for an ID column, as that has a unique value in each row.

&lt;div style=text-align:right&gt;Continue to [[../Understanding the Measure Column]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frequencies, in statistics, refers to counts of categories or responses. It's a basic statistical tool that provides a sense of how often specific response options occur in a population.

Using the sample data set, let's say we want to know the geographic distribution of genetic counselors.  Fortunately, in the sample data set, there is a variable, &quot;region&quot;, that in combination with the Frequencies function in SPSS, will tell us what we want to know.  

Let's begin. Click &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Descriptive Statistics&quot; -&gt; &quot;Frequencies&quot;:
[[File:14frequencies01.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The &quot;Frequencies&quot; window will appear:
[[File:14frequencies02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Scroll through the variables until you find the variable you want.  In our example, we're interested in &quot;region&quot;, so click the arrow to move that variable into the &quot;Variable(s):&quot; box:
[[File:14frequencies03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Then make sure that the &quot;Display frequency tables&quot; box is checked and click &quot;OK&quot;.  In the Output Window you should see
[[File:14frequencies04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Note that there are two tables in this output.  The first breaks down the frequency of valid region data versus missing.  The second table shows frequency distribution with four labeled columns. 

The first, labeled &quot;Frequency&quot;, simply reports the number of cases that fall into each category of the variable being analyzed.  E.g., exactly 100 of our genetic counselors live in the &quot;pacific&quot; region.  

The second column, &quot;Percent&quot;, provides a percentage of the total cases that fall into each region.  The percentage of genetic counselors of the total that we know work in the &quot;pacific&quot; region is 15.3%.  

The third column, labeled &quot;Valid Percent,&quot; is a percentage that does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; include missing cases. Without them, &quot;pacific&quot; region's share increases to 16.5%.

The fourth column, &quot;Cumulative Percent&quot;, adds the percentages of each region from the top of the table to the bottom, culminating in 100%.  This is more useful when the variable of analysis is ranked or ordinal, as it makes it easy to get a sense of what percentage of cases fall below each rank.

We hope this provides a sense of the utility of SPSS' Frequencies calculation.

This {{tlx|WPBannerMeta}} subtemplate decides whether the banner instance is on the main templatepage, that is, whether the banner should display in its 'demo' version with all options demonstrated. It performs two checks

{| class=wikitable style=&quot;float:right; width:0; text-align:center;&quot;
| colspan=2 rowspan=3 | 
! colspan=4 style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | Is the page the&lt;br /&gt;BANNER_NAME or subpage?
|-
! No
!style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| Yes !! No !! Yes
|-
! colspan=2 style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot; | and
! colspan=2 | and not
|-
! rowspan=2 | Is category=no set?
! No 
| 
|style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| yes
| yes
|
|-
! Yes
| 
|style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| 
| 
|
|}

#Is the pagename the {{para|BANNER_NAME}}, or is the page a subpage of that page?
#Is the {{para|category|no}} parameter set?

And then combines them together either with &quot;'''and'''&quot; (default) or another logical operator, eg &quot;'''or'''&quot;; this can be specified in the first unnamed parameter.

This template normalizes an input to be a yes/no output.

=== Usage ===

The template has five possible outputs depending on the default parameter (input if you will).

In its simplest usage these will all be either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;&quot; (blank - nothing no characters). 

# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;yes&quot;  (also applies to &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YeS&quot;, etc, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;1&quot;)   
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot; (also applies to &quot;No&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;nO&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;0&quot;) 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot; 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|¬}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot;
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;yes&quot; (also applies to any other value not given above).


Each of these can be over-ridden.

# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;bacon&quot;  (also applies to &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YeS&quot;, etc, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;1&quot;)   
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;ham&quot; (also applies to &quot;No&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;nO&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;0&quot;) 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|blank= eggs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;eggs&quot; 
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;ham&quot; 
## and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|blank= eggs|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;eggs&quot; 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|¬|¬=sausage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;sausage&quot;
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|def=cup-of-tea}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;cup-of-tea&quot; (also applies to any other value not given above).
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;bacon&quot; 
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|def=cup-of-tea|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;cup-of-tea&quot; 

This may be used (apparently perversely) thus:

* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes|yes=no|no=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;no&quot;
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no|yes=no|no=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;yes&quot;

This creates a logical inversion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[w:Z-test|single sample means test]] is a statistical test that can determine whether or not a population estimate (i.e., sample statistic) is significantly different from a known value.  

A hypothetical example may help illustrate this.  Let's say a national survey of the adult population asks how religious people are on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 being &quot;not at all religious&quot; and 10 being &quot;very religious.&quot;  And let's say that the mean on this scale in the U.S. is 6.01.  With our sample of genetic counselors, we can ask whether or not genetic counselors are similar to the general population in their religiosity.  To do this, we use a single sample means test, which takes into consideration sampling error.  Similar tests are possible for proportions (i.e., with nominal/ordinal variables), but SPSS cannot do those.  How to do a single sample means test in SPSS is illustrated below.

To begin with, go to &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Compare Means&quot; -&gt; &quot;One-Sample T Test&quot;:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The &quot;One-Sample T Test&quot; window will open:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the variable you want to compare to a target value, then move it into the &quot;Test Variable(s):&quot; box:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The next part is absolutely essential and easy to overlook the first time you run this.  In the &quot;Test Value&quot; box below the &quot;Test Variable(s):&quot; box you need to put the target value.  In our case, we'll put 6.01:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

(Note: It's not uncommon for beginners to leave the &quot;Test Value&quot; box blank.  And, for some reason, SPSS puts a default value in the box of zero, which means the test will run if you don't put your target value in the box as SPSS will assume your target value is zero.  Just make sure you put the correct target value in the &quot;Test Value&quot; box.)

The results will open in the Output Window:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

There are two tables.  The first simply describes the sample and variable included in the analysis.  The N, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean are all included.  Of particular interest for the example, the mean religiosity score of genetic counselors is 4.65, which is lower than our hypothetical religiosity of the U.S. population generally.  However, the question is whether or not this is due to random error or an actual affect of genetic counselors.  

The second table tells us whether or not the difference between the two is likely due to chance.  The first column is the t-statistic.  Using a t-table, one could use this value to determine whether or not the two means are significantly different.  SPSS does the calculations for you.  The next column, &quot;df,&quot; provides your degrees of freedom, which is n-1 for single sample means tests.  The third column, Sig. (2-tailed), provides the p-value for this particular test, which is the probability of finding the difference between the genetic counselors' mean and the general U.S. adult population mean we found (again, this is hypothetical) simply due to random error (assuming they are actually the same).  In our example, the p-value is .000, which is smaller than the standard p-value used in statistics of .05, indicating the odds of us finding this difference if the population means are the same simply due to chance is less than 1 in 1000.  In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference between genetic counselors and the general population in their average religiosity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[w:Student's_t-test#Dependent_t-test_for_paired_samples|paired samples t-test]] is a test that is useful when you have two interval/ratio variables from the same people in a sample that are measured exactly the same way.  You can use a paired samples t-test to compare the scores on the two variables.  The most common use of this test is for pre- and post-test scores for a sample when they are exposed to some intervention in between the pre- and post-tests.  The reason a paired samples t-test is used instead of an independent samples t-test is because the scores are for the same people, which suggests there is an underlying relationship between the scores.  

Another time paired samples t-tests are useful is when you have two variables with the same units of measure from the same subjects from the same time and you want to see if the subjects score differently on one test compared to the other.  This is the example we will use in this chapter to illustrate the test.  In the sample data set of genetic counselors, there are two interval variables that have the same unit of measure - a 10 point scale.  However, one variable asked genetic counselors how religious they were and the other asked them how spiritual they were.  Since it is the same subjects being asked different questions that use the same metric, we can compare their scores on these two variables using a paired samples t-test.

Here's how this is done in SPSS.  To begin with, select &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Compare Means&quot; -&gt; &quot;Paired-Samples T Test&quot;:
[[File:19pairedsamples01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The &quot;Paired-Samples T Test&quot; window will open:
[[File:19pairedsamples02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To select the variables to compare, you have to actually select two variables at the same time.  To do this, select the first variable, then hold down &quot;Control&quot; and select the second, then move them over to the &quot;Paired Variables&quot; box with the blue arrow:
[[File:19pairedsamples03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then hit &quot;OK.&quot;  You'll get the following tables in the Output Window:
[[File:19pairedsamples04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The first table provides basic sample and variable statistics for the two variables, including the Mean, the sample size, the Standard Deviation, and the Standard Error of the Mean.  Of interest in our comparison are the two means.  On the spirituality scale, genetic counselors report a mean of 6.17.  On the religiosity scale, genetic counselors report a mean of 4.64.  Those appear to be quite different scores, but the question of interest is whether those scores are different due to chance or due to an actual affect in the population.  The paired-samples t test allows us to determine that.

The second table, a correlation table, is discussed in the chapter on correlation, so it will not be discussed here.

The third table is the &quot;Paired Samples Test&quot; table.  The first column is labeled the &quot;Mean&quot; and it is the average difference between the two variable means.  The &quot;Std. Deviation&quot; and &quot;Std. Error of the Mean&quot; are calculated on the average mean in the first column.  Columns four and five are lower and upper confidence intervals for the difference.  For more information on confidence intervals, see the chapter on confidence intervals.  The sixth column, &quot;t&quot;, is the t-score.  The seventh is the degrees of freedom.  The eight column provides the p-value for the difference of means.  In our example, the p-value is .000, which is less than a standard alpha of .05, indicating that the odds of these two scores being different due to random chance assuming they are actually the same is less than 1 in 1000.  In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis that they are the same and accept the alternative.  There is a significant difference between the religiosity and spirituality of genetic counselors; genetic counselors are significantly more spiritual than they are religious.

&lt;!---PLEASE ADD METADATA TO THE &lt;includeonly&gt; SECTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE.---&gt;
This template is used to produce a link in a box to a [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]].

===Parameters===
: &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Subject box|&lt;var&gt;Name&lt;/var&gt;|image=&lt;var&gt;Image&lt;/var&gt;|size=&lt;var&gt;Size&lt;/var&gt;|left=yes|margin=&lt;var&gt;Margin&lt;/var&gt;}}'''&lt;/code&gt;

; &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;Name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; : The name of the subject. &lt;!-- This defaults to the current page's name - true but let's not encourage this.  If pages or sections are moved or copied stuff breaks. --&gt;

The following additional parameters are available. They are all optional; the default values are chosen to give a good look and feel across the project.

; {{Para|image|&lt;var&gt;Image&lt;/var&gt;}} : The image to use for the subject's icon. This defaults to an image that is specified in Template:Subject box/Images/SubjectName for the subject or a generic image. There is a [[Template:Subject box/Images|list of all such images]].

; {{Para|size|&lt;var&gt;Size&lt;/var&gt;}} : The width of the icon, as an integer. This is in units of pixels. The default is 32. The icon is also constrained to be at most 28 pixels high.

; {{Para|left|yes}} : Float the box to the left instead of to the right.

; {{Para|margin|&lt;var&gt;Margin&lt;/var&gt;}} : The margin around the box. By default, the box is surrounded by a margin of width 0.5em, but this can be customized using {{para|margin|&lt;var&gt;top right bottom left&lt;/var&gt;}} (''e.g.'', {{para|margin|0.25em 0 0.25em 0.25em}}) or removed using {{para|margin|0}} (zero).

      <comment>/* Numeric types */ nicer wording</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{clear}}
{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics|noexercises=1}}
So far, we have shrewdly avoided number types in our examples. In one exercise, we even went as far as asking you to &quot;pretend&quot; the arguments to &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; had to be of type &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;. So, from what are we hiding?

In this chapter, we will show how numerical types are handled in Haskell. While doing so, we will introduce some important features of the type system. Before diving into the text, though, pause for a moment and consider the following question: what should be the type of the function &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;ref&gt;If you followed our recommendations in &quot;Type basics&quot;, chances are you have already seen the rather exotic answer by testing with &lt;tt&gt;:t&lt;/tt&gt;... if that is the case, consider the following analysis as a path to understanding the meaning of that signature.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; class ==

As far as everyday mathematics is concerned, there are very few restrictions on which kind of numbers we can add together. &lt;math&gt;2 + 3&lt;/math&gt; (two natural numbers), &lt;math&gt;(-7) + 5.12&lt;/math&gt; (a negative integer and a rational number), &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} + \pi&lt;/math&gt; (a rational and an irrational)... all of these are valid – indeed, any two real numbers can be added together. In order to capture such generality in the simplest way possible we would like to have a very general &lt;tt&gt;Number&lt;/tt&gt; type in Haskell, so that the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; would be simply

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Number
&lt;/source&gt;

That design, however, does not fit well with the way computers perform arithmetic. While integer numbers in programs can be quite straightforwardly handled as sequences of binary digits in memory, that approach does not work for non-integer real numbers,&lt;ref&gt;One of the reasons being that between any two real numbers there are infinitely many real numbers – and that can't be directly mapped into a representation in memory no matter what we do.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it necessary for a more involved encoding to support them: [[w:Floating point|floating point numbers]]. While floating point provides a reasonable way to deal with real numbers in general, it has some inconveniences (most notably, loss of precision) which make using the simpler encoding worthwhile for integer values. We are thus left with at least two different ways of storing numbers, one for integers and another one for general real numbers, which should correspond to different Haskell types. Furthermore, computers are only able to perform operations like &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; on a pair of numbers if they are in the same format. That should put an end to our hopes of using a universal &lt;tt&gt;Number&lt;/tt&gt; type – or even having &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; working with both integers and floating-point numbers...

It is easy, however, to see reality is not that bad. We ''can'' use &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; with both integers and floating point numbers:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt;3 + 4
7
Prelude&gt;4.34 + 3.12
7.46
}}

When discussing lists and tuples, we saw that functions can accept arguments of different types if they are made ''polymorphic''. In that spirit, one possible type signature for &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; that would account for the facts above would be:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; would then take two arguments of the same type &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; (which could be integers or floating-point numbers) and evaluate to a result of type &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;. There is a problem with that solution, however. As we saw before, the type variable &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; can stand for ''any'' type at all. If &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; had that type signature we would be able to &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; two &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, or two &lt;tt&gt;Char&lt;/tt&gt;, which would make very little sense. Rather, the actual type signature of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; takes advantage of a language feature that allows us to express the semantic restriction that &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; can be any type ''as long as it is a number type'':

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; is a '''typeclass''' - a group of types which includes all types which are regarded as numbers&lt;ref&gt;That is a very loose definition, but will suffice until we are ready to discuss typeclasses in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;(Num a) =&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; part of the signature restricts &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; to number types – or, more accurately, ''instances'' of &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Numeric types ==

But what are the ''actual'' number types – the instances of &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; that &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; stands for in the signature? The most important numeric types are
&lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;:

* &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; corresponds to the vanilla integer type found in most languages. It has fixed maximum and minimum values that depend on a computer's processor. (In 32-bit machines the range goes from -2147483648 to 2147483647).

* &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; also is used for integer numbers, but unlike &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; it supports arbitrarily large values – at the cost of some efficiency.

* &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; is the double-precision floating point type, a good choice for real numbers in the vast majority of cases. (There is also &lt;tt&gt;Float&lt;/tt&gt;, the single-precision counterpart of &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;, which is usually less attractive due to further loss of precision.)

These types are available by default in Haskell and are the ones you will generally deal with in everyday tasks.

=== Polymorphic guesswork ===

There is one thing we haven't explained yet. If you tried the examples of addition we mentioned at the beginning you know that something like this is perfectly valid:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (-7) + 5.12
-1.88
}}

Here, it seems we are adding two numbers of different types – an integer and a non-integer. Shouldn't the type of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; make that impossible?

To answer that question we have to see what the types of the numbers we entered actually are:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :t (-7)
(-7) :: (Num a) =&gt; a
}}

And, lo and behold, &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; is neither &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;! Rather, it is a ''polymorphic constant'', which can &quot;morph&quot; into any number type if need be. The reason for that becomes clearer when we look at the other number...

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :t 5.12
5.12 :: (Fractional t) =&gt; t
}}

&lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt; is also a polymorphic constant, but one of the &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; class, which is more restrictive than &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; – every &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;, but not every &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; (for instance, &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;s and &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;s are not &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt;).

When a Haskell program evaluates &lt;tt&gt;(-7) + 5.12&lt;/tt&gt;, it must settle for an actual type for the numbers. It does so by performing type inference while accounting for the class specifications. &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; can be any &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;, but there are extra restrictions for &lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt;, so its type will define what &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; will become. Since there is no other clues to what the types should be, &lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt; will assume the default &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; type, which is &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;; and, consequently, &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; will become a &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; as well, allowing the addition to proceed normally and return a &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''For seasoned programmers:'' This appears to have the same effect that programs in C (and many other languages) manage with an ''implicit cast'' – by which an integer literal is silently converted to a double. The difference is that in C, the conversion is done behind your back, while in Haskell it only occurs if the variable/literal is a polymorphic constant. The difference will become clearer shortly, when we show a counter-example.&lt;/ref&gt;.

There is a nice quick test you can do to get a better feel of that process. In a source file, define

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
&lt;/source&gt;

then load the file in GHCi and check the type of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;. Then, change the file to add a &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; variable,

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
y = x + 3
&lt;/source&gt;

reload it and check the types of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;. Finally, modify &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; to

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
y = x + 3.1
&lt;/source&gt;

and see what happens with the types of both variables.

=== Monomorphic trouble ===

The sophistication of the numerical types and classes occasionally leads to some complications. Consider, for instance, the common division operator &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;. It has the following type signature:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(/) :: (Fractional a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

Restricting &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; to fractional types is a must because the division of two integer numbers will often not result in an integer. Nevertheless, we can still write something like

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / 3
1.3333333333333333
}}

because the literals &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; are polymorphic constants and therefore assume the type &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; at the behest of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;. Suppose, however, we want to divide a number by the length of a list&lt;ref&gt;A reasonable scenario – think of computing an average of the values in a list.&lt;/ref&gt;. The obvious thing to do would be using the &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; function:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / length [1,2,3]
}}

Unfortunately, that blows up:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Fractional Int)
      arising from a use of `/' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-17
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Fractional Int)
    In the expression: 4 / length [1, 2, 3]
    In the definition of `it': it = 4 / length [1, 2, 3]
}}

As usual, the problem can be understood by looking at the type signature of &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
length :: [a] -&gt; Int
&lt;/source&gt;

The result of &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; is not a polymorphic constant, but an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;; and since an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; is not a &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; it can't fit the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;.

There is a handy function which provides a way of escaping from this problem. Before following on with the text, try to guess what it does only from the name and signature:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) =&gt; a -&gt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;fromIntegral&lt;/tt&gt; takes an argument of some &lt;tt&gt;Integral&lt;/tt&gt; type (like &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;) and makes it a polymorphic constant. By combining it with &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; we can make the length of the list fit into the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / fromIntegral (length [1,2,3])
1.3333333333333333
}}

While this expression may look overly complex at first, this approach makes it easier to be rigorous when manipulating numbers. If you define a function with an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; argument, it will never be converted to an &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;, unless you explicitly tell the program to do so by using a function like &lt;tt&gt;fromIntegral&lt;/tt&gt;. As a direct consequence of its refined type system, there is a surprising diversity of classes and functions dealing with numbers in Haskell&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;A more descriptive overview of the main ones will be made in a module which is currently under development.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;.

== Classes beyond numbers ==

There are many other use cases for typeclasses beyond arithmetic. For example, the type signature of &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/source&gt;

Like &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is a polymorphic function. It compares two values of the same type, which must belong to the class &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; and returns a &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; is simply the class of types of values which can be compared for equality, and includes all of the basic non-functional types.&lt;ref&gt;Comparing two functions for equality is considered to be intractable&lt;/ref&gt;

Typeclasses are a very general language feature which adds a lot to the power of the type system. Later in the book we will return to this topic to see how to use them in custom ways.

In this form, this page could well be called &quot;Numerical types&quot;. But at least for now it seems a good idea to have a generic name, so that we are free to add other non-numerical things and keep the focus on the type system features illustrated by numbers. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 05:12, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

== Type error on &quot;x + 3.1&quot; example ==

Actually, writing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

let x = 3&lt;br /&gt;

let y = x + 3.1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

produces type error (&quot;no instance for Fractional... arising from 3.1&quot;)

:That is why that test must be loaded from a source file. I changed the passage to make that a little more obvious. Roughly, it doesn't work the same in the way you tried because GHC(i) will &quot;de-generalize&quot; the types of values defined in a let. You can override that by adding the type signature in the let, as in
: &lt;code&gt;let x :: (Num a) =&gt; a; x = 3&lt;/code&gt;

== Why wasn't / defined with type (Num a, Fractional b) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; b ? ==

Is it merely the taste of the language designers or is there a deeper reason?  For example, is there perhaps some other natural-looking expression that would become illegal?

I would appreciate a brief note (here or in the text.)

:I suppose it has to do with simplicity and a dislike of implicit casts. Also, note that your proposed signature is a little too general, as there are no guarantees that a &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; can be converted into a &lt;code&gt;Fractional&lt;/code&gt;. The closest thing in Prelude is &lt;code&gt;[http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/4.6.0.1/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:realToFrac realToFrac]&lt;/code&gt;, which converts values of the &lt;code&gt;Real&lt;/code&gt; class. Thus your version of &lt;code&gt;(/)&lt;/code&gt; might be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(/!) :: (Real a, Fractional b) -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; b
x /! y = realToFrac x / realToFrac y
&lt;/source&gt;

:But if the actual &lt;code&gt;(/)&lt;/code&gt; operator was like that you'd have to remember the implied &lt;code&gt;realToFrac&lt;/code&gt; usage and account for what it would do with your values every time you divide something. Under the ''status quo'' at least it is obvious that something else other than mere division is going on, as there are either explicit conversion functions calls or custom operators being used.

:There is interesting commentary on this issue at the Haskell Wiki in the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generic_number_type Generic number type] page. For an example of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; with no obvious conversion to &lt;code&gt;Fractional&lt;/code&gt;, consider matrix types like [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cairo/0.12.4/doc/html/Graphics-Rendering-Cairo.html#t:Matrix this] or [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hmatrix/0.15.0.1/doc/html/Data-Packed-Matrix.html#t:Matrix this].

== (+) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a is technically possible ==

&quot;''If (+) really had that type signature we would be able to add up two Bool, or two Char, which would make no sense – and is indeed impossible.''&quot;

it ''is'' technically possible to &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt; two chars, etc., since one can simply redefine (+). i know it's nit-picky, but i'm mildly averse to small incorrect details like these in computer language tutorials. they may give false insights or assurances, and therefore breed assumptions later. (for instance, someone might bang their head against the wall for hours while debugging a program because they didn't realize someone could redefine &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;.) however, i doubt that this chapter is the place to fully address the issue. i was hoping to think of a natural expression that that wasn't awkward. however i couldn't think of anything that sounded as nice as what's currently there.

CMD_HIDDINIT private function from keyboard.device and gameport.device has been removed and now these devices use a new keyboard and mouse HIDDs as an underlying level. Actual driver HIDDs may be plugged in or removed at any time using AddHardwareDriver() and RemHardwareDriver(). 

The API can be further expanded if one day we want to implement OS4 amigainput.library or something like that. 

There can be multiple input drivers (feeders) and now there can also be multiple input listeners. 

So, lowlevel.library can also work on top of the new API and receive events on its own, independently of keyboard.device and gameport.device. 



==Reference==

To debug: dump mouse events when they are fed to supplied handler. You may also write hidd.mouse client which reads and prints mouse events. This way you'll be able to monitor how events are passed through top-level mouse.hidd.
Also introduced top-level &quot;hubs&quot; for mouse and keyboard events. 
* May be ps2mouse.hidd sends malformed events.</text>

=== Items ===

A three-item, seven-point scale was used to measure purchase intention:

*how positive or negative is your judgment of the product?
*how interesting do you find the product?
*how likely is it that you will buy the product within half a year from now?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Exclusive correlation spectroscopy (ECOSY) is an NMR correlation experiment introduced by O. W. Sørensen, Christian Griesinger, Richard R. Ernst and coworkers for the accurate measurement of small J-couplings.

The idea behind the experiment is to measure an unresolved coupling with the help of a larger coupling which is resolved in a dimension orthogonal to the small coupling. Three active nuclei are needed (SXI spin system) and the pulse sequence must be able to transfer magnetization from I to S without changing the spin state of X, otherwise the ECOSY pattern will vanish.

A '''Faraday cup''' is a [[metal]] (conductive) cup designed to catch [[charged particle]]s in [[vacuum]]. The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of [[ion]]s or [[electron]]s hitting the cup.&lt;ref name='1.1715674'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Faraday-Cup Monitors for High-Energy Electron Beams |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |date=September 1956 |first=K. L. |last=Brown |coauthors=G. W. Tautfest |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=696–702 |doi=10.1063/1.1715674 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=RSINAK000027000009000696000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faraday cup is named after [[Michael Faraday]] who first theorized ions around 1830.

==How it works==

When a beam or packet of [[Ion]]s hits the metal it gains a small net charge while the ions are neutralized. The metal can then be discharged to measure a small current equivalent to the number of impinging ions. Essentially the faraday cup is part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] where ions are the charge carriers in vacuum and the faraday cup is the interface to the solid metal where electrons act as the [[charge carrier]]s (as in most circuits). By measuring the [[current (electricity)|electrical current]] (the number of electrons flowing through the circuit per second) in the metal part of the circuit the number of charges being carried by the ions in the vacuum part of the circuit can be determined. For a continuous ion beam of ions (each with a single charge)

[[Image:faraday cup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Faraday cup with an electron-suppressor plate in front]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {N}{t} = \frac {I}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of ions observed in a time t (in seconds), I is the measured current (in [[amperes]]) and e is the [[elementary charge]] (about 1.60 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; [[coulomb|C]]). Thus, a measured current of one nanoamp (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; A) corresponds to about 6 billion ions striking the faraday cup each second.

Similarly, a Faraday cup can act as a collector for electrons in a vacuum (for instance from an [[electron beam]]). In this case electrons simply hit the metal plate/cup and a current is produced. Faraday cups are not as sensitive as [[electron multiplier]] detectors, but are highly regarded for accuracy because of the direct relation between the measured current and number of ions.

==Error sources==
The counting of charges collected per unit time is impacted by two error sources: 1) the emission of low-energy [[secondary electrons]] from the surface struck by the incident charge and 2) [[backscattering]] (~180 degree scattering) of the incident particle, which causes it to leave the collecting surface, at least temporarily. Especially with electrons, it is fundamentally impossible to distinguish between a fresh new incident electron and one that has been backscattered or even a fast secondary electron.

A Fermi resonance is the shifting of the energies and intensities of absorption bands in an infrared or Raman spectrum.  It is a consequence of quantum mechanical mixing.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Nakamoto “Infrared and Raman Spectra of Inorganic and Coordination Compounds: Theory and Applications in Inorganic Chemistry (Volume A)” John Wiley, 1997. ISBN 0-471-16394-5&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was explained by the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi.

==Selection rules and occurrence==
Two conditions must be satisfied for the occurrence of Fermi Resonance:
*the two vibrational states of a molecule transform according to the same irreducible representation of the molecular point group.
*The energies of the transitions (accidentally) have almost the same energy.

Since the normal modes of a molecule are generally of disparate energies, they do not mix. Thus, Fermi resonance most often occurs between normal and overtone modes, which are often nearly coincidental in energy.

Fermi resonance leads to two effects. First, the high energy mode shifts to higher energy and the low energy mode shifts to still lower energy.  Second, the weaker mode gains intensity (becomes more allowed) and the more intense band decreases in intensity.  The two transitions are describable as a linear combination of the parent modes.  Fermi resonance does not really lead to additional bands in the spectrum.
[[Image:FermiResScheme.png|thumb|360px|right|Ideallized appearance of a normal mode and an overtone before and after Fermi resonance. Beneath the idealized spectra are idealized energy level schemes.]]

==Examples==
===Ketones===
High resolution IR spectra of most [[ketone]]s reveal that the &quot;carbonyl band&quot; is split into a doublet.  The peak separation is usually only a few wavenumbers.  This splitting arises from the mixing of ν&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; and the overtone of HCH bending modes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Silverstein, Francis X. Webster, David Kiemle “Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds”Edition: 7th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. ISBN 0471393622.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the bending vibration ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (667&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) has symmetry Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;. The first excited state of ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is denoted 01&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;0 (no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, one quantum of excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with angular momentum about the molecular axis equal to ±1, no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and clearly transforms according to the irreducible representation Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;. Putting two quanta into ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a state with components of symmetry (Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; × Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ &lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. These are called 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 02&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;0, respectively. 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 has the same symmetry (Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) as, and a very similar energy to, state 100 (a single excitation in the ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric stretch (calculated unperturbed frequency 1337&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The similarity in energy may be thought of as an accidental near-degeneracy. The states 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 100 can therefore mix together, producing a splitting and also a significant increase in the intensity of the 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 transition, so that both the 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 100 transitions have similar intensities.

'''Ferromagnetic resonance''', or FMR, is a [[spectroscopic]] technique to probe the [[magnetization]] of [[ferromagnetic]] materials.  It is a standard tool for probing [[spin wave]]s and spin dynamics.  It was unknowingly discovered by V. K. Arkad'yev when he observed the [[Absorption (optics)|absorption]] of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radiation by ferromagnetic materials in 1911.  A qualitative explanation of FMR along with an explanation of the results from Arkad'yev was offered up by Ya. G. Dorfman in 1923 when he suggested that the [[optical]] transitions due to [[Zeeman]] splitting could provide a way to study ferromagnetic structure.
FMR is very broadly similar to EPR, and also somewhat similar to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] except that FMR probes the sample magnetization resulting from the [[magnetic moment]]s of dipolar-coupled but unpaired [[electron]]s whereas NMR probes the magnetic moment of [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|atomic nuclei]] screened by the atomic or molecular orbitals surrounding such nuclei of non-zero nuclear spin.

FMR arises from the precessional motion of the (usually quite large) magnetization &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; of a ferromagnetic material in an external magnetic field H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The magnetic field exerts a [[torque]] on the sample magnetization which causes the magnetic moments in the sample to [[precess]].  The precession frequency of the magnetization depends on the orientation of the material, the strength of the magnetic field, as well as the macroscopic magnetization of the sample; the effective precession frequency of the ferromagnet is much lower in value from the precession frequency observed for free electrons in ESR or EPR. Moreover, linewidths of absorption peaks can be greatly affected both by dipolar-narrowing and exchange-broadening (quantum) effects. Furthermore, not all absorption peaks observed in FMR are caused by the precession of the magnetic moments of electrons in the ferromagnet. Thus, the theoretical analysis of FMR spectra is far more complex than that of ESR or NMR spectra.

The basic setup for an FMR experiment is a microwave [[resonant cavity]] with an [[electromagnet]].  The resonant cavity is fixed at a frequency in the [[super high frequency]] band.  A detector is placed at the end of the cavity to detect the microwaves. The magnetic sample is placed between the poles of the electromagnet and the [[magnetic field]] is swept while the resonant absorption intensity of the microwaves is detected.  When the magnetization precession frequency and the resonant cavity frequency are the same, absorption increases sharply which is indicated by a decrease in the intensity at the detector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''GF method''', sometimes referred to as '''FG method''', is a classical mechanical method introduced by E. Bright Wilson to obtain certain ''internal coordinates'' for
a vibrating semi-rigid molecule, the so-called ''normal coordinates'' ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. Normal coordinates decouple the classical vibrational motions of the molecule and thus give an easy route to obtaining vibrational amplitudes of the atoms as a function of time. In Wilson's GF method it is assumed that the molecular kinetic energy consists only of harmonic vibrations of the atoms, ''i.e.,''  overall rotational and translational energy is ignored. Normal coordinates appear also in a quantum mechanical description of the  vibrational motions of the molecule and the Coriolis coupling between rotations and vibrations.

It follows from application of the Eckart conditions that the matrix '''G'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; gives the kinetic energy in terms of arbitrary linear internal coordinates, while '''F''' represents the (harmonic) potential energy in terms of these coordinates. The GF method gives the linear transformation from general internal coordinates to the special set of normal coordinates.

== The GF method ==
A non-linear molecule consisting of ''N'' atoms has 3''N''-6  internal degrees of freedom, because 
positioning a molecule in three-dimensional space requires three degrees of freedom  and the description of its orientation in space requires another three degree of freedom. These degrees of freedom must be subtracted from the 3''N'' degrees of freedom of a system of ''N'' particles. 

The atoms in a molecule are bound by a potential energy surface (PES) (or a force field (chemistry)|force field) which is a function of 3''N''-6 coordinates.
The internal degrees of freedom ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3''N''-6&lt;/sub&gt; describing the PES in an optimum way are often non-linear; they are for instance ''valence coordinates'', such as bending and  torsion angles and bond stretches. It is possible to write the quantum mechanical kinetic energy operator for such curvilinear coordinates, but it is hard to formulate a general theory applicable to any molecule. This is why Wilson&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Wilson, Jr.
''Some Mathematical Methods for the Study of Molecular Vibrations'', J. Chem. Phys. vol. '''9''', pp. 76-84 (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; linearized the internal coordinates by assuming small displacements. The linearized version of  the internal coordinate ''q''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is denoted by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The PES ''V'' can be Taylor expanded around its minimum in terms of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.  The third term (the Hessian matrix|Hessian of ''V'') evaluated in the minimum is a force derivative matrix '''F'''. In the harmonic approximation the Taylor series is ended after this term. The second term, containing first derivatives, is zero because it is evaluated in the miminum of ''V''. The first term can be included in the zero of energy.
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; 2V \approx \sum_{s,t=1}^{3N-6} F_{st} S_s\, S_t &lt;/math&gt;.

The classical vibrational kinetic energy has the form:
:&lt;math&gt; 2T = \sum_{s,t=1}^{3N-6} g_{st}(\mathbf{q})  \dot{S}_s\dot{S}_t ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''st''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of the metric tensor of the internal (curvilinear) coordinates. The dots indicate time derivatives. Mixed terms &lt;math&gt;S_s\, \dot{S}_t&lt;/math&gt; generally present in curvilinear coordinates are not present here, because only linear coordinate transformations are used. Evaluation of the metric tensor '''g''' in the minimum '''q'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of ''V'' gives 
the positive definite and symmetric matrix '''G''' = '''g'''('''q'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. 
One can solve the following two matrix problems simultaneously
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{L} =\boldsymbol{\Phi}
\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{E},
&lt;/math&gt;
since they are equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{G} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{L} \boldsymbol{\Phi},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}=\operatorname{diag}(f_1,\ldots, f_{3N-6}) &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit matrix. The matrix '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;  contains the ''normal coordinates''  ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; in its rows:
:&lt;math&gt; Q_k = \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} (\mathbf{L}^{-1})_{kt} S_t , \quad k=1,\ldots, 3N-6. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the form of the generalized eigenvalue problem, the method is called the GF method,
often with the name of its originator attached to it: '''Wilson's GF method'''. By matrix transposition in both sides of the equation and using the fact
that both '''G''' and '''F''' are symmetric matrices, as are diagonal matrices, one can recast this equation into a very similar one  for '''FG''' . This is why the method
is also referred to as '''Wilson's FG method'''.

We  introduce  the vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \operatorname{col}(S_1,\ldots, S_{3N-6})
\quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{Q} = \operatorname{col}(Q_1,\ldots, Q_{3N-6}),
&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfy the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{Q}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Upon  use of the results of the generalized eigenvalue equation
the  energy ''E'' = ''T '' + ''V'' (in the harmonic approximation) of the molecule becomes, 
:&lt;math&gt;  
2E = \dot{\mathbf{s}}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1}\dot{\mathbf{s}}+
\mathbf{s}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
= \dot{\mathbf{Q}}^\mathrm{T}  \; \left( \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{L}\right) \;  \dot{\mathbf{Q}}+
\mathbf{Q}^\mathrm{T} \left(  \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{L}\right)\;  \mathbf{Q} 
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
= \dot{\mathbf{Q}}^\mathrm{T}\dot{\mathbf{Q}} + \mathbf{Q}^\mathrm{T}\boldsymbol{\Phi}\mathbf{Q}
 = \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} \big( \dot{Q}_t^2 +  f_t Q_t^2 \big).
&lt;/math&gt;
The Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' - ''V'' is
:&lt;math&gt; 
L = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} \big( \dot{Q}_t^2 - f_t Q_t^2 \big).
&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding Lagrange equations are identical to the Newton equations 
:&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{Q}_t + f_t \,Q_t = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
for a set of uncoupled
harmonic oscillators. These ordinary  second-order differential equations are easily solved yielding ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; as function of time, see the article on  harmonic oscillators.

==Normal coordinates in terms of Cartesian displacement coordinates ==
Often the normal coordinates are expressed as linear combinations of Cartesian displacement coordinates.
Let '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; be the position vector of nucleus A and '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
the corresponding equilibrium position. Then
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}_A \equiv \mathbf{R}_A -\mathbf{R}_A^0 &lt;/math&gt; is by definition the ''Cartesian displacement coordinate'' of nucleus A.
Wilson's  linearizing of the internal curvilinear coordinates ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the coordinate ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms  of the displacement coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;
S_t =\sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{i=1}^3 s^t_{Ai} \, d_{Ai}= \sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{s}^t_{A} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{A}, \quad \mathrm{for}\quad t = 1,\ldots,3N-6, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''s'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is known as a ''Wilson s-vector''.
If we put the &lt;math&gt;s^t_{Ai}&lt;/math&gt; into a  3''N''-6 x 3''N'' matrix '''B''', this equation becomes in matrix language
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{d}. &lt;/math&gt;
The actual form of the matrix elements  of '''B''' can be fairly complicated.
Especially for a torsion angle, which involves 4 atoms,  it requires tedious vector algebra to derive the corresponding values of the &lt;math&gt;s^t_{Ai}&lt;/math&gt;. See for  more details on this method, known as
the ''Wilson s-vector method'', the book by Wilson ''et al.'', or molecular vibration.  Now, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{L}^{-1} \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{L}^{-1} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{d} \equiv
\mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
In summation language:
:&lt;math&gt;
Q_k = \sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{i=1}^3 D^k_{Ai}\, d_{Ai} \quad \mathrm{for}\quad k=1,\ldots, 3N-6.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here '''D''' is a  3''N''-6 x 3''N'' matrix which is given by (i) the linearization of the internal coordinates '''q''' (an algebraic process)  and (ii) solution of  Wilson's GF equations (a numeric process).

==Relation with Eckart conditions ==
From the invariance of the internal coordinates ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; under overall rotation and translation
of the molecule, follows the same for the linearized coordinates '''s'''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.
It can be shown that this implies that the following 6 conditions are satisfied by the internal
coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{s}^t_{A}  = 0\quad\mathrm{and}\quad 
\sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{R}^0_A\times \mathbf{s}^t_A= 0,  \quad t=1,\ldots,3N-6.
&lt;/math&gt;
These conditions follow from the  Eckart conditions that hold for the displacement vectors, 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{A=1}^N M_A\; \mathbf{d}_{A} = 0 \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A\;  \mathbf{R}^0_{A} \times \mathbf{d}_{A} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
See Eckart conditions|this article for more details.

The '''FLuorescence EXplorer''' (FLEX) is a mission submitted to the European Space Agency in response to the ''Call for Ideas for Earth Explorer Core Missions''. Recently it has been chosen to pass to pre-phase A.

==Summary==
The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission proposes to launch a satellite for the global monitoring of steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence in terrestrial vegetation.  After more than 70 years of basic and applied research in chlorophyll fluorescence, it is now clear that fluorescence is a sensitive probe of photosynthetic function in both healthy and physiologically perturbed vegetation.  Fluorescence is a powerful non-invasive tool to track the status, resilience, and recovery of photochemical processes and moreover provides important information on overall photosynthetic performance with implications for related carbon sequestration.  The early responsiveness of fluorescence to atmospheric, soil and plant water balance, as well as to atmospheric chemistry and human intervention in land usage makes it an obvious biological indicator in improving our understanding of Earth system dynamics.  The amenability of fluorescence to remote, even space-based observation qualifies it to join the emerging suite of space-based technologies for Earth observation.  FLEX would encompass a three-instrument array for measurement of the interrelated features of fluorescence, hyperspectral reflectance, and canopy temperature. The program would involve a space and ground-truthing program of 3-years duration and would provide data formats for research and applied science.

'''Flowing afterglow mass spectrometry''', FA-MS, is a sensitive and quantitative [[mass spectrometry]] analytical approach that offers a route to on-line, real-time [[deuterium]] abundance measurements in water vapour in breath and above aqueous liquids, including urine and serum.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method involves the production and flow of thermalised hydrated hydronium cluster [[ions]] in inert helium or argon carrier gas along a flow tube following the introduction of a humid air sample. These ions react in multiple collisions with water molecules, their isotopic compositions reach equilibrium and the relative magnitudes of their isotopomers are measured by a [[quadrupole]] mass spectrometer located downstream. 

==Trace gas analysis==

One of the first papers reporting the use of the flowing afterglow was reported in Planet Space Sci in 1966 by Norton, Ferguson, Fehsenfeld, and Schmeltekopf.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They studied ion-molecule reactions pertinent to the Martian atmosphere.  This flowing afterglow technique replaced the then standard stationary afterglow.  Flowing afterglow has many attractive aspects: well-understood laminar behavior, viscous gas flow,  a large density of carrier gas which allows the study of thermalized reactions, and the capability to make new reactant ions in situ.  The ambipolar plasma is sampled using a nosecone and detected using conventional quadrupole or tandem mass spectrometry, depending on the application.  One of the drawbacks of the flowing afterglow technique is the possibility of generating multiple reactant ions.  This problem is circumvented by implementing the [[Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry|selected ion flow tube]] (SIFT).&lt;ref&gt;

Strategies that have been employed to unequivacally identify the VOCs include using [[gas chromatography]] coupled with flowing afterglow and   using a complement of reagent ions.

'''Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy''' ('''FCS''') is a common technique used by physicists, chemists, and biologists to experimentally characterize the dynamics of fluorescent species (e.g. single fluorescent dye molecules in nanostructured materials, autofluorescent proteins in living cells, etc.). Although the name indicates a specific link to fluorescence, the method is used today also for exploring other forms of luminescence (like reflections, luminescence from gold-beads or [[Quantum_dot|quantum dots]] or phosphorescent species). The word &quot;spectroscopy&quot; in the name differs from common usage, in which  a spectrum is generally understood to be a frequency spectrum. The autocorrelation is a genuine form of spectrum, however: It is the time-spectrum generated from the power spectrum (via inverse Fourier transform).

Commonly, FCS is employed in the context of optical microscopy, in particular confocal or two-photon microscopy. In these techniques light is focused on a sample and the measured  [[fluorescence]] intensity fluctuations (due to [[diffusion]], physical or chemical reactions, aggregation, etc.) are analyzed using the temporal autocorrelation. Because the measured property is essentially related to the magnitude and/or the amount of fluctuations, there is an optimum measurement regime at the level when individual species enter or exit the observation volume (or turn on and off in the volume). When too many entities are measured at the same time the overall fluctuations are small in comparison to the total signal and may not be resolvable – in the other direction, if the individual fluctuation-events are too sparse in time, one measurement may take prohibitively too long. FCS is in a way the fluorescent counterpart to [[dynamic light scattering]], which uses coherent light scattering, instead of (incoherent) fluorescence.

When an appropriate model is known, FCS can be used to obtain quantitative information such as 
* diffusion coefficients
* hydrodynamic radii
* average concentrations
* kinetic chemical reaction rates
* singlet-triplet dynamics

Because fluorescent markers come in a variety of colors and can be specifically bound to a particular molecule (e.g. proteins, polymers, metal-complexes, etc.), it is possible to study the behavior of individual molecules (in rapid succession in composite solutions). With the development of sensitive detectors such as [[avalanche photodiode]]s the detection of the fluorescence signal coming from individual molecules in highly dilute samples has become practical. With this emerged the possibility to conduct FCS experiments in a wide variety of specimens, ranging from materials science to biology. The advent of engineered cells with genetically tagged proteins (like [[green fluorescent protein]]) has made FCS a common tool for studying molecular dynamics in living cells. 

==History==
Signal-correlation techniques were first experimentally applied to fluorescence in 1972 by Magde, Elson, and Webb&lt;ref&gt;Magde, D., Elson, E. L., Webb, W. W. Thermodynamic fluctuations in a reacting system: Measurement by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,(1972) ''Phys Rev Lett'', '''29''', 705–708.&lt;/ref&gt;, who are therefore commonly credited as the &quot;inventors&quot; of FCS. The technique was further developed in a group of papers by these and other authors soon after, establishing the theoretical foundations and types of applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, M., Rigler, R. Rotational brownian motion and fluorescence intensity fluctuations,(1974) ''Chem Phys'', '''4''', 390–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elson, E. L., Magde, D. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy I. Conceptual basis and theory,(1974) ''Biopolymers'', '''13''', 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magde, D., Elson, E. L., Webb, W. W. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy II. An experimental realization,(1974) ''Biopolymers'', '''13''', 29–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  See Thompson (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson N L 1991 Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy Techniques vol 1, ed J R Lakowicz (New York: Plenum) pp 337–78&lt;/ref&gt; for a review of that period.

Beginning in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Rigler, R, Ü. Mets1, J. Widengren and P. Kask. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with high count rate and low background: analysis of translational diffusion.

Fluorescence correlations, single molecule detection and large number screening. Applications in biotechnology,(1995) ''J. Biotechnol.'', '''41''',177–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a renewed interest in FCS, and as of August 2007 there have been over 3,000 papers using FCS found in Web of Science.  See Krichevsky and Bonnet&lt;ref&gt;O. Krichevsky, G. Bonnet, &quot;Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy: the technique and its applications,&quot; Rep. Prog. Phys. 65, 251–297 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; for a recent review.  In addition, there has been a flurry of activity extending FCS in various ways, for instance to laser scanning and spinning-disk confocal microscopy (from a stationary, single point measurement), in using cross-correlation (FCCS) between two fluorescent channels instead of autocorrelation, and in using [[Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer | Förster Resonance Energy Transfer]] (FRET) instead of fluorescence.

==Typical FCS setup==

The typical FCS setup consists of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633 nm (cw), and from 690–1100 nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a microscope objective by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, that only a few are within the focal spot (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a [[photomultiplier]] tube or [[avalanche photodiode]] detector.  The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms. &lt;ref&gt;Medina, M. A., Schwille, P. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for the detection and study of single molecules in biology, (2002)''BioEssays'', '''24''', 758–764.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The measurement volume==
The measurement volume is a convolution of illumination (excitation) and detection geometries, which result from the optical elements involved. The resulting volume is described mathematically by the [[point spread function]] (or PSF), it is essentially the image of a point source. The PSF is often described as an ellipsoid (with unsharp boundaries) of few hundred nanometers in focus diameter, and almost one micrometre along the optical axis. The shape varies significantly (and has a large impact on the resulting FCS curves) depending on the quality of the optical elements (it is crucial to avoid astigmatism and to check the real shape of the PSF on the instrument). In the case of confocal microscopy, and for small pinholes (around one Airy unit), the PSF is well approximated by Gaussians:  

:&lt;math&gt; PSF(r,z)= I_0 e^{- 2 r^2/\omega_{xy}^2} e^{-2 z^2/\omega_{z}^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the peak intensity, r and z are radial and axial position, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{z}&lt;/math&gt; are the radial and axial radii, and &lt;math&gt; \omega_{z} &gt; \omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;.  This Gaussian form is assumed in deriving the functional form of the autocorrelation. 

Typically &lt;math&gt;\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; is 200–300 nm, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{z}&lt;/math&gt; is '''2–6''' times larger.&lt;ref&gt;Mayboroda, O. A., van Remoortere, A., Tanke H. J., Hokke, C. H., Deelder, A. M.,  A new approach for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) based immunoassays, (2003), ''J. Biotechnol.'', '''107''', 185–192.&lt;/ref&gt;   One common way of calibrating the measurement volume parameters is to perform FCS on a species with known diffusion coefficient and concentration (see below).  Diffusion coefficients for common fluorophores in water are given in a later section. 

The Gaussian approximation works to varying degrees depending on the optical details, and corrections can sometimes be applied to offset the errors in approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, S.T., and W.W. Webb. 2002. Focal volume optics and experimental artifacts in confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Biophys. J. 83:2300–2317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autocorrelation function==
The (temporal) autocorrelation function is the correlation of a time series with itself shifted by time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;G(\tau)=\frac{\langle\delta I(t)\delta I(t+\tau)\rangle}{\langle I(t) \rangle^2}=\frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau) \rangle}{\langle I(t)\rangle^2}-1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta I(t)=I(t)-\langle I(t)\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the deviation from the mean intensity.  The normalization (denominator) here is the most commonly used for FCS, because then the correlation at &lt;math&gt;\tau=0&lt;/math&gt;, ''G''(0), is related to the average number of particles in the measurement volume.

==Interpreting the autocorrelation function==
To extract quantities of interest, the autocorrelation data can be fitted, typically using a [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm | nonlinear least squares algorithm]].  The fit's functional form depends on the type of dynamics (and the optical geometry in question).  

===Normal diffusion===
The fluorescent particles used in FCS are small and thus experience thermal motions in solution.  The simplest FCS experiment is thus normal 3D diffusion, for which the autocorrelation is:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_D ))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_D ))^{1/2}} +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a=\omega_z/\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of axial to radial &lt;math&gt;e^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; radii of the measurement volume, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic residence time.  This form was derived assuming a Gaussian measurement volume.  Typically, the fit would have three free parameters--G(0), &lt;math&gt;G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;--from which the diffusion coefficient and fluorophore concentration can be obtained.  

With the normalization used in the previous section, ''G''(0) gives the mean number of diffusers in the volume &lt;N&gt;, or equivalently&amp;mdash;with knowledge of the observation volume size&amp;mdash;the mean concentration:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(0)=\frac{1}{\langle N\rangle}=\frac{1}{V_\text{eff}\langle C\rangle},&lt;/math&gt;

where the effective volume is found from integrating the Gaussian form of the measurement volume and is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;\ V_\text{eff}=\pi^{3/2}\omega_{xy}^2\omega_z .\, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt; gives the diffusion coefficient:
: &lt;math&gt;\ D=\omega_{xy}^2/{4\tau_D}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Anomalous diffusion===
If the diffusing particles are hindered by obstacles or pushed by a force (molecular motors, flow, etc.) the dynamics is often not sufficiently well-described by the normal diffusion model, where the mean squared displacement (MSD) grows linearly with time.  Instead the diffusion may be better described as [[anomalous diffusion]], where the temporal dependenc of the MSD is non-linear as in the power-law:

: &lt;math&gt;\ MSD= 6 D_a t^\alpha \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_a&lt;/math&gt; is an anomalous diffusion coefficient.  &quot;Anomalous diffusion&quot; commonly refers only to this very generic model, and not the many other possibilities that might be described as anomalous.  Also, a power law is, in a strict sense, the expected form only for a narrow range of rigorously defined systems, for instance when the distribution of obstacles is [[fractal]].  Nonetheless a power law can be a useful approximation for a wider range of systems.  

The FCS autocorrelation function for anomalous diffusion is:

: &lt;math&gt; G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_D)^\alpha)(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_D)^\alpha)^{1/2}} +G(\infty),&lt;/math&gt;

where the anomalous exponent &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the same as above, and becomes a free parameter in the fitting.  

Using FCS, the anomalous exponent has been shown to be an indication of the degree of molecular crowding (it is less than one and smaller for greater degrees of crowding)&lt;ref&gt;Banks, D. S., and C. Fradin. 2005. Anomalous diffusion of proteins due to molecular crowding. Biophys. J. 89:2960–2971.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Polydisperse diffusion===
If there are diffusing particles with different sizes (diffusion coefficients), it is common to fit to a function that is the sum of single component forms: 

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\sum_i \frac{\alpha_i}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))^{1/2}} +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over the number different sizes of particle, indexed by i, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the weighting, which is related to the quantum yield and concentration of each type. This introduces new parameters, which makes the fitting more difficult as a higher dimensional space must be searched.  Nonlinear least square fitting typically becomes unstable with even a small number of &lt;math&gt;\tau_{D,i}&lt;/math&gt;s.  A more robust fitting scheme, especially useful for polydisperse samples, is the Maximum Entropy Method&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, P., K. Garai, J. Balaji, N. Periasamy, and S. Maiti. 2003. Measuring Size Distribution in Highly Heterogeneous Systems with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. Biophys. J. 84(3):1977–1984.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Diffusion with flow===
With diffusion together with a uniform flow with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the lateral direction, the autocorrelation is&lt;ref&gt; Kohler, R.H., P. Schwille, W.W. Webb, and M.R. Hanson. 2000. Active protein transport through plastid tubules: velocity quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. J Cell Sci 113(22):3921–3930&lt;/ref&gt;:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D}))^{1/2}} \times \exp[-(\tau/\tau_v)^2 \times \frac{1}{1+\tau/\tau_D}] +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_v=\omega_{xy}/v&lt;/math&gt; is the average residence time if there is only a flow (no diffusion).

===Chemical relaxation===
A wide range of possible FCS experiments involve chemical reactions that continually fluctuate from equilibrium because of thermal motions (and then &quot;relax&quot;).  In contrast to diffusion, which is also a relaxation process, the fluctuations cause changes between states of different energies.  One very simple system showing chemical relaxation would be a stationary binding site in the measurement volume, where particles only produce signal when bound (e.g. by FRET, or if the diffusion time is much faster than the sampling interval).  In this case the autocorrelation is:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0) \exp(-\tau/\tau_B) +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_B=(k_\text{on}+k_\text{off} )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 

is the relaxation time and depends on the reaction kinetics (on and off rates), and: 

: &lt;math&gt; G(0) = \frac{1}{\langle N\rangle} \frac{k_{on}}{k_{off}} = \frac{1}{\langle N\rangle} K&lt;/math&gt; 

is related to the equilibrium constant ''K''.

Most systems with chemical relaxation also show measureable diffusion as well, and the autocorrelation function will depend on the details of the system.  If the diffusion and chemical reaction are decoupled, the combined autocorrelation is the product of the chemical and diffusive autocorrelations.

===Triplet state correction===
The autocorrelations above assume that the fluctuations are not due to changes in the fluorescent properties of the particles.  However, for the majority of (bio)organic fluorophores--e.g. [[green fluorescent protein]], rhodamine, [[Cy3]] and [[Alexa Fluor]] dyes--some fraction of illuminated particles are excited to a [[triplet state]] (or other non-radiative decaying states) and then do not emit [[photons]] for a characteristic relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau_F&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically &lt;math&gt;\tau_F&lt;/math&gt; is on the order of microseconds, which is usually smaller than the dynamics of interest (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;) but large enough to be measured.  A multiplicative term is added to the autocorrelation account for the triplet state.  For normal diffusion: 

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1-F+Fe^{-\tau/\tau_F}}{1-F}\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))^{1/2}}+G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ F&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of particles that have entered the triplet state and &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_F&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding triplet state relaxation time.  If the dynamics of interest are much slower than the triplet state relaxation, the short time component of the autocorrelation can simply be truncated and the triplet term is unnecessary.

==Common fluorescent probes==
The fluorescent species used in FCS is typically a biomolecule of interest that has been tagged with a fluorophore (using [[immunohistochemistry]] for instance), or is a naked fluorophore that is used to probe some environment of interest (e.g. the cytoskeleton of a cell).  The following table gives diffusion coefficients of some common fluorophores in water at room temperature, and their excitation wavelengths.

==Variations of FCS==
FCS almost always refers to the single point, single channel, temporal autocorrelation measurement, although the term &quot;fluorescence correlation spectroscopy&quot; out of its historical scientific context implies no such restriction.  FCS has been extended in a number of variations by different researchers, with each extension generating another name (usually an acronym).     

===Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS)===
FCS is sometimes used to study molecular interactions using differences in diffusion times (e.g. the product of an association reaction will be larger and thus have larger diffusion times than the reactants individually); however, FCS is relatively insensitive to molecular mass as can be seen from the following equation relating molecular mass to the diffusion time of globular particles (e.g. proteins):

: &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_D=\frac{3\pi\omega_{xy}^2\eta}{2kT}(M)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \eta&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity of the sample and &lt;math&gt;\ M&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular mass of the fluorescent species. In practice, the diffusion times need to be sufficiently different--a factor of at least '''1.6'''--which means the molecular masses must differ by a factor of '''4'''.&lt;ref&gt;Meseth, U., Wohland, T., Rigler, R., Vogel, H. Resolution of fluorescence correlation measurements. (1999) ''Biophys. J.'', '''76''', 1619–1631.&lt;/ref&gt; Dual color [[fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy]] (FCCS) measures interactions by cross-correlating two or more fluorescent channels (one channel for each reactant), which distinguishes interactions more sensitively than FCS, particularly when the mass change in the reaction is small.

===Brightness analysis methods (N&amp;B,&lt;ref&gt;Digman, M. A., R. Dalal, A. F. Horwitz, and E. Gratton.  Mapping the number of molecules and brightness in the laser scanning microscope. (2008) ''Biophys. J.'' '''94''', 2320–2332.
&lt;/ref&gt; PCH,&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y., J. D. Müller, P. T. C. So, and E. Gratton. The photon counting histogram in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. (1999) ''Biophys. J.'' '''77''', 553–567.&lt;/ref&gt; FIDA,&lt;ref&gt;Kask, P., K. Palo, D. Ullmann, and K. Gall. Fluorescence-intensity distribution analysis and its application in biomolecular detection technology. (1999) ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.'' '''96''', 13756–13761.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulant Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Müller, J. D. Cumulant analysis in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. (2004) ''Biophys. J.'' '''86''', 3981–3992.&lt;/ref&gt;)===
Fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy overcomes the weak dependence of diffusion rate on molecular mass by looking at multicolor coincidence.  What about homo-interactions?  The solution lies in brightness analysis.  These methods use the heterogeneity in the intensity distribution of fluorescence to measure the molecular brightness of different species in a sample.  Since dimers will contain twice the number of fluorescent labels as monomers, their molecular brightness will be approximately double that of monomers.  As a result, the relative brightness is sensitive a measure of oligomerization.  The average molecular brightness (&lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) is related to the variance (&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;) and the average intensity (&lt;math&gt;\langle I\rangle &lt;/math&gt;) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Qian, H., Elson, E.L. On the analysis of high order moments of fluorescence fluctuations. (1990) ''Biophys. J.'', '''57''', 375–380.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ \langle \varepsilon\rangle =\frac{\sigma^2 - \langle I\rangle}{\langle I\rangle} = \sum_i f_i \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are the fractional intensity and molecular brigthness, respectively, of species &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Two- and three- photon FCS excitation==
Several advantages in both spatial resolution and minimizing photodamage/photobleaching in organic and/or biological samples are obtained by two-photon or three-photon excitation FCS&lt;ref&gt;Diaspro, A., and Robello, M. (1999). Multi-photon Excitation Microscopy to Study Biosystems. European Microscopy and Analysis., 5:5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagatolli, L.A., and Gratton, E. (2000). Two-photon fluorescence microscopy of coexisting lipid domains in giant unilamellar vesicles of binary phospholipid mixtures. Biophys J., 78:290–305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwille, P., Haupts, U., Maiti, S., and Webb. W.(1999). Molecular dynamics in living cells observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with one- and two- photon excitation. ''Biophysical Journal'', '''77'''(10):2251–2265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Fluorescence Microspectroscopy,Infrared Chemical Imaging and High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis of Soybean  Seeds, Somatic Embryos and Single Cells., Baianu, I.C. et al. 2004., In ''Oil Extraction and Analysis.'', D. Luthria, Editor pp.241–273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Single Cancer Cell Detection by Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Infrared Chemical Imaging and Fluorescence Microspectroscopy.2004.I. C. Baianu, D. Costescu, N. E. Hofmann and S. S. Korban, [http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0407006 q-bio/0407006 (July 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===FRET-FCS===
Another FCS based approach to studying molecular interactions uses [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] (FRET) instead of fluorescence, and is called FRET-FCS.&lt;ref&gt;K. Remaut, B. Lucas, K. Braeckmans, N.N. Sanders, S.C. De Smedt and J. Demeester, FRET-FCS as a tool to evaluate the stability of oligonucleotide drugs after intracellular delivery, J Control Rel 103 (2005) (1), pp. 259–271.&lt;/ref&gt;  With FRET, there are two types of probes, as with FCCS; however, there is only one channel and light is only detected when the two probes are very close&amp;mdash;close enough to ensure an interaction.  The FRET signal is weaker than with fluorescence, but has the advantage that there is only signal during a reaction (aside from [[autofluorescence]]).

===Image correlation spectroscopy (ICS)===
When the motion is slow (in biology, for example, diffusion in a membrane), getting adequate statistics from a single-point FCS experiment may take a prohibitively long time.  More data can be obtained by performing the experiment in multiple spatial points in parallel, using a laser scanning confocal microscope.  This approach has been called Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS)&lt;ref name=&quot;ICS-ICCS&quot;&gt;Wiseman, P. W., J. A. Squier, M. H. Ellisman, and K. R. Wilson. 2000. Two-photon video rate image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS). J. Microsc. 200:14–25.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The measurements can then be averaged together.  

Another variation of ICS performs a spatial autocorrelation on images, which gives information about the concentration of particles&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, N. O., P. L. Ho¨ddelius, P. W. Wiseman, O. Seger, and K. E. Magnusson. 1993. Quantitation of membrane receptor distributions by
image correlation spectroscopy: concept and application. Biophys. J.
65:1135–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The correlation is then averaged in time. 

A natural extension of the temporal and spatial correlation versions is spatio-temporal ICS (STICS) &lt;ref name=&quot;stics&quot;&gt;Hebert, B., S. Constantino, and P. W. Wiseman. 2005. Spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS): theory, verification and application to protein velocity mapping in living CHO cells. Biophys.
J. 88:3601–3614.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In STICS there is no explicit averaging in space or time (only the averaging inherent in correlation).  In systems with non-isotropic motion (e.g. directed flow, asymmetric diffusion), STICS can extract the directional information.  A variation that is closely related to STICS (by the Fourier transform) is ''k''-space Image Correlation Spectroscopy (kICS).&lt;ref&gt;Kolin, D.L., D. Ronis, and P.W. Wiseman. 2006. ''k''-Space Image Correlation Spectroscopy: A Method for Accurate Transport Measurements Independent of Fluorophore Photophysics. Biophys. J. 91(8):3061–3075.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cross-correlation versions of ICS as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICS-ICCS&quot;/&gt;

===Scanning FCS variations===
Some variations of FCS are only applicable to serial scanning laser microscopes.  Image Correlation Spectroscopy and its variations all were implemented on a scanning confocal or scanning two photon microscope, but transfer to other microscopes, like a spinning disk confocal microscope.  Raster ICS (RICS)&lt;ref&gt;Digman, M.A., P. Sengupta, P.W. Wiseman, C.M. Brown, A.R. Horwitz, and E. Gratton. 2005. Fluctuation Correlation Spectroscopy with a Laser-Scanning Microscope: Exploiting the Hidden Time Structure. Biophys. J. 88(5):L33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;, and position sensitive FCS (PSFCS)&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, J.P., Y. Chen, and J.D. Mueller. 2005. Position-Sensitive Scanning Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. Biophys. J.:biophysj.105.060749.&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate the time delay between parts of the image scan into the analysis.  Also, low dimensional scans (e.g. a circular ring)&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Q., M.A. Cheng, M. Levi, E. Gratton, and W.W. Mantulin. 2004. Spatial-temporal studies of membrane dynamics: scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SFCS). Biophys.

Express 13, 8069–8082 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinning disk FCS, and spatial mapping===
Any of the image correlation spectroscopy methods can also be performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope, which in practice can obtain faster imaging speeds compared to a laser scanning confocal microscope.  This approach has recently been applied to diffusion in a spatially varying complex environment, producing a pixel resolution map of a diffusion coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sisan, D.R., R. Arevalo, C. Graves, R. McAllister, and J.S. Urbach. 2006. Spatially resolved fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using a spinning disk confocal microscope. Biophysical Journal 91(11):4241–4252.&lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial mapping of diffusion with FCS has subsequently been extended to the TIRF system.&lt;ref&gt;Kannan, B., L. Guo, T. Sudhaharan, S. Ahmed, I. Maruyama, and T. Wohland. 2007. Spatially resolved total internal reflection fluorescence correlation microscopy using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera. Analytical Chemistry 79(12):4463–4470&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial mapping of dynamics using correlation techniques had been applied before, but only at sparse points&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, M., W. Waldeck, and J. Langowski. 2000. Anomalous diffusion of fluorescent probes inside living cell nuclei investigated by spatially-resolved fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. J. Mol. Biol. 298(4):677–689.
&lt;/ref&gt; or at coarse resolution&lt;ref name=&quot;stics&quot; /&gt;.

===Total internal reflection FCS===
[[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope | Total internal reflection fluorescence]] (TIRF) is a microscopy approach that is only sensitive to a thin layer near the surface of a coverslip, which greatly minimizes background fluorscence.  FCS has been extended to that type of microscope, and is called TIR-FCS&lt;ref&gt;Lieto, A.M., and N.L. Thompson. 2004. Total Internal Reflection with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy: Nonfluorescent Competitors. Biophys. J. 87(2):1268–1278.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Because the fluorescence intensity in TIRF falls off exponentially with distance from the coverslip (instead of as a Gaussian with a confocal), the autocorrelation function is different.

==Other fluorescent dynamical approaches==
There are two main non-correlation alternatives to FCS that are widely used to study the dynamics of fluorescent species.

===Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)===
In [[fluorescence recovery after photobleaching | FRAP]], a region is briefly exposed to intense light, irrecoverably photobleaching fluorophores, and the fluorescence recovery due to diffusion of nearby (non-bleached) fluorophores is imaged.  A primary advantage of FRAP over FCS is the ease of interpreting qualitative experiments common in cell biology.  Differences between cell lines, or regions of a cell, or before and after application of drug, can often be characterized by simple inspection of movies. FCS experiments require a level of processing and are more sensitive to potentially confounding influences like: rotational diffusion, vibrations, photobleaching, dependence on illumination and fluorescence color, inadequate statistics, etc.  It is much easier to change the measurement volume in FRAP, which allows greater control. In practice, the volumes are typically larger than in FCS.  While FRAP experiments are typically more qualitative, some researchers are studying FRAP quantitatively and including binding dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, B.L., and J.G. McNally. 2005. FRAP analysis of binding: proper and fitting. Trends in Cell Biology 15(2):84–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  A disadvantage of FRAP in cell biology is the free radical perturbation of the cell caused by the photobleaching.  It is also less versatile, as it cannot measure concentration or rotational diffusion, or co-localization.  FRAP requires a significantly higher concentration of fluorophores than FCS.  

===Particle tracking===
In particle tracking, the trajectories of a set of particles are measured, typically by applying particle tracking algorithms to movies.[http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/]  Particle tracking has the advantage that all the dynamical information is maintained in the measurement, unlike FCS where correlation averages the dynamics to a single smooth curve.  The advantage is apparent in systems showing complex diffusion, where directly computing the mean squared displacement allows straightforward comparison to normal or power law diffusion.  To apply particle tracking, the particles have to be distinguishable and thus at lower concentration than required of FCS.  Also, particle tracking is more sensitive to noise, which can sometimes affect the results unpredictably.

'''Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching''', or '''FLIP''', is a technique in [[fluorescence microscopy]] which can be used to examine the movement or diffusion of molecules inside [[cell (biology) | cell]]s or [[cell membrane | membrane]]s.  Typically a cell membrane is labelled with a fluorescent [[fluorophore | dye]], and a specific area of the labeled membrane is [[photobleaching | bleached]] using the beam from a [[confocal laser scanning microscope]].  The fluorescence intensity from that region of the membrane is measured over time.  Motion of fluorescent molecules into and along the membrane slowly restores the fluorescence in the bleached region, while depleting the fluorescence in other regions (by exchange of bleached for unbleached fluorophores).  

Measurement of the rate of this recovery provides an estimate of the lateral membrane fluidity.  Changes in the size and shape of the bleached region can also indicate directional flow along the cell membrane.

FLIP is also useful in verifying the continuity of membranous organelles (e.g., the [[Golgi apparatus]]).  A small circumscribed region of the organelle  is continuously bleached.  As fluorophores diffuse along the membrane into the illuminated spot, they are bleached; eventually, the fluorescence of the entire organelle is depleted.

It is closely related to another technique, [[Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching]] (FRAP).  The difference between FLIP and FRAP is that FLIP follows the path of the bleached fluorophores, while FRAP follows the recovery of the bleached region.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy''' (FCCS) was introduced by Eigen and Rigler in 1994 and experimentally realized by Schwille in 1997. It extends the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) procedure by introducing high sensitivity for distinguishing fluorescent particles which have a similar diffusion coefficient. 
FCCS uses two species which are independently labelled with two spectrally separated fluorescent probes. These fluorescent probes are excited and detected by two different laser light sources and detectors commonly known as green and red respectively. Both laser light beams are focused into the sample and tuned so that they overlap to form a superimposed confocal observation volume. 

The normalized cross-correlation function is defined for two fluorescent species &lt;math&gt;\ G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt; which are independent green, G and red, R channels as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_{GR}(\tau)=1+\frac{&lt;\delta I_G(t)\delta I_R(t+\tau)&gt;}{&lt;I_G(t)&gt;&lt;I_R(t)&gt;}=\frac{&lt;I_G(t)I_R(t+\tau)&gt;}{&lt;I_G(t)&gt;&lt;I_R(t)&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;

where differential fluorescent signals &lt;math&gt;\ \delta I_G&lt;/math&gt; at a specific time, &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ \delta I_R&lt;/math&gt; at a delay time, &lt;math&gt;\ \tau&lt;/math&gt; later is correlated with each other.

==Modeling==
Cross-correlation curves are modeled according to a slightly more complicated mathematical function than applied in FCS. First of all, the effective superimposed observation volume in which the G and R channels form a single observation volume, &lt;math&gt;\ V_{eff, RG}&lt;/math&gt; in the solution:

&lt;math&gt;\ V_{eff, RG}=\pi^{3/2}(\omega_{xy,G}^2+\omega_{xy,R}^2)(\omega_{z,G}^2+\omega_{z,R}^2)^{1/2}/2^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{xy,G}^2&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{xy,R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are radial parameters and &lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{z,G}&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{z,R}&lt;/math&gt; are the axial parameters for the G and R channels respectively.

The diffusion time, &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_{D,GR}&lt;/math&gt; for a doubly (G and R) fluorescent species is therefore described as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ \tau_{D,GR}=\frac{\omega_{xy,G}^2+\omega_{xy,R}^2}{8D_{GR}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ D_{GR}&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient of the doubly fluorescent particle.

The cross-correlation curve generated from diffusing doubly labelled fluorescent particles can be modelled in separate channels as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_G(\tau)=1+\frac{(&lt;C_G&gt;Diff_k(\tau)+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_k(\tau))}{V_{eff, GR}(&lt;C_G&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ G_R(\tau)=1+\frac{(&lt;C_R&gt;Diff_k(\tau)+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_k(\tau))}{V_{eff, GR}(&lt;C_R&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the ideal case, the cross-correlation function is proportional to the concentration of the doubly labeled fluorescent complex:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_{GR}(\tau)=1+\frac{&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_{GR}(\tau)}{V_{eff}(&lt;C_G&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)(&lt;C_R&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\ Diff_k(\tau)=\frac{1}{(1+\frac{\tau}{\tau_{D,i}})(1+a^{-2}(\frac{\tau}{\tau_{D,i}})^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to FCS, the intercept of the cross-correlation curve does not yield information about the doubly labelled fluorescent particles in solution.

[[Image:Fluorescence microscop.jpg|thumb|An upright fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) with the fluorescent filter cube turret above the objective lenses, coupled with a digital camera.]]


A '''fluorescence microscope''' (colloquially synonymous with ''epifluorescence microscope'') is an [[optical microscope]] used to study properties of organic or inorganic substances using the phenomena of [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] instead of, or in addition to, [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[absorption (optics)|absorption]].&lt;ref name=Spring&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microscopyu.com/articles/fluorescence/fluorescenceintro.html |author=Spring KR, Davidson MW |title=Introduction to Fluorescence Microscopy |work=Nikon MicroscopyU |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/physics/microscopes/fluorescence/ |title=The Fluorescence Microscope |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |work=Microscopes—Help Scientists Explore Hidden Worlds |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Inverted microscope.jpg|thumb|An inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE2000) with the fluorescent filter cube turret below the stage. Note the orange plate that allows the user to look at the sample while protecting his eyes from the excitation UV light.]]

==Technique==

In most cases, a component of interest in the specimen can be labeled specifically with a fluorescent molecule called a [[fluorophore]] (such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), [[fluorescein]] or [[DyLight Fluor|DyLight 488]]).&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt; The specimen is illuminated with light of a specific [[wavelength]] (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e. of a different color than the absorbed light). The illumination light is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence through the use of a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are the light source ([[xenon arc lamp]] or [[mercury-vapor lamp]]), the [[excitation filter]], the [[dichroic mirror]] (or dichromatic beamsplitter), and the [[emission filter]] (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen.&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt; In this manner, the distribution of a single fluorophore (color) is imaged at a time. Multi-color images of several types of fluorophores must be composed by combining several single-color images.&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt;

Most fluorescence microscopes in use are epifluorescence microscopes (i.e. excitation and observation of the fluorescence are from above (''epi–'') the specimen). These microscopes have become an important part in the field of biology, opening the doors for more advanced microscope designs, such as the [[confocal microscopy|confocal microscope]] and the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]] (TIRF). 

Fluorophores lose their ability to fluoresce as they are illuminated in a process called [[photobleaching]]. Special care must be taken to prevent photobleaching through the use of more robust fluorophores, by minimizing illumination, or by introducing a [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenger]] system to reduce the rate of photobleaching.

==Epifluorescence microscopy==

[[Image:FluorescenceFilters 2008-09-28.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of a fluorescence microscope.]]
Epifluorescence microscopy is a method of fluorescence microscopy that is widely used in [[life sciences]]. The excitatory light is passed from above (or, for inverted microscopes, from below), through the [[objective (optics)|objective]] lens and then onto the specimen instead of passing it first through the specimen. The [[fluorescence]] in the specimen gives rise to emitted light which is focused to the detector by the same objective that is used for the excitation. Since most of the excitatory light is transmitted through the specimen, only reflected excitatory light reaches the objective together with the emitted light and this method therefore gives an improved signal to noise ratio. An additional filter between the objective and the detector can filter out the remaining excitation light from fluorescent light. A common use in biology is to apply fluorescent or [[fluorochrome]] stains to the specimen in order to image distributions of proteins or other molecules of interest.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

==Improvements and sub-diffraction techniques==

The nature of light limits the size of the spot to which light can be focused. According to the [[diffraction limit]] a focused light distribution cannot be made smaller than approximately half of the wavelength of the used light. Uncovered in the 19th century by [[Ernst Abbe]] this has been a barrier of the achievable resolution of fluorescence light microscopes for a long time. While resolution is denoted by the ability to discern different objects of the same kind, localizing or [[single particle tracking|tracking of single particles]] have been performed with a precision much below the diffraction limit.

Several improvements in microscopy techniques have been invented in the 20th century and have resulted in increased resolution and contrast to some extent. In 1978 first theoretical ideas have been developed to break this barrier by using a 4Pi microscope as a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope where the light is focused ideally from all sides to a common focus which is used to scan the object by 'point-by-point' excitation combined with 'point-by-point' detection &lt;ref name=&quot;clsm31-44&quot;&gt;&gt;Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field: C. Cremer and T. Cremer in M1CROSCOPICA ACTA VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September,pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, the first experimental demonstration of the 4pi microscope took place in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.W. Hell, E.H.K. Stelzer, S. Lindek, C. Cremer |title=Confocal microscopy with an increased detection aperture: type-B 4Pi confocal microscopy |journal=Optics Letters |volume=19 |year=1994 |pages=222-224 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ol-19-3-222&amp;seq=0 |doi=10.1364/OL.19.000222}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[4Pi microscopy]] is maximizing the amount of available focusing directions by using two opposing objective lenses or [[Multi-photon microscopy]] using redshifted light and multi-photon excitation.

The first technique to really achieve a sub-diffraction resolution was [[STED microscopy]], proposed in 1994. This method and all techniques following the [[RESOLFT]] concept rely on a strong non-linear interaction between light and fluorescing molecules. The molecules are driven strongly between distinguishable molecular states at each specific location, so that finally light can be emitted at only a small fraction of space, hence an increased resolution.

As well in the 1990ies another super resolution microscopy method based on wide field microscopy has been developed. Substantially improved size resolution of cellular [[nanostructure]]s stained with a fluorescent marker was achieved by development of SPDM localization microscopy and the structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI) &lt;ref&gt;M. Hausmann, B. Schneider, J. Bradl, C. Cremer (1997): High-precision distance microscopy of 3D-nanostructures by a spatially modulated excitation fluorescence microscope. In: Optical Biopsies and Microscopic Techniques II (Edts Bigio IJ, Schneckenburger H, Slavik J, Svanberg K, Viallet PM), Proc. SPIE 3197: 217-222&lt;/ref&gt;. Combining the principle of SPDM with SMI resulted in the development of the [[Vertico SMI]] microscope &lt;ref&gt;High precision structural analysis of subnuclear complexes in fixed and live cells via Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI) microscopy: J. Reymann, D. Baddeley, P. Lemmer, W. Stadter, T. Jegou, K. Rippe, C. Cremer, U. Birk in CHROMOSOME RESEARCH, Vol.   16, pp. 367 –382 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nano-structure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy: D. Baddeley, C. Batram, Y. Weiland, C. Cremer, U.J. Birk in NATURE PROTOCOLS, Vol 2, pp. 2640 – 2646 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;. Single molecule detection of normal blinking fluorescent dyes like [[GFP]] can be achieved by using a further development of SPDM the so-called SPDMphymod technology which makes it is possible to detect and count two different fluorescent molecule types at the molecular level (this technology is referred to as 2CLM, 2 Color Localization Microscopy) &lt;ref&gt;Manuel Gunkel, Fabian Erdel, Karsten Rippe, Paul Lemmer, Rainer Kaufmann, Christoph Hörmann, Roman Amberger and Christoph Cremer: ''Dual color localization microscopy of cellular nanostructures''. In: Biotechnology Journal, 2009, 4, 927-938. ISSN 1860-6768&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alternatively, the advent of [[Microscopy#PALM.2C_STORM|photoactivated localization microscopy]] could achieve similar results by relying on blinking or switching of single molecules, where the fraction of fluorescing molecules is very small at each time. This stochastic response of molecules on the applied light corresponds also to a highly nonlinear interaction, leading to subdiffraction resolution.

'''Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]]''' (FRAP) denotes an optical technique capable of quantifying the two dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of [[cell membrane]] diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing [[phospholipid]] bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.  
Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional [[diffusion]] and [[binding]] of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.  

==Experimental Setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an [[optical microscope]], a [[List of light sources|light source]] and some [[fluorescent]] probe. [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent emission]] is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad [[spectrum]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[xenon]] source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with [[laser]] light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the [[diffusion equation]]. Assuming a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant ''D'' can be simply calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{w^{2}}{4t_{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the radius of the beam and ''t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the time required for the bleach spot to recover half of its initial integrated intensity&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, B., R. Pego, et al. Analysis of Binding Reactions by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching. Biophys. J. 2004 Jun; 86(6):3473-3495&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==
===Supported Lipid Bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP  technique was intended for use as a mean to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod D.,Koppel D.E., Schlessinger J., Elson E. and Webb. W.W. Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence *photobleaching recovery kinetics. Biophysical Journal, Volume 16, Issue 9, September 1976, Pages 1055-1069.&lt;/ref&gt; While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating [[membrane proteins]], these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein Binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) [[fusion protein]]s, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP.  When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce.  When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked.  Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.

If after some time the fluorescence doesn't reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion).  Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding.  This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding.

==Applications Outside the Membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane.  After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a [[confocal microscope]] is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the [[cytoplasm]], [[mitotic spindle]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or another cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;Kaushlendra Tripathi and Veena K Parnaik. Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle J. Biosci. 33(3)2008 345-354.&lt;/ref&gt;   The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients for the protein's binding reactions and/or the protein's diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Adriaan B.Houtsmuller.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching:Application to Nuclear Proteins.Adv Biochem Engin/Biotechnol (2005) 95: 177–199&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis is most simple when the curve is dominated by only the diffusional or only the binding components.  For a circular bleach spot and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by the Soumpasis&lt;ref&gt;D M Soumpasis. Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments. Biophys J. 1983 January; 41(1): 95–97. &lt;/ref&gt; equation and involves [[modified Bessel function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=e^{-h}\left(I_{0}(h)+I_{1}(h)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h''=r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2*D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;*t); ''r''=radius of bleach spot; ''t''=time; ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''=diffusion coefficient; ''f(t)'' is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as t goes to infinity).

For a binding-dominated reaction, in which the diffusion is much faster than the unbinding of the bleached protein and subsequent binding of unbleached protein, it is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=1-B_{eq}e^{-k_{off}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fraction of the protein that is bound to other structures in the photobleached region at equilibrium, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the dissociation constant for the binding.  Sometimes there are multiple binding states in which case there are just more exponential terms of the same form.  Many FRAP recoveries are not dominated overwhelmingly by just diffusion or just binding, so their curves are more complex; FRAP recoveries are analyzed in much more detail in Sprague and Pego et al. (see References below).

'''Fluorescence spectroscopy''' aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Theory==
{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences|l1=Fluorescence}}

Molecules have various states referred to as [[energy levels]]. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states. Generally, the species being examined has a [[Stationary state|ground electronic state]] (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states are various vibrational states.

In fluorescence spectroscopy, the species is first excited, by absorbing a [[photon]], from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state of the excited electronic state.

The molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic state again, emitting a photon in the process. As molecules may drop down into any of several vibrational levels in the ground state, the emitted photons will have different energies, and thus frequencies. Therefore, by analysing the different frequencies of light emitted in fluorescent spectroscopy, along with their relative intensities, the structure of the different vibrational levels can be determined.

In a typical experiment, the different wavelengths of fluorescent light emitted by a sample are measured using a monochromator, holding the excitation light at a constant wavelength. This is called an ''emission spectrum''. An ''excitation spectrum'' is the opposite, whereby the emission light is held at a constant wavelength, and the excitation light is scanned through a many different wavelengths (via a monochromator). An ''Emission Map'' is measured by recording a number of different emission spectra created from different excitation wavelengths, and combining them all together.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, www.edinst.com&lt;/ref&gt; This is a three dimensional data set, intensity of emission as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths, and is typically depicted as a contour map.

== Instrumentation ==

[[Image:Spectrophotomer.JPG|right|thumb|260px|Schematic of a fluorometer with 90° geometry utilizing a Xe light source]]

Two general types of instruments exist:

*[[Filter fluorometer]]s use filters to isolate the [[wiktionary:incident|incident]] light and [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] light.
*[[Spectrofluorometer]]s use [[diffraction grating]] [[monochromator]]s to isolate the incident light and fluorescent light.

Both types utilize the following scheme: The light from an excitation source passes through a filter or monochromator, and strikes the sample. A proportion of the incident light is absorbed by the sample, and some of the molecules in the sample fluoresce. The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions. Some of this fluorescent light passes through a second filter or monochromator and reaches a detector, which is usually placed at 90° to the incident light beam to minimize the risk of transmitted or reflected incident light reaching the detector.

Various light sources may be used as excitation sources, including lasers, photodiodes, and lamps; [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon arcs]] and [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s in particular. A laser only emits light of high irradiance at a very narrow wavelength interval, typically under 0.01&amp;nbsp;nm, which makes an excitation monochromator or filter unnecessary. The disadvantage of this method is that the wavelength of a laser cannot be changed by much. A mercury vapor lamp is a line lamp, meaning it emits light near peak wavelengths. By contrast, a xenon arc has a continuous emission spectrum with nearly constant intensity in the range from 300-800&amp;nbsp;nm and a sufficient irradiance for measurements down to just above 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

Filters and/or monochromators may be used in fluorimeters. A monochromator transmits light of an adjustable wavelength with an adjustable tolerance. The most common type of monochromator utilizes a diffraction grating, that is, [[collimated]] light illuminates a grating and exits with a different angle depending on the wavelength. The monochromator can then be adjusted to select which wavelengths to transmit. For allowing anisotropy measurements the addition of two polarization filters are necessary: One after the excitation monochromator or filter, and one before the emission monochromator or filter.

As mentioned before, the fluorescence is most often measured at a 90° angle relative to the excitation light. This geometry is used instead of placing the sensor at the line of the excitation light at a 180° angle in order to avoid interference of the transmitted excitation light. No monochromator is perfect and it will transmit some [[stray light]], that is, light with other wavelengths than the targeted. An ideal monochromator would only transmit light in the specified range and have a high wavelength-independent transmission. When measuring at a 90 angle, only the light scattered by the sample causes stray light. This results in a better signal-to-noise ratio, and lowers the detection limit by approximately a factor 10000,&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, D. (1987). Fluorescence and Phosphorescence. Crown&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the 180° geometry. Furthermore, the fluorescence can also be measured from the front, which is often done for turbid or opaque samples

The detector can either be single-channeled or multichanneled. The single-channeled detector can only detect the intensity of one wavelength at a time, while the multichanneled detects the intensity at all wavelengths simultaneously, making the emission monochromator or filter unnecessary. The different types of detectors have both advantages and disadvantages.

The most versatile fluorimeters with dual monochromators and a continuous excitation light source can record both an excitation spectrum and a fluorescence spectrum. When measuring fluorescence spectra, the wavelength of the excitation light is kept constant, preferably at a wavelength of high absorption, and the emission monochromator scans the spectrum. For measuring excitation spectra, the wavelength passing though the emission filter or monochromator is kept constant and the excitation monochromator is scanning. The excitation spectrum generally is identical to the absorption spectrum as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma, A 1999&quot;&gt;Sharma, A. and Schulman, S. G. (1999). Introduction to Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Wiley interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of data==
At low concentrations the [[fluorescence]] [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] will generally be proportional to the [[concentration]] of the [[fluorophore]].

Unlike in UV/visible spectroscopy, ‘standard’, device independent spectra are not easily attained. Several factors influence and distort the spectra, and corrections are necessary to attain ‘true’, i.e. machine-independent, spectra. The different types of distortions will here be classified as being either instrument- or sample-related. Firstly, the distortion arising from the instrument is discussed. As a start, the light source intensity and wavelength characteristics varies over time during each experiment and between each experiment. Furthermore, no lamp has a constant intensity at all wavelengths. To correct this, a beam splitter can be applied after the excitation monochromator or filter to direct a portion of the light to a reference detector.

Additionally, the transmission efficiency of monochromators and filters must be taken into account. These may also change over time. The transmission efficiency of the monochromator also varies depending on wavelength. This is the reason that an optional reference detector should be placed after the excitation monochromator or filter. The percentage of the fluorescence picked up by the detector is also dependent upon the system. Furthermore, the detector quantum efficiency, that is, the percentage of photons detected, varies between different detectors, with wavelength and with time, as the detector inevitably deteriorates.

Correction of all these instrumental factors for getting a ‘standard’ spectrum is a tedious process, which is only applied in practice when it is strictly necessary. This is the case when measuring the quantum yield or when finding the wavelength with the highest emission intensity for instance.

As mentioned earlier, distortions arise from the sample as well. Therefore some aspects of the sample must be taken into account too. Firstly, photodecomposition may decrease the intensity of fluorescence over time. Scattering of light must also be taken into account. The most significant types of scattering in this context are Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Light scattered by Rayleigh scattering has the same wavelength as the incident light, whereas in Raman scattering the scattered light changes wavelength usually to longer wavelengths. Raman scattering is the result of a virtual electronic state induced by the excitation light. From this [[Virtual State (physics)|virtual state]], the molecules may relax back to a vibrational level other than the vibrational ground state.&lt;ref&gt;Gauglitz, G. and Vo-Dinh, T. (2003). Handbook of spectroscopy.
Wiley-VCH.&lt;/ref&gt; In fluorescence spectra, it is always seen at a constant wavenumber difference relative to the excitation wavenumber e.g. the peak appears at a wavenumber 3600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt; lower than the excitation light in water.

Other aspects to consider are the inner filter effects. These include reabsorption. Reabsorption happens because another molecule or part of a macromolecule absorbs at the wavelengths at which the fluorophore emits radiation. If this is the case, some or all of the photons emitted by the fluorophore may be absorbed again. Another inner filter effect occurs because of high concentrations of absorbing molecules, including the fluorophore. The result is that the intensity of the excitation light is not constant throughout the solution. Resultingly, only a small percentage of the excitation light reaches the fluorophores that are visible for the detection system. The inner filter effects change the spectrum and intensity of the emitted light and they must therefore be considered when analysing the emission spectrum of fluorescent light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma, A 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakowicz, J. R. (1999). Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tryptophan Fluorescence==
The [[fluorescence]] of a [[folded protein]] is a mixture of the fluorescence from individual aromatic residues. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of [[tryptophan]] residues, with some emissions due to tyrosine and phenylalanine; but disulfide bonds also have appreciable absorption in this wavelength range. Typically, tryptophan has a wavelength of maximum absorption of 280&amp;nbsp;nm and an emission peak that is [[solvatochromic]], ranging from ca. 300 to 350&amp;nbsp;nm depending in the polarity of the local environment &lt;ref&gt;[http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C08/C08Links/pps99.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/projects/gmocz/fluor.htm Intrinsic Fluorescence of Proteins and Peptides]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, protein fluorescence may be used as a diagnostic of the conformational state of a protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11325713&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vivian JT, Callis PR | title = Mechanisms of tryptophan fluorescence shifts in proteins | journal = Biophys. J. | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 2093–109 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11325713 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76183-8| url = http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/5/2093 | pmc = 1301402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence is strongly influenced by the proximity of other residues (''i.e.'', nearby ''protonated'' groups such as Asp or Glu can cause [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] of Trp fluorescence). Also, energy transfer between tryptophan and the other fluorescent amino acids is possible, which would affect the analysis, especially in cases where the Förster acidic approach is taken.  In addition, tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid; many proteins contain only one or a few tryptophan residues.  Therefore, tryptophan fluorescence can be a very sensitive measurement of the conformational state of individual tryptophan residues. The advantage compared to extrinsic probes is that the protein itself is not changed. The use of intrinsic fluorescence for the study of protein conformation is in practice limited to cases with few (or perhaps only one) tryptophan residues, since each experiences a different local environment, which gives rise to different emission spectra.

[[Tryptophan]] is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of microenvironment of the tryptophan. When performing experiments with denaturants, [[surfactant]]s or other [[amphiphilic]] molecules, the microenvironment of the tryptophan might change. For example, if a protein containing a single tryptophan in its 'hydrophobic' core is denatured with increasing temperature, a red-shift emission spectrum will appear. This is due to the exposure of the tryptophan to an aqueous environment as opposed to a hydrophobic protein interior. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to a protein which contains a tryptophan which is exposed to the aqueous solvent will cause a blue shifted emission spectrum if the tryptophan is embedded in the surfactant [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] or [[micelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Caputo GA, London E. ''Cumulative effects of amino acid substitutions and hydrophobic mismatch upon the transmembrane stability and conformation of hydrophobic alpha-helices.''
Biochemistry. 2003 Mar 25;42(11):3275-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins that lack tryptophan may be coupled to a [[fluorophore]].

At 295&amp;nbsp;nm, the tryptophan emission spectrum is dominant over the weaker [[tyrosine]] and [[phenylalanine]] fluorescence.

==Applications==

Fluorescence spectrocopy is used in, among others, biochemical, medical, and chemical research fields for analyzing [[organic compound]]s. There has also been a report of its use in differentiating malignant, bashful skin tumors from benign.

Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) techniques are useful in other kinds of analysis/measurement of a compound present in air or water, or other media, such as [[CVAFS]] which is used for heavy metals detection, such as mercury.

Fluorescence can also be used to redirect photons, see [[fluorescent solar collector]].

[[Image:Fluorescent minerals hg.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fluorescent minerals emitting visible light when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light]]

'''Fluorescence''' is the emission of electromagnetic radiation [[light]] by a substance that has absorbed radiation of a different [[wavelength]]. In most cases, absorption of light of a certain wavelength induces the emission of light with a longer wavelength (and lower energy).  However, under conditions in which intense radiation is being absorbed, it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons ([[Two-photon absorption|multiple photon absorption]]), which can lead to the emission of radiation having a smaller wavelength than the excitation source. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is due to thermal losses.  Dissipation of vibrational energy occurs on a much greater time scale than fluorescent emission. The most striking examples of this phenomenon occur when the absorbed photon is in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the spectrum, and is thus invisible, and the emitted light is in the visible region.  Practical applications of this effect are found in [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], chemical sensors, [[fluorescent labelling]], [[dyes]], biological detectors etc. 

The term 'fluorescence' was coined by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in his 1852 paper;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Change of Refrangibility of Light  |author=Stokes, G. G. |year=1852 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=142 |pages=463–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the name was suggested &quot;to denote the general appearance of a solution of sulphate of quinine and similar media&quot;. (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1853 143, 385-396, quote from page 387). The name itself was derived from the mineral [[fluorite]] (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to provide a blue fluorescent emission.  The fluorite which provoked the observation originally, and which remains one of the most outstanding examples of the phenomenon, originated from the Weardale region, of northern England.

==Equations==
===Photochemistry===
Fluorescence occurs when an orbital [[electron]] of a molecule, atom or [[nanostructure]] relaxes to its [[ground state]] by emitting a [[photon]] of light after being excited to a higher quantum state by some type of energy:

Excitation: &lt;math&gt; S_0 + h \nu_{ex} \to S_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Fluorescence (emission): &lt;math&gt; S_1 \to S_0 + h \nu_{em} + heat &lt;/math&gt;
 
here &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a generic term for photon energy with h = [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = [[frequency]] of light. (The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted light are dependent on the particular system.)

State S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ground state of the [[fluorophore]] (fluorescent molecule) and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is its first (electronically) excited state.

A molecule in its excited state, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo 'non-radiative relaxation' in which the excitation energy is dissipated as heat (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a [[triplet state]] which may subsequently relax via [[phosphorescence]] or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.

Relaxation of an S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.

Molecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process (e.g. as the product of a reaction) can transfer energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce. This process is used in [[lightstick]]s to produce different colors.

===Quantum yield===
The fluorescence [[quantum yield]] gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.

: &lt;math&gt; \Phi = \frac {\textrm{Number\ of\ photons\ emitted}} {\textrm{Number\ of\ photons\ absorbed}} &lt;/math&gt;

The maximum fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); every [[photon]] absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence, is by the rates excited state decay:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{ { k}_{ f} }{ \sum_{i}{ k}_{i } } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{ k}_{ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of [[spontaneous emission]] of radiation and 

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i}{ k}_{i } &lt;/math&gt; 

is the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are therefore often called &quot;non-radiative rates&quot;, which can include:
dynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or [[resonance energy transfer]]), internal conversion and [[intersystem crossing]]. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, this will affect both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield.

Fluorescence quantum yield are measured by comparison to a standard with known quantology; the [[quinine]] salt, quinine sulfate, in a sulfuric acid solution is a common fluorescence standard.

===Lifetime===
The fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows first-order kinetics:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[S 1 \right] = \left[S 1 \right]_0 e^{-\Gamma t} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left[S 1 \right]&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of excited state molecules at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left[S 1 \right]_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of [[exponential decay]]. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{tot}=\Gamma_{rad} + \Gamma_{nrad} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the total decay rate, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{rad}&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{nrad}&lt;/math&gt; the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds typical excited state decay times for fluorescent compounds that emit photons with energies from the [[UV]] to [[near infrared]] are within the range of 0.5 to 20 [[nanoseconds]]. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]].

==Rules==
There are several [[rule of thumb|rules]] that deal with fluorescence. The [[Kasha's rule|Kasha–Vavilov rule]] dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.

This is not always true and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.

The ''[[Jablonski diagram]]'' describes most of the relaxation mechanism for excited state molecules.

==Applications==
There are many natural and synthetic compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications.  Some deep-sea animals, such as the [[Greeneye]], use fluorescence.

===Lighting===
{{details|Fluorescent_light}}
[[Image:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|250px|Fluorescent paint and plastic lit by UV tubes. Artwork by Beo Beyond]]
The common [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]] relies on fluorescence. Inside the [[glass]] tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the ''[[phosphor]]'', which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent [[lighting]] is very energy-efficient compared to [[incandescent]] technology, but the uneven [[spectrum]] of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colours to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent or day light.  The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254&amp;nbsp;nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436&amp;nbsp;nm (blue), 546&amp;nbsp;nm (green) and 579&amp;nbsp;nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes.  These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many [[compact fluorescent lamp]] and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.

[[Fluorescent lights]] were first available to the public at the [[1939 World's Fair]], and improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes such as [[compact fluorescent lamps]].  Some [[High-intensity_discharge_lamp#High-intensity_discharge_lamps|HID lamps]] coupled their even greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.  White [[light-emitting diode]]s became available in the mid 1990s as [[LED lamp]]s, in which blue light emitted from the [[semiconductor]] strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.

[[Lightstick|Glow sticks]] sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] reaction and emit light of a different color.

===Analytical chemistry===
Many analytical procedures involve the use of a [[fluorometer]], usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength.  Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.

Fluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an [[Chromatography detector|array detector]], to detect compounds from [[HPLC]] flow. Also, [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]] plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. There is then a higher probability of lower energy atoms being excited and releasing photons, making analysis more efficient.

===Equipment===
{{main|Fluorescence spectroscopy}}
Usually the setup of a Fluorescence assay involves a Light source, which may emit an array different wavelengths of light.  Generally, a single wavelegth is required for proper analysis, so in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell.  After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may
emerge due to [[Stokes shift]] and various [[electron transitions]].  To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an Emission [[monochromator]], and observed selectively by a detector &lt;ref&gt;Harris, D. C. et al, Exploring Chemical Analysis 4th ed., New York, NY (c)2009 by W.H. Freeman and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biochemistry and medicine===

{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Endothelial cells under the microscope with three separate channels marking specific cellular components]]
Fluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or [[autofluorescence]]). In fact, a [[protein]] or other component can be &quot;labelled&quot; with a extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] which can be a small molecule, protein or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lakowicz, J.R., Principles of fluorescence spectroscopy. 3rd ed. 2006, New York: Springer. xxvi, 954 p.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/References/Molecular-Probes-The-Handbook/Introduction-to-Fluorescence-Techniques.html Invitrogen.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The quantification of a dye is done with a [[Spectrofluorometer]] and finds additional applications in:
* when scanning the fluorescent intensity across a plane one has [[fluorescence microscope|Fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells or subcellular structures which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labeling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image (multiple channels). DNA microarrays are a variant of this.
* Automated sequencing of [[DNA]] by the [[chain termination method]]; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labeled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.
. Ethidium bromide fluoresces orange when [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalating]] [[DNA]] and when exposed to [[UV light]].
* FACS ([[fluorescent-activated cell sorting]]) 
* DNA detection: the compound [[ethidium bromide]], when free to change its conformation in solution, has very little fluorescence. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced when it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]]. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic - an arguably safer alternative is the dye [[SYBR Green]].
* Immunology: An antibody has a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.
Additionally [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] used to study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while fluorescent lifetime can give an additional layer of information.

===Gemology, mineralogy, geology, and forensics===
[[Fingerprint]]s can be visualized with fluorescent compounds such as [[ninhydrin]].  Blood and other substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, particularly where their location was not previously known.

[[Gemstone]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[fiber]]s, and many other materials which may be encountered in [[Forensic science|forensics]] or with a relationship to various [[collectible]]s may have a distinctive fluorescence or may fluoresce differently under short-wave ultraviolet, long-wave ultra violet, or [[X-ray]]s.

Many types of [[calcite]] and [http://www.ambarazul.com/newsletter/april06 amber] will fluoresce under shortwave UV. [[Ruby|Rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and the [[Hope Diamond]] exhibit red fluorescence under short-wave UV light; diamonds also emit light under [[X ray]] radiation.

Fluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators.  In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission.  Furthermore, certain impurities such as iron or copper need to be absent, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent [[manganese]], in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of [[calcite]], the green fluorescence of [[willemite]], the yellow fluorescence of [[esperite]], and the orange fluorescence of [[wollastonite]] and [[clinohedrite]]. [[Hexavalent uranium]], in the form of the [[uranyl cation]], fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as [[autunite]] or [[andersonite]], and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of [[hyalite opal]].  [[Trivalent chromium]] at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of [[ruby corundum]].  Divalent [[europium]] is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral [[fluorite]]. [[Trivalent lanthanoids]] such as [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of [[zircon]]. [[Powellite]] ([[calcium molybdate]]) and [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively.  When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher energy [[tungsten]] to the lower energy [[molybdenum]], such that fairly low levels of [[molybdenum]] are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for [[scheelite]], instead of blue.  Low-iron [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.

Crude oil ([[petroleum]]) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright yellowish and bluish white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in [[oil exploration]] drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.

===Organic liquids===
Organic liquids such as mixtures of [[anthracene]] in [[benzene]], [[toluene]], or [[stilbene]] in the same [[solvent]]s, fluoresce with [[ultraviolet]] or [[gamma ray]] [[irradiation]]. The decay times of this fluorescence is of the order of nanoseconds since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter aims to give you the skills to complete your A2 Computing project. Unlike the rest of the course this unit is entirely based on coursework submitted in May.  This is great because if you work hard enough then you can make sure you get some really good marks, you have access to the mark scheme after all![[Image:Waterfall_model.svg|thumb|The classic waterfall model]]
Your project involves making a '''complex programming project''' that will likely involve '''data processing''', and then writing a report about it.  You have to make a program for a '''real user''', this is very important, you can't just make them up.  It doesn't have to be incredibly complicated, but you need a degree of complexity in order to write a good report.  You can write a computer game but they can be an awful lot of work (2-3 years with a team of 40+ people for the latest console games) and it's often difficult to find a real life user and a real need.

Over the course of the project you will be creating a report.  This is really important and lots of people spend so much time coding that they forget to complete the write up.  The '''write up is worth nearly 70% of the mark''' and will take you through a [[w:Waterfall model|waterfall model]] of system development.  There are many [[w:Agile_software_development|other]] forms of system development out there and you might find yourself completing sections of the course not necessarily in the order given, the important thing is that you make it a cohesive whole and '''complete everything'''.

Please use the links below to get you started and note where all the marks are awarded, you might create a brilliant bit of code but if you don't complete your writeup your grade will suffer.

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Picking a project}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

So now is time to start thinking about what sort of project you are going to make.  This is an important decision as this will drive the rest of this coursework.

Projects that I've marked in the past have included:
*Cricket Player Management System based on a database that keeps track of matches and player scores
*Database of children at a day care centre that deals with the billing for parents
*A computer room booking database that allowed teachers to book rooms for different days and see other teacher's timetables graphically
*A stock control database for a hardware shop that handles re-orders and sales
*A web-based maths revision site that allowed for random papers to be created then automatically marked
*An A-Level Maths revision maze game
*A French revision side scrolling adventure
*Physics projectile modeling tool
*A snake game where it asked you to eat the correct answers to maths questions
*A helicopter flying game that asked you economics questions to get extra fuel
*A computing revision program wrapped around a tetris clone
*A chess game that enforces all the rules of the game and recognises when it's check mate
*Phone based revision game for mathematics

You have probably noticed that there is a lot of talk about databases and data manipulation.  An easy way to tackle this project is to build a data processing system, i.e. a stock control system or a revision game, with a database in the back-end to store data.  This is a strong sort of project and a way to getting top marks. However, you don't have to do something like this.  If your code is complex enough then you don't have to store any data and the parts of the write up that talk about databases, you can skip. You might not be encouraged to make games, but if it is a game with a database or revision system behind it, or showing clever simulations of A-Level standard mathematics then you need to talk to your Computing teacher.

== What is Data Processing ==
[[Image:IBM Electronic Data Processing Machine - GPN-2000-001881.jpg|thumb|150px|Data processing will require a database or other datastore]]
Every system you make must involve data processing.  This means taking data and adding, updating, deleting, interpreting and displaying it.  This is very easy with a database, but you must get beyond the defaults of add, edit, delete, that something like Access gives you.  Think about using complex queries and fancy ways to present your results. It could also be an XML file storing seating plans or student records, editing/deleting/adding questions to a revision game and recording the scores of different users.  Whatever you do you must have data processing at the heart of it.

Using a form of SQL (e.g MySQL) or similar (e.g MariaDB) is a good choice over Access because it easily integrates with a lot of programming languages. Also SQL is on the COMP3 syllabus so you will need basic SQL knowledge anyway.

== How to pick a Complex problem ==
To get top marks the system has to be complex but what does that mean?  There are a few things that you need to do and a few more things you need to do to stand a chance to get top marks.  AQA's marks scheme says, to get in the top band for complexity, you need at least one of the following:
* Non trivial algorithms, e.g Graph traversal or recursion.
* Use of sophisticated features of your chosen programming language, e.g runtime created objects, sophisticated data structures, user defined classes
* Time-based simulation
* Use of network protocols (e.g TCP/IP)
* Development for mobile devices
* Complexity in the non-computing side of the problem (e.g using complex maths, if its something in your A-level maths its complex enough)
* Image processing or pattern recognition (e.g using regex Note: regex is in the COMP3 syllabus, so you'll be learning it anyway).

If you can use more than one of these, you'll guarantee yourself these marks. Also having more will give you more to write about in your later sections. However, don't be too ambitious because you don't want to spend all your time on the coding or not finish the program. 

If you're using a database it can be harder to tell if your project is going to be complex. AQA has a document on this, but in short your database will need to be fully normalised and high volumes of data will get you more marks. If you can, try to implement one of the points above and you will get the marks. 
{{ExerciseRobox|title=Warning!}}
Never create something in Access alone, you need to show real coding.  Even if Access would be a simpler solution this will not allow you to get marks for a complex project.  Always check with your teacher about complexity
{{Robox/Close}}

== Finding a Problem and a User ==
You probably have a few ideas running through your head already but you now need to find a user.  Users aren't necessarily going to find you so if you are a member of a local sports club, church, drama society etc. try and think how a data processing system could help them out.  For example, you could keep track of the members of a choir, which sessions they attended and whether they have paid their subscription.  If you know someone who runs a small business could you write a system to keep track of when staff were on duty, how much stock they have, how many sales they make? Is there an area in your school / college that could be improved?  Ask your teachers, maybe they still need to write reports manually, maybe they would want a revision tool for their subject, maybe they would like web based system to book out rooms, maybe they want a program writing that could simulate projectile motion to demonstrate something in class.  Once you have found your user keep hold of them, they are going to be key to you completing every part of this project.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If you're having trouble finding a user, try asking some of your teachers at school. If you want to do a simulation, your maths or physics teachers may be helpful.

==Workable projects?==
Do the following sound complex enough?  If not, how would you make them complex?  Remember to check with your teacher about complexity.
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A database of shop sales that allows people to update stock and add new stock items. &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Probably not complex enough!  If this is built around an Access Created database with wizards used to make all the forms and run the update queries it definitely won't be.  You might get away with it by building it in mySQL with a web front end, but you should still be looking to include some of the more complex topics such as displaying graphs and statistical data on sales.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| An online revision site allowing students to log in and sit randomly made maths tests &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds reasonably complex, if you were planning on scripting the whole thing yourself in ASPX or PHP and not using a package such as Wordpress.  You might want to throw in some nice features such as a messaging and mailing system.  You might also want to get the program to create dynamic visual displays of the random questions being asked, such as creating triangles of the dimensions being tested.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A 2D F1 racing game &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds very complex, especially if you try and think about collision detection, AI etc.  However, who is your user?  You need a real life user, could you ask you Physics teacher to come up with a scenario to simulate?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A Four in a Row game &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds very complex with the graphical representation and AI element, but again, who is your user?  Could you make this for a primary school?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| 3D shooter &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Too complex, unless you want to write some code around something like Blender or the Unreal Engine.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A photo album database &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not complex enough as it is currently written.  You could certainly add features like placing it online and allowing for tagging of photos.  Make sure you check with your teacher.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

== How will you solve the problem? ==
Once you have a user and a problem how are you going to solve it?  You aren't a multibillion pound IT firm and you probably don't have much more than a years programming experience.  You have got to be realistic about how you are going to solve this problem.  Here are a couple of questions you need to start thinking about, write down your answers

*What languages do you already know? What languages and skills do you need to learn?
*Is it going to be web, phone or desktop application based?
*Will you use a relational database or flat file data structure, or nothing at all?
*Do you know how to normalise data tables or read from text/XML files?
*Do you have enough time to do what you want to?
*Is it complex enough to get you top marks?

== Next Steps ==

Write all of this down somewhere, it's going to come in useful for your [[../Analysis/]]!

Fluorine-19 NMR (for nuclear magnetic resonance) is an analytical technique. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F has a spin of 1/2, and a relative abundance of 100 %, making measurements very fast (comparable with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR). Integrals are reliable due to the lack of a nuclear Overhauser effect (fluorine forms one bond only). Fluorine-containing compounds are occasionally encountered in organic chemistry (fluorinated compounds are popular in pharmaceutical applications), and in inorganic chemistry (e.g. the trifluoroacetate anion or counter-ligand).

The reference compound for &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F is CFCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Hebrew University | author = Roy Hoffman | year = 2007 | title = &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Fluorine NMR | url = http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/row2/f.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorogenic refers to a process in which fluorescence is generated.  The term is generally used in the context of analytical assays, where a chemical reaction dependent on the presence of a particular analyte produces fluorescent molecules.  By using a spectrophotometer, the amount of fluorescence (and indirectly, the amount of analyte) can be quantitated.  Fluorogenic methods are typically several orders of magnitude more sensitive than the older chromogenic methods.  Chromogenic is the term for the generation of color, rather than fluorescence.

'''Förster resonance energy transfer''' (abbreviated '''FRET'''), also known as '''fluorescence resonance energy transfer''', '''resonance energy transfer''' ('''RET''') or '''electronic energy transfer''' ('''EET'''), is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two [[chromophore]]s.

A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore (in proximity, typically less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm) through nonradiative [[dipole]]–dipole coupling. This mechanism is termed &quot;Förster resonance energy transfer&quot; and is named after the German scientist [[Theodor Förster]].&lt;ref&gt;Förster T., Zwischenmolekulare Energiewanderung und Fluoreszenz, ''Ann. Physik'' '''1948''', ''437'', 55. {{DOI|10.1002/andp.19484370105}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot; is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph R. Lakowicz, &quot;Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy&quot;, Plenum Publishing Corporation, 2nd edition (July 1, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html FRET microscopy tutorial from Olympus]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores) is always a nonradiative transfer of energy, the name &quot;Förster resonance energy transfer&quot; is preferred to &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot; – although the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature. FRET is analogous to [[Near Field Communication|near field communication]], in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the [[Light|wavelength]] of light emitted. In the [[near field]] region, the excited chromophore emits a virtual [[photon]] that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a ''radiationless'' mechanism. From [[quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamical]] calculations, it is determined that radiationless (FRET) and [[radiative transfer|radiative energy transfer]] are the short- and long-range [[asymptote]]s of a single unified mechanism.&lt;ref&gt; D. L. Andrews, &quot;A unified theory of radiative and radiationless molecular energy transfer&quot;, ''Chem. Phys.'' '''1989''', 135, 195-201. {{DOI|10.1016/0301-0104(89)87019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Andrews and D. S. Bradshaw, &quot;Virtual photons, dipole fields and energy transfer: A quantum electrodynamical approach&quot;, ''[[European Journal of Physics|Eur. J. Phys.]]'' '''2004''', 25, 845-858. {{DOI|10.1088/0143-0807/25/6/017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
The FRET efficiency (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[quantum yield]] of the energy transfer transition, ''i.e.'' the fraction of energy transfer event occurring per donor excitation event:

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k_{ET}}{k_f+k_{ET}+\sum{k_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_{ET}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of energy transfer, &lt;math&gt;k_{f}&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate and the &lt;math&gt;k_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the rate constants of any other de-excitation pathway.

The FRET efficiency depends on many parameters that can be grouped as follows:
* The distance between the donor and the acceptor
* The spectral overlap of the donor [[emission spectrum]] and the acceptor [[absorption spectrum]].
* The relative orientation of the donor emission dipole moment and the acceptor absorption dipole moment.

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; depends on the donor-to-acceptor separation distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with an inverse 6th power law due to the dipole-dipole coupling mechanism:
: &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{1+(r/R_0)^6}\!&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; being the Förster distance of this pair of donor and acceptor, i.e. the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%.
The Förster distance depends on the overlap [[integral]] of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum and their mutual molecular orientation as expressed by the following equation:
: &lt;math&gt; {R_0}^6 = \frac{9\,Q_0 \,(\ln 10) \kappa^2 \, J}{128 \, \pi^5 \,n^4 \, N_A} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the fluorescence [[quantum yield]] of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole orientation factor, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium, &lt;math&gt;N_A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]], and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral overlap integral calculated as
: &lt;math&gt; J = \int f_{\rm D}(\lambda) \, \epsilon_{\rm A}(\lambda) \, \lambda^4 \, d\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized donor emission spectrum, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceptor [[molar extinction coefficient]].
''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =2/3 is often assumed. This value is obtained when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to be isotropically oriented during the excited state lifetime. If either dye is fixed or not free to rotate, then ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =2/3 will not be a valid assumption. In most cases, however, even modest reorientation of the dyes results in enough orientational averaging that ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2/3 does not result in a large error in the estimated energy transfer distance due to the sixth power dependence of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Even when ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is quite different from 2/3 the error can be associated with a shift in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and thus determinations of changes in relative distance for a particular system are still valid. Fluorescent proteins do not reorient on a timescale that is faster than their fluorescence lifetime. In this case 0 ≤ ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 4.

The FRET efficiency relates to the quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as follows:
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {\tau'_{\rm D}}/{\tau_{\rm D}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau'_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of an acceptor, respectively, or as
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {F'_{\rm D}}/{F_{\rm D}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F'_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor, respectively.

==Methods==
[[File:FRET.PNG|frame|right|Example of FRET between CFP and YFP (Wavelength vs. Absorption): a [[Genetic engineering|fusion protein]] containing CFP and YFP excited at 440nm wavelength. The fluorescent emission peak of CFP overlaps the excitation peak of YFP. Because the two proteins are adjacent to each other, the energy transfer is significant–a large proportion of the energy from CFP is transferred to YFP and creates a much larger YFP emission peak. ]]
In fluorescence [[microscopy]], fluorescence [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]], as well as in [[molecular biology]], FRET is a useful tool to quantify molecular dynamics in [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], such as [[protein]]-protein interactions, protein-[[DNA]] interactions, and protein conformational changes. For monitoring the complex formation between two molecules, one of them is labeled with a donor and the other with an acceptor, and these [[fluorophore]]-labeled molecules are mixed. When they are dissociated, the donor emission is detected upon the donor excitation. On the other hand, when the donor and acceptor are in proximity (1-10&amp;nbsp;nm) due to the interaction of the two molecules, the acceptor emission is predominantly observed because of the [[intermolecular]] FRET from the donor to the acceptor. For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the donor and acceptor, FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on [[ligand]] binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.

FRET studies are scalable: the extent of energy transfer is often quantified from the milliliter scale of cuvette-based experiments to the femtoliter scale of microscopy-based experiments. This quantification can be based directly (sensitized emission method) on detecting two emission channels under two different excitation conditions (primarily donor and primarily acceptor). However, for robustness reasons, FRET quantification is most often based on measuring changes in fluorescence intensity or fluorescence lifetime upon changing the experimental conditions (e.g. a microscope image of donor emission is taken with the acceptor being present. The acceptor is then bleached, such that it is incapable of accepting energy transfer and another donor emission image is acquired. A pixel-based quantification using the second equation in the theory section above is then possible.) An alternative way of temporarily deactivating the acceptor is based on its fluorescence saturation.
Exploiting polarisation characteristics of light, a FRET quantification is also possible with only a single camera exposure.

===CFP-YFP pairs===
The most popular FRET pair for biological use is a [[cyan fluorescent protein]] ('''CFP''') - [[yellow fluorescent protein]] ('''YFP''') pair. Both are color variants of [[green fluorescent protein]] ('''GFP'''). While labeling with organic fluorescent dyes requires troublesome processes of purification, chemical modification, and intracellular injection of a host protein, GFP variants can be easily attached to a host protein by [[genetic engineering]]. By virtue of GFP variants, the use of FRET techniques for biological research is becoming more and more popular.

===BRET===
A limitation of FRET is the requirement for external illumination to initiate the fluorescence transfer, which can lead to background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to [[photobleaching]]. To avoid this drawback, [[Bioluminescence]] Resonance Energy Transfer (or '''BRET''') has been developed. This technique uses a bioluminescent [[luciferase]] (typically the luciferase from ''[[Renilla reniformis]]'') rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP.

FRET and BRET are also the common tools in the study of [[Kinetics|biochemical reaction kinetics]] and [[molecular motors]].

===Photobleaching FRET===
FRET efficiencies can also be inferred from the [[photobleaching]] rates of the donor in the presence and absence of an acceptor. This method can be performed on most fluorescence microscopes; one simply shines the excitation light (of a frequency that will excite the donor but not the acceptor significantly) on specimens with and without the acceptor fluorophore and monitors the donor fluorescence (typically separated from acceptor fluorescence using a bandpass filter) over time. The timescale is that of photobleaching, which is seconds to minutes, with fluorescence in each curve being given by

&lt;math&gt;(\mbox{background})+(\mbox{constant})*e^{-(\mbox{time})/{\tau_{\rm pb}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\tau_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; is the photobleaching decay time constant and depends on whether the acceptor is present or not. Since photobleaching consists in the permanent inactivation of excited fluorophores, resonance energy transfer from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore prevents the photobleaching of that donor fluorophore, and thus high FRET efficiency leads to a longer photobleaching decay time constant:

&lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {\tau_{\rm pb}}/{\tau'_{\rm pb}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\tau'_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\tau_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; are the photobleaching decay time constants of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the acceptor, respectively.
(Notice that the fraction is the reciprocal of that used for lifetime measurements).

This technique was introduced by Jovin in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Jovin, T.M. and Arndt-Jovin, D.J. FRET microscopy: Digital imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Application in cell biology. In Cell Structure and Function by Microspectrofluometry, E. Kohen, J. G. Hirschberg and J. S. Ploem. London: Academic Press, 1989. pp. 99-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Its use of an entire curve of points to extract the time constants can give it accuracy advantages over the other methods. Also, the fact that time measurements are over seconds rather than nanoseconds makes it easier than fluorescence lifetime measurements, and because photobleaching decay rates do not generally depend on donor concentration (unless acceptor saturation is an issue), the careful control of concentrations needed for intensity measurements is not needed. It is, however, important to keep the illumination the same for the with- and without-acceptor measurements, as photobleaching increases markedly with more intense incident light.

===Other methods===
A different, but related, mechanism is [[Dexter Electron Transfer]].

An alternative method to detecting protein-protein proximity is the [[bimolecular fluorescence complementation]] (BiFC) where two halves of a YFP are fused to a protein. When these two halves meet they form a fluorophore after about 60 s - 1 hr.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11983170&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hu CD, Chinenov Y, Kerppola TK |title=Visualization of interactions among bZIP and Rel family proteins in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation |journal=Mol. Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=789–98 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11983170 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
FRET has been applied in an experimental method for the detection of [[phosgene]]. In it, phosgene or rather [[triphosgene]] as a safe substitute serves as a linker between an acceptor and a donor [[coumarine]] (forming [[urea]] groups).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17356768&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang H, Rudkevich DM |title=A FRET approach to phosgene detection |journal=Chem.

'''Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry''', also known as '''Fourier transform mass spectrometry''', is a type of mass analyzer (or [[mass spectrometer]]) for determining the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] (m/z) of [[ions]] based on the [[ion cyclotron resonance|cyclotron frequency]] of the ions in a fixed magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9768511 Marshall, A. G.; Hendrickson, C. L.; Jackson, G. S., Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry: a primer. ''Mass Spectrom Rev'' '''17''', 1-35.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ions are trapped in a [[Penning trap]] (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates) where they are excited to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field. The excitation also results in the ions moving in phase (in a packet). The signal is detected as an image current on a pair of plates which the packet of ions passes close to as they cyclotron. The resulting signal is called a [[free induction decay]] (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of [[sine waves]]. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a [[Fourier transform]] to give a [[mass spectrum]]. 

Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a very high resolution technique in that masses can be determined with very high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the [[mass defect]] of the elements. FT-ICR MS is able to achieve higher levels of resolution than other forms of mass spectrometry, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than rf voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(99)00226-2 | title = Comparison and interconversion of the two most common frequency-to-mass calibration functions for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry | year = 2000 | last1 = Shi | first1 = S | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 195-196 | pages = 591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions of similar mass to charge (''m/z'') to be detected as distinct ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15694769&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sleno L, Volmer DA, Marshall AG |title=Assigning product ions from complex MS/MS spectra: the importance of mass uncertainty and resolving power |journal=[[J.

Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the ''m/z'' axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful.

FTICR-MS differs significantly from other [[mass spectrometry]] techniques in that the ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an [[electron multiplier]] but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the cyclotron (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with [[sector instrument]]s or at different times as with [[time-of-flight]] instruments but all ions are detected simultaneously over some given period of time.  In FT-ICR MS, resolution can be improved by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) and by increasing the magnet's bore diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(01)00588-7 | title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance detection: principles and experimental configurations | year = 2002 | last1 = Marshall | first1 = A | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 215 | pages = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FT-ICR was invented by [[Alan G. Marshall]] and Melvin B. Comisarow&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ubc.ca/personnel/faculty/comisarow/ |title=UBC Chemistry Personnel: Melvin B. Comisarow |accessdate=2009-11-05 |publisher=University of British Columbia }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of British Columbia]]. The first paper appeared in [[Chemical Physics Letters]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2 M.B. Comisarow and A.G. Marshall, ''Chem. Phys. Lett.'' '''25''', 282 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy. Marshall has continued to develop the technique at [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] and [[Florida State University]].

==Theory==
[[Image:LTQ-FTICR.jpg|thumb|250px|Linear ion trap - Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (panels around magnet are missing).]]
The physics of FTICR is similar to that of a [[cyclotron]] at least in the first approximation.

In the simplest form (idealized) the relationship between the cyclotron frequency and the mass to charge ratio is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' = cyclotron frequency, ''q'' = ion charge, ''B'' = [[magnetic field strength]] and ''m'' = ion mass.

This is more often represented in [[angular frequency]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _c = \frac{qB}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega _c&lt;/math&gt; is the angular cyclotron frequency which is related to frequency by the definition &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the quadrupolar electrical field used to trap the ions in the axial direction this relationship is only approximate. The axial electrical trapping results in axial oscillations within the trap with the (angular) frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _t = \sqrt{{\frac{q\alpha}{m}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant similar to the spring constant of a [[harmonic oscillator]] and is dependent on voltage and the trap dimensions and geometry.

The electric field and the resulting axial harmonic motion reduces the cyclotron frequency and introduces a second radial motion called magnetron motion that occurs at the magnetron frequency. The cyclotron motion is still the frequency being used but the relationship above is not exact due to this phenomenon. The natural angular frequencies of motion are:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _\pm = \frac{\omega _c}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left({\frac{\omega _c}{2}}\right)^2-\left({\frac{\omega _t}{2}}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- One of the superscript &quot;2&quot;s is inside the parentheses and the other is outside.  Is that right?  OK, now I've changed it. --&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega _t&lt;/math&gt; is the axial trapping frequency due the axial electrical trapping and &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced cyclotron (angular) frequency and &lt;math&gt;\omega _-&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetron (angular) frequency. Again &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is what is typically measured in FTICR. The meaning of this equation can be understood qualitatively by considering the case where  &lt;math&gt;\omega _t&lt;/math&gt; is small, which is generally true. In that case the value of the radical is just slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c/2&lt;/math&gt; and the value of &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is just slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt; (the cyclotron frequency has been slightly reduced). For &lt;math&gt;\omega_-&lt;/math&gt; the value of the radical is the same (slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c/2&lt;/math&gt;) but it is being subtracted from &lt;math&gt;\omega _c/2&lt;/math&gt; resulting in a small number equal to &lt;math&gt;\omega _c -\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the exact amount that the cyclotron frequency was reduced by).

==ICR cell types==
[[Image:ICR Cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A cylindrical ICR cell. The walls of the cell are made of copper, and ions enter the cell from the right, transmitted by the octopole ion guides.]]
A review of different cell geometries with their specific electric configurations is available in the literature &lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1176(95)04190-V S. Guan, A. G. Marshall, Int. J. Mass Spectrom., 146/147 (1995) 261]&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, ICR cells can belong to one of the following two categories.


===Closed cells===

Several closed ICR cells with different geometries were fabricated and their performance has been characterized. Grids were used as end caps to apply an axial electric field for trapping ions axially (parallel to the magnetic field lines). Ions can be either generated inside the cell (by Electron impact ionization) or can be enjected to the cell from an external ionization source (such as Electrospray or MALDI). Nested ICR cells with double pair of grids were also fabricated to trap both positive and negative ions simultaneously.

===Open cells===
The most common geometry is a cylinder, which is axially segmented into different parts to produce different ring electrodes. The central ring electrode is generally used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2751100 | title = Characterization of a new open cylindrical ion cyclotron resonance cell with unusual geometry | year = 2007 | last1 = Kanawati | first1 = B. | first2 = K. P. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 78 | pages = 074102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion-ion collision studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ijms.2007.09.007 | title = Characterization of a new open cylindrical ICR cell for ion–ion collision studies☆ | year = 2008 | last1 = Kanawati | first1 = B | first2 = K | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 269 | pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stored waveform inverse Fourier transform ==
Stored waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) is a method for the creation of excitation waveforms for FTMS.&lt;ref name=Cody1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cody | first =  R. B. | year = 1987 | title = Stored waveform inverse fourier transform excitation for obtaining increased parent ion selectivity in collisionally activated dissociation: Preliminary results | journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]] | volume = 1 | pages = 99 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290010607 | first2 = R. E. | first3 = S. D. | first4 = Alan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from  the inverse Fourier transform of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of selected ions. The SWIFT procedure can be used to select ions for [[tandem mass spectrometry]] experiments.

[[Image:Spectrum of blue sky.png|thumb|right|320px|Spectrum of a blue sky somewhat close to the horizon pointing east at around 3 or 4 pm on a clear day.]]

In [[physics]] and [[optics]], the '''Fraunhofer lines''' are a set of [[spectral line]]s named for the German physicist [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] (1787–1826). The lines were originally observed as dark features ([[absorption line]]s) in the [[optical spectrum]] of the [[Sun]].

The English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] was in 1802 the first person to note the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum. In 1814, Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began a systematic study and careful measurement of the [[wavelength]] of these features. In all, he mapped over 570 lines, and designated the principal features with the letters A through K, and weaker lines with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was later discovered by [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] that each [[chemical element]] was associated with a set of spectral lines, and deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were caused by [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] by those elements in the upper layers of the Sun. Some of the observed features are also caused by absorption in [[oxygen]] molecules in the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

The major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements they are associated with, are shown in the following table:

The Fraunhofer C, F, G', and h lines correspond to the alpha, beta, gamma and delta lines of the [[Balmer series]] of [[emission line]]s of the hydrogen atom. The D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines form the well-known &quot;sodium doublet&quot;, the centre wavelength of which (589.29&amp;nbsp;nm) is given the designation letter &quot;D&quot;. This historical designation for this line has stuck and is given to the all the transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of the other alkali atoms as well.  The D1 and D2 lines correspond to the fine splitting of the excited stated.  This may be confusing because the excited state for this transition is the P-state of the alkali and should not be confused with the higher D-states.

Note that there is disagreement in the literature for some line designations; e.g., the Fraunhofer d-line may refer to the [[cyan]] iron line at 466.814&amp;nbsp;nm, or alternatively to the [[yellow]] helium line (also labeled D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 587.5618&amp;nbsp;nm. Similarly, there is ambiguity with reference to the e-line, since it can refer to the spectral lines of both iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg). In order to resolve ambiguities that arise in usage, ambiguous Fraunhofer line designations are preceded by the element with which they are associated (e.g., Mercury e-line and Helium d-line).

Because of their well defined wavelengths, Fraunhofer lines are often used to characterize the [[refractive index]] and [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of optical materials.

In [[Nuclear magnetic resonance#Fourier spectroscopy|Fourier Transform NMR]], a '''free induction decay''' (FID) is the observable NMR signal generated by non-equilibrium nuclear spin magnetisation [[Larmor precession|precessing]] about the [[magnetic field]] (conventionally along z).
This non-equilibrium magnetisation is generally created by applying a pulse of [[Resonance|resonant]] radio-frequency close to the [[Larmor equation|Larmor frequency]] of the [[nuclear spin]]s.

If the magnetisation [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] has a non-zero component in the xy plane, then the precessing magnetisation will [[Electromagnetic induction|induce]] a corresponding oscillating voltage in a detection coil surrounding the sample.  This time-domain signal is typically [[Digitized|digitised]] and then [[Fourier Transform|Fourier transformed]] in order to obtain a frequency spectrum of the NMR signal i.e. the NMR [[spectrum]].

The duration of the NMR signal is ultimately limited by [[Relaxation (NMR)|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation]], but mutual [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the different NMR frequencies present also causes the signal to be damped more quickly.  
When NMR frequencies are well-resolved, as is typically the case in the NMR of samples in solution, the overall decay of the FID is relaxation-limited and the FID is approximately exponential (with a time constant T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or more accurately T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).  FID durations will then be of the order of seconds for nuclei such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.  If NMR lineshapes are not relaxation-limited (as is commonly the case in [[solid-state NMR]]), then the NMR signal will generally decay much more quickly e.g. microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR.

Particularly if a limited number of frequency components are present, the FID may be analysed  directly for quantitative determinations of physical properties, such as hydrogen content in aviation fuel, solid and liquid ratio in dairy products ([[Time-Domain NMR]]).

[[Image:Gammaspektrum Uranerz.jpg|thumb|The gamma-ray spectrum of natural [[uranium]], showing about a dozen discrete lines superimposed on a smooth continuum, allows the identification the [[nuclide]]s &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[Radium|Ra]], &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;[[Lead|Pb]], and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;[[Bismuth|Bi]] of the uranium [[decay chain]].]]
'''Gamma-ray spectroscopy''' is the quantitative study of the energy spectra of gamma-ray sources, both nuclear laboratory, geochemical, and astrophysical.  Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], being physically exactly like all other forms (e.g., X rays, visible light, infrared, radio) except for higher [[photon]] energy and frequency, and shorter wavelength.  (Because of their high energy, gamma-ray photons are generally counted individually, whereas the lowest energy forms of EM radiation (e.g., radio to sub-millimeter) are observed as electromagnetic waves comprised of many low-energy photons.) While a [[Geiger counter]] determines only the count rate (i.e. the number of gamma rays interacting in the detector in one second), a gamma-ray spectrometer also determines the energies of the [[gamma-ray]]s photons emitted by the source.  Radioactive nuclei ([[radionuclides]]) commonly emit gamma rays in the energy range from a few keV to ~10 MeV, corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes.  Such sources typically produce gamma-ray &quot;line spectra&quot; (i.e., many [[photon]]s emitted at discrete energies), whereas much higher energies (upwards of 1 [[TeV]]) may occur in the continuum spectra observed in astrophysics and elementary particle physics.  The boundary between gamma rays and X rays is somewhat blurred, as X rays typically refer to the high energy [[electromagnetic|EM]] emission of atoms, which may extend to over 100 keV, whereas the lowest energy emissions of nuclei are typically termed gamma rays, even though their energies may be below 20 keV.

Most radioactive sources produce gamma rays of various energies and intensities. When these emissions are collected and analyzed with a gamma-ray spectroscopy system, a gamma-ray energy spectrum can be produced. A detailed analysis of this spectrum is typically used to determine the identity and quantity of gamma emitters present in the source. The gamma spectrum is characteristic of the gamma-emitting [[nuclide]]s contained in the source, just as in [[optical spectroscopy]], the optical spectrum is characteristic of the atoms and molecules contained in the sample.

The equipment used in gamma spectroscopy includes an energy-sensitive radiation detector, a pulse sorter (i.e., multichannel analyzer), and associated amplifiers and [[data acquisition|data readout]] devices. The most common detectors include [[scintillator|sodium iodide (NaI)]] [[scintillation counter]]s and high-purity [[germanium]] detectors.

==System components==
A gamma spectroscopy system consists of a detector, electronics to collect and process the signals produced by the detector, and a computer with processing software to generate, display, and store the spectrum. Other components, such as rate meters and peak position stabilizers, may also be included.

Gamma spectroscopy detectors are passive materials that wait for a gamma interaction to occur in the detector volume. The most important interaction mechanisms are the [[photoelectric effect]], the [[Compton effect]], and [[pair creation|pair production]]. The photoelectric effect is preferred, as it absorbs all of the energy of the incident gamma ray. Full energy absorption is also possible when a series of these interaction mechanisms take place within the detector volume. When a gamma ray undergoes a Compton interaction or pair production, and a portion of the energy escapes from the detector volume without being absorbed, the background rate in the spectrum is increased by one count. This count will appear in a channel below the channel that corresponds to the full energy of the gamma ray. Larger detector volumes reduce this effect.

The voltage pulse produced by the detector (or by the [[photomultiplier]] in a scintillation detector) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal produced by the detector, reshapes it into a [[Gaussian]] or [[trapezoidal]] shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the [[analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of &quot;bins&quot; into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the ''channels'' in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on the resolution of the system and the energy range being studied.

The multichannel analyzer output is sent to a computer, which stores, displays, and analyzes the data. A variety of software packages are available from several manufacturers, and generally include spectrum analysis tools such as energy calibration, peak area and net area calculation, and resolution calculation.

==Detector performance==
Gamma spectroscopy systems are selected to take advantage of several performance characteristics.  Two of the most important include detector resolution and detector efficiency.

===Detector resolution ===
Gamma rays detected in a spectroscopic system produce peaks in the spectrum. These peaks can also be called ''lines'' by analogy to optical spectroscopy. The width of the peaks is determined by the resolution of the detector, a very important characteristic of gamma spectroscopic detectors.  Resolution is analogous to [[resolving power]] in optical spectroscopy. High resolution enables the spectroscopist to separate two gamma lines that are close to each other. Gamma spectroscopy systems are designed and adjusted to produce symmetrical peaks of the best possible resolution. The peak shape is usually a [[Gaussian distribution]]. In most spectra the horizontal position of the peak is determined by the gamma ray's energy, and the area of the peak is determined by the intensity of the gamma ray and the efficiency of the detector.

The most common figure used to express detector resolution is [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). This is the width of the gamma ray peak at half of the highest point on the peak distribution. Resolution figures are given with reference to specified gamma ray energies. Resolution can be expressed in absolute (i.e., [[electron volts|eV]] or MeV) or relative terms.  For example, a sodium iodide (NaI) detector may have a FWHM of 9.15 keV at 122 keV, and 82.75 keV at 662 keV. These resolution values expressed in absolute terms. To express the resolution in relative terms, the FWHM in eV or MeV is divided by the energy of the gamma ray and multiplied by 100. Using the preceding example, the resolution of the detector is 7.5% at 122 keV, and 12.5% at 662 keV. A germanium detector may give resolution of 560 eV at 122 keV, yielding a relative resolution of 0.46%.

===Detector efficiency===
Not all gamma rays emitted by the source and pass through the detector will produce a count in the system. The probability that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the detector and produce a count is the ''efficiency'' of the detector. High-efficiency detectors produce spectra in less time than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the detector material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.

Efficiency, like resolution, can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent the probability that a gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of the detector at 1332 keV to that of a 3&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cp[[second|s]]/[[Bq]]). Relative efficiency values greater than one hundred percent can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.

The energy of the gamma rays being detected is an important factor in the efficiency of the detector. An efficiency curve can be obtained by plotting the efficiency at various energies. This curve can then be used to determine the efficiency of the detector at energies different from those used to obtain the curve. High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors typically have higher sensitivity.

==Scintillation detectors==
[[Scintillator|Scintillation detectors]] use crystals that emit light when gamma rays interact with the atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray. The mechanism is similar to that of a [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]]. The detectors are joined to [[photomultiplier|photomultipliers]] that convert the light into electrons and then amplify the electrical signal provided by those electrons. Common scintillators include [[thallium]]-[[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] [[sodium iodide]] (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to ''sodium iodide (NaI)'' detectors—and [[bismuth germanate]] (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in light-tight coverings. 

Scintillation detectors can also be used to detect [[alpha ray|alpha]]- and [[beta ray|beta]]-radiation.

===Sodium iodide-based detectors===
[[Image:Cs137 Spectrum.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Figure 1: Sodium iodide gamma spectrum of cesium-137 (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs)]]
[[Image:Co60 Spectrum.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Figure 2: Sodium iodide gamma spectrum of cobalt-60 (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co)]] 

Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) has two principal advantages:
# It can be produced in large crystals, yielding good efficiency, and 
# it produces intense bursts of light compared to other spectroscopic scintillators.
NaI(Tl) is also convenient to use, making it popular for field applications such as the identification of unknown materials for law enforcement purposes. 

An example of a NaI spectrum is the gamma spectrum of the [[cesium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs—''see Figure 1''. &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs emits a single gamma line of 662 keV. It should be noted that the 662 keV line shown is actually produced by &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;[[barium|Ba]]&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[decay product]] of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, which is in [[secular equilibrium]] with &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.

The spectrum in Figure 1 was measured using a NaI-crystal on a photomultiplier, an amplifier, and a multichannel analyzer. The figure shows the number of counts (within the measuring period) versus channel number. The spectrum indicates the following peaks (from left to right):
# low energy x radiation (due to [[internal conversion]] of the gamma ray),
# [[backscatter]] at the low energy end of the [[Compton effect|Compton distribution]], and
# a photopeak (full energy peak) at an energy of 662 keV

The Compton distribution is a continuous distribution that is present up to channel 150 in Figure 1. The distribution arises because of primary gamma rays undergoing [[Compton scattering]] within the crystal: Depending on the scattering angle, the Compton electrons have different energies and hence produce pulses of different heights.

If many gamma rays are present in a spectrum, Compton distributions can present analysis challenges. To reduce gamma rays, an anticoincidence shield can be used—''see [[Compton suppression]]''. Gamma ray reduction techniques are especially useful for small [[lithium]]-doped germanium (Ge(Li)) detectors.

The gamma spectrum shown in Figure 2 is of the [[cobalt]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co, with two gamma rays with 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV respectively. (''See the [[decay scheme]] article for the decay scheme of cobalt-60.'') The two gamma lines can be seen well-separated; the peak to the left of channel 200 most likely indicates a strong [[background radiation]] source that has not been subtracted. A backscatter peak can be seen at channel 150, similar to the second peak in Figure 1.

Sodium iodide systems, as with all scintillator systems, are sensitive to changes in temperature. Changes in the [[operating temperature]] caused by changes in environmental temperature will shift the spectrum on the horizontal axis. Peak shifts of tens of channels or more are commonly observed. Such shifts can be prevented by using spectrum stabilizers.

Because of the poor resolution of NaI-based detectors, they are not suitable for the identification of complicated mixtures of gamma ray-producing materials. Scenarios requiring such analyses require detectors with higher resolution.

==Semiconductor-based detectors==
[[File:Am-Be-SourceSpectrum.jpg|thumb|350px|Germanium gamma spectrum of a radioactive Am-Be-source.]]

[[Semiconductor detector]]s, also called solid-state detectors, are fundamentally different from scintillation detectors. In semiconductor detectors, an electric field is applied to the detector volume. An electron in the semiconductor is fixed in its [[valence band]] in the crystal until a gamma ray interaction provides the electron enough energy to move to the [[conduction band]].  Electrons in the conduction band can respond to the electric field in the detector, and therefore move to the positive contact that is creating the electrical field. The gap created by the moving electron is called a &quot;hole,&quot; and is filled by an adjacent electron. This shuffling of holes effectively moves a positive charge to the negative contact. The arrival of the electron at the positive contact and the hole at the negative contact produces the electrical signal that is sent to the preamplifier, the MCA, and on through the system for analysis. The movement of electrons and holes in a solid-state detector is very similar to the movement of ions within the sensitive volume of gas-filled detectors such as [[ionization chamber|ionization chambers]]. 

Common semiconductor-based detectors include [[germanium]], [[cadmium telluride]], and [[cadmium zinc telluride]].

Germanium detectors provide significantly improved energy resolution in comparison to sodium iodide detectors, as explained in the preceding discussion of resolution. Germanium detectors produce the highest resolution commonly available today. [[Cryogenic]] temperatures are vital to the operation of germanium detectors.

==Calibration and background radiation==
If a gamma spectrometer is used for identifying samples of unknown composition, its energy scale must be calibrated first. Calibration is performed by using the peaks of a known source, such as cesium-137 or cobalt-60. Because the channel number is proportional to energy, the channel scale can then be converted to an energy scale. If the size of the detector crystal is known, one can also perform an intensity calibration, so that not only the energies but also the intensities of an unknown source—or the amount of a certain isotope in the source—can be determined.

Because some radioactivity is present everywhere (i.e., [[background radiation]]), the spectrum should be analyzed when no source is present. The background radiation must then be subtracted from the actual measurement. [[Lead]] absorbers can be placed around the measurement apparatus to reduce background radiation.

'''Gas phase ion chemistry''' is a field of science encompassed within both [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. It is the science that studies [[ion]]s and [[molecule]]s in the gas phase, most often enabled by some form of [[mass spectrometry]]. By far the most important applications for this science is in studying the [[thermodynamic]]s and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of reactions.&lt;ref name=Aubry2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Aubry | first =  C. | year = 2000 | title = Correlating thermochemical data for gas-phase ion chemistry | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 200 | pages = 277 | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00323-7 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7010x1969.pdf Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, No. 10, pp. 1969-1976, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example one application is in studying the [[thermodynamics]] of the [[solvation]] of ions. Ions with small [[solvation]] spheres of 1, 2, 3... solvent molecules can be studied in the gas phase and then extrapolated to bulk solution.

==Theory==

===Transition state theory===
{{Main|Transition state theory}}
Transition state theory is the theory of the rates of elementary reactions which assumes a special type of [[chemical equilibrium]] (quasi-equilibrium) between reactants and activated complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Transition State Theory|file= T06470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RRKM theory===
{{main|RRKM theory}}
RRKM theory is used to compute simple estimates of the [[unimolecular ion decomposition]] [[reaction rates]] from a few characteristics of the [[potential energy surface]].

==Gas phase ion formation==
The process of converting an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] into an [[ion]] by adding or removing charged particles such as [[electron]]s or other ions can occur in the gas phase. These processes are an important component of gas phase ion chemistry.

===Associative ionization===
{{main|Associative ionization}}
Associative ionization is a gas phase reaction in which two [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s interact to form a single product [[ion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=associative ionization|file= A00475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;A^* + B \to AB^{+\bullet} + e^-&lt;/math&gt;

where species A with excess internal energy (indicated by the asterisk) interacts with B to form the ion AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

One or both of the interacting species may have excess [[internal energy]].

===Charge-exchange ionization===
{{main|Charge-exchange ionization}}
Charge-exchange ionization (also called '''charge-transfer ionization''') is a gas phase reaction between an [[ion]] and a neutral species 
:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A + B^+&lt;/math&gt;
in which the charge of the ion is transferred to the neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-exchange ionization|file= C00989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical ionization===
{{main|chemical ionization}}
In chemical ionization, ions are produced through the reaction of ions of a reagent gas with other species.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1966''', ''88'', 2621-2630. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00964a001 Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some common reagent gases include:  [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[isobutane]].

===Chemi-ionization===
{{main|Chemi-ionization}}
Chemi-ionization can be represented by
:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to M^{+\bullet} + e^- + G&lt;/math&gt;
where G is the excited state species (indicated by the superscripted asterisk), and M is the species that is ionized by the loss of an [[electron]] to form the [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[cation]] (indicated by the superscripted &quot;plus-dot&quot;).

===Penning ionization===
{{main|Penning ionization}}
Penning ionization refers to the interaction between a gas-phase excited-state atom or molecule G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and a target molecule M resulting in the formation of a radical molecular cation M&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt;, an electron e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a neutral gas molecule G:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Penning gas mixture|file= P04476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to M^{+\bullet} + e^- + G&lt;/math&gt;

Penning ionization occurs when the target molecule has an [[ionization potential]] lower than the internal energy of the excited-state atom or molecule. [[associative ionization|Associative]] Penning ionization can also occur:

:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to MG^{+\bullet} + e^-&lt;/math&gt;

==Fragmentation==
There are many important [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] reactions that take place in the gas phase.

===Collision-induced dissociation===
{{main|Collision-induced dissociation}}
CID (also called collisionally activated dissociation - CAD) is a method used to fragment molecular [[ion]]s in the gas phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16401509&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wells JM, McLuckey SA |title=Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides and proteins |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=402 |issue= |pages=148–85 |year=2005 |pmid=16401509 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(05)02005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15481084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sleno L, Volmer DA |title=Ion activation methods for tandem mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1091–112 |year=2004 |pmid=15481084 |doi=10.1002/jms.703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular ions collide with neutral gas molecules such as [[helium]], [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]. In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into [[internal energy]] which results in fragmentation.

===Charge remote fragmentation===
{{main|Charge remote fragmentation}}
Charge remote fragmentation is a type of [[covalent bond]] breaking that occurs in a gas phase [[ion]] in which the cleaved bond is not adjacent to the location of the charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11199379&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cheng C, Gross ML |title=Applications and mechanisms of charge-remote fragmentation |journal=Mass Spectrom Rev |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=398–420 |year=2000 |pmid=11199379 |doi=10.1002/1098-2787(2000)19:6&lt;398::AID-MAS3&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gross | first =  M. | year = 2000 | title = Charge-remote fragmentation: an account of research on mechanisms and applications | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 200 | pages = 611 | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00372-9 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge transfer reactions==
There are several types of charge-transfer reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-transfer reaction (in mass spectrometry)|file=C01005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as charge-permutation reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-permutation reaction|file=M04002}}&lt;/ref&gt;):  partial-charge transfer

:&lt;math&gt;A^{2+} + B \to A^+ + B^+&lt;/math&gt;,

charge-stripping reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-stripping reaction|file=C01001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A^{2+} + B + e^-&lt;/math&gt;,

and charge-inversion reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-inversion mass spectrum|file=C00992}}&lt;/ref&gt; positive to negative

:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A^- + B^{2+} &lt;/math&gt;

and negative to positive

:&lt;math&gt;A^- + B \to A^+ + B + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;.

This effect is similar to Gaussian blur effect in image processing produced by convolution with the Gaussian function.

The term is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss.

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Analysis}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Before you start making your project you need to know what you are going to make.  This is where your analysis comes in useful and it's also worth 12 marks, that's 16% of the overall project!  We'd better get started.

== What do you need to include? ==

Hopefully by now you have some idea of your user and what they want you to do, we need to codify (write it down) it all so we can start getting some marks.  The exam board has been very kind and if you check out the mark scheme they even provide a list of things that you need to include in your Analysis.  We're going to take these and use them as our headings.

=== Research Methods ===
[[File:Accessories-text-editor.svg|thumb|right|100px|Make sure your research leads directly to your objectives]]
This should be done first. You have an idea on the sections that you need to present so you should put together some questions for your main user to get the answers you need to start putting this together.  From your research you need to know the following:
* The current system and how it runs
* The problems with the current system
* The users
* The skill levels of people using it
* What they want the new system to do
* Any preferences in terms of web based, phone based, application based.  What platform are you developing for
A structured interview might do the trick and you need to note down all the responses to each of your questions. You should try to understand the current situation and the problem and it is recommended you perform and evidence at least two of the following methods and explain why you used each:
*Interview
*Questionnaire (for multiple users)
*Observation of current system
Once you have finished presenting your research you need to summarise what it said and explain why you used each research method.

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Don't forget to:}}
[[File:Dobry Artykul-MK.svg|50px]]Make sure that all information on users, current system problems, proposed system features etc. comes directly from your research, otherwise it looks like you haven't done your research properly 
{{Robox/Close}}

===Background to/identification of the Problem===

You need to introduce your problem, a quick two paragraphs of what the problem is and how a computer might solve it.  For example mention how the current system is paper based, slow and people are always losing things, the computerised system would be faster, secure and allow them to run reports and calculate things.  But don't mention any languages or databases at this point, we will decide that at the end of the analysis.

===Description of the current system===

Describe the current system, what it does and how it currently stores its data. Describe the flaws in the current system, is it slow, secure, easy to query, easy to use, can it have multiple people use it at once, is it easy to access?

===Identification of prospective user(s)?===
[[File:System-users.svg|thumb|100px|right|You might have multiple users]]
In some instances your system will involve only one user, the person you are writing it for.  In most cases it will involve more than one person. You need to '''recognise all the users''', big and small, of your system.

For example if you were making a maths revision website you have the maths teacher as your main user, but who else is going to use the system?  The students of course!  You would then need to write how each of these user groups would use the system and how some users would have more access than others.  The teacher would be able to change the tests and see the results of all their students, they should be able to add and delete student users. The students should be able to take tests and only see their results.

For example if you were making a stock control system then the system administrator should be able to add/delete/update and re-order items of stock, run reports and add/delete/update users and suppliers.  The general shop floor staff should only be able to sell items and print out receipts.  The customers will have no direct use of the system.

You should also mention for each user the '''skills they possess'''.  For example if they use a Mac all the time then an interface similar to an OS X interface would be useful.  If they use Microsoft Office 2010 then an interface similar to that software suite would be suitable.

===Identification of user needs and acceptable limitations===
Summarise your research findings, what do each of your users want you to do?  For example:

The teacher needs me to create a system that
* stores students high scores
* shows student progress
* allows them to add, edit and delete questions

The students need me to create a system that
* allows them to log in
* allows them to answer exam style questions

Limitations are slightly harder to list.  You need to write down what your system won't be doing for reasons of time, complexity, or user preference.  These might include the system not storing user log in details as these will be managed by LDAP.  The system not enforcing spin on the pool ball as this isn't needed by the teacher and I don't have time.

===Data source(s) and destination(s)===
In most cases you'll use a database, but you could also use a file-based system or xml.
By now you should have mentioned a couple things that your project will need to store and process (this should have come from your interviews).  Where are you going to get this data from?

*What is it -&gt; where is it from -&gt; where is it going

For example the current system might say:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! What is it !! Source !! Destination
|-
| Customer Details || new customers filling in forms || customers paper records
|-
| Questions for exams || past papers and teachers || photocopies for students
|}

The new system would then look like (notice that there might be some more attributes):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! What is it !! Source !! Destination
|-
| Customer Details || new customers filling in online forms || customers db table
|-
| Questions for exams || past papers and teachers || questions XML file
|-
| Admin details || Manager || users db table
|}

===Data volumes===
An important thing to think about when building any system is how much data you will need to store and how much processing is required.  This should come directly from your research and will influence how you complete your project and what sort of hardware you will need to use. For example if you only have one person sitting an online test at one time, you only need a simple computer.  If you are looking to have hundreds of people using your system at once then you will need a very fast computer and probably a web based solution.

For example:
*I will be storing several hundred customers and...
*The revision system will store up to 100 different questions and 300 student details
*Each student will have their attempt at each question recorded, making potentially 300*100 = 30000 question answer results
*The system only needs to process one sale at a time because...

===Data Dictionary===
Like a dictionary describing all the words you can use in a sentence, this will record all the pieces of data that you want to store and process in your system.  You will need to provide the following information for everything you will store data on:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name
! Field Purpose
! Field Type
! Field Size
! Example Data
! Validation
|-
| First Name
| Stores the name of the player
| String
| 30
| Peter
| Not blank
|-
| Date of Birth
| Stores the date of birth of the player
| Date/Time
| DD/MM/YY (6 figures)
| 19/08/76
| Date/Time format 
|-
| Score
| Stores the top score of the player
| integer
| 4
| 7643
| bigger than 0, less than 10000 
|}

If you are storing a database make sure that you have stored data on all the fields that will be in your database, for example the data above is storing data on a student in a school.  What data will you need to store for your system to work?

If you are making a program, you will want to list all the variables that your program will store whilst it is running.  For example, if you were creating a program to tally the score someone achieved in a quiz, you should list the variable that will store this score.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name
! Field Type
! Start Value
! Description
|-
| Score
| Integer
| 0
| This will keep track of the score of the player
|-
| First Name
| String
| NULL
| This will keep track of the first name of a player
|-
| Date of Birth
| Date
| 01/01/1990
| This will keep track of the date of birth of the player
|}

'''Warning''': A very common mistake is to mis-size your fields.  For example you are making a markbook system where you will store the age of students.  The ages are between 11 and 16, so why not make the age 16 in length? The answer is because length sixteen allows you to store the age: 9999999999999999, which is older than the universe.  The length should be a more sensible '''2''' as the numbers are two characters long

===Data Flow Diagrams===
There are many ways that you can draw data flow diagrams, so if your teacher tells you one way and the way you read here is completely different, don't worry.  The important thing is that you show how data moves through the current system, where it is stored, where it will be processed and how you plan it to move through the new system.  It is called a data flow diagram after all!  For these examples we are using the '''Gane Sarson''' method.

[[Image:DFD0.png|thumb|480px|center|A typical Data Flow Diagram, you'll need a lot more detail!]]

There are four main components that you need to be aware of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Description !! Symbol
|-
| Entity || This generally shows all the people involved in the system.  It may also indicate other external systems that you are interacting with || circle
|-
| Process || This describes the processing that happens to the data as it is moved from one location to another, it has data inputted and will output to a data store, another process or an entity || square
|-
| Store || Generally this indicates the different computational stores used to hold your data, such as hard disk files, databases, CD ROMs etc.  || rectangle
|-
| Transfer || This shows how data moves from one part of the system to another.  you need to label the arrows to explain exactly what is moving about. || arrow
|}

Using the descriptions we can see the diagram above means the following: 
# A customer can enquire about store items, the system processes the enquiry and fetches the data from the item datastore, sending the results to the customer
# A customer can order an item, the system checks that the customer is real, checks the item is in stock, sends an order and finally sends the item and an invoice to the customer.

You need to produce four data flow diagrams, two showing the current situation and two showing the proposed system.  For each you must show the following diagrams:
*Level 0
*Level 1

You can make them using a word processor but it's far easier to use specialist software.  You can try to use [[w:Dia (software)|dia]] or [[w:Open ModelSphere|Open ModelSphere]], which are both free.  Alternatively you can use Microsoft [[w:Visio|Visio]].

{{CPTExtension|title=Extension: Use Cases}}
In software and systems engineering, a [[w:use case|use case]] is a list of steps, typically defining interactions between a role (known in [[w:UML|UML]] as an &quot;actor&quot;) and a system, to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or an external system. For example in a system where a user wants to invite some people to a party on a social network. Person:
# logs in
# selects to create an event
# picks a date and time from, using a date picker
# picks a date and time to, using a date picker
# selects a location, using a map
# adds a picture of the venue from their picture collection
# adds description
# selects private event
# sends invites

===Entity Relationship Diagrams (for databases)===
[[File:CPT-Databases-ExampleReceipt.svg|thumb|320px|Four related entities shown using Crow's Foot notation. This relationship shows that a receipt has one customer, one staff member and one product. And a customer can have many receipts; a staff member can process many receipts; and a category of product can be sold many times.]]
When thinking about how you are going to save data on your system you might decide to use a database, if this is the case you must include an E-R Diagram.  If you aren't using a database explain that there is no need to complete this section. You need to recognise your main tables.  There should be at least 3 tables and relationships between them.  The tables don't have to be normalised at this stage but the relationships should be described in a little detail.

* see chapter on [[../../Problem Solving, Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Networking/Databases|Databases]]

===Object Orientation planning (for Object Orientation)===
For each class that you are using describe:
* overview of what it does
* inheritance
* overriding
* public and private variables
* public and private methods

For example, the attributes of a monster class might contain:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Access Type
! Field Name
! Field Type
! Initial Value
! Description
|-
| Private
| Health
| Integer
| 100
| This will store the health of the monster, when the health gets to 0 the monster should die
|-
| Private
| x
| Integer
| 0
| This will track the x location of the monster
|}

you also need to note the methods that the monster class would use:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Access Type
! Method Name
! Parameters
! Return Values
! Description
|-
| Public
| MoveLeft
| none
| none
| This will move the monster 3 points to the left
|-
| Public
| Hurt
| damage
| the current health of the monster
| this allows you to damage monsters
|}

* see chapter on [[../../Problem Solving, Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Networking/Programming Concepts/Object-oriented programming (OOP)|object orientation]]

===Objectives===
[[File:Gnome-colors-alacarte.svg|thumb|right|100px|Make sure your objectives are numbered and SMART]]
This is the most important part of your Analysis, because this is how you are going to check if your end system meets all your user needs. You need to outline three sets of objectives that are all SMART and numbered:
*System Objectives
*Processing Objectives
*User Objectives
As far as possible all your objectives should be SMART. But what does SMART mean?
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Letter
! Major Term
! Description
! Example
! Not acceptable!
|-
| S
| Specific
| Make sure that it's not ambiguous and it concerns a part of your system
| The system should be able to display 5 top scores in descending order
| My system should be good
|-
| M
| Measurable
| Is there any way that you can easily prove that you have met this objective.
| Each page should load in less than 5 seconds
| My pages will be beautiful
|-
| A
| Attainable
| Make sure that within the time and resources available you will be able to complete the objective
| My system will allow the saving of user preferences
| There will be a facial recognition system to allow users to log into the system
|-
| R
| Relevant
| Is the objective going to help you meet your user needs?
| A receipt will be printed and emailed to the customer
| My cashier system will play MP3s in the background
|-
| T
| Time-bound
| You are limited in the time you have to complete this project. You must list the deadline in your Analysis somewhere and can you finish each objective in time?
| I will show the player position on the map using 2D Vector graphics
| The game will have 3D graphics as good as League of Legends
|}
As you can probably recognise, several of the incorrect objectives above fail to meet multiple SMART criteria.  Test yourself, which of these objectives are SMART enough to get you started on a good project:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will allow staff to update stock and add new stock items. &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - Yes, this should be possible
* R - Yes, this is core to running the system
* T - Yes, this should be achievable within the time given
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The sports club system will have a clock displaying the current time on each page &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - Yes, this should be possible
* R - '''No''', why can't they use the clock on the desktop
* T - Yes, this should be achievable within the time given
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will use custom code to interpret and display SVG game graphics &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - '''Maybe''', this should be possible, but why are you writing your own code, can't you use a library?
* R - Yes, the game will need graphics
* T - '''No''', SVG is a complex thing to use, will you have time to implement this? Is it that core to what you are doing?  Why not use pre-existing libraries?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will calculate and display the total number of sales per customer &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening and the code behind it
* A - Yes,
* R - Yes, as long as this is called for from the interview or other part of the analysis
* T - Yes
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will process 5,000,000 transactions a second &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing debug information, maybe a counter tallying transactions
* A - '''Maybe''', you would be hitting processing speed limitations and probably limitations in speed
* R - '''No''', this system sounds too complex as this level of speed would only be required in something like Google or Facebook
* T - '''No''', this sounds like cutting edge industry level stuff, are you sure you could achieve it in the time given?
| &amp;nbsp;

===Potential Solutions===
There are several ways that you could solve the problem at hand you need to list at least 3 different options.  For each of them you need to mention positive and negative things and then argue out your chosen solution.

For example.  If I was tasked with making a stock control system I could use the following things (with a lot more detail!)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Suggested Solution
! Positives
! Negatives
|-
| Excel and VBA desktop application
| &lt;/br&gt;I know how to use excel&lt;br/&gt;the user also has experience in excel&lt;br/&gt;Excel and VBA will allow me to perform calculations and display results
| Excel is a flat file database and won't let me handle links between data.&lt;br/&gt;The solution will only be available offline
|-
| Visual Basic.NET application and Access Database backend
| I have some experience of Visual Basic from the first year&lt;br/&gt;VB.NET lets me easily build a solution that will have similar interfaces to MS Office programs&lt;br/&gt;They already own Access and use Windows&lt;br/&gt;
| I need to learn more VB.NET to complete this project&lt;br/&gt;This solution will be offline only
|-
| ASP.NET and MSSQL database website based solution
| This solution will allow the user to login online.&lt;br/&gt;Relationships will be enforceable&lt;br/&gt;I will be able to use SQL to perform searches
| I have a lot to learn in ASP.NET&lt;br/&gt;The user doesn't need to access it from multiple computers&lt;br/&gt;It requires a server and networking know-how
|}

===Chosen Solution===

From the choices that you suggested pick the best one and explain why.  This is going to be how you are going to solve this problem!

===Other evidence===

In this section you need to justify that the techniques you used to write your analysis were correct and made sure that you managed to get all the objectives of the new system.  Go back to the questionnaires, interview and observations.  Include them here and explain how this made sure that you could produce a comprehensive Analysis.

==Next steps==
Now you have completed your Analysis you need to start making your project.  You should have some idea of how you are going to make your system and you now need to start acquiring all the skills you will need to complete this project.  Get yourself a text book about the programming language you have chosen and make sure you can perform some simple tasks using it. At this point it would be a good idea to write a quick list of skills that you will need to learn.

Whilst you are getting those skills, head over to [[../Design|Design]]

'''WPBannerMeta''' incorporates a number of ''''hooks'''', where advanced or customized features can be added. These should take the form of a subtemplate passed to the relevant hook parameter. Any relevant parameters should then be passed to the hook template&amp;mdash;it may be necessary to repeat parameters that are already passed to the main template (e.g.: {{para|category|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{category|¬}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{para|quality|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are commonly used). If you write a hook that you think other projects could use, please copy or move it to a subpage here and add it to the list below.

===Writing a hook===
Hooks should be carefully designed to mimic the meta-functionality of the WPBannerMeta template, particularly with things like category opt-out and case-insensitive quality filtering; and for ease of maintenance, the parameters should be similarly named to WPBannerMeta's default parameters. 

===Available hook parameters===
*{{para|HOOK_ASSESS}} – between the code for quality and priority assessments.
*{{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}} – just below the comments display, adjacent to {{para|BOTTOM_TEXT}}. Please use this hook rather than the {{para|BOTTOM_TEXT}} parameter, for adding extra functionality to the bottom of the template.
*{{para|HOOK_NOTE}} – after the last note code (above the comment display).
*{{para|HOOK_COLLAPSED}} – added to the 'counter' that counts the number of notes that have been triggered on a page, to prompt the collapsible box.  Accepts either
**any valid input to the &lt;tt&gt;[[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions##expr:|#expr:]]&lt;/tt&gt; ParserFunction.
**&quot;''auto''&quot;, which automatically sets to 1 if HOOK_NOTE is non-empty and 0 otherwise. This is the default setting and is suitable if HOOK_NOTE will not normally produce more than one row of output.
*{{para|HOOK_PRIORITY}} – between the priority assessment and the autoassess notice. 
*{{para|HOOK_NESTED}} – after the task force list that is displayed when the banner is nested within a {{tl|WikiProjectBannerShell}}.
*{{para|HOOK_TF}} – after the task force code (just above the code for {{para|attention}}).

===Existing hooks===
*[[/cats]] &amp;ndash; add categories based on parameters with proper optout, case insensitivity, etc.
*[[/notecounter]] – allows notes, etc. added in HOOK_NOTE to contribute towards the counter that triggers the notes being collapsed.
*[[/notes]] &amp;ndash; provides ten additional notes.  Hooks to {{para|HOOK_NOTE}}.
*[[/taskforces]] – provides ten additional taskforces (hooks to {{para|HOOK_TF}}).
*[[/tfnested]] – nested summaries for ten additional taskforces.  Works with [[/taskforces]] above.  Hooks to {{para|HOOK_NESTED}}.
*[[/todolist]] – allows for easy adding of a project wide to-do list (hooks to {{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}}).

This hook allows notes added in other hooks ([[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes|/notes]], etc) to contribute towards the counter that triggers the notes being collapsed into a show/hide box when they become too numerous. Each parameter should be set to one of the trigger parameters for a hooked note.

'''''This hook cannot be 'stacked' in the usual way'''''.  Normally, you can 'stack' hook templates:

&lt;pre&gt;
|HOOK_NOTE              = &lt;!--
--&gt;{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This does '''not''' work with this particular hook.  You need to concatenate the hook templates with an addition sign &lt;tt&gt;'''+'''&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
|HOOK_COLLAPSED         = {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}} + {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}} + {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}

This hook enables a project to-do list or other similar list to be easily integrated into a project banner. It should be attached to the {{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}} hook.

There are two main parameters, {{para|TODO_LINK}} and {{para|TODO_TEXT}}. Only one should be used at any time. If the todo list is located on a different page then &lt;tt&gt;TODO_LINK&lt;/tt&gt; should be used. However, if you've just got some text to include then you can use the &lt;tt&gt;TODO_TEXT&lt;/tt&gt; option instead.

If you are using &lt;tt&gt;TODO_LINK&lt;/tt&gt; and don't want to see the edit links at the top of the textbox, set &lt;tt&gt;TODO_EDITLINKS=no&lt;/tt&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Table of Contents ==
* [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Introduction|Introduction]]
* [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Mail|Mail]]
** [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Google_Mail|Google Mail]]

== Introduction ==
If you have trouble finding the right settings for your mail-server, try http://www.webpan.com/Customers/Email/SMTP_Authentication_Telnet_Test.htm
with detailed instructions how to test your settings using telnet.

This link and some more can be found on https://docs.openclinica.com/Email-Configuration-and-Troubleshooting-Tips .

== Mail ==
OpenClinica can be configured to automatically send e-mail messages. For example if a user lost his or her password, the password can be reset and a mail can be sent to notify the user. 
But another use of mail is the generating of messages, defined by rules. For example, if a Serious Adverse Event happens, a mail is sent to to principal investigator.

Configuring the mail-option is done in the datainfo.properties file:
/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/OpenClinica/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties

Before you edit this file, make sure you have a backup, something like datainfo.properties-20120721

=== Google Mail ===
Most people will use the mail server on their system, but sometimes it can be handy to use a GMail account.
If you want to use a google mail account try the following configuration:
&lt;pre&gt;
mailHost=smtp.gmail.com
mailPort=465
mailProtocol=smtps
mailUsername=johndoe@gmail.com
mailPassword=xxxxxxxx
mailSmtpAuth=false
mailSmtpStarttls.enable=false
mailSmtpsAuth=true
mailSmtpsStarttls.enable=false
mailSmtpConnectionTimeout=1000
mailErrorMsg=janedoe@does.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

For versions before 3.1:
&lt;pre&gt;
mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
mail.username=johndoe@gmail.com
mail.password=xxxxxxxx
mail.port=587
mail.errormsg=janedoe@does.com
mail.protocol=smtp
mail.smtp.auth=true
mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
mail.smtps.auth=false
mail.smtps.starttls.enable=false
mail.smtp.connectiontimeout=5000 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hi. Thx for code. What do you think about 2 small changes :
* move &quot;cx = ax + i * h / 800&quot; from j-loop to i-loop. 
* compute &quot;h / 800&quot; and use it's value not to compute it for every point 

It should be faster. Regards. --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 15:43, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

:I have written &quot;i * h / width&quot; (i = 0 to width - 1) in order to make the meaning more clear, in my programs I calculate h/width once for all. You are right, &quot;cx = ax + i * h / width&quot; should be put outside &quot;for j = 0 to height - 1 do&quot;, I have corrected this, and will do the same in all my programs. Thanks.

Hi. I have made a program in C that should realize your algorithm. ( It does not work = gives black file). Can you look at it ? Regards --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 17:52, 13 December 2010 (UTC)

..... ( old code is removed. See new code below)


: I understand that you let the domain outside of the Mandelbrot set and its boundary be of one colour, since you have not calculated the colour scale col and the real iteration number.

:Instead of &quot;if (f&gt;r)/*(n == m || log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; PixelWidth * sqrt(fd) ) */&quot;, you should write:

:: if (n == m || log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; thick * sqrt(fd)) /* the condition for Z belonging to the Mandelbrot set or the boundary */

:and instead of &quot;array[((iYmax-iY-1)*iXmax+iX)*3]=0;&quot;, you should write:

:: array[((iHeight-1 - iY)*iWidth + iX)*3]=0; /* iWidth = 800, iHeight = 600 */

:Besides:
:1) iYmax = 599 (not 799)
:2) CyMax = ay + 600*h/800 (not ay + h)
:3) f (first in the iteration loop) is Zx * Zx + Zy * Zy (not Zx + Zy * Zy)
:4) PixelWidth = h/iWidth, but PixelHeight is the same number (not h/iHeight, but &quot;height of section&quot;/iHeight = h/iWidth)

:Thx for answer. I have made some changes based on your tips. It works now. The image looks similar ( only black and white) but the quality is not the same. How can I improve it ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam majewski|contribs]]) 16:39, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

: A download manager is an application that helps you to download files faster (especially big ones); it re-starts downloading after breaking connection.

== Wget ==
: Wget is a kind of console applications but you can use GUI for it called Gwget.
:1. Installation:&lt;br /&gt;
 apt-get install gwget
::a. Run it from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Gwget Download Manager.
::b. Copy downloading file link from a web browser.
::c. Add it to Gwget 
[[File:Dm1.png|center|600px]]
:: and wait for finishing.
[[File:Dm2.png|center|600px]]


:2. For KDE there is KGet Download Manager as a part of the environment.


: Wget home page: http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html
: More about Wget on Wikipedia: [[w:Wget|Wget]]
: Gwget home page: http://projects.gnome.org/gwget/
: Gwget on Wikipedia: [[w:GWget|GWget]]
: KWget on KDE home page: http://www.kde.org/
: KGet on Wikipedia: [[w:KGet|KGet]]


== Quick Downloader ==
: Small but system independent applications works with Java.
:: 1. Download &quot;OSIndependent&quot; file from: http://qdown.sourceforge.net/ and extract it.
:: 2. Get in the new created &quot;OSIndependent&quot; folder in Termial as an user and run it: 
 java -jar QuickDownloader.jar
[[File:Pobieranie3.png|center|500px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Pobieranie4.png|center|500px]]


== DownThemAll! ==
: Firefox web browser add-on install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201/
: Running the add-on first time just choose download folder
[[File:Dl1.png|center|500px]]
: and  click on &quot;Start&quot;.
[[File:Dl2.png|center|500px]]

: Home page: http://www.downthemall.net/


== FireDownload ==
: It's another Firefox add-on and it makes downloading 10 times faster as the add-on maker says,
: install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10615/

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Shortly after the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], muck-raking journalist [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] publishes a scurrilous book about Dumbledore. The revelations in this book severely shake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s faith in his erstwhile hero, and lead him to wonder whether Dumbledore had been honest with him about anything.

== Event Details ==

While packing up to leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys' home]] for the last time, Harry happens to see Dumbledore's name on a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']]. Reading, he finds a eulogy to Dumbledore by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]], and, in a more recent edition, an interview with Rita Skeeter on the occasion of the publication of her book, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. While Doge's obituary is something of a revelation, telling Harry of Dumbledore's father who was sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], and of Dumbledore's mother, brother, and sister, the hints of scandal that Skeeter reveals in her interview seem to go counter to everything Harry had believed about Dumbledore.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|the wedding]], Harry finds Elphias Doge and attempts to discern the truth from him. Their conversation, however, is taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]], who apparently believes the scandals alluded to by Skeeter and overshadows Doge by sheer volume. Harry does learn that the Dumbledore family, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], lived in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], just as Harry's parents had.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] visits the Trio at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 11|some time later]], he brings a copy of the ''Prophet'' with him. That edition contains an excerpt from Rita's book, in which Dumbledore's mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] is described as proud and haughty. It also suggests that Kendra was hoping to be able to hide her daughter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], who Skeeter says was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. While there is very little here that has not already been alluded to in the earlier interview, it is still something of a shock to Harry to see it written down so completely.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 13|Later]], the Trio [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltrate the Ministry]] to attempt to recover the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. While searching Umbridge's office, Harry sees what he takes to be a small mirror showing Dumbledore's face. On inspection, he finds it to be a copy of ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. He has only time to look at one of the photographs therein, one showing two teen-aged boys, apparently friends, before he is interrupted.

Very shortly afterwards, Harry sees one of the teen-aged boys again. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has found [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], and is torturing him for information on something he had once owned. Unwillingly viewing Voldemort's thoughts, Harry sees, in Gregorovitch's memories, a teenager from the photo leaving through Gregorovitch's shop window, having stolen something from him.

Harry and Hermione decide to visit Godric's Hollow to speak with Bathilda Bagshot, arriving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|on Christmas Eve]]. In Bathilda's house, Harry notices several vacant picture frames, and surmises that the vacant frames once held the photos now found illustrating ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. He also finds a photo of the teenage thief, and puts it in his pocket. At the disastrous end of the visit, he loses the photo of the thief, and Voldemort finds it.

The following day, Hermione reveals that she had picked up an unopened copy of ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' from Bathilda's parlour. Harry finds the picture of the two teenagers, with a caption identifying Dumbledore, and the teen-aged thief as his best friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. Reading a chapter titled, &quot;The Greater Good&quot;, they learn that Dumbledore graduated Hogwarts with many honors and accolades. He and his friend, Elphias Doge, intended to take a Grand Tour of Europe, but Kendra Dumbledore's sudden death canceled it. Although Doge had claimed that Dumbledore made a grand sacrifice to care for his family, the book implies otherwise, quoting several Godric's Hollow citizens. One Enid Smeek recounts that Albus did little to curtail his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]]'s wild behavior and kept his sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], hidden away. Although the Dumbledores remained reclusive, Bathilda Bagshot reportedly established a friendship with the family. Skeeter claims that although Bathilda's memory may have been affected by age, she was able to extract enough facts to piece together the scandalous story of Kendra's death, which was passed off as a spell backfiring. She also debunks Ariana being sickly and claims Albus had an affinity for the Dark Arts and may have supported Muggle oppression.

The same summer that Albus returned home to care for the family, Bathilda Bagshot took in her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald, a student as brilliant as Dumbledore, who was expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. He and Albus quickly formed a close friendship. In a letter to Gellert, Dumbledore writes that he agrees Wizard dominance over Muggles is for the greater good, but they must rule responsibly and only use force when necessary. He believes that was Gellert's mistake at Durmstrang, although he says that if Gellert had not been expelled, then they would never have met. Rita states that this letter proves that Albus Dumbledore once intended to overthrow the Statute of Secrecy and establish Wizard rule over Muggles. It contradicts his later stance supporting Muggle-born witches and wizards and protecting Muggles' rights.

But barely two months after their friendship began, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted ways and did not see each other again until their legendary duel. Bathilda Bagshot believed the rift involved Ariana's death. Gellert was in the Dumbledore house when it happened, and he came home distressed, leaving by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] the next day. Bathilda says Aberforth blamed Albus, and they came to blows at the funeral. Bathilda goes on to say that Gellert's departure was unfortunate, as he would have been a comfort to Albus. It was never understood why Aberforth blamed Albus for Ariana's death, although it is speculated that it was related to Albus' friendship with Gellert, who had been expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks on fellow students.

Grindelwald then went on to become one of the greatest Dark wizards, conquering much of Europe. It was not until five years after his reign of terror started that Dumbledore succumbed to the Wizarding world's pleas to end Grindelwald's vicious rampage. Questions lingered after Grindelwald's defeat, however. Was it his affection for Grindelwald that delayed Albus taking action? How and why did Ariana die? Was it an accident or the first attempt at implementing their &quot;Greater Good&quot; plan?

The chapter ends here, and Harry is stunned as he endures the loss of his unwavering trust in Dumbledore, who once embodied nothing but goodness and wisdom. Hermione reminds him that it was Rita Skeeter who wrote the book, but Harry points out Dumbledore's own words in his letter to Grindelwald. Hermione says that, unfortunately, Grindelwald's slogan, &quot;For the Greater Good&quot;, probably stemmed from Dumbledore's ideas and became Grindelwald's justification for his atrocities. Those words were reportedly carved over the entrance to &quot;Nurmengard&quot;, the prison Grindelwald built to jail his enemies. Hermione attempts to attribute Dumbledore's actions to his youth, but Harry reminds her that they are the same age, and they are fighting Dark Arts, not championing them. Hermione claims she is not defending what Albus did, but says he had just lost his mother and he was alone. But Harry points out he had a brother and that he kept his Squib sister locked up, although Hermione doubts she was Squib. She says that the Dumbledore they knew would never have allowed Muggle oppression, and whatever he believed when he was seventeen, he chose a different path and spent his remaining life fighting evil. Hermione surmises that Harry is really angry because Dumbledore never revealed this about himself, which Harry acknowledges may be true. But he wonders how Dumbledore could have left him in such a mess, and if he ever really cared about him.

It turns out that what Skeeter has done is interviewed those who knew Dumbledore from outside the household, most notably Bathilda Bagshot by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]]. While the events she writes about did happen, full understanding of the circumstances surrounding them is delayed until near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Escaping Death Eaters in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], the Trio enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], where they find that the bartender is Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. Aberforth gives more of an insider's view of the events of the time which, while still not particularly flattering to Albus, at least explains the events of the day and dispels much of the fear Harry has that Dumbledore had been on the Dark side. Dumbledore's motives, however, are not revealed until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|somewhat later]], and a full understanding is only granted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|later still]].

== Notable Consequences ==

The principal effect of the appearance of this book is to cast Harry's belief in his hero, Dumbledore, completely into disarray. He had been carrying out Dumbledore's mission out of love and respect for the man Dumbledore was, but finds that there is an entire unexplained, and possibly scandalous past that Dumbledore has never told him about. As he is no longer sure who Dumbledore was, Harry is unsure about the worth of the mission that Dumbledore had set him, and of the value Dumbledore had placed on him personally. Was Dumbledore truly what he seemed, or was he simply conning Harry into doing his work for him?

Information in this book, and information gathered elsewhere, leads Harry along a path that Voldemort is also following: towards one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Without information gleaned from this book, Harry would not have understood the link connecting the experiences he received from Voldemort, and would not have been able to determine what Voldemort sought, or why.

== Analysis ==

Rita Skeeter has always been held up as an example of the very &quot;yellowest&quot; of the yellow press, writing for sensation rather than for truth. While there is often some fact behind what she writes, she has completely internalized the belief that the function of a newspaper is to sell newspapers, and thus the function of a writer is to write whatever sells. In this book, we see her at her &quot;best&quot;, taking events that are open to misinterpretation, and misinterpreting them to the maximum sensationalist effect. One could wonder why Harry so readily accepts the picture she paints, despite its differences from the Dumbledore we, and Harry, have come to know. Apart from the all-too-human readiness to believe the worst in others, there is little that would make Harry believe Skeeter's story. However, Skeeter is a very successful writer, and by now has quite obviously learned how to use a single provable fact to support a veritable tower of innuendo. Harry, young and inexperienced, is not yet able to deconstruct Skeeter's text and determine where he is being duped.

There are several passages in the series that could be considered epigrams. One of them, spoken by Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|late in the second book]], is &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; Though Harry is, at the time, comforted by this thought, he is not so quick to apply it to others. In this case, Harry is quick to accept the stories told by Skeeter at face value, probably because the only counter-story he has heard to date is the weak protestations from Elphias Doge. Believing these stories about Dumbledore's past is particularly harmful because Harry seems unable to believe that people can change. He has shown this before, when he learned about his father's student life; though told that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] had stopped being a bully and had become quite the upstanding wizard, Harry remains doubtful that his father had really changed, and wonders who his father really was. Skeeter's revelations similarly upset Harry's understanding of Dumbledore and his motives, and Harry seems unable to see that Dumbledore had made choices that changed him to the wizard he was, leaving behind the child he had been. Possibly this is because, while Harry has made the choices that distinguish him from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], to Harry's perceptions, the choices he made were not changes in behaviour, but simply affirmations of his beliefs. The key choices he made, in his first day at Hogwarts, were to reject [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s offer of friendship on the Hogwarts Express, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]]'s suggestion that he would &quot;do well in Slytherin&quot;. As both of these choices were simply affirmations of his existing beliefs, he may not be able to perceive that great changes can equally be chosen. Curiously, though, he does not recognize that Dumbledore's choice, to support Muggles rather than rule them, is equally an affirmation of his previous character, and the episode presented by Skeeter is an aberration inspired by Grindelwald, rather than a measure of his true character.

As horrible as it is, this book is actually quite an important factor in Harry's maturation. The reader can see, as Harry starts to in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', that prior to this year, Harry has been largely reacting to others rather than acting on his own. It is only in this book that he takes the initiative, choosing to pursue the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], rather than following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] pursuit of one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Hallows]]. While it is true that in making this decision, he follows Dumbledore's wishes, he must first elect to do so, rather than following the allure of the Hallows which promise &quot;the ability to conquer Death&quot;. By forcing Harry to re-examine his assumptions about Dumbledore, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' sows the doubt that allows him to consider the other choice.

This last item merits examination in some depth. In the first five books, it should be obvious to the reader that Harry is purely reacting to events initiated by Voldemort and his associates, and to a lesser extent to Dumbledore and his wishes. This is pointed up for us by a comment of Ron's, that Dumbledore likely knew everything that was going on, and had allowed Harry to face Voldemort in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. Looking back at events from the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the reader could be forgiven for believing that Harry's role was to be a tool for Dumbledore, rather than an individual in his own right.

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore expressly acts to bring Harry into his confidence to the extent that he feels able. Dumbledore teaches Harry almost all that he has been able to learn about Voldemort's early career, knowing that a key to defeating an enemy is understanding him. Despite this preparation for battle, Dumbledore gives no clue that he expects Harry to be fighting Voldemort directly. Right up to the end of the book, when Dumbledore dies, it would appear that Dumbledore will be fighting Voldemort, and Harry will be assisting him, a role that Harry seems almost worshipfully to accept. As long as Harry accepts Dumbledore's guidance without question, he cannot mature; and it takes a very large event, Dumbledore's death, to force Harry out of that comfortable area.

However, we can quickly see that is not enough. Harry clearly remains unthinkingly loyal to Dumbledore's memory after the funeral, a fact we hear him express to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]], then, and again at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] during the summer. The long wander through the wintry English countryside, which causes Ron's departure, coupled with the doubts raised by Skeeter's venomous book, lead Harry to question his mission and whether Dumbledore saw him as anything other than a tool. It is this self-examination that allows Harry to decide for himself that he will follow Dumbledore's instructions, rather than following his own inclination to try and thwart Voldemort's attempt to retrieve the Elder Wand. This same awareness of self assists him in deflecting Aberforth's jeering comments about the validity of Harry's mission. But without the self-examination, Harry would be very unlikely to come to any real understanding of why he was doing what he was doing, and the story would have been significantly weaker as a result; and Skeeter's book, excerpted in various places through this particular part of the story, is key to unbalancing Harry's world to the point that he must actually think about his place in it.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' first appears, and is completely dealt with, in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', and as such there is very little effect that it can have on the rest of the series. However, one point is of some interest here, and we must wonder why Skeeter did not mention it in her book or articles. It is true that Dumbledore never married, and it appears from his comments [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|later]], where he speaks of being &quot;infatuated&quot; with Grindelwald, that in fact he is homosexual. In the United States, it would be impossible to have a known homosexual in charge of a school as large as Hogwarts. We wonder why Skeeter did not make more of Dumbledore's sexual proclivities than she did, despite the more forgiving attitude of the British. The only conclusion we can reach is that perhaps her editor struck those passages out as being too inflammatory for her audience, all of whom presumably passed through Hogwarts while Dumbledore was a teacher or headmaster there. Further, that thesis was likely unsupported by any facts other than chance comments in the letters between Dumbledore and Grindelwald; one thing Dumbledore was good at was discretion.&lt;!-- Note to editors: This is about as much exploration of this topic as we want. Remember, it's a kids' book. --&gt;

==Overview of EHR / EMR==


An '''electronic health record (EHR)''' (also '''electronic patient record''' or '''computerised patient record''') is an evolving concept defined as a systematic collection of electronic health information about individual patients or populations&lt;ref&gt;Gunter, T.D. and Terry, N.P. 2005 [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1550638 The Emergence of National Electronic Health Record Architectures in the United States and Australia: Models, Costs, and Questions] in ''J Med Internet Res'' 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a record in digital format that is capable of being shared across different health care settings, by being embedded in network-connected enterprise-wide information systems. Such records may include a whole range of data in comprehensive or summary form, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, and billing information.

It is important to note that an EHR is generated and maintained within an institution, such as a hospital, integrated delivery network, clinic, or physician office.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/informatics/EHR.pdf Electronic Health Records Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Its purpose can be understood as a complete record of patient encounters that allows the automation and streamlining of the workflow in health care settings and increases safety through evidence-based decision support, quality management, and outcomes reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIMSS&quot;&gt;[http://www.himss.org/ASP/topics_ehr.asp HIMSS - Electronic Health Record (EHR)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Factors in purchasing an EHR software==

Purchasing the best EHR takes time. One needs to plan accordingly and the following tips will enable the decision making process purchase much smoother and also result in a successful implementation of EHR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emrconsultant.com/education/sevenfactors]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Research'''. Get familiarized with the industry and learn what others have to say about the various EHR options available in the market. Look for unbiased information from people like consultants, talks in the blogs and various medical forums.

'''Rational Planning'''. Set EHR goals that are reasonable to attain and design an EHR implementation plan which should include milestones,that one   wants to reach as well as what one is looking to gain from an EHR.

'''Attitude'''. Make sure that the entire personal medical practice has a positive attitude about using an EHR solution. Look out for EHR vendors[[http://www.emrandhipaa.com/administrator/2006/02/21/overwhelming-list-of-emr-companies/ |EHR / EMR vendors]] who look to build this positive attitude. Thus making sure that everyone is on the same page, critical for the success of EHR.

'''ROI'''. Determine what type of Return on Investment can be expected when implementing an EHR system. EHR software can be extremely costly depending on the type of EHR features that one is looking to implement. Therefore, it is important to have an idea of the practice's budget, as well as the cost savings expected from a proper EHR implementation.

'''Technical Competency'''. The practice's staff must be quizzed on how good they are at using computers. Making sure the staff feels comfortable using new technology will help prepare everyone for this transition to an EHR.

'''Hardware'''. Selecting the correct hardware will result in savings of thousands of dollars when purchasing an EHR solution. Not only will it save money but it will also improve the functionality within the EHR. There are several hardware companies that have partnered with EHR vendors, so be sure to ask them what hardware will work best with the EHR product. Ask the EHR vendor if they offer bundled solutions. Another alternative is to speak with an IT consulting company at the beginning to enable a smooth EHR implementation.

==Comparison of EHR solution providers==

== [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Chapter P2P Implementations#Peer2Mail|p2m]] ==
: p2m (peer-to-mail) network is a little different than all of theme above.
: All files you can download straight from an e-mail box.
:1. To do that you have to log any p2m forum in and find a file &quot;hashcode&quot; that contains downloading details.
: The file lets you log automatically to an e-mail box and download files.
: But there is only one p2m client for Linux in this moment and it doesn't work with &quot;hashcode&quot; yet.
: So if you want to use the network find an e-mail box address and password for your file.
:2. Now download the network client called OpenP2M: http://openp2m.sourceforge.net/download.php?language=en
: If the link doesn't work use second one: http://www.pavroo.w8w.pl/files/openp2m-portable0.185.zip
:3. Extract file, get to the new folder using Terminal and run application:
 sh openp2m-linux-java16.sh
:4. Log in an e-mail box and download files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will solve the two equations for the potentials, and put them together to generate a solution for E and B. The two equations are

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \phi} {\partial t^2} = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2}= -\mu_0 J&lt;/math&gt;

==Retarded Time==

Imagine an infinite sheet. At time 0, a current is turned on, and thus, a magnetic field should be produced. What is the field at a very far point immediately after time 0? It is still 0, because the &quot;news&quot; that the current is turned on hasn't reached there yet. Electromagnetic information travel at the speed of light. This isn't surprising since light is an electromagnetic phenomena. We have already seen that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light; it would only make sense if all electromagnetic fields propagate at that speed.

Thus, let us introduce the quantity &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-r/c&lt;/math&gt; called the retarded time. Suppose we have a fixed point P, and that it is currently time t. At another point Q, electromagnetic waves are sent. The waves arriving at P are not the ones generated at that instant, but the ones generated at &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}&lt;/math&gt;. This is because light takes &lt;math&gt;PQ/c&lt;/math&gt; time to travel to P, so we must subtract it from t.

It turns out that the most general solution to the potential equations is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||} dV&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||} dV&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-\frac{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the potentials are given at the actual time t, while the time appearing in the integral is the retarded time. Also, the integrals are over r'. Third, note that &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}&lt;/math&gt; is a function of both r and r'; keep this in mind when doing integrals and derivatives with retarded time in it.

Last of all, note that the following equation is '''not correct''':

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||^2} dV&lt;/math&gt;

as might be expected from analogy. Thus, our formulas for potentials is not a trivial equation; they have to be checked against Maxwell's equations.

On the other hand, since we know that &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; -\nabla \phi = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;, we can &quot;easily&quot; calculate the fields from the potentials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose there is a point charge q traveling with location at all times given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. We will use the formulas developed in the previous section to find the potentials and the fields.

The retarded time is given by &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-\frac{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{\gamma}(t_{ret})||}{c}&lt;/math&gt; (since, when we measure go back, the particle wasn't where it is now, it is at &lt;math&gt; \gamma(t_{ret})&lt;/math&gt;) Note that at most one previous instance of the particle is generating the field at the point, since the particle is moving at subluminal speeds. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\eta}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{\gamma}(t_{ret})&lt;/math&gt; is a unique vector.

Thus, the scalar potential is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{\eta}||} dV = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||} \int \rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})dV&lt;/math&gt;

You might think that equals
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||}&lt;/math&gt;

but that is '''wrong'''! The reason is very subtle: for the integral to be equal to the total charge, the charge distribution has to be taken at a specific time. However, we are obliged to evaluate the distribution at different times for each point! Thus, the charged particle is &quot;smeared&quot; out! Even though we are considering a point particle, the formula is still wrong, since the correction factor doesn't depend on geometric size!

Suppose the particle is a box of length a and is moving towards us. However, we will observe the particle to have length b, because the light that is simultaneously reaching our eyes from the front and back of the box originated from different times. In the time that light from the back of the box travels the extra distance b, the car traveled distance &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{c}=\frac{b-a}{v}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{a}{1-v/c}&lt;/math&gt;; the box is stretched by factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-v/c}&lt;/math&gt; that has nothing to do with the size of the object. This is not an effect of length contraction; this is rather more similar to the Doppler shift.

The correct formula for the scalar potential is 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\left(\frac{1}{1-\mathbf{\hat{\eta}} \cdot \mathbf{w}'(t_{ret})/c} \right)\frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||}&lt;/math&gt;

The current density is &lt;math&gt;\rho \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, and by similar arguments,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\left(\frac{1}{1-\mathbf{\hat{\eta}} \cdot \mathbf{w}'(t_{ret})/c} \right)\frac{\mu_0 q \mathbf{v}}{4 \pi ||\mathbf{\eta}||}=\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

These are the Lienard-Wiechert Potentials for a moving charge. The correction factors are for the components of velocity pointing to the point we are measuring the potentials at.

Irony is a development kit for implementing languages on the .NET platform. It uses the flexibility and power of the C# language and .NET Framework 3.5 to implement a completely new and streamlined technology of compiler construction.
 
Unlike most existing yacc/lex-style solutions, Irony does not employ any scanner or parser code generation from grammar specifications written in a specialized meta-language. In Irony, the target language grammar is coded directly in C# using operator overloading to express grammar constructs. Irony's scanner and parser modules use the grammar encoded as a C# class to control the parsing process.

The Irony project is hosted on [http://irony.codeplex.com/ CodePlex].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template checks whether a category is 'in use', checking various combinations of whether the category exists (is not a redlink) and is populated (has pages in it).

=== Usage ===

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cat in use|Wikipedia}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{cat in use|Wikipedia}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cat in use|Avpoaihaw}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{cat in use|Avpoaihaw}}

The second parameter can be used to say what kind of comparison is done:
*&lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– returns true if the category exists ''or'' has members
*&lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– true if the category exists ''and'' has members
*&lt;tt&gt;'''xor'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– true if the category exists but is empty, or if the category does not exist but has members (slightly weird, admittedly &lt;tt&gt;:D&lt;/tt&gt;)

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;
This template can be used to add a navigation bar to &quot;assessment by topic&quot; category pages that follow the naming convention &quot;Category:''quality''-quality ''topic'' pages&quot; (e.g. Category:Start-quality history pages) in order to facilitate navigation between the various assessment quality categories for that topic. By default, the template will also add the category to the parent categories &quot;''Topic'' pages by quality&quot; (e.g. History pages by quality) and &quot;''quality''-quality pages&quot; (e.g. Start-quality pages).

==Syntax==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{cat quality
 |topic=
 |quality=
 |sort=
 |parent=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* '''topic''' - set so that your category is, e.g. &quot;''Quality''-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;
* '''quality''' - should be one of ''FB'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''start'', ''stub'', ''NB'', or ''Unassessed''
* '''sort''' (optional) - the key you want to use to sort the category in its parent Category:Foo-quality pages
* '''parent''' (optional) - set so that your importance categories are subcategories of &quot;''parent'' pages by quality&quot;. If not defined, defaults to ''topic''.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

== Usage ==
This template will display, in a horizontal table, the number of pages of each priority, which belong to a particular [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|WikiProject]]. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority
 |topic=
 |project=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the priority categories are: &quot;Foo-priority ''topic'' pages&quot;.
* {{para|project}} (optional) - if defined, a refresh button and the following caption is displayed below the table: &quot;WikiProject ''project'' pages by priority&quot;.

== Examples ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages}}

;Formatting template layout

By using the {{para|format}} tag, you can change the way the template is formatted using one of Wikibooks' defined styles ([[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]). 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}

You can use any of the Wikibooks-defined classes in this parameter. In this example, the switch changes the style from the default ''wikitable'' to the ''toc'' style used in the {{tl|Cat priority}} template. All formatting in the template will be changed to the defined style chosen and cannot be modified.

=== Task force example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Pages by Priority
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |format     = toc
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will generate:

{{Pages by Priority
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |nocat      = yes
 |format     = toc
}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

== Usage ==
This template will display, in a horizontal table, the number of pages of each quality, which belong to a particular [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|WikiProject]]. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality
 |topic=
 |project=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;.
* {{para|project}} (optional) - if defined, a refresh button and the following caption is displayed below the table: &quot;WikiProject ''project'' pages by quality&quot;.

== Examples ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages}}

;Formatting template layout

By using the {{para|format}} tag, you can change the way the template is formatted using one of Wikibooks' defined styles ([[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]). 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}

You can use any of the Wikibooks-defined classes in this parameter. In this example, the switch changes the style from the default ''wikitable'' to the ''toc'' style used in the {{tl|Cat quality}} template. All formatting in the template will be changed to the defined style chosen and cannot be modified.

=== Task force example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Pages by Quality
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |format     = toc
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will generate:

{{Pages by Quality
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |nocat      =yes

      <comment>/* Preface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preface ==
The purpose of this book is to provide practical advice on writing a compiler, together with some practical examples of both compilers and interpreters, in order to break away from the concept that building compilers and interpreters are impossible tasks.

For basic information on the subject, look up the [[Compiler Construction/References|References]] or [[Compiler Construction/External Links|External Links]] Sections of the book and the [[Compiler Construction/Glossary|Glossary]] for the relevant Wikipedia articles.

Some theory is unavoidable, but has been kept to a minimum. If you search the Web for &quot;compiler construction&quot; you will find lots of information and many different approaches. All this book can do is demonstrate a few of the many possible ways of constructing a compiler. After going through this book you should be better able to evaluate other methods.

''This is a Wiki. Readers, please contribute: fix a spelling mistake, rephrase a sentence, expand a paragraph, add a section, write a complete chapter.''

This book has been written in accordance to several goals. The book must be:
* useful and practical - there are several good compiler books available to us, in particular the [[w:Dragon Book (computer science)|Dragon Book]]. However, while technologies for scanners or syntax analyzers have been well-developed and known, we believe that there is a need for a book that covers, for example, script languages or sophisticated dynamic compilation with byte-code.
* non-trivial - this is related to the first goal.
* provides a good coverage of object-oriented languages - 
* have a lot of references - 
* updated - one advantage of an online textbook is that it can be updated to cover new languages or implementation technologies.

We wish the book helps you create a compiler or any tool employing compiler technology.

If you are not familiar with terminology or basic concepts in compilers, you should read the [[Compiler Construction/Introduction|Introduction Chapter]] since the rest of the book will assume it as background information.

== Assumptions ==
;Appropriate Background
To get the most out of this book, your background/experience/capabilities should include most of the following:
* Be familiar with the basic computer architecture, components and execution model.
* Have a few years experience in one or (preferably) more high-level programming languages.
* Be able to cope with programs containing several thousand lines of source code.
* You don't need any specific mathematical background, though some acquaintance with simple algebra might be helpful.
* Programming requires a logical mind capable of precise attention to detail.
* Be prepared to learn about various computer science concepts.  In particular, you should be able to understand EBNF as described in Section 6 of this chapter.  Other concepts will be introduced as required, e.g. stacks, recursion.
* Be prepared to learn about simple [[w:Assembly_language|assembly languages]] and about various aspects of [[w:Computer_architecture|computer architecture]] and [[w:Addressing_mode|addressing modes]].

Even if you do not have the background given above you should still be able to pick up a few ideas by reading the text.

You may be able to implement some or all of the programs supplied in this book. If you have some high-level programming experience you should also be able to play around at extending the capabilities of the interpreter.

;Implementation Software
Since this is a freely available book, it seems appropriate to use some freely available implementation language.

I have chosen to use a subset of C++ in conjunction with the GNU GCC compiler. The subset corresponds roughly to using C++ as a better C, including use of standard C++ libraries, but not getting into the object-oriented side of C++. If you use GNU/Linux then this compiler will/should already be available to you. Otherwise you will have to search the World Wide Web for a free version which will run on your system.

If you use Microsoft Windows then you might like to consider Code::Blocks, a free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the MinGW compiler(a port of GCC), which is available from www.codeblocks.org.

;Simplify the Source Language
To reduce the complexity of this book, we will make some simplifying assumptions about the source language which we write a compiler for:
# The source language does not allow subroutine declarations to be nested.
# All identifiers must be declared before use.
# Syntax analysis of the source language can be done in one pass.
# During syntax analysis, we need only look at the next source token to decide what to do next.
In later chapters we will give more consideration to the effects of relaxing these assumptions.

In practical terms these assumptions mean that the source language is easy to translate using simple techniques,
and that some run-time complexity has been eliminated.
: The first assumption rules out Algol 60 and Pascal.
: The second assumption allows one-pass compilation.
: The third assumption rules out Algol 68; according to Hunter, up to 4 passes may be needed for syntax analysis.
: The second and fourth assumptions rule out Fortran; the following are all valid Fortran statements, but you can't even decide what sort of statement each is until you have looked near/at the end of the statement (in Fortran, spaces are not significant, variables need not be declared, and there are no reserved keywords).

The intent of this book is to arm the reader with knowledge and skills to overcome common sleep problems. The reader may be frustrated by sleeping too much or too little, and by the stress and unsatisfactoriness he/she may feel as a result thereof.

=== Going to Sleep ===



=== Waking Up ===

'''Sleep inertia''' is a physiological state characterized by a decline in motor dexterity and a subjective feeling of grogginess immediately following an abrupt awakening. The impaired alertness may interfere with the ability to perform mental or physical tasks. Sleep inertia can also refer to the tendency of a person to want to return to sleeping.

In other words, it's easy to fall back asleep after the alarm has gone off, often multiple times! How are we to overcome this hindrance? It takes 15-20 minutes for the body to overcome the desire to go back to bed after waking up, the last thing you should do is lie back down in bed! People have many different methods to try wake up on time, however unsuccessful they may be.

One might begin by having multiple alarms at different times, and at different places in the room. Alarms can cause you to have intense sleep inertia if your are not awoken at an arousal point (semi-awake state) during your sleep. The product [http://wakemate.com/ WakeMate] claims to wake you at these arousal points, to avoid sleep inertia. The product monitors motion during sleep, and uses actigraphy to analyze and decide to sound the alarm.

If multiple alarms don't work, it is advised to create some obstacles (chairs and the like) to the alarm clock. Moving the obstacles will take more time and will get your blood flowing a little bit. Stretching (especially around the neck and shoulders) might also help, as the body can become very sore from lying down for so long. If you don't find it easy to fall asleep in a chair, you may set one beside your alarm clock so you may sit for 15-20 min (instead of lying down) and wake up.

=== Polyphasic ===

Polyphasic sleeping refers to trading core sleep for 20-minute naps during the day. The conversion is generally one 20-minute nap for 1.5 hours of core sleep. These naps should be as evenly spaced out as possible, but may be moved according to your schedule.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sleep Schedule !! Total Amount of Sleep (hours) !! Amount of Core Sleep (hours) !! Number of 20-min Naps
|-
| Monophasic || 8 || 8 || none
|-
| Siesta || 6.3 || 6 || 1
|-
| 2-nap Everyman || 5.2 || 3.5 || 2
|-
| 3-nap Everyman || 4 || 3 || 3
|-
| 4-nap Everyman || 2.8 || 1.5 || 4 or 5
|-
| Uberman || 2 || 0 || 6
|-
| Dymaxion || 2 || 0 || 4 30-min naps
|}

The Everyman polyphasic schedule is most common since it can easily be adapted to a normal work schedule. For example, one might sleep from midnight to 3am, taking naps at 7:30, noon, and 6pm. To account for a typical work schedule, the naps are not evenly spaced.

The Uberman is considered the most difficult of the 20-min nap variety. There is no core sleep, and the naps can't be missed by more than 30 minutes or you will feel very tired! This is in contrast to the Everyman schedule, where naps may be missed by a few hours without much consequence.

The Dymaxion is known to be more difficult than the Uberman because the body's tendency to fall into deep sleep after 20 minutes, making it very difficult to wake from a nap.

      <comment>/* Syntax Analysis */  tokens -&gt; Tokens at the start of sentence 2 in paragraph 2. Also a bit of beautifying in paragraph 2.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Syntax Analysis ==
This is alternatively known as parsing. It is roughly the equivalent of checking that some ordinary text written in a natural language (e.g. English) is grammatically correct (without worrying about meaning).

The purpose of syntax analysis or parsing is to check that we have a valid sequence of tokens. Tokens are valid sequence of symbols, keywords, identifiers etc. Note that this sequence need not be meaningful; as far as syntax goes, a phrase such as &quot;'''true''' + 3&quot; is valid but it doesn't make any sense in most programming languages.

The parser takes the tokens produced during the lexical analysis stage, and attempts to build some kind of in-memory structure to represent that input. Frequently, that structure is an 'abstract syntax tree' (AST). 

The parser needs to be able to handle the infinite number of possible valid programs that may be presented to it. The usual way to define the language is to specify a ''grammar''. A grammar is a set of rules (or ''productions'') that specifies the syntax of the language (i.e. what is a valid sentence in the language).

There can be more than one grammar for a given language. Furthermore, it is easier to build parsers for some grammars than for others.

Fortunately, there exists a class of programs (often called `compiler-compilers', even though this is a silly name) that can take a grammar and generate a parser for it in some language. (Sound familiar?). Examples of such programs are:
* ANTLR (targeting Java, C++ and C#)
* SableCC (targeting Java)
* YACC (targeting C)
* YACC++ (targeting C++)
* plus many others....
These can make the compiler-writer's job considerably easier, ''if'' she can write down the grammar for her language.

=== Recursive Descent Parsing ===
A ''recursive descent parser'' is a top-down parser built from a set of mutually-recursive procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such procedure usually implements one of the production rules of the grammar. Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes.

A predictive parser is a recursive descent parser with no backup. Predictive parsing is possible only for the class of LL(k) grammars, which are the context-free grammars for which there exists some positive integer k that allows a recursive descent parser to decide which production to use by examining only the next k tokens of input. (The LL(k) grammars therefore exclude all ambiguous grammars, as well as all grammars that contain left recursion. Any context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar that has no left recursion, but removal of left recursion does not always yield an LL(k) grammar.) A predictive parser runs in linear time.

Recursive descent with backup is a technique that determines which production to use by trying each production in turn. Recursive descent with backup is not limited to LL(k) grammars, but is not guaranteed to terminate unless the grammar is LL(k). Even when they terminate, parsers that use recursive descent with backup may require exponential time.

Although predictive parsers are widely used, programmers often prefer to create LR or LALR parsers via parser generators without transforming the grammar into LL(k) form.

Some authors define the recursive descent parsers as the predictive parsers. Other authors use the term more broadly, to include backed-up recursive descent.[citation needed]

==== Example parser ====
The following [[w:EBNF|EBNF]] grammar (for Niklaus Wirth's PL/0 programming language, from Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs) is in LL(1) form (for simplicity, ident and number are assumed to be terminals):

 program = block &quot;.&quot; .
 
 block =
     [&quot;const&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number {&quot;,&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number} &quot;;&quot;]
     [&quot;var&quot; ident {&quot;,&quot; ident} &quot;;&quot;]
     {&quot;procedure&quot; ident &quot;;&quot; block &quot;;&quot;} statement .
 
 statement =
     [ident &quot;:=&quot; expression
     | &quot;call&quot; ident
     | &quot;begin&quot; statement {&quot;;&quot; statement} &quot;end&quot;
     | &quot;if&quot; condition &quot;then&quot; statement
     | &quot;while&quot; condition &quot;do&quot; statement
     ] .
 
 condition =
     &quot;odd&quot; expression
     | expression (&quot;=&quot;|&quot;#&quot;|&quot;&lt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;=&quot;|&quot;&gt;&quot;|&quot;&gt;=&quot;) expression
     .
 
 expression = [&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;] term {(&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;) term} .
 
 term = factor {(&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;) factor} .
 
 factor = ident | number | &quot;(&quot; expression &quot;)&quot; .

Terminals are expressed in quotes (except for ident and number). Each nonterminal is defined by a rule in the grammar.

Notice how closely the predictive parser below mirrors the grammar above. There is a procedure for each nonterminal in the grammar. Parsing descends in a top-down manner, until the final nonterminal has been processed. The program fragment depends on a global variable, sym, which contains the next symbol from the input, and the global function getsym, which updates sym when called.

==== Implementation in functional languages ====

Recursive descent parsers are particularly easy to implement in functional languages such as Haskell or ML.

=== Table-Driven Parsing ===

=== Operator Precedence Parsing ===
Operator precedence parsing is used in shift-reduce parsing. '''''operator grammar''''' No production has two nonterminal symbols in sequence on the right hand side. An operator grammar can be parsed using shift-reduce parsing and precedence relations between terminal symbols to find handles. This strategy is known as operator precedence.

=== Parsing via a Tool - yacc/bison ===
Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:en:GNU bison|GNU bison]] article.

=== Parsing via a Tool - JavaCC ===

Please refer to Lexical Analysis: Scanning via a Tool - JavaCC for information on generating a token manager.

==== Using the generated Token manager ====

In order to use the generated token manager, an instance of it has to be created. When doing so, the constructor expects a Reader as the source of the input data (other sources are also possible, see the JavaCC documentation).

Once created, the token manager object can be used to get tokens via the 

 Token ''ParserName''TokenManager.getNextToken() throws ParseError;

method.

Each Token object as returned by the getNextToken() method. Such a Token object provides a field ''kind'' which identifies the token (''ParserName'''''Constants.java''' defines the corresponding constants). It also contains the field ''image'', which just holds the matched input data as a String.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intermediate Representation ==
The form of the internal representation among different compilers varies widely. If the back end is called as a subroutine by the front end then the intermediate representation is likely to be some form of annotated parse tree, possibly with supplementary tables.
If the back end operates as a separate program then the intermediate representation is likely to be some low-level pseudo assembly language or some register transfer language (it could be just numbers, but debugging is easier if it is human-readable).

== Optimization ==
On modern computers, a compiler can be considered to have
satisfactory performance if it translates a moderate size source program
(say about 1000 lines) in a matter of seconds.
The way to get a compiler with satisfactory performance
is more or less the same way you would get any program performing well.
* Design using good algorithms.
* Ensure your data structures match the algorithms. 
* Structure using modules with clean simple interfaces.
* Implement using clear straightforward code.
* When there is an overall performance problem
** Measure the actual performance in reasonable detail.
** Identify the troublesome areas.
** Redesign and re-implement these problem areas.

In this book we will consider
various algorithms and data structures
and discuss their likely impact on performance.

Note that '''actual measurement is crucial''',
since the problems are often not where you guess they might be.
For your initial implementation
you may well have selected simple algorithms
which are known to perform poorly
in order to get something working quickly.
Nevertheless, you should still measure performance in detail,
since there may be some other source
of (at least some of) your problems.

: If you are very lucky, your implementation language might have some optional facility for selectively measuring CPU time. Take care to only activate such a feature for a few crucial routines; the timing overhead could easily exceed the execution time for small routines and distort the result.

: More commonly you will be unlucky and will have to explicitly add timing code to selected routines; make sure you can easily disable it and enable it as required. Typically you will have to insert calls to some CPU timing routine at the beginning and end of a routine, and then subtract the two values to get the time for that routine, which will include the time for any routines called by it.

Various measurements on the performance of actual compilers
have been reported over the years.
Specific areas which have been known to cause problems include:
* Multiple routine calls during lexical analysis for each and every source character.
* Skipping white space during lexical analysis.
* Skipping over a comment.
* Decoding a tightly packed parse table during syntax analysis.
* Looking things up in the name table during semantic analysis.
* Determining whether some name is a reserved keyword or a user-definable identifier.

An extensive list of optimizations can be found on Wikipedia in the [[wikipedia:Compiler optimization|compiler optimization article]]. Optimization is a very rich and complex topic, so this chapter will only attempt to introduce the basics.

Optimization within a compiler is concerned with improving in some way the generated object code '''while ensuring the result is identical'''. Technically, a better name for this chapter might be &quot;Improvement&quot;, since compilers only attempt to improve the operations the programmer has requested. Optimizations fall into three categories:

* '''Speed'''; improving the runtime performance of the generated object code. This is the most common optimization
* '''Space'''; reducing the size of the generated object code
* '''Safety'''; reducing the possibility of data structures becoming corrupted (for example, ensuring that an illegal array element is not written to)

Unfortunately, many &quot;speed&quot; optimizations make the code larger, and many &quot;space&quot; optimizations make the code slower -- this is known as the [[w:space-time tradeoff|space-time tradeoff]].

===Common Optimization Algorithms===
Common optimization algorithms deal with specific cases:

# Dead Code Elimination
# Common Sub-expression Elimination
# Copy Propagation
# Code Motion
# Induction Variable Elimination
# Reduction In Strength
# Function Chunking

==== Dead Code Elimination ====
Dead code elimination is a size optimization (although it also produces some speed improvement) that aims to remove logically impossible statements from the generated object code. Dead code is code which will never execute, regardless of input

Consider the following program:
 a = 5
 if (a != 5) {
   // Some complicated calculation
 }
 ...

It is obvious that the complicated calculation will never be performed; since the last value assigned to '''a''' before the '''if''' statement is a constant, we can calculate the result at compile-time. simple substitution of arguments produces &lt;code&gt;if (5 != 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which is '''false'''. Since the body of an &lt;code&gt;if(false)&lt;/code&gt; statement will never execute - it is ''dead code'' we can rewrite the code:
 a = 5
 // Some statements

The algorithm was used to identify and remove sections of dead code

==== Common Sub-expression Elimination ====
Common sub-expression elimination is a speed optimization that aims to reduce unnecessary recalculation by identifying, through code-flow, expressions (or parts of expressions) which will evaluate to the same value: ''the re-computation of an expression can be avoided if the expression has previously been computed and the values of the operands have not changed since the previous computation''.

Consider the following program:
 a = b + c
 d = e + f
 g = b + c

In the above example, the first and last statement's right hand side are identical and the value of the operands do not change between the two statements; thus this expression can be considered as having a ''common sub-expression''.

The common sub-expression can be avoided by storing its value in a temporary variable which can cache its result. After applying this Common Sub-expression Elimination technique the program becomes:
 t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = b + c
 a = t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
 d = e + f
 g = t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus in the last statement the re-computation of the expression &lt;code&gt;b + c&lt;/code&gt; is avoided.

== Copy Propagation ==
Given an assignment x=y,replace later uses of x with y,provided there are no intervening assignments to x or y.
Here the code will become smaller.
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        x[i]=a;
        sum=x[i]+a;
        
        instead of this we can use:
        x[i]=a;
        sum=a+a; 
      
&lt;/source&gt;

  For x[i]=a, is copy statements.Use of 'a' for 'x[i]',
 whenever possible after copy statement.Here it may not
 appear to be code improvement,but opens up scope
 for other optimizations.


==== Code Motion ====
{{wikipedia|loop-invariant code motion}}

This optimization technique mainly deals to reduce the number of source code lines in the program. For example, consider the code below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    x = y + z;
    a[i] = 6 * i + x * x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The calculations &lt;code&gt;x = y + z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x * x&lt;/code&gt; can be moved outside the loop since within they are loop invariant - they do not change over the iterations of the loop - so our optimized code will be something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
x = y + z;
t1 = x * x;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    a[i] = 6 * i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code can be optimized further. For example, [[#Reduction In Strength | strength reduction]] could remove the two multiplications inside the loop (&lt;code&gt;6*i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;).

Another example of code motion:

 for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)
 {
   a = a + c;
 }

In the above mentioned code, a = a + c can be moved out of the 'for' loop, and the new code is

 a = a + 10*c;

==== Induction Variable Elimination ====
A variable is said to be  induction variable if this gets increased and decreased by a fixed amount on every iteration of a loop.
ex: 
       for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
        {
         j=17*i;
        }
Here i,j are induction variables 
If two or more induction variables in loop, it may be possible to get rid of all but one. 
Eventually we can eliminate j from this loop.

==== Reduction In Strength ====
This concept refers to the compiler optimization method of substituting some machine instruction(s) by cheaper one(s) maintaining equivalence in results. Since some operators have different strength i.e use different space in the memory. This type of optimization can generate high gains especially when targeting different hardware and the compiler is aware of the subtle differences it can benefit from.

'''For ex- Strength of *(Multiply) is &quot;Higher&quot; than +(Add).&lt;br /&gt;
So,in this type of optimization Higher Strength Operators are replaced by Lower Strength Operators.'''
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example'''&lt;br /&gt;
Given that &lt;br /&gt;
Length(S1 || S2) &lt;br /&gt;
where S1 and S2 have some values.&lt;br /&gt;

So If we apply the rule then&lt;br /&gt;
Length(S1 || S2) ---(Replaced By)--&gt; [Length(S1) + Length(S2)]&lt;br /&gt;

As + operation is cheaper than the ||.&lt;br /&gt;
and it was Cleared by the above example that there will no change in Result.

==== Function Chunking ====
Function chunking is a compiler optimization for improving code locality. Profiling information is used to move rarely executed code outside of the main function body. This allows for memory pages with rarely executed code to be swapped out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Known Languages Conceptual Implementations ==
Since this book is about the compiler, the following studies do not detail much syntax or language designs but implementation techniques. If you are familiar with languages below, it may help understand compilers by understanding how those familiar concepts (like dynamic binding) are implemented.

Furthermore, we don't consider practical implication of decisions on the language design. Some tricky situations, like problems of reference dependency or the precedence of operators, may not occur most of the times, but those are often the interests of language implementors.

''&lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot; xml:lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;Mucuna pruriens&lt;/span&gt;'' commonly known as cowitch or velvet bean is sometimes used as a coffee substitute, however, cooking leaches out chemical compounds such as levodopa (L-DOPA). If consumed in large quantities as food, unprocessed they are toxic to non-ruminant mammals, including humans.

This recipe shows how to leech out dangerous toxins while still keeping the nutrient enzymes and L-DOPA that have long been used in traditional Ayurvedic Indian medicine for diseases including Parkinson's Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

#Put 1⅛ (1.125) cups (265½ [265.5] mL) of almonds, ½ (0.5) cup (118 mL) cowitch and ½ (0.5) cup (118 mL) almonds seperatly into three (3) bowls of water. Make sure they are covered completely underneath at least one (1) inch (2&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;²⁷⁄&lt;big&gt;₅₀&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [2.54] cm) of water. This is called sprouting or steeping. Leave them in the refrigerator overnight, and then drain the water. Absolutely do not drink this water, since it has absorbed many of the toxins.
#Put the 1⅛ cups of almonds from the previous step into a blender and add 3⅜ (3.375) cups (796½ [796.5] mL) of fresh water. The mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand. You may either discard the pulp or use it for other recipes, such as mixing it into almond [[Cookbook:Agar Jelly|agar jelly]]. Wash and dry your hands, and then pour the almond milk into ice cube trays. Place the ice cube trays into the freezer and remove when frozen.
#Now put the rest of the almonds and cowitch with three (3) cups (708 mL) of fresh water into the blender. Just like before, this mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can in the same way as you did in the previous step. Discard the pulp, and absolutely do not eat it, since it has many toxins. Do not drink or taste the liquid at this point. Wash and dry your hands, and put this liquid back in the blender. Blend in the dates, matcha and milk thistle. If you are only going to make part of the mixture now, refrigerate what you’re not going to use and save for later in the refrigerator. 
#When well blended, pulse the liquid mixture with ice made from the almond milk until you reach the consistency you desire. Serve immediately.

== Variations ==
Instead of making [[Cookbook:Almond Milk|raw almond milk]] from scratch, you could simply purchase almond milk or use cow’s milk. Just bear in mind using cow’s milk would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you. There is a recipe for cooked almond milk, [[Cookbook:Sharbat bil Loz|Sharbat bil Loz]], that involves a stove, although that is not advisable, as that will destroy the food enzymes in the almond milk.

Unlike dates, artificial sweeteners usually do not have any nutrients. If you would like to substitute the dates for something else, try natural sweeteners, such or stevia or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] instead of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or syrup, if you can. Just bear in mind using honey would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you.

If you do not have milk thistle, you can empty one serving of a liver/organ support/shield or milk thistle supplement, such as a 200 mg (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;²²⁄&lt;big&gt;₃₁₂₅&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [0.00704] oz) serving of milk thistle capsules, into the mixture by simply twisting open the capsules with your dry hands.

== Warnings ==
*Do not to use bitter almonds, since the combination of bitter almonds and water releases cyanide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter Almond&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Bitter Almonds
|accessdate=2009-05-14
|publisher=revolutionhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do not keep for the mixture from step 3 above for more than two (2) days, since it spoils quickly. It's best to make it fresh.
*Do not exceed three (3) servings per day.

This section should be where you are going to plan out your entire system before you build it.  It doesn't always work out this way and you might find yourself coming back and changing things as you actually code your project.  It is not recommended to write the design before you have done some coding.  From your Analysis you should have an idea of what you are going to produce and have sourced some text books to get you started.  Complete a couple of simple example programs before writing your Design, this way you'll have a better idea of the capabilities of the language you are using.  And remember, don't be afraid to come back and change things!

== Sections to Include ==
To get full marks you should aim to write something about all of the following.  Some projects won't require all sections, for example you might not have a database and therefore have no need to include SQL.  It's always best to check with your teacher about what you need to include.

===Overall System Design===

To give a clear idea of how we are going to complete our project it's a good idea to use an IPSO chart.  IPSO stands for Input, Process, Storage, Output.  Every project should have information under these headings. An example is below:
* Input - these might include various types of human interaction and loading data from external sources such as databases, web feeds, scientific instruments etc.
* Process - this is the important bit.  What are you going to process, what is it going to calculate?
* Storage - this will record all the ways that you are going to store data, it might include database table names, structure names and external files such as xml and csv.
* Output - What will the end user be given, what will be output to the screen?

Let's take a look at an example:

|-
! Inputs
! Processes
! Storage
! Outputs
|-
| User Details&lt;/br&gt;New purchase
| Monthly sales&lt;/br&gt;Highest performing Salesperson&lt;/br&gt;Highest paying customer
| Database tables:&lt;/br&gt;Customer&lt;/br&gt;Stock Item&lt;/br&gt;Purchase
| Receipt&lt;/br&gt;Monthly sales chart
|}

===Modular Design===
When you design your system you need to split it into smaller components. Like this book having different chapters about different things, your project should have different parts (modules) that do different things, but when they are combined they make up a complete whole.

There are two ways to split your project into modules, one is code based and the other is form based.  Ideally your project should be using both methods. 
====Form/Navigation Based====
If your program has lots of different functionality and uses a website or an application you probably have different pages to perform different tasks.  You are also able to navigate from one page to another starting at your main menu.  You need to show the different forms/pages that you use and how you would get from one to another:
[[Image:Files11_directory_hierarchy.svg|thumb|150px]]
*Main Menu
**Adjust Products
***Add Products
***Remove Products
***Update Products
**Sell Item
**Adjust Staff
***Add Staff
***Remove Staff
***Update Staff
**Reports
***Chocolates
***Beer
***Sausages
Even better than this you could draw a nice diagram on how everything links together.

====Code Based====
If you are writing a very complicated coding project then you might be using modules of code, some modules that build off other modules.  You might also be using Classes and you need to show the class inheritance diagrams

===Definition of data requirements (Design Data Dictionary)===
Incredibly similar to your Analysis.  If you haven't made any changes since then and it is normalised, just copy the data into here.  You'll have to do a little more work in a second on the validation areas.

===Definition of record structure===
If you are saving anything to text files or XML files mention here how those files are organised.

If you are using records or structures in your code mention them here and how they work

===Validation required===
If you are getting the user to input data you will definitely need to validate the data that they insert.  For example if you are getting them to fill in a new customer record you will have fields such as Title, First Name, Date of Birth, Number of toes.  You want them to input data such as:
 Mr.
 Peter
 16/07/93
 9
And what will happen if they type in the following:
 Mrr.
 Peter8
 jelly
 -8
Well it'll probably break your system, we need to prevent them from entering '''garbage''' into our system. If we allow rubbish data our calculations won't work, our reports will be wrong and the data will be useless. Remember this rule:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Garbage In, Garbage Out&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To prevent '''garbage''' being input we are going to validate, that means check, each item of data that a person inputs into the system.  We can do this in many ways
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Validation Check !! Description !! Suitable Applicable Field !! Valid data !! Erroneous Data
|-
| Datatype || Checks that only a certain data type is inserted into a field.  Such as a date or an integer || date of birth || 18/02/97 || 13/13/13 or &quot;clot&quot;
|-
| Length || Checks that the data entered has the correct number of characters. For example a British phone number is always 11 characters, or the ID of a shopping item might always be 5 characters || Postcode || E4 7HJ || EEE668 JUY
|-
| Range || Checks that the data is within a set range, being greater than, less than, between, etc. For example the age of someone will be greater than 0, the number of days in a month would be greater or equal to 28 and less than 31. || Number of kidneys || 2 || 45
|-
| Presence || This is when you need to make inputting data compulsory, the user isn't allowed to miss a field out.  For example, they must state whether they agree or disagree with a legal statement, they must enter a postcode || Phone number || 07070707070 || (blank)
|-
| Lookup/List || This is when you only allow set values into a field.  For example a Title would only allow for &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Miss.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;.  Anything else would be erroneous.  You can implement this normally by using a drop down list || Gender || Female || Jackal
|}
Most of these validation checks are built into database packages, so if you create a database and then use a development suite to create the forms, the validation will be built into the forms automatically.  If you don't have this privilege, you'll have to hard code it.  That of course will come in the Technical Solution stage.  Let's take a look at our original garbage data, did we manage to use validation to stop all the nonsense getting into our database?
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name !! Validation Checks !! Description !! Error message !! Data !! Caught 
|-
| Title || Lookup (&quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Miss.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;) || only allow correct formatted titles || Please insert a valid Title || Mrr. || Yes
|-
| First Name ||  Presence || make sure name is a sensible length and present || Please insert a name || Peter8 || No, we can't catch people being purposely malicious, you could try and code some checks but beware of the '[[w:Scunthorpe_problem | Scunthorpe problem]]'!
|-
| Date of Birth || Datatype(Date)|| Make sure they have input a correct DoB || Please insert a valid date || jelly || Yes
|-
| Number of toes || 14 &gt; Length &gt;= 0 || Make sure they have a sensible number of toes || Please insert a number between 0 and 13 || -8 || Yes
|}
For your report you need to write a table like the one above, though you can omit the last two columns.

{{CPTExtension|title=Validation notation: Regex}}
When you are trying to enforce a format to data being input, you might want to use validation notation.  For example if you want to specify that a class name must be a two digit number followed by three letters, for example 12PKP, You could write:
:&lt;number&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;letter&gt;&lt;letter&gt;&lt;letter&gt;
Or even more simply:
:99LLL

The regex expression equivilent could be:
:/^[0-9][0-9][a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]$/
or
:/^[0-9]{2}[a-zA-Z]{3}$/
{{Robox/Close}}

===File organisation and processing (if appropriate)===
*File sizes
*Data Volumes

===Database design including normalised relations (if appropriate)===
If you are making a database then you need to include an E-R Diagram.  You should show the diagram and explain what each of the relationships mean. For example:

* A student can have many bookings
* Each booking only has one student
* Each booking only has one book
* A book can be involved in many bookings

===Sample of planned SQL queries (if appropriate)===
If you are making a database you need to write about the SQL that you use to '''SELECT''', '''INSERT''', '''UPDATE''' and '''DELETE''' things from your tables.  In some cases you might also be writing the code behind making the individual tables, the data definition language.  In fact those headings are exactly what you need to use.

{{CPTExtension|title=Reserved words}}
When you are querying your database you might get some unexpected errors, where a query fails to run when it doesn't appear to have any problem with it.  This may be due to using a resevered word in your query.  SQL has a lot of reserved words, words that have special meanings, and if you use one of these in a query it '''won't''' treat it as a field name.  For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
SELECT Username, Password FROM tblUsers
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This might bring up an error as &lt;code&gt;Password&lt;/code&gt; is a reserved word in SQL.  To get by this problem you might want to change your fieldnames to something a little more sensible or put the fieldname in square brackets:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
SELECT Username, [Password] FROM tblUsers
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
There are many other reserved words out there, so be careful:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
PERCENT, PLAN, PRECISION, EXISTS, PRIMARY, PRINT, PUBLIC,
BACKUP, FOREIGN, READ,FREETEXT, FROM, REFERENCES, BULK, 
FULL, RESTORE, GROUP, IDENTITY, RULE, SAVE, INDEX, SELECT, 
STATISTICS, KEY, TABLE, NATIONAL, DATABASE, UNION, DELETE, 
DISK, ON, USER, PASSWORD&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Different databases have different sets of reserved words, you can find a good list [http://drupal.org/node/141051 here]

Note: If you are not using a SQL server (for example, using MySQL with PHP) you may need to use `backticks` instead of square bracket notation.
{{Robox/Close}}

====SELECT====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that returns selections of records.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement selects the details (ID, Name, Price, Description) of a product which has been selected by the user.  So that the user can view the product detail on the preview screen before buying the product

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
SELECT ID, Name, Price, Description FROM Products
WHERE ID=?
&lt;/source&gt;

====INSERT====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that inserts new records into your database.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement adds a new high score along with the date the score was achieved for a users account.

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
INSERT INTO Scores (ID, DateofScore, Score)
VALUES (?,?,?)
&lt;/source&gt;

====UPDATE====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that updates an old record with new details.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement updates the date of birth of a user, after they have updated the form that launches when they first log into the program.

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
UPDATE User
SET DoB=?
WHERE ID=?
&lt;/source&gt;


====Data Definition Language====
If you have designed your database tables using a program such as [[w:Open_ModelSphere|Open ModelSphere]] you can then define the code behind making your tables which you can then feed into MySQL or MSSQL to create your database.  Get some credit for this and list your DDL. For example, the command to create a table named '''employees''' with a few sample columns would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE employees (   
    id            INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name    CHAR(50)  null,
    last_name     CHAR(75)  not null,
    dateofbirth   DATE      null
);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Identification of storage media===
This is quite easy if you remember the hardware section of [[../../Computer Components, The Stored Program Concept and the Internet/Hardware Devices#Secondary_Storage_Devices|Unit 2]].  You must recommend how your system will be '''distributed''' to and then '''run''' by the user.

You need to start off by calculating how much space the program will take up to distribute and how much space it will take up when it is running.

Distributing your software will require that you transmit the data to the user somehow.  This could be through a CD-ROM, USB drive, DVD-ROM or internet connection.  Why would you pick each?  Which would be most suitable?  Think about security, speed, having a backup, size of files to transmit.

Running the system will in most cases require the user to be able to write new files to your system, saving high scores, new purchases etc.  How big will the system feasibly get?  You need to recommend something that will allow the user to read and write to, something that is secure and reliable, and something that will be big enough and fast enough to handle everything. A CD-ROM would not be suitable here, why?  Hard Disks could be suitable, why?

===Identification of suitable algorithms for data transformation, pseudocode of these algorithms===
You will be asked to provide examples of designing your code. If you have lots of code then pick the 6-8 most interesting examples.  For each bit of code try to include the following:

* Title
* Plain English explanation
* Pseudo code

For example with a log in screen you could write the following:
====Plain English====
This code takes the username and password input by the user and then checks them against the login details stored in the login file.

====Pseudo Code====
var userName = Textbox.username
var password = Textbox.password

load the acceptable login names and passwords from the text file and store it into var acceptableLogins

If userName and password are in acceptableLogins Then
:Login Allowed
:Show Menu screen
Else
:Show error message
End If

===Class definitions(diagrams) and detail of object behaviours and methods (if appropriate)===
[[Image:Oop-uml-class-example.png|thumb|this is a simple diagram, you would have to explain each of the attributes and subroutines]]
If you have used Object Orientation in writing your program (highly recommended to get in the top mark band) you need to describe it here.  You must mention the following:
* Class names
* Any inheritance
* Attributes (variables) and whether they are public or private, explaining what they are for
* Function names with return values and description
* Procedures names with return values and description
* Any overriding performed

===User interface design (HCI) rationale===
In all projects you will have some form of user interface, in nearly all cases this will be a [[w:GUI | GUI]].  This section actions you to show and explain the methods that you are going to capture data (inputs), and the ways you are going to display/print out data(outputs).  Notice in each case it says sample, so you don't have to show how every form/prinout will look, 4 examples of each should suffice.  You could hand draw each, or draw them using an arts package like inkscape, alternatively you could design them in a package like Visual Studio and use the design views of the form.  DO NOT use screen shots of the final code running, we need to see your designs.

====UI sample of planned data capture and entry designs====
This section need to show the designs of your forms / interfaces.  Don't be afraid to include early screen shots of forms in design view.  Remember we are not marking this section on working code, but on the design ideas behind each form / interface.  You must mention your reasoning:
* Tick Boxes / radio buttons
* Drop down lists
* positioning of elements
* colour schemes
* ease of navigation

You can do this by annotating each screen shot.

====UI sample of planned valid output designs====
This might be one or more of several things:
* the designs of reports that your system is planned to produce
* the high score board of a game or quiz
* the game screen showing points health etc.
* a graph showing data
* anything that is calculated and shown to the user

Using the same rationale as the previous section you must complete annotated versions of these.

===Description of measures planned for security and integrity of data===
Security and integrity are slightly different things.

'''Security''' means preventing unauthorised people accessing areas of your work.   This might include students accessing each others marks for a test, customers accessing other customers' details, students accessing the marks to a test or anything that conflicts with the data protection act.  To do this you need to implement security systems such as usernames and passwords, access rights and restricted areas.  You might have certain buttons and areas that only appear for certain users.  If they are restricted users there will be parts of your system that they wont see, and for the admin user, they should be able to see everything.

'''Integrity''' is making sure that your data doesn't 'corrupt'.  This means making sure that certain bits of data always take on the correct format or don't violate certain rules.  For example, if you had a date of birth, you wouldn't want people to be inserting their name in that field.  How do you do this?  With validation rules.  Write about them here.  You might also want to make sure that your database maintains its [[w:referential integrity | referential integrity]].  This will prevent people linking to records in other tables that don't exist.  Talk about how you would do this.

===Description of measures planned for system security===
You don't want unauthorised people gaining access to your data.  This might include stalkers trying to find out personal details stored on your system, students trying to cheat etc. You might recommend that the end user keeps data in secure locations or behind operating system passwords.  Or that there is a main password to get into your system.

You should also mention how the system will be recovered in the circumstance that it becomes corrupted or lost.  Mention the method by which you will recover the system/reinstall etc.

===Overall test strategy===
There are several different ways that you could test your system.  This section asks you to consider each and mention how you are going to test your system with regard to each.  Don't just describe each, you must talk about how you will use them to test your system

====Black-box testing====
[[File:Blackbox.svg|thumb|200px|Black box testing diagram]]
In this mode you don't care about the code behind what you are testing, you just know what results should come about from particular data inputs.  This is useful for complex sub routines that have multiple possible inputs. For example testing a search algorithm.  If you do come across any problems then you will have to find and fix them for that we use...

====White-box testing====
[[File:CPT-Testing-Whitebox.svg|thumb|200px|White box testing diagram, where each coloured line is a route through the code]]
In this you are going to test as many routes 'through' your code as you can.  This means looking at your code and trying to come up with tests that will test every logical statement that you have written.  For example if you have an if statement that checks if a password is correct or not, put a test in place to see if it works when the correct password is inserted '''AND''' when an incorrect password is inserted. Things you should include:
*If statements
*While loops

====Trace tables====
This is a great way to find and fix problems.  You should try to pick two or three of your most complex pieces of code to perform a trace table upon.  By using this you prove that the code works.

== Tor (The Onion Router) ==
: Tor is a virtual computers network makes almost anonymoust internet access.
: It can be used with web browsers, instant messengers or IRC networks.
: But some internet providers can block access to Tor network.
::1. To have the lastes version of Tor add Tor project repositories:
 sux
 mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
 deb http://mirror.noreply.org/pub/tor sid main
::2. Next receive public key:
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 94C09C7F
 gpg --export 94C09C7F | apt-key add -
::3. And install &quot;tor&quot; and &quot;polipo&quot; packages:
 apt-get update
 apt-get install tor tor-geoipdb polipo
::4. Download &quot;polipo&quot; config file from the project page (Save link as...):
::: https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf
::5. Change the file name from &quot;polipo.conf&quot; for &quot;config&quot;.
::6. Move it out as root to folder :
 /etc/polipo/ 
::7. Re-start polipo with command as root:
 /etc/init.d/polipo restart
::8. Install &quot;Tor Button&quot; add-on for Iceweasel web browser from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275/
::: and re-start Iceweasel.
::9. Check your IP address for example here: http://www.checkip.org/
::10. Then click on the TOR button (or an onion icon) in down right corner and check IP again ;-)

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Imagine that once you have delivered your project to your user they want to pay someone else to make improvements on it.  This is very common in industry where IT projects can be decades old (The IBM [[w:CICS#History|CICS]] product was first released in 1969, it's still going strong).  So that other people can take over your project you need to provide them with decent documentation so they can understand what everything does.  For this you need to make your System Maintenance.

===System Overview===
The first thing a person inheriting an old system would like to see is a brief overview of all the components, that is what we are providing here.
* Structural Overview of how different forms link together
* You are going to list all the forms / modules / classes and describe what each does.
* If applicable include an inheritance diagram
* If applicable include an E-R Diagram
* You are then going to list the different sub routines on each of the forms / modules / classes and describe what each one of them does mentioning any return values or parameters

===Detailed Algorithm Design=== 
You need to include some examples of your most complicated algorithms and how you built them.  It's recommended that you include as much evidence of your coding skill as possible but in some cases this will be very difficult as you will have produced so much code that it's impossible to fully describe all of it.  Ten complex pieces of code should suffice.

For each piece of code include 3 sections
*Plain English description of what the code does
*Pseudo Code outline of the code
*Real code well laid out with comments where necessary

For example:

&lt;u&gt;Plain English&lt;/u&gt;

This piece of code works out the average price of a selection of chocolate bars.  To do this I should first of all use SQL to find all the chocolate bars from the Products table. I will then add all the prices together and divide the total by the number of chocolate bars to get an average price.

&lt;u&gt;Pseudo Code&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Items = (SELECT Product Price FROM products WHERE ProductType = ChocolateBar)

For Each Item
  Count increases
  TotalPrice = TotalPrice + Item.Price
Next Item

Output Average = TotalPrice / Count
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Real Code&lt;/u&gt;

..
..
..

=== Procedure and variable Lists ===
For each Module and Form that you create you should have code sitting behind it. This section will give the marker an overview of the different coding components of your project, keep in mind variable datatypes and their 'bit' capacity i.e using a character instead of a string.

For example:

&lt;u&gt;Module Sweet Form&lt;/u&gt;

This Module calculates a variety of statistics and presents reports for all the sweets and chocolate stored in the database

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Procedures / Functions
|-
! Access
! Name
! Description
! Parameters
! Outputs / returned values
|-
| Public
| AverageChoc
| Calculates the average price of a chocolate bar and outputs the value
| None
| The average price is printed to the screen
|}


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Variables
|-
! Access
! Name
! Type
! Description
|-
| Private
| NumChocBars
| Integer
| This stores the number of chocolate bars currently in stock
|}

===Annotated listings of program code / macro code and tailoring===
This is where you provide the marker with all of your code.  As we mentioned earlier it should be quite easy to understand already as you used sensible names, indentation and comments.  This section is going to allow the marker to see all that hard work, with a little annotation where anything isn't 100% clear.  If you have included this in your technical solution, then please provide a link.

===Database tables in design view===

If you have used a program to make your database tables then show them in design view, making sure that people can see the data types.

If you have used DDL copy it here.

This is the real thing, where you get marked on the code that you have written.  Notice that the program without any writeup is worth only 31% of the overall unit.  However, you need this section to complete the other parts of the project and this section will almost certainly take you longer than any other section of this Unit.  Below are a couple of quick tips on getting top marks in this section plus some links to programming help guides:

=== Don't just use built in functions ===
In the good old days students could get a decent mark by making a project in Access and using wizards to do all the functionality. This is no longer the case and if you do that you will get a very low mark.  '''You must write your own code and sub routines'''.  Handing in page after page of automatically generated code will get you no marks.  Write your own algorithms and take credit for it!

===(Database) Normalise Data===
[[Image:ERD-artist-performs-song.svg|thumb|320px|Two related entities shown using Crow's Foot notation]]
Make sure that all your database tables are normalised.  If they aren't you will lose marks in the [[../Design/]] Section and your project will be very hard to get working.  A quick way to test this is to see if your E-R Diagram only has 1-Many relationships.  If you use anything else then you will be running into trouble.

===(Object Orientation) Make sure you use Encapsulation appropriately===
If you are building your own code classes make sure that you don't allow users direct access to any variables and that they use the appropriate get and set routines.  Don't make everything public!  If you can, use inheritance.  By implementing these things you'll find the exam much easier.

=== Use sensible variable datatypes ===
Make sure that the datatype you use are sensible.  You will get marked down for using the wrong datatypes in your database tables and variables.

For example:
If you are recording the total number of chocolate bars in a shop you don't need to use a Long or Float,  you can only have whole numbers of chocolate bars and it is unlikely you'll have over a few million items.  Use an Integer!

=== Use sensible variable names ===
If you are using variables to store things they must have a name that makes sense so you know what it does when you read its name in your code.  

For example:
If you are recording the total number of chocolate bars in a shop you don't want to use a name like variable1.  What does variable1 mean?  Use a sensible name such as NumChoc.

=== Use sensible Function/Procedure names ===
If you are creating subroutines to process things in your code make sure you give them a sensible name so that people know what they are doing when they see them in the code.

For example:
If you have written a piece of code to calculate the average price of a chocolate bar then don't call it FuncitonA(), what does FunctionA() mean?!  Call it ChocAverage().

===Try to stick to one naming convention===
If you are using lots of variable names and function names, stick to a single style for naming them.  If you use lots of different conventions things are going to look ugly. [[w:Identifier_naming_convention|Wikipedia guidance]]

For example:

*firstName, lastName, calculateDoB, numLegs
*FirstName, LastName, CalculateDoB, NumLegs
*First_Name, Last_Name, Calculate_DoB, Num_Legs

===Don't make your names too long===
Long variables can be very hard to read and much easier for you to make mistakes when writing them, try to shorten things where possible.

For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Too Long
! Just Right
|-
| ThisIsYourFirstName
| FirstName
|-
| the_value_of_a_chocolate_bar 
| ChocVal
|}

===When using forms prefix toolbox type===
When you are using forms and lots of variables at the same time it can sometimes get very confusing whether you are talking about a variable price or the text box that stores the price.  Get past this using prefixes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Form Object
! prefix
! example
|-
| Text box
| txt
| txtFirstName
|-
| Button
| btn
| btnSubmit
|-
| Radio button
| rdo
| rdoOverEighteen
|-
| Check box
| chk
| chkAgree
|-
| Image Element
| img
| imgLogo
|-
| Timer
| tmr
| tmrLogOut
|-
| Label
| lbl
| lblIntroduction
|-
| Standard variable
| [none]
| ChocNumber
|}
 
=== Indent your work ===
A lot of programming environments help to indent your code automatically and you should be able to find one for the language you are using. Indenting helps people to quickly read and understand your code as it clearly shows the structure of functions, procedures, selection and iteration statements.
For example the following is very hard to read:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
...
while (x == y) {
something();
somethingelse();
if (some_error)
do_correct();
else
continue_as_usual();
}
finalthing();
...
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If you indent it, it becomes much easier to read:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ...
    while (x == y) {
        something();
        somethingelse();
        if (some_error)
            do_correct();
        else
            continue_as_usual();
    }
    finalthing();
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Use comments where necessary ===
Some of the best written code doesn't need comments because if you have structured it correctly and used all the proper naming conventions it should be pretty easy to read.  However for the code you are writing you should put some comments to explain what each section does.


&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
'this function takes an array of prices and outputs the average
function calculateAverage(num1(20) as integer)
{
    'add all the numbers together
    while ...
          ...
          ...
    end while
    
    console.writeline(average)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===What to submit===
You need to provide all the code that you have written. For each of your forms provide:
* Title
* Screen shot
* Code

For each of your modules/classes provide:
* Title
* Code

For any database tables you have made, provide screen shots in design view of mySQL or Access

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Quality of Writing}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Having written this text book, I've come to discover that Quality of Writing is something that people find very important.  If it isn't well written and presented then you are going to find it very hard to read and you probably wouldn't recommend it to your friends.  It's exactly the same with your coursework, but if you don't present your work very well then you are going to lose marks and get your teacher very cross.  Overall this section is only worth 3 marks, but these are also the 3 easiest marks in the entire Unit.  If you follow the guidelines below then you are almost guaranteed to get them.
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:252px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:240px;&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;

It came with my Pea Sea.&lt;br /&gt;
It plane lee marks four my revue&lt;br /&gt;
Miss Steaks I can knot sea.

Eye strike the quays and type a whirred &lt;br /&gt;
And weight four it two say &lt;br /&gt;
Weather eye am write oar wrong &lt;br /&gt;
It tells me straight a weigh.

Eye ran this poem threw it,&lt;br /&gt;
Your shore real glad two no.&lt;br /&gt;

My chequer tolled me sew.

A chequer is a bless thing,&lt;br /&gt;
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.&lt;br /&gt;
It helps me right all stiles of righting,&lt;br /&gt;
And aides me when eye rime.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;
The original version of this poem was written by Jerrold H. Zar in 1992.  An unsophisticated spell checker will find little or no fault with this poem because it checks words in isolation.  A more sophisticated spell checker will make use of a [[w:language model | language model]] to consider the context in which a word occurs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


===Use a Word Processor===
This seems pretty obvious.  A lot of schools/colleges use Microsoft Office and Word, check to see if you can get a cheap copy of that.  Alternatively you can [http://download.openoffice.org/ download] [[w:OpenOffice|OpenOffice]] for free!  It does everything you will need to write a top marks report.  If you want to be really clever and write something in [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]] then feel free, but it's probably not worth the effort right now.

===Use a footer===
You get given marks for having footers on your work. This needs to include the following:

&lt;center&gt;'''Your Name''' | '''The title of the Project''' | '''The page number'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''P Kemp''' | '''My Amazing Fruit Stall Database''' | '''12/97'''&lt;/center&gt;

*[http://wordprocessing.about.com/od/wordprocessingsoftware/l/blheadfoot.htm Footers in Word]
*[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Getting_Started/Creating_headers_and_footers Footers in OpenOffice]

===Check your Spelling and Grammar===
This is pretty obvious and should be easy enough to do as spelling mistakes are normally highlighted with little red squiggly lines. However, as you can see to the right there are some errors that your spell checker can't pick up.  You have to proof read it!

===Proof read===
Before every draft you hand in, and especially before your final deadline, proof read your work.  This means sitting down and reading through everything you have written.  You will be amazed at how many little mistakes you made without realising it.  Even better, get a friend or member of your family to read it.  If they can understand it then you are sure that the examiner will be able to understand it and you will get all the marks that you deserve.

DO NOT rely on your teacher to proof read your work, they have a lot to mark and might get annoyed with you.  It is far better to ask them to give you ideas on how to improve your technical work than asking them to explain the difference between 'they're', 'there' and 'their'!

===Use Headings NOT Bold and Underline===
When students are in years 7 and 8 they have great fun with word art and making their titles look very fancy.  You don't get any marks for having fancy titles, in fact using them could make you lose marks.

If you have never used Heading styles before, now is the time to learn.  By using styles such as Heading 1 and Heading 2 it will allow you to automatically create a table of contents!  Imagine that, no need to count the page numbers. 

*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BqHH-zkzEw Using Headings in Word]
*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zRDDItRO30 Using Headings in OpenOffice]
[[Image:Brethren-Vol2-1.png|thumb|150px|You need a contents page for people to find their way around your work]]
===Use a contents page===
It is essential that the marker can navigate their way through your report.  To help them with this we are going to add a table of contents at the front of the document. Doing this manually can take a long time, but if you use headings then your can automate the entire process.  Remember if you change any text you will need to update your contents page to show the new layout.  The last thing you should do before printing is to update the contents page!

Look at the videos above to see how it is done.

===Widows and Orphans===
A very common mistake when writing reports is to mess up the layout.  This can involve having headings at the bottom of the page and the text accompanying that text on the next page (Widow) or having the text slipping onto the next page (Orphan).  This makes it very hard to read.

To make sure that your text is nice and tidy you need to make sure that if you have a Widowed header, you make sure that it starts off on the next page.  You can do this by using lots of carriage returns, but an easier and tidier way is to use '''page breaks'''.  You may not have used these before, they are a great way of making sure that everything is well laid out.

First of all find the '''¶''' button.  This shows us the formatting of the page.

Next find a heading that you want to switch to the next page, put the cursor in the front of the title and press &quot;CTRL+Enter&quot;

A page break should appear and things should be a little neater.

===Make sure your screenshots are clear===
So your project works and you have a lot of screen shots to show that your testing works.  However the screenshots are so small that you can't read the data entered or the error messages.  This means you are going to lose marks as your evidence of testing doesn't show any testing!  Make sure that you crop unneeded parts of the screen out of your images.  Use the crop button.

== Ceni ==
: One of tools for wired and wirelles networks managing is an application made by sidux developers - Ceni.
: There is Ceni network configuration guide for the chapter: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/System_installation#9._Ceni Sidux/Installation/Ceni]
: When you configure the network, it doesn't need any more your attention.
[[File:Instal19.png|center|600px]]


== Wicd ==
: But if you change an access point often I suggest to install any graphic network configurator.
: Wicd is a default network configurator for XFCE so install it as root:
 apt-get install wicd
:1. You will be asked for adding a new user to &quot;netdev&quot; group - mark it with &quot;space&quot; bottom as &quot;x&quot; and click OK.
[[File:Wicd1.png|center|600px]]
:2. Re-boot your computer.
:3. Open Wicd from desktop panel-&gt; Preferences tab-&gt; Network Interfaces:
::a. For Wireless type: wlan0
::b. For Wired type: eth0 and click on-&gt; OK.
[[File:Net2.png|center|400px]]
:4. Refresh network list and find yours-&gt; mark for Automatically connection to this network.
[[File:Net3.png|center|400px]]
:5. If you use wireless connection open &quot;Properties&quot; and type your network key if required.
[[File:Net4.png|center|400px]]


: Home page: http://wicd.sourceforge.net/
: Wicd on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicd


== Network Manager ==
: Network Manager is an application for GNOME environment but it works on others anyway.
: It manages mobiles networks too from 0.7 version.
 apt-get remove wicd
 apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome


: Home page: http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/ 


== KNetwork Manager ==
: For KDE environment install:
 apt-get install network-manager network-manager-kde
   or
 apt-get install kwlan


: Kwlan home page: http://www.kde.org/applications/internet/kwlan/

: If you think about your own web side, you have a few possibilities.
 

== Hosting ==
: What you have to do first is finding a hosting provider.
: It depends what do you need for, providers offer different services - it can be for free with pop-ups
: or paid for with no pop-ups. Usually your e-mail provider has free file hosting as an option.
: If not just try to find it in search engines such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing.


== Providers templates ==
: If you created an account on any hosting server just choose any available template to start making
: your first web side. Just type your text, add pictures, etc.


== Ready to use templates ==
: But if you want to make something different, find and download a template package typing in any search
: engine: &quot;html templates&quot; or &quot;free html templates&quot;.
: Next step is editing it using a WYSIWYG application (What You See Is What You Get) - an effect will be
: much better if you do it this way.


== KompoZer ==
: One of WYSIWYG application is KompoZer (previously NVU), download it from: http://www.kompozer.net/
:1. You don't need to install it, just extract it, get in the new &quot;kompozer&quot; folder and run &quot;kompozer&quot; file.
:2. Now extract a template you downloaded.
:3. And open extracted template with KompoZer clicking on &quot;Open&quot; icon.
:4. Edit the template as you wish and save it as &quot;index.html&quot; file if it'll be your main page.
:5. KompoZer has an ftp client bilt-in to send your page out to your hosting server but if you don't
:: like it you can use any different ftp client I described here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Useable_applications/Ftp_clients Sidux/Useable applications/Ftp clients]

: VoIP telphony (Voice over Internet Protocol) lets making calls to landlines or mobiles with cheap prices.


== Requirements ==
: If you want to make VoIP calls you have to do 3 things:
:1. Create an account on any VoIP provider web side.
:2. Pre-paid your account.
:3. Install one of available VoIP application.


== VoIP providers ==
: There are two providers I tried by myself, more you can find on a web side below.
::1. Skype Out http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/features/allfeatures/call-phones-and-mobiles/
::2. Freeconet http://www.freeconet.pl/en/
::3. or check it here: http://www.voip-catalog.com/press_releases.html


== Kphone ==
: Kphone is very small but fully working VoIP application.
:1. Installation:
 apt-get install kphone libqt3-mt
:2. The installation script doesn't make Menu entry, so you can do it yourself:
 sux
 mousepad /usr/share/applications/kphone.desktop
:: copy and past text below in:&lt;br&gt;
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Kphone
 Comment=VoIP telephony
 Exec=kphone
 Icon=/usr/share/icons/oxygen/64x64/apps/internet-telephony.png
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Network;
:: and save the file (the icon patch can be vary).
:3. Run it from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Kphone
:4. As a first step configure your account:
::a. In &quot;User part of sip URL&quot; type your user name or number you got from VoIP provider.
::b. In &quot;Host part of sip URL&quot; type VoIP provider sip address such as: sip.address.com
::c. In &quot;Authentication Username (optional)&quot; type your user name again.
[[File:Voip1.png|center|300px]]
::d. As a next step type your password marking &quot;Save password&quot;.
[[File:Voip2a.png|center|300px]]
:4. In: Preferences tab-&gt; Phone Book you may add your contacts.
[[File:Voip3aen.png|center|400px]]
5. To make a phone call type a phone number in search fild and click on phone icon.
[[File:Voip4a.png|center|400px]]


: Kphone home page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kphone
: More about Kphone on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPhone


== Others applications ==
: There are not too many configuration differents for all VoIp applications so I suggest to try:
# Linphone: http://www.linphone.org and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linphone
# Ekiga: http://ekiga.org/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekiga
# X-lite: http://www.counterpath.com/x-lite.html
# Zoiper: http://www.zoiper.com/
# Twinkle: http://www.twinklephone.com/

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Question 2.1.1=
==1==
If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, then the area of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==2==
If there is a line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; not on &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, then there is exactly one line &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that is parallel to &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

==3==
If &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; is a triangle with sides of length &lt;math&gt;a, b,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{sin A}=\frac{b}{sin B}=\frac{C}{sin C}&lt;/math&gt;

==4==
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function on [a, b] and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an function such that &lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then...


=Question 2.2.2=
==1==
If &lt;math&gt;1|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot q = n&lt;/math&gt;. Let q = n.

==2==
If &lt;math&gt;n|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;n \cdot q = n&lt;/math&gt;. Let q = 1.

==3==
If &lt;math&gt;m|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;m\cdot q = n\,&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;-mq = -n\,&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;m\cdot -q = -n\,&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;m|-n\,&lt;/math&gt;.


=Question 2.2.3=
==1==
If n is an even integer, then for some integer k, &lt;math&gt;n = 2k&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;j=3k&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then &lt;math&gt;3n = 3(2k) = 2(3k) = 2j&lt;/math&gt;.

==2==
If n is an odd integer, then for some integer k, &lt;math&gt;n = 2k+1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;j=3k+1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then &lt;math&gt;3n = 3(2k+1) = 6k+3 = 6k+2+1 = 2(3k+1)+1 = 2j+1&lt;/math&gt;.

==3==
If n is even, then &lt;math&gt;n = 2k&lt;/math&gt;. For integers j and k, let &lt;math&gt;j = 2k^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2) = 2j&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is even.

If n is odd, then &lt;math&gt;n = 2k+1&lt;/math&gt;. For integers j and k, let &lt;math&gt;j = 2k^2 + 2k+ 1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1) + 1 = 2j&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is odd.

=Question 2.2.6=

If a|b, and b|bm then a|bm, implying aj = bm for some integer j.

Also, if a|c, and c|cn then a|cn, implying ai = cn for some integer i.

We let x = (j+i).

ax = aj+ai

ax = bm+cn

Which implies a|(bm+cn).

=Question 2.2.7=

&lt;math&gt;a|b&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; ax = b&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, x.

&lt;math&gt;c|d&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; cy = d&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, y.


&lt;math&gt;ac|bd = ac|ax\cdot cy\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;acj = ax\cdot cy&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, j.

&lt;math&gt;acj = ac(xy)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;j=xy\,&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;ac|bd\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=Question 2.3.3=

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; a|b &lt;/math&gt;. This means there is an integer &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b = an &lt;/math&gt;. Then, we have:

&lt;math&gt; bc = (an)c = a(nc) &lt;/math&gt;

We may consider the integer &lt;math&gt; k = nc &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we have that &lt;math&gt; bc = ak &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; a|bc &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe these suggestions require some associated justification.  In other words, there needs to be some text about &quot;why&quot; these things should be done.  For example, why should local functions use an anonymous namespace be used ''instead of'' statically declared functions? Or why should memory access occur in ascending order?  Furthermore, it'd be nice to know the relative benefit of each suggestion.  For example, what performance gain is actually likely if a constructors arguments are re-ordered to declaration order in a class of only a half dozen simple member types?  When it comes to &quot;optimizing&quot;, a lot depends on the context of the optimization, therefore there needs to be some description of why/when a particular optimization makes most sense.  I am not arguing against these being valid suggestions, but I do think they need associated rationales to convince the reader why and when they may be worthwhile. -- [[User:Autumnfields|Autumnfields]] ([[User talk:Autumnfields|talk]]) 18:49, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

----

I wrote the text and I don't think further explanation is required.

First, because the average programmer need just to know what to do and not why.

Second, because anyway enough information is explanation is provided.

Let's see your points.

You wrote &quot;why should local functions use an anonymous namespace be used ''instead of'' statically declared functions?&quot;.
And the module contains &quot;in modern C++, the use of static global variables and functions is deprecated, and should be replaced by variables and functions declared in an anonymous namespace&quot;. It is not a question of optimization. To optimize the code, you could just as well use statically declared functions and variables. But it appears that they are deprecated, and therefore you'd better use an anonymous namespace.

You wrote &quot;why should memory access occur in ascending order?&quot;.
And the module contains &quot;Data caches optimize memory access in increasing sequential order.&quot;
It appears that usually hardware behaves that way.

At last you said &quot;it'd be nice to know the relative benefit of each suggestion&quot;.
That is quite hard to do, as it depends on a lot of factors.
Actually, some advices have null or adverse advantage.
Therefore, you should always time your code before and after applying a change meant to &quot;optimize&quot;.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

===Usage===
This template will display information about quality assessments. The template is generally used for the instructions on a WikiProject's &quot;/Assessment&quot; page. 

====Full syntax====
The full syntax is as follows:
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Quality Summary
 |banner=
 |topic=
 |extraparam=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Parameters====
* {{para|banner}} (required) - the name of the WikiProject's project banner template, ''without'' the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix. This parameter is found in the banner name field. (''Note'': a template shortcut can also be used).
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|BANNER_NAME=Template:''banner''&lt;/code&gt;
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;. This parameter can be found in one of two places. By default, the topic field would equal the project field, or if it exists, the corresponding assessment category field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|PROJECT=''topic''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;|ASSESSMENT_CAT=''topic'' pages&lt;/code&gt; 
* {{para|extraparam}} (optional) - extra parameters to be passed over to the WikiProject's banner, usually the name of a task force with a ''yes''. This parameter is found in the corresponding task force field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|tf 1=''extraparam''=''yes''&lt;/code&gt;

===Example===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Quality Summary
 |banner     = WikiProject Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |extraparam = french=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Result''':

{{Assessment Quality Summary
 |banner=WikiProject Languages
 |topic=French language
 |extraparam=french=yes
}}

: I'll try to show you how to make connection with second computer working under Windows OS in local network.
: To do that I will use samba and one of it's GUI. 
: As a second way I'll make connection using Opera web browser.


== Samba ==
: Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients in local network.
: I have tried a few samba GUI but only one worked for me very well.
: But it doesn't mean it'll be the same on your computer, you should try theme yourself.


: Samba home page: http://www.samba.org/
: Samba on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_%28software%29


== SMB-Browser ==
: SMB-Browser is the one application that worked on my computer well.
: It's not available in Debian repositories, I have found it pre-installed with Elive 2.0 linux distibution.
:1. Add Elive server address:
 # Elive
 deb http://europe.repository.elive-systems.com/ lenny main elive drivers tests efl ports multimedia games other  
 deb http://europe.debian.elive-systems.com/ lenny main contrib non-free  
: to repository list using a text editor as root:
 sux
 mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
:2. Next refresh package list and recive a public key:
 apt-get update
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv key_ID
 gpg --export key_ID | apt-key add -
 apt-get update
:3. And install application:
 apt-get install smb-browser smb-admin
:4. After that change rights for two files responsibility for mounting and unmounting shared files:
 chmod u+s /sbin/mount.cifs
 chmod u+s /sbin/umount.cifs
:5. Run SMB-browser from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Browser of Share
::a. In &quot;preferences&quot; tab make:
::: - mark &quot;mount.cifs&quot;
::: - type user name and password of second computer
[[File:Net1.png|center|500px]]
::b. Go to &quot;Main&quot; tab: 
::: - type IP address of second computer
::: - click on &quot;Search by Hostname or IP&quot;
[[File:Lokal2.png|center|500px]]
::c. If everything is all right you'll see second's computer's shared folder in left down window.
::d. Click on &quot;Mount&quot; to mount it and &quot;Browse&quot; - it'll open Thunar file manager.
[[File:Lokal3.png|center|500px]]
::e. All the files you can copy, edit, remove or send new one out from your computer.
:6. To finish connection click on &quot;Un-mount&quot;.


== Others samba GUI ==
# Smb4k: http://smb4k.berlios.de/ 
# Smb2www: http://www.scintilla.utwente.nl/users/frank/smb2www/
# Komba2: http://sourceforge.net/projects/komba/
# Samba GUI list: http://www.samba.org/samba/GUI/


== Opera Unite ==
: Second way to make connection with another computer (under any system) is using Opera Unite [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Useable_applications/Web_browsers#Opera Sidux/Opera].
: Unite lets you share your files, videos, music, etc via internet.
:1. Choose &quot;Unite&quot; icon from left panel, then &quot;File sharing&quot; and click on &quot;Start&quot;.
:2. A configurator will open a window so click on &quot;Next&quot;.

:3. In next step make registration on Opera server.

:4. Or log in if you have an account.
[[File:Unite3.png|center|600px]]
:5. Next step - choose your computer name for Unite.
[[File:Unite4.png|center|600px]]
:6. And next choose a folder you want to share.
[[File:Unite5.png|center|600px]]
:7. After that go to your Opera main page, copy the address link for your friends.
:8. Don't forget to give your password to theme.
[[File:Unite6.png|center|600px]]
:9. To finish sharing just click on &quot;Stop&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conditional Clauses==

Conditional clauses in English and Latin have the general form:

&lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (condition clause) (result clause)

Or:

(result clause) &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (condition clause)

For example:

#If I see anyone, I'll tell you.
#If he was sleeping, you should not have knocked.
#I cannot hear you if I'm sleeping.
#I would have been sad if I had not won.

There are 3 types of conditional clauses in Latin:

#Simple Fact (Present or Past)
#Contrary to Fact (Present or Past)
#Future (More or Less Vivid)

===Simple Fact Conditionals===

Simple fact conditionals in Latin have the general form:

si (condition clause in the present indicative) (result clause in the present indicative)

Or:

si (condition clause in the imperfect/perfect indicative) (result clause in the imperfect/perfect indicative)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si diligenter laboras, bonus puer es&lt;/i&gt;

If you are working diligently, you are a good boy.

&lt;i&gt;si dominum adiuvabas, bonus servus eras&lt;/i&gt;

If you were helping your master, you were a good slave.

===Contrary to Fact Conditionals===

Contrary to fact conditionals are used if the condition clause is known to be false. For example:

If you weren't playing during class, you would be a good boy (but you were playing, so you aren't a good boy).

Contrary to fact conditionals have the general form:

si (condition clause in the imperfect subjunctive) (result clause in the imperfect subjunctive)

Or:

si (condition clause in the pluperfect subjunctive) (result clause in the pluperfect subjunctive)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si matrem adiuvaret, cena parata esset&lt;/i&gt;

If he were helping his mother, the dinner would be ready.

&lt;i&gt;si patrem adiuvisset, pater matrem adiuvare potuisset&lt;/i&gt;

If he had helped his father, his father would have been able to help his mother.

Note how English uses &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;would have&lt;/b&gt; for result clauses, while Latin uses the same tense as in the condition clauses.

===Future Conditionals===

Future conditionals are, of course, used to express conditions in the future. For example:

If you help me, I will be done faster.

Future conditionals take the following general form:

si (condition clause in the future or future perfect) (result clause in the future)

Or:

si (condition clause in the present subjunctive) (result clause in the present subjunctive)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si fortiter pugnaveritis, urbs non delebitur&lt;/i&gt;

If you fight bravely, the city will not be destroyed.

Note how English uses the present tense for the condition clause, while Latin uses the future or future perfect.

&lt;i&gt;si diligenter laboretis, vobis meridie domum dimittam&lt;/i&gt;

If you were to work diligently, I would dismiss you at noon.

This type of clause, known as the future less vivid (as opposed to the future more vivid which uses the future and future perfect), is used to express more improbable conditions in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;includeonly&gt;A page's priority assessment is generated from the '''''priority''''' parameter in the {{tl|{{{banner|PROJECT_BANNER}}}}} project banner on its talk page:

; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{{banner|PROJECT_BANNER}}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|priority=???&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{{extraparam|}}}|{{!}}{{{extraparam}}}}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The following values may be used for the '''''priority''''' parameter to describe the relative priority of the page within the project:
{| style=&quot;background:transparent&quot; 
|-
! width=&quot;100%&quot;|&lt;!----&gt;
! &lt;!----&gt;
|-
| '''Top''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Top-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Top|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''High''' (adds pages to [[:Category:High-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|High|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''Mid''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Mid-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Mid|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''Low''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Low-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Low|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''NB''' (adds pages to [[:Category:NB-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|NB|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''???''' (pages for which a valid priority rating has not yet been provided are listed in [[:Category:Unknown-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]]
| {{priority||category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|}

The '''''priority''''' parameter should be assigned according to the [[#Priority scale|priority scale]] below.&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template will display information about priority assessments. The template is generally used for the instructions on a WikiProject's &quot;/Assessment&quot; page.

====Full syntax====
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     =
|topic      =
|extraparam =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Parameters====
* {{para|banner}} (required) - the name of the WikiProject's project banner template, ''without'' the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix. This parameter is found in the banner name field. (''Note'': a template shortcut can also be used).
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|BANNER_NAME=Template:''banner''&lt;/code&gt;
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-priority ''topic'' pages&quot;. This parameter can be found in one of two places. By default, the topic field would equal the project field, or if it exists, the corresponding assessment category field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|PROJECT=''topic''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;|ASSESSMENT_CAT=''topic'' pages&lt;/code&gt; 
* {{para|extraparam}} (optional) - extra parameters to be passed over to the WikiProject's banner, usually the name of a task force with a ''yes''. This parameter is found in the corresponding task force field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|tf 1=''extraparam''=''yes''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     = WikiProject Languages
|topic      = French language
|extraparam = French=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will produce:

{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     = WikiProject Languages
|topic      = French language
|extraparam = French=yes
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">For WikiProject banners using quality or importance scales, if the parameter ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' is defined, then the words &quot;quality scale&quot; and &quot;importance scale&quot; will be linked to that page. This allows a project to use its own custom scales if they wish and provides a convenient link to them from the banner.

If ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' is not defined, then the banner will check to see if either of the following pages exist:
* '''PROJECT_LINK/Assessment'''
* or (if ''PROJECT_LINK'' is not defined), '''Wikibooks:WikiProject PROJECT/Assessment'''
If they do then the banner will guess that this is where the WikiProject's quality and importance scales are kept and will link to this page.

* If this is not desired (for example, the page '''PROJECT_LINK/Assessment''' does not contain anything useful, then you can set ''ASSESSMENT_LINK=no''.
* If the banner has guessed correctly, then it is advisable to set ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' to point to this page. This will remove the warning box from the template page.

For any queries or help with this, please ask at [[Template talk:WPBannerMeta]].&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template subpages|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

'''Global warming potential''' (GWP) is a measure of how much a given mass of [[/greenhouse gas/]] is estimated to contribute to [[global warming]]. It is a relative scale which compares the [[gas]] in question to that of the same mass of [[carbon dioxide]] (whose GWP is by convention equal to 1). A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval and the value of this must be stated whenever a GWP is quoted or else the value is meaningless.

The substances subject to restrictions in the [[Kyoto protocol]] either are rapidly increasing their concentrations in [[Earth's atmosphere]] or have a large GWP.

The GWP depends on the following factors:
* the absorption of [[infrared radiation]] by a given species
* the spectral location of its absorbing wavelengths
* the [[atmospheric lifetime]] of the species
Thus, a high GWP correlates with a large infrared absorption and a long atmospheric lifetime.  The dependence of GWP on the wavelength of absorption is more complicated. Even if a gas absorbs radiation efficiently at a certain wavelength, this may not affect its GWP much if the atmosphere already absorbs most radiation at that wavelength. A gas has the most effect if it absorbs in a &quot;window&quot; of wavelengths where the atmosphere is fairly transparent. The dependence of GWP as a function of wavelength has been found empirically and published as a graph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/north/ITS%20GWP%20Data.xls Matthew Elrod, &quot;Greenhouse Warming Potential Model.&quot;]  Based on [[Journal of Chemical Education]], Vol 76, pp. 1702-1705, December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the GWP of a greenhouse gas depends directly on its infrared spectrum, the use of infrared spectroscopy to study greenhouse gases is centrally important in the effort to understand the impact of human activities on global [[climate change]].

== Calculating the global warming potential ==
Just as [[radiative forcing]] provides a simplified means of comparing the various factors that are believed to influence the climate system to one another, Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are one type of simplified index based upon radiative properties that can be used to estimate the potential future impacts of emissions of different gases upon the climate system in a relative sense. GWP is based on a number of factors, including the radiative efficiency (infrared-absorbing ability) of each gas relative to that of carbon dioxide, as well as the decay rate of each gas (the amount removed from the atmosphere over a given number of years) relative to that of carbon dioxide [https://archive.is/20120728225203/www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/gwp.html].

The '''radiative forcing capacity''' (RF) is the amount of energy per unit area, per unit time, absorbed by the greenhouse gas, that would otherwise be lost to space.  It can be expressed by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;RF = \sum_{n=1}^{100} Abs_i * F_i / (path length * density)&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript ''i'' represents an interval of 10 [[inverse centimeter]]s.  Abs&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents the integrated infrared absorbance of the sample in that interval, and F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents the RF for that interval.{{Verify source|date=September 2008}}

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) provides the generally accepted values for GWP, which changed slightly between 1996 and 2001. An exact definition of how GWP is calculated is to be found in the IPCC's [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/247.htm 2001 Third Assessment Report]. The GWP is defined as the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of 1 kg of a trace substance relative to that of 1 kg of a reference gas:

:&lt;math&gt;GWP \left(x\right) = \frac{\int_0^{TH} a_x \cdot \left[x(t)\right] dt} {\int_0^{TH} a_r \cdot \left[r(t)\right] dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where TH is the time horizon over which the calculation is considered; a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiative efficiency]] due to a unit increase in atmospheric abundance of the substance (i.e., Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and [x(t)] is the time-dependent decay in abundance of the substance following an instantaneous release of it at time t=0. The denominator contains the corresponding quantities for the reference gas (i.e. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The radiative efficiencies a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are not necessarily constant over time. While the absorption of infrared radiation by many greenhouse gases varies linearly with their abundance, a few important ones display non-linear behaviour for current and likely future abundances (e.g., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend upon abundance and hence upon the future scenario adopted.

Since all GWP calculations are a comparison to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is non-linear, all GWP values are affected. Assuming otherwise as is done above will lead to lower GWPs for other gases than a more detailed approach would.

=== Use in Kyoto Protocol ===
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the Conference of the Parties decided (decision 2/CP.3) [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop3/07a01.pdf#page=31] that the values of GWP calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] are to be used for converting the various greenhouse gas emissions into comparable [[Co2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents]] when computing overall sources and sinks.

== Importance of time horizon ==

Note that a substance's GWP depends on the timespan over which the potential is calculated. A gas which is quickly removed from the atmosphere may initially have a large effect but for longer time periods as it has been removed becomes less important. Thus methane has a potential of 25 over 100 years but 72 over 20 years; conversely [[sulfur hexafluoride]] has a GWP of 22,800 over 100 years but 16,300 over 20 years (IPCC TAR). The GWP value depends on how the gas concentration decays over time in the atmosphere. This is often not precisely known and hence the values should not be considered exact. For this reason when quoting a GWP it is important to give a reference to the calculation.

The GWP for a mixture of gases can not be determined from the GWP of the constituent gases by any form of simple linear addition.

Commonly, a time horizon of 100 years is used by regulators (e.g., the [[California Air Resources Board]]).

== Values ==

[[Carbon dioxide]] has a GWP of exactly 1 (since it is the baseline unit to which all other greenhouse gases are compared).

Although [[water vapor|water vapour]] has a significant influence with regard to absorbing infrared radiation (which is the green house effect; see [[greenhouse gas]]), its GWP is not calculated. Its concentration in the atmosphere mainly depends on air temperature. There is no possibility to directly influence atmospheric water vapour concentration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gradient enhanced NMR''' is a method for obtaining high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectra without the need for ''phase cycling''. Gradient methodology is used extensively for two purposes, either rephasing (selection) or dephasing (elimination) of a particular magnetization transfer pathway. It includes the application of magnetic field gradient pulses to select specific coherences. By using actively shielded gradients, a gradient pulse is applied during the evolution period of the selected coherence to dephase the transverse magnetization and another gradient pulse refocuses the desired coherences remaining during the acquisition period.

==Advantages==
*Significant reduction in measuring time
*Reduced T1 artifacts 
*Elimination of phase cycling and difference methods 
*Possibility for three and four-quantum editing 
*The ability to detect resonances at the same chemical shift as a strong solvent resonance

==Drawbacks==
*A need for field-frequency-lock blanking during long runs.

==Examples==
*Selection of transverse magnetization (I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; etc.):

A '''helium mass spectrometer''' is an instrument commonly used to detect and locate small leaks. It was initially developed in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II to find extremely small leaks in the [[Gaseous diffusion|gas diffusion process]] of [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment plants]].&lt;ref&gt;LEAK DETECTION by N. Hilleret of CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. &quot;At the origin of the helium leak detection method was the ”Manhattan Project” and the unprecedented leak-tightness requirements needed by the uranium enrichment plants. The required sensitivity needed for the leak checking led to the choice of a mass spectrometer designed by Dr. A.O.C. Nier tuned on the helium mass. Because of its industrial use, the material choice (originally glass) turned out to be unbearably fragile and after many complaints by the users, a new metallic version was developed and constructed. The sensitivity of the apparatus was in 1946 ~10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and it increased to ~10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by 1970. Nowadays the quoted sensitivity of the most sensitive detectors is ~10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, a factor 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; gain within 50 years.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It typically uses a [[vacuum chamber]] in which a sealed container filled with helium is placed. Helium leaks out of the container, and the rate of the leak is detected by a [[mass spectrometer]].

== Detection technique ==

The leak detection technique depends on the separation of helium from other gases in a [[vacuum]]. It is accomplished by [[ionization|ionizing]] a gas sample containing helium, pushing the sample through a [[magnetic field]], and collecting the helium [[ion]]s as they emerge. Since helium ions exit along a different path from all other ions, collection of helium is reasonably simple. The current produced by the helium ion flow is used to drive a [[ammeter]]. Often audio alarms, and visual display on leak detection system to give information and warnings about leak levels. [[Ionization]], separation and collection takes place within a [[spectrometer tube]], which is the heart of the system.

Helium is used as a [[tracer]] because it penetrates small leaks rapidly. Helium has also the property of being non-toxic, [[inert gas|chemically inert]], inexpensive to produce, and present in the atmosphere only in minute quantities (5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]]). Typically a helium leak detector will be used to measure leaks in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·[[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

* A flow of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is slightly less than 1 ml per minute at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP).
* A flow of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is slightly less than 3 ml per century at STP.

== Internal spectrometer tube operation ==
In the spectrometer tube, the heart of the helium mass spectrometer, the electrons produced by a [[hot filament]] enter an [[ionization chamber]] under vacuum, and collide with [[gas]] [[molecules]], creating within the chamber ions quantitatively proportional to the pressure in the ion chamber. These ions are repelled out of the ion chamber, under vacuum, through the exit slit, by a repeller field. The combined [[electrostatic]] effect of the repeller, exit slit, focus plates, and ground slit [[collimation|collimates]] the [[ion beam]] so that it enters the magnetic field as a straight &quot;ribbon&quot; of ions.

== Types of leaks ==
Typically there are two types of leaks in the detection of helium as a ''[[tracer]]'' for leak detection.

*'''Residual leak''': A residual leak is a real leak that may be gross, or small, according to the sensitivity setting of the leak detector.
*'''Virtual leak''': A virtual leak is the semblance of a leak in a vacuum system caused by slow release of trapped gases, as gases may adhere as pockets to the interior sides of a chamber. This can cause confusion to the operator as it may be a false indication of a present leak.

== Uses ==
Helium mass spectrometer leak detectors are used in production line industries such as [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]], automotive parts, carbonated beverage containers, food packages and [[aerosol spray|aerosol]] packaging, as well as in the manufacture of steam products, [[gas bottle]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[tire]] valves, and numerous other products including all [[vacuum]] systems.

== Test methods ==
{{Cleanup-list|date=January 2008}}
=== Global helium spray - vacuum test ===
This method requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested will be located in some kind of a tent in which the helium concentration will be raised to 100% helium. 
*If the part is small the vacuum system included in the leak testing instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.
*If the size of the part is too large, an additional vacuum pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.
If leakage is encountered the small and &quot;agile&quot; molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered.

=== Local helium spray - vacuum test ===
This method is a small variation from the one above.
It still requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested is sprayed with a localized stream of helium tracer gas. 
*If the part is small the vacuum system included in the instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.
*If the size of the part is too large, an addition pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.
If leakage is encountered the small and &quot;agile&quot; molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium spray head will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area.

=== Helium charged - vacuum test ===
In this case the part is pressurized (sometime this test is combined with a burst test, i.e. at 40 bars) with helium while sitting in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is connected to a vacuum pumping system and a leak detector. Once the vacuum has reached the mass spectrometer operating pressure, any helium leakage will be measured.
This test method applies to a lot of components that will operate under pressure: airbag canisters, evaporators, condensers, high-voltage SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; filled switchgear.

=== Bombing test (overpressure) - vacuum test ===
This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed.

First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a &quot;bombing&quot; chamber.

If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device.

Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured.

This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices.

This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down.

=== Helium charged - sniffer test ===
In this last case the part is pressurized with helium. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a special device, a sniffer probe, that allows it to sample air (and tracer gas when confronted with a leak) at atmospheric pressure and to bring it into the mass spectrometer.

This mode of operation is frequently used to locate a leak that has been detected by other methods, in order to allow for parts repair.

The '''Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence''' (HSQC) experiment is used frequently in [[NMR]] spectroscopy of organic molecules and is of particular significance in the field of [[protein NMR]]. It was invented by [[Geoffrey Bodenhausen]] and [[D. J. Ruben]] in 1980.  The resulting spectrum is two-dimensional with one axis for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and the other for a ''heteronucleus'' (an [[atomic nucleus]] other than a proton), most often [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] or [[nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]. The spectrum contains a peak for each unique proton attached to the heteronucleus being considered. Thus, if the [[chemical shift]] of a specific proton is known, the chemical shift of the coupled heteronucleus can be determined, and vice versa.

== HSQC in protein NMR ==
The &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N HSQC experiment is probably the most frequently recorded experiment in protein NMR. The HSQC experiment can be performed either using the natural abundance of the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N [[isotope]], or using isotopically labeled protein. The latter can be recorded on much lower concentrations of protein, but requires [[recombinant expression]] of the protein. 

Each [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] of the [[protein]] (except [[proline]]) has an amide proton attached to a [[nitrogen]] in the [[peptide bond]]. If the protein is folded, the peaks are usually well dispersed, and most of the individual peaks can be distinguished. Being a relatively cheap and quick experiment, the HSQC is useful to screen candidates for [[protein structure|structure]] determination by NMR. The number of peaks in the spectrum should match the number of residues in the protein (though sidechains with nitrogen-bound protons will add additional peaks).  It will probably be difficult to solve the structure of the protein if this is not the case. The labour-intensive process of structure determination is usually not undertaken until a good HSQC is obtained.

It is not possible to assign the HSQC spectrum by itself, or in other words to determine which peaks correspond to a particular residue in the protein. This process can be done in different ways as outlined in the [[protein NMR]] article. The assignment of the spectrum is usually the first step in a structure determination, and is essential for a meaningful interpretation of more advanced NMR experiments.

The HSQC experiment is also useful for detecting interactions with [[ligand]]s, such as other proteins or drugs. By comparing the HSQC of the free protein with the one bound to the ligand, it is possible to find the changes in the [[chemical shift]]s of the peaks, which is most likely to occur in the binding interface.

The '''history of mass spectrometry''' dates back more than one hundred years and has its roots in physical and chemical studies regarding the nature of matter. The study of [[gas discharge]]s in the mid 19th century led to the discovery of [[anode ray|anode]] and [[cathode ray]]s, which turned out to be positive [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s. Improved capabilities in the separation of these positive ions enabled the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s of the elements. The first such discovery was with the atom [[neon]], which was shown by [[mass spectrometry]] to have at least two stable isotopes:  neon-20 with 10 [[proton]]s and 10 [[neutron]]s and neon-22 with 10 protons and 12 neutrons. Mass spectrometers were used in the [[Manhattan Project]] for the separation of isotopes of uranium necessary to create the [[atomic bomb]]. 

==Prout's Hypothesis==
[[Prout's hypothesis]] was an early 19th century attempt to explain the properties of the [[chemical element]]s using the internal structure of the [[atom]]. In 1815, the [[England|English]] chemist [[William Prout]] observed that the [[atomic weight]]s that had been measured were [[integer]] multiples of the atomic weight of [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;William Prout (1815). On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. ''Annals of Philosophy'', 6: 321&amp;ndash;330. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PROUT.HTML Online reprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Prout (1816). Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. ''Annals of Philosophy'', 7: 111&amp;ndash;13. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PROUT.HTML#prout2 Online reprint]&lt;/ref&gt; Prout's hypothesis remained influential in chemistry throughout the 1820s.  However, more careful measurements of the atomic weights, such as those compiled by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1828 or [[Edward Turner]] in 1832, appeared to disprove it.  In particular the atomic weight of [[chlorine]], which is 35.45 times that of [[hydrogen]], could not at the time be explained in terms of Prout's hypothesis. It would take the better part of a century for this problem to be resolved.

==Canal rays==
In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Julius Plücker]] investigated the light emitted in [[discharge tubes]] and the influence of magnetic fields on the glow.  Later, in 1869, [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] studied discharge tubes with energy rays extending from a negative [[electrode]], the cathode. These rays produced a [[fluorescence]] when they hit a tube's glass walls, and when interrupted by a solid object they cast a shadow. 

Canal rays, also called [[Anode rays]],  were observed by [[Eugen Goldstein]], in 1886. Goldstein used a [[Gas filled tube|gas discharge tube]] which had a perforated [[cathode]].  The rays are produced in the holes (canals) in the cathode and travels in a direction opposite to the &quot;[[cathode ray]]s,&quot; which are streams of [[electron]]s. Goldstein called these positive rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot; - canal rays. In [[1907]] a study of how this &quot;ray&quot; was deflected in a [[magnetic field]], revealed that the [[Particle physics|particles]] making up the ray were not all the same [[mass]]

==Discovery of isotopes==
[[Image:Discovery of neon isotopes.JPG|thumb|300px|right|In the bottom right corner of this photographic plate are markings for the two isotopes of neon: neon-20 and neon-22.]]


In 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of [[canal rays]], [[J. J. Thomson]] channeled a stream of ionized neon through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a photographic plate in its path.  Thomson observed two patches of light on the photographic plate (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection.  Thomson concluded that the neon gas was composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22).&lt;ref&gt;JJ Thomson (1913), [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html ''Rays of positive electricity''], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', A 89, 1-20 &amp;mdash; Discovery of neon isotopes&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson's student [[Francis William Aston]] continued the research at the Trinity College, building the first full functional mass spectrometer in 1919. He was able to identify isotopes of [[chlorine]] (35 and 37), [[bromine]] (79 and 81), and [[krypton]] (78, 80, 82, 83, 84 and 86), proving that these natural occurring elements are composed of a combination of isotopes. The use of electromagnetic focusing in [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrograph]] which rapidly allowed him to identify no fewer than 212 of the 287 naturally occurring isotopes. In 1921 F. W. Aston became a fellow of the famous [[Royal Society]].

His work on isotopes also led to his formulation of the [[Whole Number Rule]] which states that &quot;the mass of the oxygen isotope being defined [as 16], all the other isotopes have masses that are very nearly whole numbers,&quot; a rule that was used extensively in the development of [[nuclear energy]]. The exact mass of many isotopes was measured leading to the result that hydrogen has a 1% higher mass than expected by the average mass of the other elements. Aston speculated about the subatomic energy and the use of it in 1936.

In [[1918]], [[Arthur Jeffrey Dempster]] developed the first modern [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], which was over 100 times more accurate than previous versions, and established the basic theory and design of mass spectrometers that is still used to this day.  Dempster's research over his career centered around the mass spectrometer and its applications, leading in [[1935]] to his discovery of the uranium isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.  This isotope's ability to cause a rapidly expanding [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[nuclear chain reaction]] allowed the development of the [[atom bomb]] and [[nuclear power]].

In 1932, [[Kenneth Bainbridge]] developed a mass spectrometer with a resolving power of 600 and a relative precision of one part in 10,000.&lt;ref name='Audi 2006'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The history of nuclidic masses and of their evaluation|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry |date=2006-04-01|first=Georges|last=Audi|coauthors=|volume=251|issue=2-3|pages=85–94|doi= 10.1016/j.ijms.2006.01.048}}|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VND-4JKRWJX-2/2/628018a7bf50a32b4cdba32b77f181c8|format=|accessdate=2008-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; He used this instrument to verify the [[Mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]], E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title= The Equivalence of Mass and Energy|journal=Phys.

==Manhattan Project==
A [[Calutron]] is a [[sector instrument|sector mass spectrometer]] that was used for separating the [[isotopes]] of [[uranium]] developed by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fepi2.htm |title=Lawrence and His Laborator |accessdate=2007-09-03 |year=1981 |work=LBL Newsmagazine |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Manhattan Project]] and was similar to the [[Cyclotron]] invented by Lawrence. Its name is a [[concatenation]] of Cal. U.-tron, in tribute to the [[University of California]], Lawrence's institution and the contractor of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] laboratory.&lt;ref name='OSTI ID: 20699216'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The Uranium Bomb, the Calutron, and the Space-Charge Problem|journal=Physics Today|date=2005-05-01|first=William E.|last=Parkins|coauthors=|volume=58|issue=5|pages=45–51|doi= 10.1063/1.1995747}}|url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1947_ParkinsWE.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; They were implemented for industrial scale [[uranium enrichment]] at the [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12 plant]] established during the war and provided much of the uranium used for the &quot;[[Little Boy]]&quot; [[nuclear weapon]], which was dropped onto [[Hiroshima]] in [[1945]].

==Development of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry==
The use of a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography was developed during the 1950s by Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty.&lt;ref&gt;Gohlke, R. S., [http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1956_Gohlke.pdf Time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas-liquid partition chromatography]. ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1959''', ''31'', 535-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gohlke, R. S.; McLafferty, F. W., [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(93)85001-E Early gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.]'' J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.'' '''1993''', ''4'', (5), 367-371.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of affordable and [[miniaturized]] [[computer]]s has helped in the simplification of the use of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyse a sample.

==Fourier transform mass spectrometry==
[[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometry was developed by [[Alan G. Marshall]] and [[Melvin B. Comisarow]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2 M.B. Comisarow and A.G. Marshall, ''Chem. Phys. Lett.'' '''25''', 282 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy. 

==Soft ionization methods==
Field desorption ionization was first reported by Beckey in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Beckey H.D. ''Field ionization mass spectrometry.'' '''Research/Development''', ''1969'', 20(11), 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In field ionization, a high-potential electric field is applied to an ''emitter'' with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny &quot;whiskers&quot; have been grown.  This produces a very high electric field in which electron tunneling can result in ionization of gaseous analyte molecules.  FI produces mass spectra with little or no fragmentation, dominated by molecular radical cations M&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt; and occasionally protonated molecules &lt;math&gt;[M+H]^+&lt;/math&gt;.

Chemical ionization was developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1966''', ''88'', 2621-2630. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00964a001 Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4569234&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fales HM, Milne GW, Pisano JJ, Brewer HB, Blum MS, MacConnell JG, Brand J, Law N |title=Biological applications of electron ionization and chemical ionization mass spectrometry |journal=Recent Prog. Horm. Res. |volume=28 |issue= |pages=591–626 |year=1972 |pmid=4569234 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7025931&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dougherty RC |title=Negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry: applications in environmental analytical chemistry |journal=Biomed.

The analyte is ionized by ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. The process may involve transfer of an electron, a proton or other charged species between the reactants. This is a less energetic procedure than [[electron ionization]] and the ions produced are, for example, protonated molecules:  [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These ions are often relatively stable, tending not to fragment as readily as ions produced by [[electron ionization]].

[[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) is a soft [[ionization]] technique used in [[mass spectrometry]], allowing the analysis of [[biomolecule]]s ([[biopolymer]]s such as [[proteins]], [[peptides]] and [[sugars]]) and large [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecules]] (such as [[polymers]], [[dendrimers]] and other [[macromolecules]]), which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods. It is most similar in character to [[electrospray ionization]] both in relative softness and the ions produced (although it causes much fewer multiply charged ions). The term was first used in 1985 by [[Franz Hillenkamp]], [[Michael Karas]] and their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas, M.; Bachmann, D.; Hillenkamp, F. |title=Influence of the Wavelength in High-Irradiance Ultraviolet Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry of Organic Molecules |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Anal. Chem.]] |volume=57 |issue= |pages=2935–9 |year=1985 |pmid= |doi=10.1021/ac00291a042}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers found that the [[amino acid]] [[alanine]] could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid [[tryptophan]] and irradiated with a pulsed 266 nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide [[melittin]] could be ionized when mixed with this kind of “matrix”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas, M.; Bachman, D.; Bahr, U.; Hillenkamp, F. |title=Matrix-Assisted Ultraviolet Laser Desorption of Non-Volatile Compounds |journal=[[International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|Int J Mass Spectrom Ion Proc]] |volume=78 |issue= |pages=53–68 |year=1987 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0168-1176(87)87041-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when [[Koichi Tanaka]] of Shimadzu Corp. and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30 nm [[cobalt]] particles in [[glycerol]] with a 337 nm [[nitrogen laser]] for ionization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tanaka, K.; Waki, H.; Ido, Y.; Akita, S.; Yoshida, Y.; Yoshida, T. |title=Protein and Polymer Analyses up to m/z 100 000 by Laser Ionization Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry |journal=[[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom]] |volume=2 |issue=20 |pages=151–3 |year=1988 |pmid= |doi=10.1002/rcm.1290020802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Markides | first =K | authorlink = | coauthors =Gräslund, A | title =Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2002/chemadv02.pdf | format =PDF | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266 nm laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas M, Hillenkamp F |title=Laser desorption ionization of proteins with molecular masses exceeding 10,000 daltons |journal=Anal.

&lt;/ref&gt; Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.

HNCA is a 3D NMR experiment commonly used in the field of protein NMR. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an amino acid residue is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary HNCOCA experiment transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue{{ref|hnca}}. The HNCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCOCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N isotopic labelling, at a concentration greater than 0.1 mM, and is thus generally only applied to recombinant proteins.

The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N axis and a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt; (i)} and {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}, while for the complementary HNCOCA experiment peaks appear only at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

[[Image:LTQ-FTICR.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer]]
A '''hybrid mass spectrometer''' is a device for [[tandem mass spectrometry]] that consists of a combination of two or more ''[[m/z]]'' separation devices of different types.

==Notation==
The different ''m/z'' separation elements of a hybrid [[mass spectrometer]] can be represented by a shorthand notation. The symbol ''Q'' represents a [[quadrupole mass analyzer]], ''q'' is a [[radio frequency]] collision quadrupole, ''TOF'' is a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]], ''B'' is a magnetic [[sector mass spectrometer|sector]] and ''E'' is an electric sector.
 
==Sector quadrupole==
A  [[sector instrument]] can be combined with a collision quadrupole and [[quadrupole mass analyzer]] to form a hybrid instrument. &lt;ref name=Glish1982&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Glish | first =  G. | year = 1982 | title = A new “hybrid” sector/quadrupole mass spectrometer for mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry | journal = International Journal or Mass Spectrometry and Ion Physics | volume = 41 | pages = 157 | doi = 10.1016/0020-7381(82)85032-8 | last2 = McLuckey | first2 = S | last3 = Ridley | first3 = T | last4 = Cooks | first4 = R | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BEqQ configuration with a magnetic sector (B), electric sector (E), collision quadrupole (q) and ''m/z'' selection quadrupole (Q) have been constructed&lt;ref name=Schoen1985&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schoen | first =  A. | year = 1985 | title = A hybrid BEQQ mass spectrometer | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes | volume = 65 | pages = 125 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1176(85)85059-X | last2 = Amy | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Ciupek | first3 = J.D. | last4 = Cooks | first4 = R.G. | last5 = Dobberstein | first5 = P. | last6 = Jung | first6 = G. | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1986&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harrison | first =  A. | year = 1986 | title = A hybrid BEQQ mass spectrometer for studies in gaseous ion chemistry | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes | volume = 74 | pages = 13 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1176(86)85020-0 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an instrument with two electric sectors (BEEQ) has been described.&lt;ref name=Winger1992&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Winger | first =  B.

The '''hydrogen line''', '''21 centimeter line''' or '''HI line'''  refers to the [[spectral line]] created by changes in the energy state of neutral [[hydrogen]] and occurs at a frequency of 1420.40575177 [[Megahertz|MHz]], equivalent to a [[Wavelength#In_non-vacuum_media|vacuum wavelength]] of around 21.10611405413 [[centimetre|cm]]. This line falls within the [[radio]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and is used extensively in [[astronomy]], since it can penetrate [[Cosmic dust|dust clouds]] that are [[opaque]] to [[Visible light|visible wavelengths]]. The radiation comprising the hydrogen line comes from the [[Atomic transition|transition]] between the two [[hyperfine levels]] of the hydrogen [[Principle quantum number|1]][[Azimuthal quantum number|s]] [[ground state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyperphysics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html |title=The Hydrogen 21-cm Line |accessdate=2008-09-20 |work=[[Hyperphysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of the hydrogen line==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{-}}

Neutral hydrogen consists of a single [[proton]] orbited by a single [[electron]]. As well as their orbital motion, the proton and electron also have [[spin (physics)|spin]]. Classically, this is analogous to rotational motion (like the [[Earth]] rotating on its axis as it orbits the [[Sun]]), but as they are [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[particle physics|particles]] the concept has a slightly different meaning.

The spin of the electron and proton can be in either direction - in the classical analogy they are rotating clockwise or anticlockwise around a given axis. They may have their spin oriented in the same direction or in opposite directions. Because of [[magnetism|magnetic]] interactions between the particles, a hydrogen atom that has the spins of the electron and proton aligned in the same direction (parallel) has slightly more energy than one where the spins of the electron and proton are in opposite directions (anti-parallel).

The lowest orbital energy state of atomic hydrogen has [[hyperfine splitting]] arising from the spins of the proton and electron changing from  a [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to antiparallel configuration. This transition is highly [[forbidden line|forbidden]] with an extremely small probability of 2.9&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This means that the time for a single isolated atom of neutral hydrogen to undergo this transition is around 10 million (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) years and so is unlikely to be seen in a laboratory on Earth. However, as the total number of atoms of neutral hydrogen in the [[interstellar medium]] is very large, this emission line is easily observed by [[radio telescope]]s. Also, the lifetime can be considerably shortened by collisions with other hydrogen atoms and interaction with the [[cosmic microwave background]].

The line has an extremely small natural width because of its long lifetime, so most broadening is due to [[doppler shift]]s caused by the motion of the emitting regions relative to the observer.

==Discovery==

During the 1930s, it was noticed that there was a radio 'hiss' that varied on a daily cycle and appeared to be extraterrestrial in origin. After initial suggestions that this was due to the Sun, it was observed that the radio waves seemed to be coming from the centre of [[Milky Way|the Galaxy]]. These discoveries were published in 1940 and were seen by Professor [[Jan Hendrik Oort|J.H. Oort]] who knew that significant advances could be made in astronomy if there were [[emission line]]s in the radio part of the spectrum. He referred this to [[Hendrik van de Hulst|Dr Hendrik van de Hulst]] who, in 1944, discovered that [[electric charge|neutral]] [[hydrogen]] could produce radiation at a [[frequency]] of 1420.4058&amp;nbsp;MHz due to two closely spaced energy levels in the [[ground state]] of the [[hydrogen atom]].

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm line (1420.4&amp;nbsp;MHz) was first detected in 1951 by [[Harold Irving Ewen|Ewen]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell|Purcell]] at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ewan |first=H.I. |authorlink= |coauthors=E.M. Purcell |year=1951 |month=September |title=Observation of a line in the galactic radio spectrum |journal=Nature |volume=168 |issue=4270 |pages=356 |id= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v168/n4270/pdf/168356a0.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-21 |quote= |doi=10.1038/168356a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published after their data was corroborated by Dutch astronomers [[Muller]] and [[Oort]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=C.A. |authorlink= |coauthors=J.H. Oort |year=1951 |month=September |title=The Interstellar Hydrogen Line at 1,420 Mc./sec., and an Estimate of Galactic Rotation |journal=Nature |volume=168 |issue=4270 |pages=357–358 |id= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v168/n4270/pdf/168356a0.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-21 |quote= |doi=10.1038/168357a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Christiansen and Hindman in Australia. After 1952 the first maps of the neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy were made and revealed, for the first time, the spiral structure of the [[Milky Way]].
&lt;!--http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/ewen/index.html--&gt;

==Uses in radio astronomy==

Luckily, the spectral line appears within the [[radio spectrum]] (in the [[microwave window]] to be exact). Electromagnetic energy in this range can easily pass through the Earth's atmosphere and be observed from the Earth with little interference.  

Assuming that the hydrogen atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy, each line of sight through the galaxy will reveal a hydrogen line. The only difference between each of these lines is the doppler shift that each of these lines has. Hence, one can calculate the relative speed of each arm of our [[galaxy]]. The [[rotation curve]] of our [[galaxy]] has also been calculated using the 21-cm hydrogen line. It is then possible to use the plot of the [[rotation curve]] and the [[velocity]] to determine the distance to a certain point within the galaxy. 

Hydrogen line observations have also been used indirectly to calculate the mass of galaxies, to put limits on any changes over time of the universal [[gravitational constant]] and to study dynamics of individual galaxies.

== Uses in cosmology ==
The line is of great interest in [[big bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] because it is the only known way to probe the &quot;dark ages&quot; from [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] to [[reionization]]. Including the [[redshift]], this line will be observed at frequencies from 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to about 9&amp;nbsp;MHz on Earth. It potentially has two applications. First, by mapping redshifted 21 centimeter radiation  it can, in principle, provide a very precise picture of the [[matter power spectrum]] in the period after recombination. Second, it can provide a picture of how the universe was reionized, as neutral hydrogen which has been ionized by radiation from stars or quasars will appear as holes in the 21 centimeter background. 

However, 21 centimeter experiments are very difficult. Ground based experiments to observe the faint signal are plagued by interference from television transmitters and the [[ionosphere]], so they must be very secluded and careful about eliminating interference if they are to succeed. Space based experiments, even on the far side of the moon (which should not receive interference from terrestrial radio signals), have been proposed to compensate for this. Little is known about other effects, such as [[synchrotron radiation|synchrotron emission]] and free-free emission on the galaxy. Despite these problems, 21 centimeter observations, along with space-based gravity wave observations, are generally viewed as the next great frontier in observational cosmology, after the cosmic microwave background polarization.

==Uses in terrestrial remote sensing ==

The [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|Soil Moisture &amp; Ocean Salinity]] (SMOS) satellite's main scientific instrument [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS) uses the 1400-1427&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies (including 1420.406&amp;nbsp;MHz) to monitor the ocean surface salinity and the soil moisture of the Earth. The choice of HI band results from: 1) much better radiative signature of salinity and moisture in microwave than in higher frequencies, 2) no electromagnetic interference from anthropogenic sources, as HI is reserved for radioastronomy.

==Possible uses for SETI==
The [[Pioneer plaque]], attached to the [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] [[spacecraft]], portrays the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and used the wavelength as a standard scale of measurement. For example the height of the woman in the image is displayed as eight times 21&amp;nbsp;cm, or 168&amp;nbsp;cm. Similarly the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition was used for a unit of time in a map to Earth included on the Pioneer plaques and also the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes.

On this map, the position of the Sun is portrayed relative to 14 [[pulsar]]s whose rotation period circa 1977 is given as a multiple of the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition. It is theorized by the plaque's creators that an advanced civilization would then be able to use the locations of these pulsars to locate the [[Solar System]] at the time the spacecraft were launched.

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm Hydrogen line is considered a favorable frequency to search for signals from another civilization, as part of the [[SETI]] program. The original paper by [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] proposed just such a search in their paper, ''Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence''.[http://www.lifeinuniverse.org/noflash/SETI-07.html]

[[:ru:Маковецкий, Пётр Васильевич|Pyotr Makovetsky]] proposed to use for SETI a frequency which is equal to [[pi]] times 1420.4&amp;nbsp;MHz (pi times 1420.40575177 megahertz = 4.46233627 gigahertz; (2 * pi) times 1420.40575177 megahertz = 8.92467255 gigahertz). Since pi is a [[Transcendental number]], such frequency couldn't possibly be produced in a natural way as a [[harmonic]], and would clearly signify its artificial origin. Such signal would not be jammed by HI line itself,  or any of its harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;Makovetsky P. [http://n-t.ru/ri/mk/sk109-4.htm Smotri v koren'] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
The Turk's head knot is a decorative knot primarily used by [[Scouts]] as [[wikt:woggle|woggle]]s to attach their neckerchiefs. Like most decorative knots, it is hard to tie for the first time. 
==How to tie==
# Have in your hand about {{units|a metre|3 feet}} of rope.
# In the end, make a loop with end 2, then another that goes over it. (Figure 1, bottom of page)  
# Bring end 1 under end 2, then put it over, then under, then over, then under the rope each time that you cross it. You will then get something like figure 2. 
# Slide your thumb or a stick (of a diameter of about {{units|2cm|0.8 inches}}) into the square that has formed in the centre of the knot. In doing so, you will be able to keep this space open and use it to shape your knot.
# Still using end 1, follow end 2, as in figure 3. 
# Do as many cycles as you like. Usually, people make three turns, but nothing is stopping you from defying that tendency! The only thing to be aware of is how much rope you have left.
# The hardest part is over. You only have left to tighten your knot. To do that, start with one of the ends of the rope, then tighten the knot (not too hard) around your thumb or the stick that you placed in the middle. It's a long process, but you will see your knot taking shape.
# Cut the excess rope, and secure the two extremities in the ring (using a small reef knot or stitches, or you could also dip the whole thing in melted wax to solidify it). In doing so, you won't see the ends, which will make your knot even more attractive.
# Place your knot on an object of your choice and proudly show your creation to others!

[[File:Hydrogen spectrum.svg|frame|right|The spectral series of hydrogen, on a [[logarithm]]ic scale.]]

The [[emission spectrum]] of atomic [[hydrogen]] is divided into a number of '''spectral series''', with wavelengths given by the [[Rydberg formula]]. These observed spectral lines are due to electrons moving between energy levels in the atom. The spectral series are important in astronomy for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating [[red shift]]s. Further series were discovered as spectroscopy techniques developed.

==Physics==
In [[physics]], the spectral lines of hydrogen correspond to particular jumps of the [[electron]] between [[energy level]]s. The simplest model of the hydrogen atom is given by the [[Bohr model]]. When an electron jumps from a higher energy to a lower, a [[photon]] of a specific wavelength is emitted.
[[File:Hydrogen transitions.svg|thumb|left|400px|Electron transitions and their resulting wavelengths for Hydrogen. Energy levels are not to scale.]]
The spectral lines are grouped into series according to ''n'''. Lines are named sequentially starting from the longest wavelength/lowest frequency of the series, using Greek letters within each series. For example, the {{nowrap|2 &amp;rarr; 1}} line is called &quot;Lyman-alpha&quot; (Ly-α), while the {{nowrap|7 &amp;rarr; 3}} line is called &quot;Paschen-delta&quot; (Pa-δ). Some hydrogen spectral lines fall outside these series, such as the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line]]; these correspond to much rarer atomic events such as [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html |title=The Hydrogen 21-cm Line |accessdate=2009-03-18 |work=[[Hyperphysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fine structure]] also results in single spectral lines appearing as two or more closely grouped thinner lines, due to relativistic corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liboff |first=Richard L. |author-link=Richard Liboff |title=Introductory Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2002 |isbn=0-8053-8714-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically one can only observe these series from pure hydrogen samples in a lab. Many of the lines are very faint and additional lines can be caused by other elements (such as [[helium]] if using sunlight, or [[nitrogen]] in the air). Lines outside of the visible spectrum typically cannot be seen in observations of sunlight, as the atmosphere absorbs most infra-red and ultraviolet wavelengths.

==Rydberg formula==
The energy differences between levels in the Bohr model, and hence the wavelengths of emitted/absorbed photons, is given by the Rydberg formula&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bohr |first=Niels |author-link=Niels Bohr |chapter=Rydberg's discovery of the spectral laws |editor-last=Kalckar |editor-first=J. |title=N. Bohr: Collected Works |publisher=North-Holland Publ. |publication-place=Amsterdam |publication-date=1985 |volume=10 |pages=373–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over \lambda} = R \left( {1 \over (n^\prime)^2} - {1 \over n^2} \right) \qquad \left( R = 1.097373 \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{m}^{-1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the initial energy level, ''n&amp;prime;'' is the final energy level, and ''R'' is the [[Rydberg constant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CODATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaningful values are returned only when ''n'' is greater than ''n&amp;prime;'' and the limit of one over infinity is taken to be zero.

==Series==
All wavelengths are given to 3 [[significant figures]].

Balmer lines are historically referred to as &quot;[[H-alpha]]&quot;, &quot;H-beta&quot;, &quot;H-gamma&quot; and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Balmer |first=J.

Parts of the Balmer series can be seen in the [[Fraunhofer lines|solar spectrum]]. H-alpha is an important line used in astronomy to detect the presence of hydrogen.

===Further (n&amp;prime; &gt; 6)===
Further series are unnamed, but follow exactly the same pattern as dictated by the Rydberg equation. Series are increasingly spread out and occur in increasing wavelengths. The lines are also increasingly faint, corresponding to increasingly rare atomic events.

== Extension to other systems ==
The concepts of the Rydberg formula can be applied to any system with a single particle orbiting a nucleus, for example a [[Helium|He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion or a [[muonium]] particle. The equation must be modified based on the system's [[Bohr radius]]; emissions will be of a similar character but at a different range of energies.

All other atoms possess at least two electrons in their [[ionization|unionized]] form and the interactions between these electrons makes analysis of the spectrum by such simple methods as described here impractical.  The deduction of the Rydberg formula was a major step in physics, but it was long before an extension to the spectra of other elements could be accomplished.

'''Hydrogen deuterium exchange''' (also called H-D or H/D exchange) is a [[chemical reaction]] in which a covalently bonded [[hydrogen]] atom is replaced by a [[deuterium]] atom, or vice versa. Usually the examined protons are the [[amide]]s in the backbone of a [[protein]]. The method gives information about the [[solvent]] accessibility of various parts of the molecule, and thus the [[protein structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein. Hydrogen exchange was first shown and explored by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]].

==The exchange reaction==
In solution, [[Amide]] [[hydrogen]]s in the [[peptide bond]]s of proteins exchange protons with the [[solvent]]. By changing the solvent from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, deuterons will be incorporated in the amide positions and the exchange reaction can be followed. Most often, deuterium is added to a protein in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O by diluting the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (e.g. tenfold). Usually exchange is performed at physiological pH (7.0-8.0) where proteins are in their most native ensemble of conformational states.  See also {{ref|englander}}.

Because the exchange reaction can be either [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]] catalyzed, it is strongly [[pH]] dependent. For the backbone amide hydrogens, the minimum exchange rate occurs at approximately pH 2.6, on average.  By performing the exchange at neutral pH and then rapidly changing the pH, the exchange rates of the backbone amide hydrogens can be dramatically slowed, or [[quenching|quenched]].  The pH at which the reaction is quenched depends on the analysis method.  For detection by NMR, the pH may be moved to around 4.0-4.5.  For detection by mass spectrometry, the pH is dropped to the minimum of the exchange curve, pH 2.6. In the most basic experiment, the reaction is allowed to take place for a set time before it is quenched.

The deuteration pattern of a quenched protein can be stably maintained in non-aqueous environments.  However, analysis of the deuteration is usually performed in an aqueous solution, which means that exchange will continue at a slow rate even after the reaction is quenched.  Reversion of deuterated positions after the quench step is referred to as ''back-exchange'' and various methods have been devised to correct for this.

==Detection of H/D exchange==
H-D exchange was measured originally by the father of hydrogen exchange [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]] using density gradient tubes.  In modern times, H/D exchange has primarily been monitored by the methods: [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]]. Each of these methods have their advantages and drawbacks.

===NMR spectroscopy===
[[Hydrogen]] and [[deuterium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are grossly different in their magnetic properties.  Thus it is possible to distinguish between them by [[NMR spectroscopy]]. Typically [[HSQC]] spectra are recorded at a series of timepoints while the hydrogen is exchanging with the deuterium. Since the HSQC experiment is specific for hydrogen, the signal will decay exponentially as the hydrogen exchanges. It is then possible to fit an exponential function to the data, and obtain the exchange constant. This method gives [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]-specific information for all the residues in the protein simultaneously. The major drawback is that it requires a prior assignment of the spectrum for the protein in question. This can be very labor intensive, and usually limits the method to proteins smaller than 25 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]]. Because it takes minutes to hours to record the spectra, it is difficult to obtain information about amides, that exchange in shorter time frames.

===Mass spectrometry===
Mass spectrometry has several advantages over NMR with respect to analysis of H/D exchange reactions: Much less material is needed, the concentration of protein can be very low (as low as 0.1 uM), the size limit is much greater, and data can usually be collected and interpreted much more quickly{{ref|review}}.

The deuterium nucleus is twice as heavy as the hydrogen nucleus because it contains a [[neutron]] as well as a proton.  Thus a protein that contains some deuterium will be heavier than one that contains all hydrogen. As a protein is increasingly deuterated, the [[molecular mass]] increases correspondingly.  Detecting the change in the mass of a protein upon deuteration was made possible by modern protein mass spectrometry, first reported in 1991 by Katta and Chait {{ref|katta}}.

The location and relative amount of deuterium exchange along the peptide backbone can be determined roughly by subjecting the protein to proteolysis after the exchange reaction has been quenched.  Individual peptides are then analyzed for overall deuteration of each peptide fragment.  Using this technique the resolution of deuterium exchange is determined by the size of the peptides produced during digestion {{ref|zhang}}.  [[Pepsin]], an acid [[protease]], is commonly used for proteolysis, as the quench pH must be maintained during the proteolytic reaction.  To minimize the back-exchange, proteolysis and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis must be done as quickly as possible.  [[HPLC]] separation of the peptic digest is often carried out at low temperature just prior to [[electrospray mass spectrometry]] to minimize back-exchange. More recently, [[UPLC]] has been used due to its superior separation capabilities {{ref|uplc}}.

It was proposed in 1999 that it might be possible to achieve single-residue resolution by using [[collision-induced dissociation]] fragmentation of deuterated peptides in conjunction with [[tandem mass spectrometry]]. It was soon discovered that CID causes &quot;scrambling&quot; of the deuterium position within the peptides {{ref|scrambling1}}{{ref|scrambling2}}. However, collisions produced by [[electron transfer dissociation]] seem to proceed with little or no scrambling under the correct experimental conditions {{ref|scrambling3}}.  This suggests that eventually it may be possible to obtain single-residue resolution of H/D exchange reactions on a routine basis.

==Applications to protein structure==
It is not possible to determine the structure of a protein with H/D exchange nor is it possible to define secondary structural elements.  The reasons for this are related to the way in which [[protein structure]] structure slows exchange.  Exchange rates are a function of two parameters: solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding.  Thus an amide which is part of a intramolecular [[hydrogen bond]] will exchange slowly if at all, while an amide on the surface of protein hydrogen bonded to water will exchange rapidly. Amides buried from the solvent but not hydrogen bonded may also have very slow exchange rates.  Because both solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding contribute to the rate of exchange, it becomes difficult to attribute a given exchange rate to a structural element without [[x-ray crystallography]] or NMR structural data.

H/D exchange has been used to characterize the [[protein folding|folding]] pathway of proteins, by refolding the protein under exchange conditions. The parts of the structure that form rapidly, will be protected quickly, and thus not exchanged, whereas areas that fold late in the pathway will be exposed to the exchange for longer periods of time. Thus H/D exchange can be used to determine the sequence of various folding events. The critical factor determining the time resolution of this approach is the time required for quenching.

H/D exchange has been used to characterize protein-protein interactions{{ref|komives}}. The exchange reaction needs to be carried out with the isolated proteins and with the complex. The exchanging regions are then compared. If a region is buried by the binding, the amides in this region may be protected in the complex and exchange slowly. However, one must bear in mind that H-D exchange cannot be used to locate binding interfaces for all protein-protein interactions.  Some protein-protein interactions are driven by electrostatic forces of side chains and are unlikely to change the exchange rate of backbone amide hydrogens, particularly if the amide hydrogens are located in stable structural elements such as alpha helicies.

Lastly, H/D exchange can be used to monitor conformational changes in proteins as they relate to protein function.  If conformation is altered as result of [[post-translational modification]], enzyme activation, drug binding or other functional events, there will likely be a change to H/D exchange that can be detected.

==Uses==
MRS allows doctors and researchers to obtain biochemical information about the tissues of the human body in a non-invasive way (without the need for a biopsy), whereas MRI only gives them information about the structure of the body (the distribution of water and fat).

For example, whereas MRI can tell doctors where a tumour (cancer) is located within a patient's body, MRS can, in theory, tell them how aggressive (malignant) the tumour is.

MRS equipment can be tuned (just like a radio receiver) to pick up signals from different chemical nuclei within the body. The most common nuclei to be studied are protons (hydrogen), phosphorus, carbon, sodium and fluorine.

The types of biochemicals (metabolites) which can be studied include choline-containing compounds (which are used to make cell membranes), creatine (a chemical involved in energy metabolism), inositol and glucose (both sugars), N-acetyl aspartate (a chemical associated with the myelin sheaths of nerve cell fibres), and alanine and lactate which are elevated in some tumors.

At present MRS is mainly used as a tool by scientists (e.g., medical physicists and biochemists) for medical research projects, but it is becoming clear that it also has the ability to give doctors useful clinical information which can be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of disease.

MRS is currently used to investigate a number of diseases in the human body, most notably cancer (in brain, breast and prostate), epilepsy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's Chorea.

==Example==

Shown below is an MRI brain scan (in the axial plane, that is slicing from front-to-back and side-to-side through the head) showing a brain tumour (meningioma) at the bottom right. The red box shows the volume of interest from which chemical information was obtained by MRS (a cube with 2&amp;nbsp;cm sides which produces a square when intersecting the 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick slice of the MRI scan).

The proton MRS spectrum from this tumour is also shown (as acquired with a 1.5 tesla whole-body MRI scanner). The horizontal axis is NMR frequency (or chemical shift in parts per million, p.p.m., relative to a reference chemical at 0 p.p.m. rather than in the absolute units of hertz) and the vertical axis is signal strength (in arbitrary units).

Each biochemical, or metabolite, has a different peak in the spectrum which appears at a known frequency.  The peaks corresponding to the amino acid alanine, are highlighted in red (at 1.4 p.p.m). This is an example of the kind of biochemical information which can help doctors to make their diagnosis. Other metabolites of note are choline (3.2 p.p.m.) and creatine (3.0 p.p.m.).

The ICP-AES is composed of two parts: the ICP and the optical [[spectrometer]]. The ICP torch consists of 3 concentric [[quartz]] glass tubes.  The output or &quot;work&quot; coil of the [[radio frequency]] (RF) generator surrounds part of this quartz torch. [[Argon]] gas is typically used to create the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

When the torch is turned on, an intense [[electromagnetic field]] is created within the coil by the high power [[radio frequency]] signal flowing in the coil.  This RF signal is created by the RF generator which is, effectively, a high power radio transmitter driving the &quot;work coil&quot; the same way a typical radio transmitter drives a transmitting antenna.  The argon gas flowing through the torch is ignited with a [[Tesla]] unit that creates a brief discharge arc through the argon flow to initiate the ionization process.  Once the plasma is &quot;ignited&quot;, the Tesla unit is turned off.

The argon gas is ionized in the intense electromagnetic field and flows in a particular rotationally symmetrical pattern towards the magnetic field of the RF coil. A stable, high temperature plasma of about 7000 K is then generated as the result of the inelastic collisions created between the neutral argon atoms and the charged particles.

A [[peristaltic pump]] delivers an aqueous or organic sample into a [[nebulizer]] where it is atomized and introduced directly inside the plasma flame. The sample immediately collides with the electrons and other charged ions in the plasma and is broken down into charged [[ions]]. The various molecules break up into their respective atoms which then lose [[electron]]s and recombine repeatedly in the plasma, giving off radiation at the characteristic [[wavelength]]s of the elements involved.

In some designs, a shear gas, typically [[nitrogen]] or dry compressed air is used to 'cut' the plasma flame at a specific spot. One or two transfer lenses are then used to focus the emitted light on a [[diffraction grating]] where it is separated into its component wavelengths in the optical spectrometer.  In other designs, the plasma impinges directly upon an optical interface which consists of an orifice from which a constant flow of argon emerges, deflecting the plasma and providing cooling while allowing the emitted light from the plasma to enter the optical chamber.  Still other designs use optical fibers to convey some of the light to separate optical chambers.

Within the optical chamber(s), after the light is separated into its different wavelengths (colors), the light intensity is measured with a [[photomultiplier]] tube or tubes physically positioned to &quot;view&quot; the specific wavelength(s) for each element line involved, or, in more modern units, the separated colors fall upon an array of semiconductor photodetectors such as CCDs [[charge coupled devices]].  In units using these detector arrays, the intensities of all wavelengths (within the system's range) can be measured simultaneously, allowing the instrument to analyze for every element to which the unit is sensitive all at once.  Thus, samples can be analyzed very quickly.

The intensity of each line is then compared to previously measured intensities of known [[concentration]]s of the elements, and their concentrations are then computed by extrapolation along the calibration lines.

In addition, special software generally corrects for interferences caused by the presence of different elements within a given sample matrix.

==Applications==

ICP-AES is often used for analysis of trace elements in soil, and it is for that reason it is often used in forensics to ascertain the origin of soil samples found at crime scenes or on victims etc. Taking one sample from a control and determining the metal composition and taking the sample obtained from evidence and determine that metal composition allows a comparison to be made. While soil evidence may not stand alone in court it certainly strengthens other evidence.

'''Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry''' ('''ICP-MS''') is a type of [[mass spectrometry]] that is highly sensitive and capable of the determination of a range of [[metals]] and several [[non-metals]] at concentrations below one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (part per trillion). It is based on coupling together an [[inductively coupled plasma]] as a method of producing [[ions]] ([[ionization]]) with a [[mass spectrometer]] as a method of separating and detecting the ions.  ICP-MS is also capable of monitoring isotopic speciation for the ions of choice.


==Components==

===Inductively coupled plasma===
An [[inductively coupled plasma]] is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that contains a sufficient concentration of ions and electrons to make the gas electrically conductive. The plasmas used in spectrochemical  analysis are essentially electrically neutral, with each positive charge on an ion balanced by a free electron. In these plasmas the positive ions are almost all singly-charged and there are few negative ions, so there are nearly equal amounts of ions and electrons in each unit volume of plasma 

An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 14 to 18 liters per  minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electrical spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 million cycles per second). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly-changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions. The temperature of the plasma is very high, of the order of 10,000 K.

The ICP can be retained in the quartz torch because the flow of gas between the two outermost tubes keeps the plasma away from the walls of the torch. A second flow of argon (around 1 liter per minute) is usually introduced between the central tube and the intermediate tube to keep the plasma away from the end of the central tube. A third flow (again usually around 1 liter per minute) of gas is introduced into the central tube of the torch. This gas flow passes through the centre of the plasma, where it forms a channel that is cooler than the surrounding plasma but still much hotter than a chemical flame. Samples to be analyzed are introduced into this central channel, usually as a mist of liquid formed by passing the liquid sample into a nebulizer. 

As a droplet of nebulized sample enters the central channel of the ICP, it evaporates and any solids that were dissolved in the liquid vaporize and then break down into atoms. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely-bound electron to form a singly charged ion.

===Mass spectrometry===
For coupling to [[mass spectrometry]], the ions from the plasma are extracted through a series of cones into a mass spectrometer, usually a [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]]. The ions are separated on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio and a detector receives an ion signal [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the concentration.

The concentration of a sample can be determined through calibration with [[certified reference material]] such as single or multi-element reference standards. ICP-MS also lends itself to quantitative determinations through [[Isotope Dilution]], a single point method based on an isotopically enriched standard.

Other mass analyzers coupled to ICP systems include double focusing magnetic-electrostatic sector systems with both single and multiple collector, as well as time of flight systems (both [[axial]] and [[orthogonal]] accelerators have been used).

Other types of spectrometers using ICP are [[ICP-AES]] (atomic emission spectrometer) and MC-ICP-MS (multi-collector).

==Routine Maintenance==
As with any piece of instrumentation or equipment, there are many aspects of maintenance that need to be encompassed by daily, weekly and annual procedures.  The frequency of maintenance is typically determined by the sample volume and cumulative run time that the instrument is subjected to.  

One of the first things that should be carried out before the calibration of the ICP-MS is a sensitivity check and optimization.  This ensures that the operator is aware of any possible issues with the instrument and if so, may address them before beginning a calibration.  Typical indicators of sensitivity are Rhodium levels, Cerium/Oxide ratios and DI water blanks.  

One of the most frequent forms of routine maintenance is changing out sample and waste tubing on the peristaltic pump, as these tubes can get worn fairly quickly resulting in holes and clogs in the sample line, resulting in skewed results.  Other parts that will need regular cleaning and/or replacing are sample tips, nebulizer tips, sample cones, skimmer cones, injector tubes, torches and lenses.  It may also be necessary to change the oil in the interface roughing pump as well as the vacuum backing pump, depending on the workload put on the instrument.

==Metal speciation==
A growing trend in the world of elemental analysis has revolved around the speciation of certain metals such as chromium and arsenic.  One of the primary techniques to achieve this is to use an ICP-MS in combination with an [[HPLC]].  There are many advantages, from a clinical standpoint, in knowing the specific species present within a patient's body.  For example, one species of [[chromium]], known as Chromium III or Trivalent Chromium, is needed by the body and causes no ill effects; however, Chromium VI or Hexavalent Chromium, is very toxic to the body.  Chromium VI can cause mutations that may lead to cancer if not repaired by the body.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

It is also beneficial for a clinician to utilize speciation analysis from a preventative standpoint.  Many patients, who suffer from elevated levels of certain metals, do not know when or where the exposure incident(s) are occurring.  By identifying the exact species, a physician can better narrow the search for possible exposure sites, therefore helping the patient to avoid certain areas in the future.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Quantification of proteins and biomolecules by ICP-MS==
There is an increasing trend of using ICP-MS as a tool in Speciation Analysis, which normally involves a front end chromatograph separation and an [[elemental selective detector]], such as AAS and ICP-MS. For example, ICP-MS may be combined with size exclusion chromatograph] and quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ([[QPNC-PAGE]]) for identifying and quantifying native metal cofactor containing proteins in biofluids. Also the phosphorylation status of proteins can be analyzed.

Recently{{when?}} a new type of protein tagging reagents called metal coded affinity tags (MeCAT) were introduced to label proteins quantitatively with metals, especially lanthanides.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17627934&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahrends R, Pieper S, Kühn A, ''et al.'' |title=A metal-coded affinity tag approach to quantitative proteomics |journal= Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics|volume= 6|issue=  11| pages = 1907|year=2007 |pmid=17627934 |doi=10.1074/mcp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MeCAT labelling allows relative and absolute quantification of all kind of proteins or other biomolecules like peptides. MeCAT comprises a site-specific biomolecule tagging group with at least a strong chelate group which binds metals. The MeCAT labelled proteins can be accurately quantified by ICP-MS down to low attomol amount of analyte which is at least 2-3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than other mass spectrometry based quantification methods. By introducing several MeCAT labels to a biomolecule and further optimization of LC-ICP-MS detection limits in the zeptomol range are within the realms of possibility. By using different lanthanides MeCAT multiplexing can be used for pharmacokinetics of proteins and peptides or the analysis of the differential expression of proteins (proteomics) e.g. in biological fluids. Breakable PAGE SDS-PAGE (DPAGE, dissolvable PAGE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or chromatography is used for separation of MeCAT labelled proteins. Flow-injection ICP-MS analysis of protein bands or spots from DPAGE SDS-PAGE gels can be easily performed by dissolving the DPAGE gel after electrophoresis and staining of the gel. MeCAT labelled proteins are identified and relatively quantified  on peptide level by MALDI-MS or ESI-MS.

==Sample introduction==
The first step in analysis is the introduction of the sample. This has been achieved in ICP-MS through a variety of means.

The most common method is the use of a [[nebulizer]]. This is a device which converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a [[slurry]]. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a double pass or cyclonic spray chamber. Use of autosamplers makes this easier and faster.

Less commonly, the [[laser ablation]] has been used as a means of sample introduction. In this method, a laser is focused on the sample and creates a plume of ablated material which can be swept into the plasma. This is particularly useful for solid samples, though can be difficult to create standards for leading the challenges in quantitative analysis.

Other methods of sample introduction are also utilized. Electrothermal vaporization (ETV) and in torch vaporization (ITV) use hot surfaces (graphite or metal, generally) to vaporize samples for introduction. These can use very small amounts of liquids, solids, or slurries. Other methods like vapor generation are also known.

==Transfer of ions into vacuum==
The carrier gas (usually [[argon]] or occasionally [[helium]]) is sent through the central channel and into the very hot plasma. The sample is then exposed to [[radio frequency]] which converts the gas into a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The high temperature of the plasma is sufficient to cause a very large portion of the sample to form ions. This fraction of ionization can approach 100% for some elements (e.g. sodium), but this is dependent on the ionization potential. A fraction of the formed ions passes through a ~1mm hole (sampler cone) and then a ~0.4mm hole (skimmer cone). The purpose of which is to allow a [[vacuum]] that is required by the [[mass spectrometer]].

The vacuum is created and maintained by a series of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary vane pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.

==Sample Preparation==
For most clinical methods using ICP-MS, there is a relatively simple and quick sample prep process.  The main component to the sample is an internal standard, which also serves as the diluent.  This internal standard consists primarily of [[deionized water]], with nitric or hydrochloric acid, and Indium and/or Gallium.  Depending on the sample type, usually 5 ml of the internal standard is added to a test tube along with 10-500 microliters of sample. This mixture is then vortexed for several seconds or until mixed well and then loaded onto the autosampler tray.
For other applications that may involve very viscous samples or samples that have particulate matter, a process known as [[sample digestion]] may have to be carried out, before it can be pipetted and analyzed.  This adds an extra first step to the above process, and therefore makes the sample prep more lengthy.

==Ion optics==

Before mass separation, a beam of positive ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles that may have been carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion lens arrangements for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent's Omega Lens &lt;ref&gt;Kenichi Sakata et al., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and method, US patent 6265717 B1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Perkin-Elmer's Shadow Stop &lt;ref&gt; ''Scott D. Tanner et al.'', Device and method preventing ion source gases from entering reaction cell, US patent 6639665 B2.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is [[Varian]] patented used by [[Bruker]]  &lt;ref&gt; ''Iouri Kalinitchenko'' Ion Optical System for a Mass Spectrometer, United States Patent Number 6,614,021 B1 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 90 degrees reflecting &quot;Ion Mirror&quot; optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background &lt;ref&gt; ''Shane Elliott, Michael Knowles, and Iouri Kalinitchenko'', A Change in Direction in ICP-MS, published on Mar, 2004 in American Laboratory,

These ions are removed by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. Supplying the reactive/collisional gas into the tip of the skimmer cone and/or into the tip of the sampler cone induces extra collisions and reactions that destroy polyatomic ions in the passing plasma.

==Plasma==
The plasma used in an ICP-MS is made by ionizing argon gas (Ar → Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  The energy required for this reaction is obtained by pulsing an electrical current in wires that surround the argon gas.  A complete description of plasma generation is given in the following section.

After injecting the sample, the plasma's extreme temperature causes the sample to separate into individual atoms ([[atomization]]).  Next, the plasma ionizes these atoms (M → M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) so that they can be detected by the mass spectrometer.

===Plasma Generation===
An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 14 to 18 liters per minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electrical spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 million cycles per second). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly-changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions.

===Advantage of Argon===
Making the plasma from argon, instead of other gases, has several advantages.  First, argon is abundant (in the atmosphere, as a result of the radioactive decay of potassium) and therefore cheaper than other noble gases. Argon also has a higher first ionization potential than all other elements except He, F, and Ne.  Because of this high ionization energy, the reaction  (Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Ar) is more energetically favorable than the reaction (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → M).  This ensures that the sample remains ionized (as M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) so that the mass spectrometer can detect it.

Argon can be purchased for use with the ICP-MS in either a refrigerated liquid or a gas form.  However it is important to note that whichever form of argon purchased, it should have a guaranteed purity of 99.9% Argon at a minimum.  It is important to determine which type of argon will be best suited for the specific situation.  Liquid argon is typically cheaper and can be stored in a greater quantity as opposed to the gas form, which is more expensive and takes up more tank space.  If the instrument is in an environment where it gets infrequent use, then buying argon in the gas state will be most appropriate as it will be more than enough to suit smaller run times and gas in the cylinder will remain stable for longer periods of time, whereas liquid argon will suffer loss to the environment due to venting of the tank when stored over extended time frames.  However if the ICP-MS is to be used routinely and is on and running for eight or more hours each day for several days a week, then going with liquid argon will be the most suitable.  If there are to be multiple ICP-MS instruments running for long periods of time, then it will most likely be beneficial for the laboratory to install a bulk or micro bulk argon tank which will be maintained by a gas supply company, thus eliminating the need to change out tanks frequently as well as minimizing loss of argon that is left over in each used tank as well as down time for tank changeover.

==Elemental analysis==
The ICP-MS allows determination of [[chemical element|elements]] with atomic mass ranges 7 to 250. This encompasses [[Lithium|Li]] to [[U]]. Some masses are prohibited such as 40 due to the abundance of argon in the sample. Other blocked regions may include mass 80 (due to the argon dimer), and mass 56 (due to ArO), the latter of which greatly hinders [[Fe]] analysis unless the instrumentation is fitted with a reaction chamber.

A typical ICP-MS will be able to detect in the region of nanograms per litre to 10 or 100 milligrams per litre or around 8 orders of magnitude of concentration units.

Unlike [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], which can only measure a single element at a time ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 [[Pittcon Editors' Awards]].

==Usage==
One of the largest volume uses for ICP-MS is in the medical and forensic field, specifically, toxicology.  A physician may order a metal assay for a number of reasons, such as suspicion of heavy metal poisoning, metabolic concerns, and even hepatological issues.  Depending on the specific parameters unique to each patient's diagnostic plan, samples collected for analysis can range from whole blood, urine, plasma, serum, to even packed red blood cells.  Another primary use for this instrument lies in the environmental field.  Such applications include water testing for municipalities or private individuals all the way to soil, water and other material analysis for industrial purposes.  

In recent years, industrial and biological monitoring has presented another major need for metal analysis via ICP-MS.  Individuals working in plants where exposure to metals is likely and unavoidable, such as a battery factory, are required by their employer, to have their blood or urine analyzed for metal toxicity on a regular basis.  This monitoring has become a mandatory practice implemented by OSHA, in an effort to protect workers from their work environment and ensure proper rotation of work duties (i.e. rotating employees from a high exposure position to a low exposure position).

Regardless of the sample type, blood, water, etc., it is important that it be free of clots or other particulate matter, as even the smallest clot can disrupt sample flow and block or clog the sample tips within the spray chamber.  Very high concentrations of salts, e.g. sodium chloride in sea water, can eventually lead to blockages as some of the ions reunite after leaving the torch and build up around the orifice of the skimmer cone.  This can be avoided by diluting samples whenever high salt concentrations are suspected, though at a cost to detection limits.

ICP is used for [[motor oil]] analysis. Analyzing used motor oil reveals a great deal about how the engine is operating. Parts that wear in the engine will deposit traces in the oil which can be detected with ICP. ICP analysis can help to determine whether parts are failing. In addition, ICP can determine what amount of the original oil additives remain, and tell how much service life the oil has remaining. Oil analysis is often used by fleet manager or automotive enthusiasts who have an interest in finding out as much about their engine's operation as possible.

This technique is also widely used the field of radiometric dating, in which it is used to analyze relative abundance of different isotopes. ICP-MS is more suitable for this application than the previously used Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry, as species with high ionization energy such as Osmium (Os) and Tungsten (Hf-W) can be easily ionized.

In physical chemistry|physical and analytical chemistry, infrared spectroscopy (&quot;IR spectroscopy&quot;) is a technique used to identify chemical compounds based on how infrared|infrared radiation is absorbed by the compounds' chemical bonds. This article is an '''IR spectroscopy correlation table''' that lists some general absorption peaks for common types of atomic bonds and functional groups. Note that this information is unreferenced, and may not be accurate.

The absorptions in this range do not apply only to bonds in organic molecules. IR spectroscopy is useful when it comes to analysis of inorganic compounds (such as metal complexes  or fluoromanganates) as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Infrared spectroscopy''' (IR spectroscopy) is the subset of spectroscopy that deals with the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It covers a range of techniques, the most common being a form of absorption spectroscopy. As with spectroscopy|all spectroscopic techniques, it can be used to identify compounds or investigate sample composition. Infrared spectroscopy correlation tables are tabulated in the literature.

== Background and Theory ==
The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is divided into three regions; the near-, mid- and far- infrared, named for their relation to the visible spectrum. The far-infrared, approximately  400-10&amp;nbsp;wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1000–30&amp;nbsp;μm), lying adjacent to the microwave region, has low energy and may be used for rotational spectroscopy. The mid-infrared, approximately 4000–400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (30–1.4&amp;nbsp;μm) may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated Rovibronic excitation|rotational-vibrational structure. The higher energy near-IR, approximately 14000–4000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1.4–0.8&amp;nbsp;μm) can excite overtones|overtone or Harmonic (mathematics)|harmonic vibrations. The names and classifications of these subregions are merely conventions. They are neither strict divisions nor based on exact molecular or electromagnetic properties.

Infrared spectroscopy exploits the fact that molecules have specific frequencies at which they rotate or vibrate corresponding to discrete energy levels (vibrational modes). These resonant frequency|resonant frequencies are determined by the shape of the molecular potential energy surfaces, the masses of the atoms and, by the associated vibronic coupling.  In order for a vibrational mode in a molecule to be IR active, it must be associated with changes in the permanent dipole.  In particular, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation|Born-Oppenheimer and harmonic approximations, i.e. when the molecular Hamiltonian corresponding to the electronic ground state can be approximated by a quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator in the neighborhood of the equilibrium molecular geometry, the resonant frequencies are determined by the normal modes corresponding to the molecular electronic ground state potential energy surface. Nevertheless, the resonant frequencies can be in a first approach related to the strength of the bond, and the atomic mass|mass of the atoms at either end of it. Thus, the frequency of the vibrations can be associated with a particular bond type. 

Simple diatomic molecules have only one bond, which may stretch. More complex molecules have many bonds, and  vibrations can be conjugated, leading to infrared absorptions at characteristic frequencies that may be related to chemical groups. For example, the atoms in a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, commonly found in organic compounds can vibrate in six different ways: '''symmetrical and antisymmetrical stretching''', '''scissoring''', '''rocking''', '''wagging''' and '''twisting''':

The infrared spectrum of a sample is collected by passing a beam of infrared light through the sample.  Examination of the transmitted light reveals how much energy was absorbed at each wavelength. This can be done with a monochromatic beam, which changes in wavelength over time, or by using a Fourier transform instrument to measure all wavelengths at once. From this, a transmittance or absorbance spectrum can be produced, showing at which IR wavelengths the sample absorbs.  Analysis of these absorption characteristics reveals details about the molecular structure of the sample.

This technique works almost exclusively on samples with covalent bonds. Simple spectra are obtained from samples with few IR active bonds and high levels of purity. More complex molecular structures lead to more absorption bands and more complex spectra. The technique has been used for the characterization of very complex mixtures.

== Sample preparation ==
Gaseous samples require little preparation beyond purification, but a sample cell with a long pathlength (typically 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm) is normally needed, as gases show relatively weak absorbances.

Liquid samples can be sandwiched between two plates of a high purity salt (commonly sodium chloride, or table salt, although a number of other salts such as potassium bromide or calcium fluoride are also used). The plates are transparent to the infrared light and will not introduce any lines onto the spectra. Some salt plates are highly soluble in water, so the sample and washing reagents must be anhydrous (without water).

Solid samples can be prepared in four major ways. The first is to crush the sample with a mulling agent (usually nujol) in a marble or agate mortar, with a pestle. A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured.

The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then crushed in a mechanical die press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass.

The third technique is the Cast Film technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis.

The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20-100 micrometre) film from a solid sample. This is one of the most important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved. 

It is important to note that spectra obtained from different sample preparation methods will look slightly different from each other due to differences in the samples' physical states.

== Typical method ==
[[Image:IR spectroscopy apparatus.jpeg|thumbnail|right|400px|Typical apparatus]]
A beam of infrared light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in)

== Uses and applications ==

Infrared spectroscopy is widely used in both research and industry as a simple and reliable technique for measurement, quality control and dynamic measurement. It is of especial use in forensic analysis in both criminal and civil cases, enabling identification of polymer degradation for example. It is perhaps the most widely used method of applied spectroscopy.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The instruments are now small, and can be transported, even for use in field trials. With increasing technology in computer filtering and manipulation of the results, samples in solution can now be measured accurately (water produces a broad absorbance across the range of interest, and thus renders the spectra unreadable without this computer treatment). Some instruments will also automatically tell you what substance is being measured from a store of thousands of reference spectra held in storage.

By measuring at a specific frequency over time, changes in the character or quantity of a particular bond can be measured. This is especially useful in measuring the degree of polymerization in polymer manufacture. Modern research instruments can take infrared measurements across the whole range of interest as frequently as 32 times a second. This can be done whilst simultaneous measurements are made using other techniques. This makes the observations of chemical reactions and processes quicker and more accurate.

Techniques have been developed to assess the quality of tea-leaves using infrared spectroscopy. This will mean that highly trained experts (also called 'noses') can be used more sparingly, at a significant cost saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Luypaert|first1=J.|last2=Zhang|first2=M.H.|last3=Massart|first3=D.L.

Infrared spectroscopy has been highly successful for applications in both organic and inorganic chemistry. Infrared spectroscopy has also been successfully utilized in the field of semiconductor microelectronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lau|first= W.S. |coauthors=  |title= Infrared characterization for microelectronics |publisher= World Scientific |year= 1999 |month= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;: for example, infrared spectroscopy can be applied to semiconductors like silicon, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, zinc selenide, amorphous silicon, silicon nitride, etc.

==Isotope effects==
The different isotopes in a particular species may give fine detail in infrared spectroscopy. For example, the O-O stretching frequency of oxyhemocyanin is experimentally determined to be 832 and 788&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ν(&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) and ν(&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) respectively.

By considering the O-O as a spring, the wavelength of absorbance, ν can be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the spring constant for the bond, and ''μ'' is the reduced mass of the A-B system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B}&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of atom &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;).

The reduced masses for &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O can be approximated as 8 and 9 respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\nu_{^{16}O}}{\nu_{^{18}O}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{8}} \approx \frac{832}{788}&lt;/math&gt;

== Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ==
'''Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy''' is a measurement technique for collecting infrared spectra.  Instead of recording the amount of energy absorbed when the frequency of the infra-red light is varied (monochromator), the IR light is guided through an interferometer. After passing the sample the measured signal is the interferogram. Performing a mathematical Fourier transform on this signal results in a spectrum identical to that from conventional (dispersive) infrared spectroscopy.  

FTIR spectrometers are cheaper than conventional spectrometers because building of interferometers is easier than the fabrication of a monochromator. In addition, measurement of a single spectrum is faster for the FTIR technique because the information at all frequencies is collected simultaneously. This allows multiple samples to be collected and averaged together resulting in an improvement in sensitivity. Because of its various advantages, virtually all modern infrared spectrometers are FTIR instruments.

== Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy ==
'''Two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis''' is the application of 2D correlation analysis on infrared spectra. By extending the spectral information of a perturbed sample, spectral analysis is simplified and resolution is enhanced. The 2D synchronous and 2D asynchronous spectra represent a graphical overview of the spectral changes due to a perturbation (such as a changing concentration or changing temperature) as well as the relationship between the spectral changes at two different wavenumbers.

[[Image:2dir pulse sequence newversion.png|thumb|300px|right|Pulse Sequence used to obtain a two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared spectrum.]] The time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually referred to as the coherence time and the second time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the waiting time. The excitation frequency is obtained by Fourier transforming along the &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; axis.

Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is a technique that has become available with the development of femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment first a set of pump pulses are applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time, where the system is allowed to relax. The waiting time typically lasts from zero to several picoseconds and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_3&lt;/math&gt; excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes. Because of its extremely high time resolution it can be used to monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.

Like in two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2DNMR) spectroscopy this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allow for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy also involve the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR two distinct techniques, Correlation spectroscopy#COSY|COSY and Correlation spectroscopy#NOESY|NOESY, are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first are related to the scalar coupling, while in the later they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY and nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY. The COSY variant of nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has been used for determination of the secondary structure content proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = N. Demirdöven, C.

The '''in-gel digestion''' is part of the [[sample preparation (mass spectrometry)|sample preparation]] for the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] identification of [[protein]]s in course of [[Proteomics|proteomic analysis]]. The method was introduced 1992 by Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld, J et al., 1992&quot;&gt;Rosenfeld, J et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1992, 203 (1), 173-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite innumerable modifications and improvements the basic elements of the procedure remain largely unchanged. &lt;ref name=&quot;Jeno, P et al., 1995&quot;&gt;Jeno, P et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1995, 224 (1), 75-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 1996&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A et al., ''Anal Chem'', 1996, 68 (5), 850-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Borchers, C et al., ''Anal Chem'', 2000, 72 (6), 1163-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 2006&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A et al., ''Nat Protoc'', 2006, 1 (6), 2856-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/search/allsearch?WISsearch2=granvogl+gruber+2007&amp;WISindexid2=WISall&amp;mode=quicksearch&amp;products=journal&amp;contextLink=%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Findex.html%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3EHome%3C%2Fa%3E+%2F+%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fsubject%3DLIFE%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3ELife+Sciences%3C%2Fa%3E+%2F+%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fsubject%3DLS30%26titles%3Dtrue%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3EMolecular+Cell+Biology%3C%2Fa%3E&amp;contentOID=76510741&amp;contentTitle=PROTEOMICS&amp;WISindexid1=issn&amp;WISsearch1=1615-9861&amp;articleGo.x=21&amp;articleGo.y=13 Granvogl, B et al., ''Proteomics'', 2007, 7 (5), 642-54.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-gel digestion primarily comprises the four steps destaining, [[redox|reduction]] and [[alkylation]] (R&amp;A) of the [[cysteine]]s in the protein, proteolytic cleavage of the protein and [[extraction]] of the generated [[peptide]]s.

==Destaining==
Proteins which were separated by 1D or 2D [[PAGE]] are usually visualised by staining with  [[dye]]s like [[Coomassie]] Brilliant Blue (CBB) or [[silver staining|silver]]. Although the sensitivity of the method is significantly lower, the use of Coomassie is more common for samples destined to mass spectrometry since the silver staining impairs the analysis. After excision of the protein band of interest from the gel most protocols require a destaining of the [[protein]]s before proceeding.

The destaining solution for CBB contains usually the [[buffer solution|buffer]] [[salt]] [[ammonium bicarbonate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and a fraction of 30%-50% [[organic compound|organic]] [[solvent]] (mostly [[acetonitrile]]). The hydrophobic interactions between protein and CBB are reduced by the organic fraction of the solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jin, Y and Manabe, T, 2005&quot;&gt;Jin, Y and Manabe, T, ''Electrophoresis'', 2005, 26 (6), 1019-28.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time diminishes the ionic part of the solution the [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] bonds between the [[dye]] and the positively [[electric charge|charged]] [[amino acid]]s of the protein. In contrast to a mixture of [[water]] with organic solvent the effectivity of destaining is increased. An increase of [[temperature]] promotes the destaining process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd, MD, 1996&quot;&gt;Lloyd, MD, ''Anal Biochem'', 1996, 241 (1), 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; To a certain degree (&lt; 10%) the destaining procedure is accompanied with a loss of protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Speicher, KD et al., ''Journal of Biomolecular Techniques'', 2000, 11 (2), 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the removal of CBB does not affect the yield of [[peptide]]s in the mass spectrometric measurement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry, DE et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Terry, DE et al., ''J Am Soc Mass Spectrom'', 2004, 15 (6), 784-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of silver stained protein bands the destaining is accomplished by [[oxidation]] of the [[metall]]ic [[silver]] attached to the protein by [[potassium ferricyanide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gharahdaghi, F et al., 1999&quot;&gt;Gharahdaghi, F et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 1999, 20 (3), 601-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner, LW et al., 2002&quot;&gt;Sumner, LW et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2002, 16 (3), 160-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The released silver [[ion]]s are [[Coordination complex|complexed]] subsequently by [[sodium thiosulfate]].

==[[Redox|Reduction]] and [[alkylation]] (r&amp;a)==
The staining and destaining is often followed by the reduction and alkylation (r&amp;a) of the [[cystine]]s or [[cysteine]]s potentially embodied in the protein. Hereby the [[disulfide bond]]s of the proteins are irreversibly broken up and the optimal unfolding of the [[tertiary structure]] is obtained. The reduction to the [[thiol]] is accomplished by the reaction with chemicals containing [[sulfhydryl]] or [[phosphine]] groups such as [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT) or [[tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine hydrochloride]] (TCEP). In course of the subsequent irreversible alkylation of the SH groups with  [[iodoacetamide]] the cysteines are transformed to the stable S-carboxyamidomethylcysteine (CAM; adduct: -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The specific mass of the aminoacid cysteine is thereby increased from 103.01 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]] to 160.03 Da.

This chemical modification allows for proteins with a high number of disulfide bonds the successful identification as well as the highest peptide yield and sequence coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hale, JE et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Hale, JE et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 2004, 333 (1), 174-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katayama, H et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Katayama, H et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2004, 18 (20), 2388-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rareness of the aminoacid cysteine for most of the proteins the step of r&amp;a does not effect any improvement of the mass spectrometric analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;&gt;Havlis, J et al., ''Anal Chem'', 2003, 75 (6), 1300-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A and Shevchenko, A, 2001&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A and Shevchenko, A, ''Anal Biochem'', 2001, 296 (2), 279-83.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and homogeneous alkylation of cysteines the point of time for the modification is crucial. With denaturing [[electrophoresis]] it is strongly recommended to perform the reaction before the execution of the electrophoresis, since there are free [[acrylamide]] [[monomer]]s in the gel able to modify cysteines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamdan, M et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Hamdan, M et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 2001, 22 (9), 1633-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mineki, R et al., 2002&quot;&gt;Mineki, R et al., ''Proteomics'', 2002, 2 (12), 1672-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sechi, S and Chait, BT, 1998&quot;&gt;Sechi, S and Chait, BT, ''Anal Chem'', 1998, 70 (24), 5150-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert, B et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Herbert, B et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 2001, 22 (10), 2046-57.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting acrylamide adducts are bound irreversible to the cysteines and can not be removed by subsequent r&amp;a. The specific mass of the adduct is 174.05 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]].

==In-gel digestion==
Afterwards the eponymous step of the method is performed, the in-gel digestion of the proteins. By this procedure, the protein is cut [[enzyme|enzymatically]] into a limited number of shorter fragments. These fragments are called [[peptide]]s and allow for the identification of the protein with their characteristic mass and pattern. The [[serine protease]] [[trypsin]] is the most common enzyme used in protein analytics. Trypsin cuts the [[peptide bond]] specifically at the carboxyl end of the basic aminoacids [[arginine]] and [[lysine]]. If there is an acidic amino acid like [[aspartic acid]] or [[glutamic acid]] in direct neighborhood to the cutting site, the rate of hydrolysis is diminished,  a [[proline]] [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] to the cutting site inhibits the [[hydrolysis]] completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiede, B et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Thiede, B et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2000, 14 (6), 496-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

An undesirable side effect of the use of proteolytic enzymes is the self digestion of the protease. To avoid this, in the past [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions were added to the digestion buffer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vajda, T and Garai, A, 1981&quot;&gt;Vajda, T and Garai, A, ''J Inorg Biochem'', 1981, 15 (4), 307-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sipos, T and Merkel, JR, 1970&quot;&gt;Sipos, T and Merkel, JR, ''Biochemistry'', 1970, 9 (14), 2766-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays most suppliers offer modified trypsin where selective [[methylation]] of the lysines limits the autolytic activity to the arginine cutting sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice, RH et al., 1977&quot;&gt;Rice, RH et al., ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'', 1977, 492 (2), 316-321.&lt;/ref&gt; Unmodified trypsin has its highest activity between 35°C and 45°C. After the modification, the optimal temperature is changed to the range of 50°C to 55°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Finehout, EJ et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Finehout, EJ et al., ''Proteomics'', 2005, 5 (9), 2319-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other enzymes used for in-gel digestion are the endo[[protease]]s [[Lys-C]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, 1999&quot;&gt;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, ''Analytica Chimica Acta '', 1999, 383 (1-2), 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jekel, PA et al., 1983&quot;&gt;Jekel, PA et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1983, 134 (2), 347-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson, SD, 1995&quot;&gt;Patterson, SD, ''Electrophoresis'', 1995, 16 (7), 1104-14.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Glu-C]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Scheler, C et al., 1998&quot;&gt;Scheler, C et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 1998, 19 (6), 918-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Houmard, J and Drapeau, GR, 1972&quot;&gt;Houmard, J and Drapeau, GR, ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'', 1972, 69 (12), 3506-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farah, MA et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Farah, MA et al., ''Biochim Biophys Acta'', 2005, 1725 (3), 269-82.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Asp-N]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wang, L et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Wang, L et al., ''Pharm Res'', 2005, 22 (8), 1338-49.&lt;/ref&gt;. These proteases cut specifically at only one amino acid e.g. Asp-N cuts n-terminal of aspartic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, 1999&quot;/&gt; Therefore a lower number of longer peptides is obtained.

The analysis of the complete primary [[sequence]] of a protein using only one protease is usually not possible. In those cases the digestion of the target protein in several approaches with different enzymes is recommended. The resulting overlapping peptides permit the assembly of the complete sequence of the protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheler, C et al., 1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Choudhary, G et al., 2003&quot;&gt;Choudhary, G et al., ''J Proteome Res'', 2003, 2 (1), 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wa, C et al., 2006&quot;&gt;Wa, C et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 2006, 349 (2), 229-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the digestion the proteins fixed in the matrix of the gel have to be made accessible for the protease. The permeation of the enzyme to the gel is believed to be facilitated by the [[dehydration]] of the gel pieces by treatment with [[acetonitrile]] and subsequent swelling in the digestion buffer containing the protease. This procedure relies on the presumption that the protease permeates to the gel by the process of swelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hellman, U et al., 1995&quot;&gt;Hellman, U et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1995, 224 (1), 451-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Different studies about the penetration of the enzymes to the gel showed the process to be almost completely driven by diffusion. The drying of the gel does not seam to support the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt; Therefore, the improvement of the in-gel digestion has to be achieved by the reduction of the way of the enzyme to its substrate e.g. by cutting the gel to pieces as small as possible.

Usually, the in-gel digestion is run as an overnight process. For the use of trypsin as protease and a temperature of 37°C the time of incubation found in most protocols is 12-15 h. However, experiments about the duration of the digestion process showed that after 3 h there is enough material for successful mass spectrometric analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finehout, EJ and Lee, KH, 2003&quot;&gt;Finehout, EJ and Lee, KH, ''Electrophoresis'', 2003, 24 (19-20), 3508-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the optimisation of the conditions for the protease in temperature and [[pH]] allows for the completion of the digestion of a sample in 30 min.&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt;

[[Surfactant]] (detergents) can aid in the solubilization and denaturing of proteins in the gel and thereby shorten digestion times and increase protein cleavage and the number and amount of extracted peptides, especially for [[lipophilic]] proteins such as [[membrane protein]]s. [[Cleavable detergent]]s are detergents that are cleaved after digestion, often under acidic conditions. This makes the addition of detergents compatible with mass spectrometry.

==Extraction==
After finishing the digestion the peptides generated in this process have to be extracted from the gel matrix. This is accomplished by one or several [[extraction]] steps. The gel particles are incubated with an extraction solution and the supernatant is collected. In the first extraction, almost all of the peptide is recovered, the repetition of the extraction step can increase the yield of the whole process by only 5-10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt; To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed. For the extraction of acidic peptides a solution similar to the concentration and composition of the digestion buffer is used; basic peptides are extracted in dependence to the intended mass spectrometric method with a low concentrated acidic solution of [[formic acid]] for [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]] and [[trifluoroacetic acid]] for [[MALDI]] respectively. Studies on model proteins showed a recovery of approximately 70–80% of the expected peptide yield by extraction from the gel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;
Many protocols contain an additional fraction of acetonitrile to the extraction solution which, in concentrations above 30% (v/v), is effective in reducing the [[adsorption]] of peptides to the surface of [[reaction tube]]s and [[pipette]] tips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erdjument-Bromage, H et al., 1998&quot;&gt;Erdjument-Bromage, H et al., ''J Chromatogr A'', 1998, 826 (2), 167-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid of the pooled extracts is evaporated in a [[centrifugal evaporator]]. If the [[volatile]] salt [[ammonium bicarbonate]] was used for the basic extraction, it is partially removed in the drying process. The dried peptides can be stored at -20°C for at least six months.

==Critical considerations and actual trends==
Some major drawbacks of the common protocols for the in-gel digestion are the extended time need and the multiple processing steps making the method error-prone in respect to [[contamination]]s (especially [[keratin]]). These disadvantages were largely removed by the development of optimised protocols and specialised reaction tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt; 

More severe than the difficulties with handling are losses of material while processing the samples. The mass spectrometric protein analysis is often performed at the limit of detection, so even small losses can decide about success or failure of the whole analysis. These losses are due to washout during different processing steps, [[adsorption]] to the surface of [[reaction tube]]s and [[pipette]] tips, uncomplete extraction of peptides from the gel and/or bad [[ionisation]] of single peptides in the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart, II et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Stewart, II et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2001, 15 (24), 2456-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In dependence of the different physicochemical properties of the peptides the losses can vary between 15 and 50%. Due to this heterogeneity of the peptides up to now a universally valid solution for this major drawback of the method has not been found.

==Commercial implementations==
The commercial implementations of in-gel digestion have to be divided into products for high and for low throughput laboratories.

===High-throughput===
Due to the highly time consuming and work intensive standard procedure the method of in-gel digestion was limited to a relatively small number of protein spots to be processed at a time. Therefore it has been found to be the ideal object for [[automation]] ambitions to overcome these limitations for industrial and service laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houthaeve, T et al., 1997&quot;&gt;Houthaeve, T et al., ''Journal of Protein Chemistry'', 1997, 16 (5), 343-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in laboratories where in-gel digestion is performed with a high-throughput the procedure is usually automated. The degree of automation varies from simple pipetting [[robot]]s to highly sophisticated all-in-one solutions, offering an automated workflow from gel to mass spectrometry. The systems usually consist of a spot picker, a digestion robot, and a spotter. 

The spot picker is programmed with a picking list generated by an [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|gel image analysis software]] and excises the desired protein spots from a [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D gel]]. The gel plugs are transferred to a [[microplate]] where the digestion robot performs the necessary steps for the in-gel digestion. Afterwards the spotter deposits the peptide solution on [[MALDI]] target plates or on microplates for automated [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]]-MS measurement.
Manufacturers of automated in-gel digestion systems are [[GE Healthcare]] (Ettan Series), [[Bruker Daltonics]] (PROTEINEER), [[Applied Biosystems|Perkin Elmer]] (MultiPROBE II), and [[Shimadzu]] (Xcise).
The advantages of the automation other than the larger number of spots to be processed at a time are the reduced manual work and the improved [[standardisation]]. Due to the many handling steps of the method, the results of the manual process could vary depending on the dexterity of the user and the risk of contamination is high. Therefore, the quality of the results is described to be one main advantage of the automated process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canelle, L et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Canelle, L et al., ''Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry'', 2004, 18 (23), 2785&amp;ndash;2794.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drawbacks of automated solutions are the costs for robots, maintenance and consumables as well as the complicated setup of the process. Since the automated picking needs digitised information of the spot location, the analysis of the gel image for relevant spots has to be done by software requiring standardised imaging methods and special scanners. This lengthy procedure prevents the researcher from spontaneous identifications of a few interesting spots from a single gel as well as the need to operate the systems at full capacity. The resulting amount of data from the subsequent automated MS analysis is another problem of high throughput systems as their quality is often questionable and the evaluation of these data takes significantly longer than the collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stead, DA et al., 2008&quot;&gt;Stead, DA et al., ''Brief Bioinform'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu, J et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Hu, J et al., ''Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic'', 2005, 3 (4), 322-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-throughput===
The mentioned drawbacks limit the reasonable use of automated in-gel digestion systems to the routine laboratory whereas the research laboratory with a demand to make a flexible use of the instruments of protein identification more often stays with the manual, low-throughput methods for in-gel digestion and MS analysis. This group of customers is targeted by the industry with several kit systems for in-gel digestion.

Most of the kit systems are mere collections of the chemicals and enzymes needed for the in-gel digestion whereas the underlying protocol remains unchanged from the manual standard procedure described above. The advantage of these products for the unexperienced customer lies in the guaranteed functioning of the diverse solutions in combination with a ready-made protocol for the process. 

A few companies have tried to improve the handling process of in-gel digestion to allow even with manual sample preparation an easier and more standardised workflow. The Montage&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; In-Gel Digest Kit from [[Millipore Corporation|Millipore]] is based on the standard protocol, but enables processing of a large number of parallel samples by transferring the handling of the gel pieces to a modified 96 well microplate. The solutions for the diverse steps of in-gel digestion are pipetted into the wells of this plate whereas the removal of liquids is performed through the bottom of the wells by a [[vacuum pump]]. This system simplifies the handling of the multiple pipetting steps by the use of multichannel [[pipette]]s and even pipetting robots. Actually, some manufacturers of high-throughput systems have adopted the system to work with their robots. This illustrates the orientation of this kit solution to laboratories with a larger number of samples.

A completely different approach is made by the German company [http://www.omx-online.com OMX GmbH]. Their product line OMX-S is designed for the small scale use of up to 24 samples at a time by using a shortened protocol and specialised reaction tubes. The product is based on a critical evaluation of the conventional method of in-gel digestion where 30 steps and about 16 hours are needed for the processing from gel spot to peptide solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeno, P et al., 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 2006&quot;/&gt; The resulting protocol is reduced to four steps and about 2 hours process time by omitting steps not resulting in significant improvement of peptide yield and shortening the incubation time for digestion by increasing the temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt; The reaction tubes provided with this system enable the user to perform all steps from picking the spot to elution of peptides in one device. The gel spot is [[centrifuge]]d to the reaction chamber through a small opening, a process by which the gel is torn to small pieces. The gel stays for the whole procedure in this reaction chamber, only the different buffers are added by manual pipetting and centrifugation and removed by centrifugation. The handling of in-gel digestion is significantly simplified and acclerated with this system, as well as the risks of contamination and loss of material are reduced. However, the processing of a larger number of samples is due to the manual processing of every single spot still work intensive and not comparable to automated systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer''' (INEPT) is a signal enhancement method used in NMR spectroscopy which involves the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from spins with large Boltzmann population differences to nuclear spins of interest with low Boltzmann population differences.  INEPT uses [J-coupling for the polarization transfer in contrast to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) which arises from dipolar cross-relaxation. 

The signal enhancement has two sources:
* The spin population effect increases the signal by a factor of ''K'' = ratio of magnetogyric ratios of the nuclei.
* Nuclei with higher magnetogyric ratio generally relax more quickly.  Since the rate at which the INEPT transfer can be repeated is limited by the relaxation of these spins (rather than the low sensitivity spins), then the experiment can be repeated more frequently, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

As a result, INEPT can enhance the NMR signal by a factor larger than ''K'', while the NOE can increase the signal by a factor of at most 1+''K''/2{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.  Note that a negative value of ''K'' may result in a ''reduction'' in signal intensity; historically INEPT was proposed a method to enhance the signal from the limited number of nuclei with negative magnetogyric ratio e.g. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N or &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si.

'''Ion-attachment mass spectrometry''' ('''IAMS''') is a form of [[mass spectrometry]] that uses a &quot;soft&quot; form of ionization similar to [[chemical ionization]] in which a cation is attached to the analyte molecule in a reactive collision:
:&lt;math&gt;M + X^+ + A \to MX^+ + A&lt;/math&gt; 

Where M is the analyte molecule, X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the cation and A is a non-reacting collision partner.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Lithium ion attachment mass spectrometry: Instrumentation and features|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
This technique is applicable to gases or any materials that can be vaporized. It uses a non-fragmenting non-conventional ionisation mode, by attachment of a lithium (or alkaline) ion to the gas to be analysed with a more traditional mass filter. This instrument is more dedicated to analysis of moderately-sized molecules such as organic or aromatic compounds.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Aromatic ion attachment mass spectrometry: an ion-molecule reaction for organosulfur analysis|journal=Organic Mass Spectrometry|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Currently, it is used industrially to verify, with a high throughput, the concentrations of [[brominated flame retardant]]s (BFR) in plastics in compliance with [[European Union|European]] [[RoHS]] (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulation in place since 2006. The banned molecules include [[PBB]] and [[PBDE]], whose concentration should not exceed 0.1% w/w. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The guide of environmental quality assurance for a supplier of JVC |date=July 2006 | publisher = [[JVC]] | url = http://www.jvc-victor.co.jp/company/environ/wr/gprocure/eqaguide_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittcon 2006; Poster by Y.

'''Ion mobility spectrometry''' ('''IMS''') is an analytical technique used to separate and identify ionized molecules in the gas phase based on their ion mobility in a carrier buffer gas.  Though heavily employed for military or security purposes, such as detecting drugs and explosives, the technique also has many laboratory analytical applications, recently being coupled with [[mass spectrometry]] and [[high performance liquid chromatography]]. IMS devices come in a wide range of sizes (often tailored for a specific application) and are capable of operating under a broad range of conditions.  Systems operated at higher pressure (i.e. atmospheric conditions, 1 atm or 1013 mbar) are also accompanied by elevated temperature (above 100°C), while lower pressure systems (1-20 mbar) do not require heating.  

==History==
IMS was first developed primarily by [[Earl W. McDaniel]] of [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s and 1960s when he used drift cells with low applied electric fields to study gas phase ion mobilities and reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18200615&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanu AB, Dwivedi P, Tam M, Matz L, Hill HH |title=Ion mobility-mass spectrometry |journal=[[J Mass Spectrom]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18200615 |doi=10.1002/jms.1383 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following decades, he coupled his new technique with a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer, with others also utilizing his techniques in new ways.  IMS cells have since been attached to many other mass spectrometers and high-performance liquid chromatography setups.  Currently IMS is a widely-used technique implemented by many, and improvements and other uses are continually being developed.

Outside of laboratory purposes, IMS has found great usage as a detection tool.  More than 10,000 IMS devices are in use worldwide in airports, and the US Army has more than 50,000 IMS devices.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotov, Yu. A. (2006). “Ion Mobility Spectrometry.” ''Journal of Analytical Chemistry'', '''61''' (6): 519.&lt;/ref&gt;  In industrial settings, uses of IMS include checking equipment cleanliness and detecting emission contents, such as determining the amount of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid in a stack gas from a process.&lt;ref&gt;Particle Measuring Systems, Inc. “Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) Theory and Applications”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ion Mobility==
{{main|Electrical mobility}}

In the traditional method of drift-time IMS, commonly referred to as just IMS, produced ions travel through a drift tube which has an applied electric field and a carrier buffer gas that opposes the ion motion.  At the end of the tube is a detector.  Based on an ion’s mass, charge, size and shape (the ion mobility), the migration time through the tube is characteristic of different ions, leading to the ability to distinguish different analyte species.  The area of an ion that gas molecules strike is an ion’s collision cross-section, related to the ion size and shape.  The greater this collision cross-section is, meaning the larger the ion size, the more area available for buffer gas to collide and impede the ion’s drift – the ion then requires a longer time to migrate through the drift tube.

The [[physical quantity]] ''' ion mobility''' ''K'' is defined as the proportionality factor of an ion's drift velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' in a gas and an electric field of strength ''E'',

::: &lt;math&gt;v_d=KE&lt;/math&gt;
 
Ion mobilities are commonly reported as a ''reduced mobilities'', correcting to standard gas density ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', which can be expressed in standard temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 273 K and standard pressure ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1013 mbar:

::: &lt;math&gt;K_0 = K \frac{n}{n_0} = K \ \frac{T_0}{T} \ \frac{p}{p_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The ion mobility ''K'' can be experimentally determined by measuring the the drift time ''t&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an ion traversing within a homogeneous electric field the potential difference ''U'' in the drift length ''L'': 

::: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{L^2}{t_D U}&lt;/math&gt;

The ion mobility ''K'' can also be calculated by the Mason equation:

::: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{3}{16} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\mu kT}} \frac{Q}{n\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is the ion [[charge (physics)|charge]], ''n'' is the drift gas [[number density]], ''μ'' is the [[reduced mass]] of the ion and the drift gas molecules, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the drift gas [[temperature]], and ''σ'' is the ion’s [[cross section (physics)|collision cross section]] with the drift gas.  This relation holds approximately  at a low electric field limit, where the ratio of E/n is small, at ≤ 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-17&lt;/sup&gt; C•cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

A drift tube’s resolving power ''R'' can be calculated as

::: &lt;math&gt;R= \frac{t}{\Delta t}= \sqrt{\frac{LEQ}{16kT\ln2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the tube length, E is the electric field strength, Q is the ion charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the drift gas temperature.

With a low electric field applied, the thermal energy of the ions is greater than the energy gained from the electric field between collisions.  With these ions having similar energies as the buffer gas molecules, diffusion forces dominate ion motion.

== Instrumentation ==
=== Ionization ===
The molecules of the sample need to be [[ionization|ionized]], usually by [[corona discharge]], atmospheric pressure [[photoionization]] (APPI), [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), or a [[radioactive]] source, e.g. a small piece of &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;[[Nickel|Ni]] or &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;[[Americium|Am]], similar to the one used in ionization [[smoke detector]]s. ESI and MALDI techniques are commonly used when IMS is paired with mass spec.  

Doping materials are sometimes added to the drift gas for ionization selectivity.  For example, acetone can be added for chemical warfare agent detection, chlorinated solvents added for explosives, and nicotinamide added for drugs detection.&lt;ref&gt;Creaser, Colin; Thomas, Paul; et al. (2004). “Ion mobility spectrometry: a review. Part 1. Structural analysis by mobility measurement.” ''The Analyst'', '''129''': 984-994. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Analyzer ===
==== TOFIMS====
In its simplest form an IMS system measures how fast a given ion moves in a uniform [[electric field]] through a given atmosphere. 
[[image:Ion mobility spectrometry diagram.svg|thumb|500px|An ion mobility spectrometer separates ions by shape and charge.]]
In specified intervals, a sample of the ions is let into the drift chamber; the gating mechanism is based on a charged electrode working in a similar way as the [[control grid]] in [[triode]]s works for electrons. For precise control of the ion pulse width admitted to the drift tube, more complex gating systems such as a [[Bradbury-Nielsen shutter|Bradbury-Nielsen]] design are employed.  Once in the drift tube, ions are subjected to a homogeneous electric field ranging from a few volts per centimeter up to many hundreds of volts per centimeter.  This electric field then drives the ions through the drift tube where they interact with the neutral drift molecules contained within the system.

In the drift tube, chemical species separate based on the [[ion mobility]], arriving at the detector for measurement.  Ions are recorded at the detector in order from the fastest to the slowest, generating a response signal characteristic for the chemical composition of the measured sample. 

For drift-time IMS, two main methods are used – either reduced pressure or ambient pressure.  A reduced pressure is where the applied pressure gas is at a few torr, commonly used to measure ion collision cross-sections.  Ambient pressure is what is used for stand-alone detector devices, as well as detection for gas, liquid, and supercriticial fluid chromatographies.  The higher pressures of ambient pressure methods allow for higher resolving power and greater separation selectivity due to a higher rate of ion-molecule interactions.  Reduced pressure IMS allows for ion-focusing and an easier interface with mass spec.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18200615&quot; /&gt;
Though drift electric fields are normally uniform, non-uniform drift fields are also used.  These non-uniform field IMS results are often calibrated to uniform field instrumentation.  Non-uniform field usage is still in a relatively early developing stage.&lt;ref&gt;Clemmer, David E. et al. (2008).  “Biomolecule Analysis by Ion Mobility Spectrometry.” ''Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry'', '''1''': 293-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DMS ====
DMS ([[differential mobility spectrometer]]) make use of the dependence of ion mobility ''K'' on electric field strength ''E'' at high electric fields. Ions are subjected to different field strengths for different amounts of time. Thereby only ions with certain mobility dependence survive. These types of IMS work as a scanable filter. They are also called [[High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry|FAIMS]]

==== DMA ====
DMA [[differential mobility analyzer]] make use of a fast gas stream perpendicular to the electric field. Thereby ions of different mobilities undergo different trajectories. This type of IMS corresponds to the [[sector instruments]] in [[mass spectrometry]]. They also work as a scanable filter.

=== Drift Gas ===
The drift gas pressure is an important parameter for the IMS instrument design and resolution. Most drift gases have a greater potential to break down at pressures higher than a few mbar, with the potential to break down increasing as the pressure increases.  As an example, high drift voltages of about 10-30 kV can be used with tubes of 1 m length and high gas pressures of 100-1000 mbar to obtain high resolutions.  At higher pressures than 10 mbar, ions become more difficult to store.  At lower pressures, ions can be stored more easily to obtain an accumulated continuous signal, with the trade-off of lower electric fields (around 10-30 V/cm).
Elevated gas temperature assists in removing ion clusters that may distort experimental measurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methods in Modern Biophysics&quot;&gt;Bengt Nolting, ''Methods in Modern Biophysics'', Springer Verlag, 2005, ISBN 3-540-27703-X &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ion Mobility Spectrometry&quot;&gt;Gary Eiceman &amp; Zeev Karpas, ''Ion Mobility Spectrometry'', CRC Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8493-2247-2 &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Detector ===
Often the detector is a simple [[Faraday plate]], however, more advanced ion mobility instruments are [[Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry|coupled]] with [[mass spectrometer]]s where both size and mass information may be obtained simultaneously.

===Ion traps ===
Ion trap mobility spectrometry is an instrumental analytical method for detection and analysis of chemical substances, able to detect very low concentrations of chemicals based upon the differential migration of [[ion]]s through homogeneous [[electric field]]. It is a version of [[ion mobility spectrometry]]. ITMS provides a substantial performance improvement over IMS, as the shutter grid is eliminated together with the associated loss of sensitivity.



== Hyphenated IMS ==
IMS can be combined with other separation techniques.

==Applications==
Perhaps ion mobility spectrometry's greatest strength is the speed at which separations occur—typically on the order of tens of milliseconds.  This feature combined with its ease of use, relatively high sensitivity, and highly compact design have allowed IMS as a commercial product to be used as a routine tool for the field detection of [[explosive]]s, [[illegal drug trade|drugs]], and [[chemical weapons]]. A major manufacturer of IMS screening devices used in airports is [[Smiths Group|Smiths Detection]].

In the pharmaceutical industry IMS is used in [[cleaning validation]]s, demonstrating that reaction vessels are sufficiently clean to proceed with the next batch of pharmaceutical product. IMS is much faster and more accurate than HPLC and total organic carbon methods previously used.  IMS is also used for analyzing the composition of drugs produced, thereby finding a place in quality assurance and control.&lt;ref&gt;O’Donnell, Ryan M.; Sun, Xiaobo; de B. Harrington, Peter. (2008). “Pharmaceutical applications of ion mobility spectrometry.” '' Trends in Analytical Chemistry'', '''27''' (1): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt;   As a research tool ion mobility is becoming more widely-used in the analysis of biological materials, specifically, [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].  For example, IMS-MS using MALDI as the ionization method has helped make advances in proteomics, providing faster high-resolution separations of protein pieces in analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, J.A. . et al.

'''Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry''' ('''IMS-MS''') is a method that combines [[ion mobility spectrometry]] and [[mass spectrometry]] to identify different substances within a test sample.

==History==
On the one hand, [[ion mobility spectrometry]] was developed in the 60s and typically separates charged particles on a millisecond scale. On the other hand, [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry]] was developed in the 50s and typically separates charged particles on a microsecond scale.
The combination of both instruments was pioneered in 1963 at the [[Bell Labs]] 

*	In 1963 McAfee and Edelson published an IMS-TOF combination. From their Letter to the Editor &lt;ref&gt;K.B. McAfee and D. Edelson ''J. Chem. Phys.'' '''1963''', 382.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not conclusive whether they used an orthogonal extraction TOF. Most likely it was, because they seem to have used the TOF of the company Bendix, which was an orthogonal TOF.  
*	In 1967 McKnight, McAfee and Sipler published an IMS-TOF combination. Their instrument clearly included an orthogonal TOF.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. McKnight, K.B. McAfee and D.P. Sipler  ''Phys. Rev.'' '''1967''', ''164''(1), 62&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*	In 1969 Cohen et al. filed a patent &lt;ref&gt;Patent US 3621240&lt;/ref&gt; on an IMS-QMS system. The QMS at that time was an improvement compared to the TOFMS, because the TOFMS lacked under the slowlyness of the electronic data acquisition systems at that time. 
*	In 1970, Young, Edelson and Falconer published an IMS-TOF with orthogonal extraction &lt;ref&gt;C.E. Young, D. Edelson, W.E. Falconer ''J. Chem. Phys.'' '''1970''', ''53''(11), 4295.&lt;/ref&gt;. They seem to have used the same system as McKnight et al. in 1967, incorporating slight modifications. Their work was later reproduced in the landmark book of Mason/McDaniel &lt;ref&gt;E.A. Mason, E.W. McDaniel; Transport Properties of Ions in Gases; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1988; p 560&lt;/ref&gt;, which is regarded as the “bible of IMS” by those skilled in the art. 
*	In 1996 Guevremont et al. presented a poster at the ASMS conference &lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of 44th ASMS conference, p.1090&lt;/ref&gt; about IMS-TOF. 
*	In 1997 Tanner patented a quadrupole with axial fields which can be used as a drift cell for IMS separation. He also mentions the combination of these quadrupoles with an orthogonal TOFMS &lt;ref&gt;Patent WO9707530 (A1)&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*	In 1998 Clemmer reinvented the IMS-TOF combination, using a co-axial IMS-TOF setup &lt;ref&gt;Henderson S C, Valentine S J, Counterman A E, Clemmer D E, ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1999''', ''71'', (2), 291-301&lt;/ref&gt;.
*	In 1999 Clemmer reinvented the IMS-TOF with an orthogonal TOF system &lt;ref&gt;Hoaglund C S, Valentine S J, Sporleder C R, Reilly J P, Clemmer D E, ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1998''', ''70'', (11), 2236-2242.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Instrumentation==
{{Main|ion mobility spectrometer|mass spectrometer}}
The IMS-MS is a combination of an [[ion mobility spectrometer]] and a [[mass spectrometer]]. 
First the ion mobility spectrometer separates ions according to their mobilities. In a second step the mass spectrometer separates ions according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. Such a combination is often referred to as a ''[[hyphenated separation]]'' or ''[[multi-dimensional separation]]''. 

There are different types of ion mobility spectrometers and there are different types of mass spectrometers. In principle it is possible to combine every type of the former with any type of the later.

=== Types of IMS ===
* TOFIMS (time-of-flight IMS) or the traditional [[ion mobility spectrometry|ion mobility spectrometer]]
* DMS [[differential mobility spectrometer]]: a scanable filter, also called [[High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry|FAIMS]]
* DMA [[differential mobility analyzer]]: a scanable filter

===Types of MS ===
* TOFMS ([[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]])
* QMS ([[quadrupole mass spectrometer]])
* ITMS ([[ion trap mass spectrometer]])
* FTMS ([[Fourier transform mass spectrometry|Fourier transform mass spectrometer]])
* SFMS ([[sector instruments|sector mass spectrometer]])

==Applications==
The IMS-MS technique can be used for analyzing complex mixtures. It is used in: 
* proteomics for the analysis of peptides
* detection of chemical warfare agents
* detection of explosives
* analysis of nano particles

[[File:Ionization energies.png|right|thumb|400px|Ionization energies of neutral elements.]]
'''Ionization''' is the [[physics|physical]] process of converting an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] into an [[ion]] by adding or removing charged particles such as [[electron]]s or other ions. This is often confused with [[dissociation (chemistry)]].

The process works slightly differently depending on whether an ion with a positive or a negative [[electric charge]] is being produced. A positively-charged ion is produced when an electron bonded to an atom (or molecule) absorbs enough energy to escape from the [[electric potential]] barrier that originally confined it, thus breaking the bond and freeing it to move. The amount of energy required is called the [[ionization potential]]. A negatively-charged ion is produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently caught inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. 

In general, ionization can be broken down into two types: '''sequential ionization''' and '''non-sequential ionization'''. In classical physics, only sequential ionization can take place; refer to the [[#Classical ionization|Classical ionization]] section for more information. Non-sequential ionization violates several laws of classical physics; refer to the [[#Quantum ionization|Quantum ionization]] section.

==Classical ionization==

Applying only [[classical physics]] and the [[Bohr model]] of the atom makes both atomic and molecular ionization entirely [[Scientific determinism|deterministic]]; that is, every problem will always have a definite and computable answer. According to classical physics, it is absolutely necessary that the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. In concept, this idea should make sense: The same way a person cannot jump over a one-meter wall without jumping at least one meter off the ground, an electron cannot get over a 13.6-[[Electronvolt|eV]] potential barrier without at least 13.6 eV of energy.

===Applying to positive ionization===

According to these two principles, the energy required to release an electron is ''strictly'' greater than or equal to the potential difference between the current bound atomic or molecular [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] and the highest possible orbital. If the energy absorbed exceeds this potential, then the electron is emitted as a free electron. Otherwise, the electron briefly enters an [[excited state]] until the energy absorbed is [[Radiation|radiated]] out and the electron re-enters the lowest available state.

===Applying to negative ionization===

Due to the shape of the potential barrier, according to these principles, a free electron must have an energy greater than or equal to that of the potential barrier in order to make it over. If a free electron has enough energy to do so, it will be bound to the lowest available energy state, and the remaining energy will be radiated away. If the electron does not have enough energy to surpass the potential barrier, then it is forced away by the electrostatic force, described by [[Coulombs Law]], associated with the electric potential barrier.

===Sequential ionization===

Sequential ionization is a description of how the ionization of an atom or molecule takes place. For example, an ion with a +2 charge can be created only from an ion with a +1 charge or a +3 charge. That is, the numerical charge of an atom or molecule must change sequentially, always moving from one number to an adjacent, or ''sequential'', number.

==Quantum ionization==

In [[quantum mechanics]], ionization can still happen classically, whereby the electron has enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but there is the additional possibility of [[tunnel ionization]].

===Tunnel ionization===

[[Tunnel ionization]] is ionization due to [[quantum tunneling]]. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and, thus, a greater chance to do so.

===Non-sequential ionization===

When the fact that the electric field of light is an alternating electric field is combined with tunnel ionization, the phenomenon of non-sequential ionization emerges. An electron that tunnels out from an atom or molecule may be sent right back in by the alternating field, at which point it can either recombine with the atom or molecule and release any excess energy or have the chance to further ionize the atom or molecule through high-energy collisions. This additional ionization is referred to as non-sequential ionization for two reasons: One, there is no order to how the second electron is removed, and, two, an atom or molecule with a +2 charge can be created straight from an atom or molecule with a neutral charge, so the integer charges are not ''sequential''.  Non-sequential ionization is often studied at lower laser-field intensities, since most ionization events are sequential when the ionization rate is high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ISOLTRAP''' is a tandem Penning trap mass spectrometer at the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator at CERN, very similar to SMILETRAP. The facility plays a leading role in the field of high precision mass spectrometry of radioactive ions. The masses of more than 200 short-lived nuclides have been measured with a relative uncertainty of typically dm/m ~ 1x10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; and even almost up to one order of magnitude lower in some special cases. 

Recently, the performance of the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP has been considerably enhanced. Major technical improvements were implemented to increase the range of accessible nuclei to those that are produced in minute quantities of only 100 ions/s and to nuclei with half-lives down to ~50 ms as well as to decrease the typical relative uncertainty down to ~1x10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, a linear radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) trap and a carbon-cluster source were added to the ISOLTRAP spectrometer. Since the unified atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C the calibration of the magnetic field with carbon clusters allows absolute mass measurements. 

Accurate mass measurements of short-lived nuclides are of high interest for a number of reasons: They allow direct observation of nuclear structure effects like the location of shell and sub-shell closures, pairing, or the onset of deformation. In combination with a precise study of super-allowed beta emission they provide tests of the Standard Model. Additionally, masses of unstable nuclei are the most critical nuclear physics parameters for reliable nucleosynthesis calculations in astrophysics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The isomeric shift (also called isomer shift) is the shift on atomic spectral lines and gamma spectral lines, which occurs as a consequence of replacement of one nuclear isomer by another. It is usually called '''isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines''' and '''Mössbauer isomeric shift''' respectively. If the spectra have also hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. The isomeric shift provides important information about the nuclear structure and the physical, chemical or biological environment of atoms.

==The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines==
The '''isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines''' is the energy or frequency shift in atomic spectra, which occurs when one replaces one nuclear isomer by another. The effect was predicted by Richard M. Weiner&lt;ref name=Weiner1956&gt;R. M. Weiner, Nuovo Cimento 4 (1956) 1587.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1956 whose calculations showed that it should be measurable by atomic (optical) spectroscopy (cf. also&lt;ref name=Weiner1959&gt;R. M. Weiner, Phys. Rev. 114, (1959) 256; Zhur. Eksptl. I Teoret. Fiz. 35 (1958) 284, translation: Soviet Phys. JETP. 35(8) (1959) 196.&lt;/ref&gt;). It was observed experimentally&lt;ref name=Meliss1959&gt;A. Melissinos and S. Davis, Phys. Rev. 115 (1959) 130.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time in 1958. The theory of the atomic isomeric shift developed in &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; is also used in the interpretation of the Mössbauer isomeric shift.

==Terminology==
The notion of isomer appears also in other fields such as chemistry and meteorology. Therefore in the first papers devoted to this effect &lt;ref name=Weiner1956 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d0442487x86h7212/]/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; the name ''nuclear isomeric shift on spectral lines'' was used. Before the discovery of the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift referred exclusively to atomic spectra; this explains the absence of the word ''atomic'' in the initial &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; definition of the effect. Subsequently the isomeric shift was also observed in gamma spectroscopy through the Mössbauer effect and was called '''Mössbauer isomeric shift'''. For further details on the history of the isomeric shift and the terminology used cf. Refs.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Weiner, Analogies in Physics and Life, World Scientific 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;S. L. Ruby, in Mössbauer Isomer Shifts, editors G. K. Shenoy and F. E. Wagner, North Holland Publishing Company, 1978, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopic versus isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines==
Atomic spectral lines are due to transitions of electrons between different atomic energy levels E, followed by emission of photons. Atomic levels are a manifestation of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and nuclei. The energy levels of two atoms the nuclei of which are different isotopes of the same element are shifted one with respect to the other, despite the fact that the electric charges Z of the two isotopes are identical. This is so because isotopes differ by the number of neutrons and therefore the masses and volumes of two isotopes are different; these differences give rise to the isotopic shift on atomic spectral lines.

In the case of two nuclear isomers the number of protons and the number of neutrons are identical, but the quantum states and in particular the energy levels of the two nuclear isomers differ. This difference induces a difference in the electric charge distributions of two isomers and thus a difference δφ in the corresponding electrostatic nuclear potentials φ, which ultimately leads to a difference ΔE in the atomic energy levels. The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines is then given by

ΔE = -e∫ δφ │ψ │&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dτ

where ψ is the wave function of the electron involved in the transition, e its electric charge and the integration is performed over the electron coordinates.
The isotopic and the isomeric shift are similar in the sense that both are effects in which the finite size of the nucleus manifests itself and both are due to a difference in the electromagnetic interaction energy between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. The isotopic shift had been known decades before the isomeric shift and it provided useful but limited information about atomic nuclei. Unlike the isomeric shift, the isotopic shift was at first discovered in experiment and then interpreted theoretically (cf. also &lt;ref&gt;Fizicheskii Encyclopeditskii Slovar, Sovietskaia Encyclopaedia, Moscow 1962 (Physics Encyclopaedical Dictionary) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;). While in the case of the isotopic shift the determination of the interaction energy between electrons and nuclei is a relatively simple electromagnetic problem, for isomers the problem is more involved, since it is the strong interaction, which accounts for the isomeric excitation of the nucleus and thus for the difference of charge distributions of the two isomeric states. This circumstance explains in part why the nuclear isomeric shift was not discovered earlier: the appropriate nuclear theory and in particular the [[nuclear shell model]] were developed only in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As to the experimental observation of this shift, it also had to await the development of a new technique, that permitted spectroscopy with isomers, which are metastable nuclei. This too happened only in the 1950s.
While the isomeric shift is sensitive to the internal structure of the nucleus, the isotopic shift is (in a good approximation) not. Therefore the nuclear physics information, which can be obtained from the investigation of the isomeric shift, is superior to that which can be obtained from isotopic shift studies. The measurements through the isomeric shift of e.g. the difference of nuclear radii of the excited and ground state constitute one of the most sensitive tests of nuclear models. Moreover, combined with the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift constitutes at present a unique tool in many other fields, besides physics.

==The isomeric shift and the nuclear shell model==
According to the nuclear shell model there exists a class of isomers for which, in a first approximation, it is sufficient to consider one single nucleon, called the “optical” nucleon, to get an estimate of the difference between the charge distributions of the two isomer states, the rest of the nucleons being ''filtered out''. This applies in particular for isomers in odd proton-even neutron nuclei, near closed shells. In115, for which the effect was calculated in &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;, is such an example. The result of the calculation was that the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, although rather small, turned out to be two orders of magnitude bigger than a typical natural line width, which constitutes the limit of optical measurability.

The shift measured three years later&lt;ref name=Meliss1959&gt;A. Melissinos and S. Davis, Phys. Rev. 115 (1959) 130.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hg197 was quite close to that calculated for In115, although in Hg197, unlike in In115, the optical nucleon is a neutron and not a proton and the electron-free neutron interaction is much smaller than the electron-free proton interaction. This is a consequence of the fact that the optical nucleons are not free but bound particles&lt;ref name=Weiner1956&gt;R. M. Weiner, Nuovo Cimento 4 (1956) 1587.&lt;/ref&gt; . Thus the results of &lt;ref name=Meliss1959/&gt; could be explained&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Shirley, Nuclear Applications of Isomeric Shifts, Proc. Int. Conf. on the Mössbauer Effect, Saclay 1961, editors D. H. Compton and A.H. Schoen, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; within the theory of &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt; by associating with the odd optical neutron an effective electric charge of Z/A.

==The Mössbauer isomeric shift==
The '''Mössbauer isomeric shift''' is the shift seen in gamma ray spectroscopy when one compares two different nuclear isomeric states in two different physical, chemical or biological environments, and is due to the combined effect of the recoil-free Mössbauer transition between the two nuclear isomeric states and the transition between two atomic states in those two environments.

The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines depends on the electron wave function ψ and on the difference δφ of electrostatic potentials φ of the two isomeric states.

For a given nuclear isomer in two different physical or chemical environments (different physical phases or different chemical combinations) the electron wave functions are also different. Therefore on top of the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, which is due to the difference of the two nuclear isomer states, there will be a shift between the two environments (because of the experimental arrangement, these are called source (s) and absorber (a)). This combined shift is the Mössbauer isomeric shift and it is described mathematically by the same formalism as the nuclear isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, except that instead of one electron wave function, that in the source ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;, one deals with the difference between the electron wave function in the source ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; and the electron wave function in the absorber ψ&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;:

ΔE&lt;sub&gt;Mössbauer&lt;/sub&gt;  = ΔE&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; – ΔE&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;  = -e∫ δφ [│ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; │&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - │ψ&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;│&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ]dτ

The first measurement of the isomeric shift in gamma spectroscopy with the help of the Mössbauer effect was reported&lt;ref&gt;O. C. Kistner and A. W. Sunyar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 4 (1960) 412.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980, two years after its first experimental observation in atomic spectroscopy&lt;ref name=Meliss1959/&gt;. By measuring this shift one obtains important and extremely precise information, both about the nuclear isomer states and about the physical, chemical or biological environment of the atoms, represented by the electronic wave functions.

Under its Mössbauer variant, the isomeric shift has found important applications in domains as different as Atomic Physics, Solid State Physics, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Metallurgy, Mineralogy, Geology, and Lunar research. For further literature cf. also Ref.&lt;ref&gt;Mössbauer Isomer Shifts, editors G. K. Shenoy and F. E. Wagner, North Holland Publishing Company, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear isomeric shift has also been observed in muonic atoms&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. J. Hüfner et al. in Muon Physics, edited by V. W. Hughes and C. S. Wu, Academic Press 1977, Vol. 1, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;, that is atoms in which a muon is captured by the excited nucleus and makes a transition from an atomic excited state to the atomic ground state in a time which is short compared to the lifetime of the excited isomeric nuclear state.

'''Isotope ratio mass spectrometry''' '''(IRMS)''' is a specialization of [[mass spectrometry]], in which mass spectrometric methods are used to measure the relative abundance of [[isotope]]s in a given sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17705258&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul D, Skrzypek G, Fórizs I |title=Normalization of measured stable isotopic compositions to isotope reference scales - a review |journal=Rapid Commun.

== Introduction ==
The isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) allows the precise measurement of mixtures of stable isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Townsend, A. (ed)| year=1995 | title=Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science ''Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science'' | publisher=Academic Press Limited |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has two different applications in the earth and environmental sciences. The analysis of '[[stable isotopes]]' is normally concerned with measuring isotopic variations arising from mass-dependent [[isotopic fractionation]] in natural systems. On the other hand, [[radiogenic]] isotope analysis involves measuring the abundances of decay-products of natural radioactivity, and is used in most long-lived [[radiometric dating]] methods.

Most instruments used for precise determination of isotope ratios are of the magnetic [[sector instrument|sector]] type. This type of analyzer is superior to the quadrupole type in this field of research for two reasons. Firstly, it can easily be set up for multiple-collector analysis, and secondly, it gives high-quality 'peak shapes'. Both of these considerations are important for isotope ratio analysis at very high precision and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dickin, A.P. | year=2005 | title=Radiogenic Isotope Geology | url=http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/ | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sector-type instrument designed by [[Alfred Nier]] was such an advance in [[mass spectrometer]] design that this type of instrument is often called the 'Nier type'. In the most general terms the instrument operates by ionizing the sample of interest, accelerating it over a potential in the kilo-volt range, and separating the resulting stream of ions according to their mass to charge ratio (m/z). The current of each ion beam is then measured using a 'Faraday' detector or multiplier detector.

Many radiogenic isotope measurements are made by ionization of a solid source, whereas stable isotope measurements of light elements (e.g. H, C, O) are usually made in an instrument with a gas source. In the latter case, dual gas inlets enable reliable repetition of measurements by supplying continuous streams of the reference and sample gases, which are sequentially switched by a changeover valve.  The IRMS's collector also features an array of Faraday cups (conductive, metal vessels which neutralise ions that hit them whilst themselves becoming charged), or &quot;multicollector&quot;, which allows the simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. B. Bouthitt and K. Garnett|title= The Evolution of the Multicollector in Isotope Ratio Mass Spectromety|journal=Proceedings of the 18th AMZSMS Conference |pages=THO–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples must be introduced as pure gases, achieved through combustion, gas chromatographic feeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Meier-Augenstein, W. | journal =J. Chromarogr., A | year = 1999 | volume = 842 | pages= 351–371 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(98)01057-7 | title =Applied gas chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry }}&lt;/ref&gt; or chemical trapping. By comparing the detected isotopic ratios to a measured standard, an accurate determination of the isotopic make up of the sample is obtained. For example, carbon isotope ratios are measured relative to the international standard for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  (The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; standard is produced from a fossil [[belemnite]] found in the [[Pee Dee]] formation, which is a limestone formed in the Cretaceous period in [[South Carolina]], U.S.A.; its &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio is 0.0112372.)

== Gas Source ('stable isotope') mass spectrometry ==

Instruments have been developed based on several techniques for mass separation and tuned to a wide range of applications. The article below describes one of these application areas, instruments adapted specifically to measure the relative abundance of masses up to around [[atomic number|mass number]] 66.

This field is of interest because the relative variation in mass between [[isotopes]] in this range is large enough to give rise to variation in chemical, physical and biological behaviour. This leads to measurable effects on the isotopic composition of samples characteristic of their biological or physical history.

As a specific example, the [[hydrogen]] isotope [[deuterium]] (heavy hydrogen) is almost double the mass of the common hydrogen isotope. Water molecules containing the common hydrogen isotope (and the common oxygen isotope, mass 16) have a mass of 18. Water incorporating a deuterium atom has a mass of 19, over 5% heavier. The energy to vaporise the heavy water molecule is higher than that to vaporize the normal water so isotope fractionation occurs during the process of evaporation.

Thus a sample of sea water ([[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], or VSMOW) will exhibit a quite detectable isotopic ratio difference when compared to Arctic snowfall (standard light Arctic precipitation, or SLAP).

[[File:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|right|thumb|300 px|Schematic of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the  [[United States Geological Survey]]]]
It is critical that the sample be processed before entering the mass spectrometer so that only a single chemical species enters at a given time.  Generally, samples are combusted or pyrolyzed and the desired species (usually hydrogen gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide, or sulfur dioxide) is purified by means of traps, filters, catalysts and/or chromatography.

The two most common types of IRMS instruments are continuous flow&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9538528&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brenna JT, Corso TN, Tobias HJ, Caimi RJ |title=High-precision continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=227–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9538528 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1997)16:5&lt;227::AID-MAS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dual inlet. In dual inlet IRMS, purified gas obtained from a sample is alternated rapidly with a standard gas (of known isotopic composition) by means of a system of valves, so that a number of comparison measurements are made of both gases.  In continuous flow IRMS, sample preparation occurs immediately before introduction to the IRMS, and the purified gas produced from the sample is measured just once.  The standard gas may be measured before and after the sample or after a series of sample measurements.  While continuous-flow IRMS instruments can achieve higher sample throughput and are more convenient to use than dual inlet instruments, the yielded data is of approximately 10-fold lower precision.

== Static Gas ('noble gas') mass spectrometry ==

A static gas mass spectrometer is one in which a gaseous sample for analysis is fed into the source of the instrument and then left in the source without further supply or pumping throughout the analysis. This method can be used for 'stable isotope' analysis of light gases (as above), but it is particularly used in the isotopic analysis of [[noble gases]] (= rare or inert gases) for [[radiometric dating]] or [[isotope geochemistry]]. Important examples are [[argon-argon dating]] and helium isotope analysis.

== Solid Source ('radiogenic isotope') mass spectrometry ==

Several of the isotope systems involved in [[radiometric dating]] depend on IRMS using [[thermal ionization]] of a solid sample loaded into the source of the mass spectrometer (hence thermal ionization mass spectrometry, [[TIMS]]). These methods include [[rubidium-strontium dating]], [[uranium-lead dating]], [[lead-lead dating]] and [[samarium-neodymium dating]].

When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.&lt;ref name=Dickin&gt;Dickin, A.P., 2005. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology'' 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization potential, such as [[Strontium]] (Sr), and [[Lead]] (Pb).

The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500 degrees Celsius, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization potential, such as [[Osmium]] (Os), and [[Tungsten]] (Hf-W).  Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization potential can be analyzed more effectively with MC-ICP-MS.

== Multiple collector - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) ==

An MC-ICP-MS instrument is a multiple collector mass spectrometer with a plasma source. MC-ICP-MS was developed to improve the precision achievable by ICP-MS during isotope ratio measurements.  Conventional [[ICP-MS]] analysis uses a quadrupole analyser, which only allows single-collector analysis. Due to the inherent instability of the plasma, this limits the precision of ICP-MS with a quadrupole analyzer to around 1%, which is insufficient for most [[radiogenic]] isotope systems.

Isotope ratio analysis for [[radiometric dating]] has normally been determined by TIMS. However, some systems (e.g. Hf-W and Lu-Hf) are difficult or impossible to analyse by TIMS, due to the high ionization potential of the elements involved. Therefore these methods can now be analysed using MC-ICP-MS.

Magnetic sector mass spectrometry requires a high acceleration potential in order to properly resolve species with different masses.  Since the ion beam is normally positive, a multi-collector ICP-MS  (unlike conventional ICP-MS) needs to have an ion source up to 8000 V positive, in order to keep the analyzer at electrical ground.  This was one of the engineering challenges of developing MC-ICP-MS. Magnetic sector mass spectrometry also requires an ion beam with a relatively small range in ion energy. This is achieved in MC-ICP-MS by using an electrostatic and/or quadrupole pre-filter, which allows the ion energy of the beam to be homogenized before entering the magnetic sector.

== Moving Wire IRMS (MW-irMS) ==
Moving wire IRMS is useful for analyzing [[Carbon-13]] ratios of compounds in a solution, such as after purification by [[liquid chromatography]].  The solution (or outflow from the chromatography) is dried onto a nickel or stainless steel wire.  After the residue is deposited on the wire, it enters a furnace where the sample is converted to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by combustion.  The gas stream finally enters a capillary, is dried, ionized, and analyzed.&lt;ref name='brenna_1996'&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. | year = 1996 | author = Caimi, R. J.; Brenna, J. T. | title = Direct analysis of carbon isotope variability in albumins by liquid flow-injection isotope ratio mass spectrometry | volume = 7 | pages = 605–610 | doi = 10.1016/1044-0305(96)00010-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process allows a mixture of compounds to be purified and analyzed continuously, which can decrease the analysis time by a factor of four.&lt;ref name='brenna_1996'/&gt; Moving wire IRMS is quite sensitive, and samples containing as little as 1 nano-[[Mole (unit)|mole]] of Carbon can yield precise (within 1‰) results.&lt;ref name=Sessions2005&gt;{{cite journal

== Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) ==
For isotopes occurring at extremely low levels, [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) can be used.  For example, the decay rate of the radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is widely used to date organic materials, but this approach is limited to relatively large samples no more than a few thousand years old.  AMS extended the range of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C dating to about 60,000 years BP, and is about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times more sensitive than conventional IRMS.

== Applications ==

The variation outlined above has applications in [[hydrology]] since most samples will lie between these two extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17091470&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Han LF, Gröning M, Aggarwal P, Helliker BR |title=Reliable determination of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in atmospheric water vapour adsorbed on 3A molecular sieve |journal=Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. |volume=20 |issue=23 |pages=3612–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17091470 |doi=10.1002/rcm.2772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a sample of water from an [[aquifer]], and a sufficiently sensitive tool to measure the variation in the isotopic ratio of hydrogen in the sample, it is possible to infer the source, be it ocean water seeping into the aquifer or precipitation seeping into the aquifer, and even to estimate the proportions from each source.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17540896&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weldeab S, Lea DW, Schneider RR, Andersen N |title=155,000 years of West African monsoon and ocean thermal evolution |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5829 |pages=1303–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17540896 |doi=10.1126/science.1140461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application is in paleotemperature measurement for [[Paleoclimatology]]. For example one technique is based on the variation in isotopic fractionation of oxygen by biological systems with temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10568296&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tolosa I, Lopez JF, Bentaleb I, Fontugne M, Grimalt JO |title=Carbon isotope ratio monitoring-gas chromatography mass spectrometric measurements in the marine environment: biomarker sources and paleoclimate applications |journal=Sci.

Species of [[foraminifera]] incorporate oxygen as calcium carbonate in their shells. The ratio of the oxygen isotopes oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 incorporated into the calcium carbonate varies with temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of the water. This oxygen remains &quot;fixed&quot; in the calcium carbonate when the forminifera dies, falls to the sea bed, and its shell becomes part of the sediment. It is possible to select standard species of forminifera from sections through the sediment column, and by mapping the variation in oxygen isotopic ratio, deduce the temperature that the forminifera  encountered during life if changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of the water can be constrained.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12720329&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shen JJ, You CF |title=A 10-fold improvement in the precision of boron isotopic analysis by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry |journal=Anal.

In forensic science, research suggests that the variation in certain isotope ratios in drugs derived from plant sources (cannabis, cocaine) can be used to determine the drug's continent of origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16696708&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Casale J, Casale E, Collins M, Morello D, Cathapermal S, Panicker S |title=Stable isotope analyses of heroin seized from the merchant vessel Pong Su |journal=J.

'''Isotopic labeling''' is a technique for tracking the passage of a sample of substance through a system.  The substance is 'labeled' by including unusual [[isotope]]s in its chemical composition.  If these unusual isotopes are later detected in a certain part of the system, they must have come from the labeled substance. 

In ordinary isotopic labeling, there are two ways to detect the presence of labeling isotopes.  Since isotopes have different [[mass]]es, they can be separated using [[mass spectrometry]].  Another consequence of the difference in mass is that molecules containing isotopes have different [[vibrational mode]]s; these can be detected by [[infrared spectroscopy]].

Isotopic labeling can also be used to study [[chemical reaction]]s. In this method specific atoms are replaced by an isotope in a reactant molecule which then participates in a chemical reaction. With [[spectroscopy]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy for example, it is now possible to identify where a particular molecular fragment in the reactant ends up as a particular fragment in one of the reaction products. 

An example of the use of isotopic labeling is the study of [[phenol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) in water by replacing common [[hydrogen]] ([[hydrogen-1|protium]]) with [[deuterium]] ('''deuterium labeling''').  Upon adding phenol to [[heavy water|deuterated water]] (water containing D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in addition to the usual H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O),  the substitution of deuterium for the hydrogen is observed in phenol's [[hydroxyl group]] (resulting in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OD), indicating that phenol readily undergoes hydrogen-exchange reactions with water. Only the hydroxyl group was affected, indicating that the other 5 hydrogen atoms did not participate in these exchange reactions.

==Radioisotopic labeling==
Radioisotopic labelling is a technique for tracking the passage of a sample of substance through a system.  The substance is &quot;labelled&quot; by including [[radionuclide]]s in its chemical composition.  When these [[radioactive decay|decay]], their presence can be determined by detecting the [[particle radiation|radiation]] emitted by them.  Radioisotopic labelling is a special case of [[isotopic labeling]].

For these purposes, a particularly useful type of radioactive decay is [[positron emission]].  When a positron collides with an electron, it releases two high-energy [[photon]]s traveling in diametrically opposite directions.  If the positron is produced within a solid object, it is likely to do this before travelling more than a millimetre.  If both of these photons can be detected, the location of the decay event can be determined very precisely.

Strictly speaking, radiosotopic labelling includes only cases where radioactivity is artificially introduced by experimenters, but some natural phenomena allow similar analysis to be performed.  In particular, [[radiometric dating]] uses a closely related principle.

==Isotopic tracer==
[[Image:Benzyneconversioncolouredlabels.png|left|300px| For example, the use of a carbon-13 label was used to determine the mechanism in the above proposed 1,2- to 1,3-didehydrobenzene conversion of the [[phenyl]] substituted aryne precursor '''1''' to acenaphthylene, reference: A m-Benzyne to o-Benzyne Conversion Through a 1,2-Shift of a Phenyl Group. Blake, M. E.; Bartlett, K. L.; Jones, M. Jr. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 6485. doi:10.1021/ja0213672 ]]

An ''isotopic tracer'', (also &quot;isotopic marker&quot; or &quot;isotopic label&quot;), is used in [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] to help understand chemical [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] and interactions. In this technique, one or more of the [[atom]]s of the [[molecule]] of interest is substituted for an atom of the same [[chemical element]], but of a different (often [[radioactive]], such as in [[Radioactive tracer|radioactive tracing]]) [[isotope]]. Because the atom has the same number of protons, it will behave in almost exactly the same way chemically as other atoms in the compound, and with few exceptions will not interfere with the reaction under investigation.  The difference in the number of [[neutron]]s, however, means that it can be detected separately from the other atoms of the same element.

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] typically uses this type of technique to investigate the mechanisms of chemical reactions (basically trying to find out which starting atom ends up where after a reaction), because NMR detects not only isotopic differences, but also gives an indication of the position of the atom.

[[Mass spectrometer|Mass spectrometry]] can also be used with this technique, since mass spectra recorded with sufficiently high resolution can distinguish among isotopes based on the different masses resulting from the different number of neutrons.

[[Autoradiograph]]s of gels in [[gel electrophoresis]] can also take advantage of this approach.  In this technique, radioactive isotopes are used.  The radiation emitted by compounds containing the radioactive isotopes darkens a piece of [[photographic film]], recording the position of these compounds relative to one another in the gel.

Isotopic (isotope) tracers are some of the most important tools in [[geology]], because they can be used to understand complex mixing process in earth systems. Isotope tracers are almost always used in the form of isotope ratios. By studying the ratio between two isotopes of the same element, we avoid effects involving the overall abundance of the element, which would usually swamp the much smaller variations in isotopic abundances. Further discussion of the application of isotopic tracers in geology is covered under the heading of [[isotope geochemistry]].

Isotopic tracers are usually subdivided into two categories: [[radiogenic]] isotope tracers and [[stable isotope]] tracers. A radiogenic isotope tracer &lt;ref&gt;Dickin, A. P., 2005. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; involves an isotope produced by [[radioactive decay]], which is usually ratioed against a non-radiogenic isotope (whose abundance in the earth does not vary due to radioactive decay).

A stable isotope tracer involves only non-radiogenic isotopes. In this case, relative variations in abundance between the two isotopes is most often caused by mass-dependent fractionation. In theory, any element with two stable isotopes can be used as an isotopic tracer. However, the most commonly used stable isotope tracers involve relatively light isotopes which readily undergo fractionation in natural systems. See also [[isotopic signature]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''isotopic shift''' (also called isotope shift) is the shift in atomic spectra which occurs when one nuclear isotope is replaced by another. If the spectra have also hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. There are two effects which contribute to this shift:

Hughes, C. Eckart|journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=36|year=1930|page=694|title=The Effect of the Motion of the Nucleus on the Spectra of Li I and Li II|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.36.694}}&lt;/ref&gt; is important for light elements.

*The volume difference. This difference induces a change in the electric charge distribution of the nucleus. This effect is important in heavy elements and its first theory was formulated by Pauli and Peierls.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli, R. E. Peierls, Phys. Z. 32 (1931) 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Brix, H. Kopfermann, Festschrift Göttinger Akad. Springer, 17 (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Kopfermann, Nuclear Moments, Academic Press 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

The method is based on the covalent labeling of the N-terminus and sidechain amines of peptides from protein digestions with tags of varying mass.  There are currently two mainly used reagents: 4-plex and 8-plex, which can be used to label all peptides from different samples/treatments.  These samples are then pooled and usually fractionated by nano liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A database search is then performed using the fragmentation data to identify the labeled peptides and hence the corresponding proteins. The fragmentation of the attached tag generates a low molecular mass reporter ion that can be used to relatively quantify the peptides and the proteins from which they originated, using software such as the freely available i-Tracker&lt;ref name=&quot;i-Tracker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shadforth IP, Dunnley PJ, Lilley KS, Bessant C |title=i-Tracker: For quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=6 |pages=145 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-6-145 |pmid=16242023 |pmc=1276793}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''J-coupling''' (also called ''indirect dipole dipole coupling'') is the coupling between two nuclear [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s due to the influence of bonding [[electron]]s on the [[magnetic field]] running between the two nuclei. J-coupling contains information about [[dihedral angle]]s, which can be estimated using the [[Karplus equation]].  It is an important observable effect in 1D [[NMR spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]].

==Discovery==
In October [[1951]], [[Erwin Hahn|E. L. Hahn]] and D. E. Maxwell reported a ''spin echo experiment'' which indicates the existence of an interaction between two protons in dichloroacetaldehyde. In the echo experiment, two short, intense pulses of [[radiofrequency]] [[magnetic field]] are applied to spin ensemble at the nuclear resonance condition and are separated by time interval of τ. The echo appears with a given maximum amplitude at time 2τ. For each setting of τ, the maximum of the echo signal is measured and plotted as a function of τ. If the spin ensemble consists of [[magnetic moment]], a monotonic decay in the echo envelope is obtained. In the Hahn-Maxwell experiment, the decay was modulated by two frequencies: one frequency corresponded with the difference in [[chemical shift]] between the two non equivalent spins and a second frequency, J, that was smaller and independent of magnetic field strength. (J/2π = 0.7 cycle per second)

Such interaction came as a great surprise. The direct interaction between two magnetic dipole is dependent on the relative position of two nuclei in such a way that when averaged on all various orientation of the molecule it equals to zero. 

In November 1951, [[Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|N. F. Ramsey]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell|E. M. Purcell]] proposed a mechanism that explained the observation and gave rise to an interaction of the form I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The mechanism is the magnetic interaction between each nucleus and the electron spin of its own atom together with the exchange coupling of the electron spins with each other.

In 1990s, direct evidence has been found for the presence of J-couplings between magnetically active nuclei on both sides of the [[hydrogen bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P. Blake, B. Lee, M. Summers, M. Adams, J.-B. Park, Z. Zhou and A. Bax | title = Quantitative measurement of small through-hydrogen-bond and 'through-space' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;199&lt;/sup&gt;Hg J couplings in metal-substituted rubredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus | year = 1992 | journal = [[Journal of Biomolecular NMR]] | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 527–533 | doi = 10.1007/BF02192814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.

Soc.]] | volume = 114 | issue = 12 | pages = 4931–4933 | doi = 10.1021/ja00038a084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was surprising to observe such couplings across hydrogen bonds since J-couplings are usually associated with the presence of purely [[covalent bond]]s. However, it is now well established that the H-bond J-couplings follow the same electron-mediated polarization mechanism as their covalent counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An introduction to hydrogen bond scalar couplings |author = Andrew J. Dingley, Florence Cordier and Stephan Grzesiek | journal = [[Concepts in Magnetic Resonance]] | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–127 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1002/1099-0534(2001)13:2&lt;103::AID-CMR1001&gt;3.0.CO;2-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==J-coupling Hamiltonian==
The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a molecular system may be taken as:

''H = '''D'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; +'''D'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +'''D'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.''

D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = electron orbital-orbital, spin-orbital, spin-spin and electron spin-external field interactions

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = magnetic interactions between nuclear spin and electron spin 

D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = direct interaction of nuclei with each other

for a [[singlet]] molecular state and frequent molecular collisions, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are almost zero. The full form of J-coupling interaction between spins I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; on the same molecule is:

''H = 2π '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;. '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''

where '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt; is the j-coupling tensor, a 3x3 real matrix. It depends on molecular orientation. In isotropic liquid it reduces to a number, so called '''scalar coupling'''. In 1D NMR, scalar coupling leads to oscillations in FID as well as splitting of lines in the spectrum.

==Measurement of J-coupling==
The ''Quantitative J correlation'' developed by [[Ad Bax]] et al. in 1994 is commonly the method of choice for accurate measurements of J couplings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E. de Alba and N.

The '''Karplus equation''', named after [[Martin Karplus]], describes the correlation between &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[J-coupling]] constants and [[dihedral angle|dihedral torsion angles]] in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalton2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] | volume = 81 | issue = 51 |page=37 | date =2003-12-22 | first=Louisa |last=Dalton | title = Karplus Equation | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/8151/8151karplus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J(\phi) = A \cos^2 \phi + B \cos\,\phi + C&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''J'' coupling constant, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the dihedral angle, and ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are empirically-derived parameters whose values depend on the atoms and substituents involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karplus1959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karplus |first=Martin | title = Contact Electron-Spin Coupling of Nuclear Magnetic Moments | year = 1959 | journal = [[J. Chem. Phys.]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–15 | doi = 10.1063/1.1729860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship may be expressed in a variety of equivalent ways e.g. involving cos 2 &amp;phi;  rather than cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;phi; —these lead to different numerical values of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' but do not change the nature of the relationship.

The relationship is used for &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''J''&lt;sub&gt;H,H&lt;/sub&gt; coupling constants.  The superscript &quot;3&quot; indicates that a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H atom is coupled to another &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H atom three bonds away, via H-C-C-H bonds.  (Such hydrogens bonded to neighbouring carbon atoms are termed [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Karplus1963&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karplus |first=Martin |title = Vicinal Proton Coupling in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance | year = 1963 | journal = [[J.

This relationship between local geometry and coupling constant is of great value throughout [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy and is particularly valuable for determining back bone torsion angles in [[protein NMR]] studies.

'''Kautsky effect''' (also named ''fluorescence transient'', ''fluorescence induction'' or ''fluorescence decay'') is a phenomenon consisting on a typical variation on the behavior of a plant fluorescence when is exposed to light. It was discovered in 1931 by H. Kautsky and A. Hirsch.

When dark-adapted photosynthesising cells are illuminated with continuous light, [[chlorophyll fluorescence]] displays characteristic changes in intensity accompanying the induction of photosynthetic activity.

==Explanation==
[[image:kautsky effect.PNG|right|The Kautsky effect]]
When the plant is illuminated the fluorescence intensity increases with a time constant in the microsecond or millisecond range. After a few seconds the intensity falls again and finally reaches a steady-state level. The initial rise of the fluorescence intensity (A) is attributed to the progressive saturation of the [[reaction center]]s in the photosynthesis. Therefore the [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching of the fluorescence]] by the photosynthesis decreases with the time of illumination, with a corresponding increase of the fluorescence intensity. The quenching by the photosynthesis pathway is called [[photochemical quenching]]. The slow decrease of the fluorescence intensity at later times (B) is termed [[non-photochemical quenching]]. Non-photochemical quenching is most likely due to a protection mechanism the plant has to avoid the adverse effect of an excess of light. Several processes cause non-photochemical quenching, e.g. [[photoinhibition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}

The '''Kendrick mass''' is a mass obtained by scaling the [[atomic mass unit]] (u), or dalton (Da) to simplify the display of peak patterns in hydrocarbon [[mass spectra]].&lt;ref name='Kendrick 1963'&gt; {{cite journal|title=A mass scale based on CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.0000 for high resolution mass spectrometry of organic compounds|journal=[[Anal. Chem.]]|date=1963|first=Edward|last=Kendrick|coauthors=|volume=35|issue=|pages=2146–2154|id= |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac60206a048|format=|accessdate=2010-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14730994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marshall AG, Rodgers RP |title=Petroleomics: the next grand challenge for chemical analysis |journal=[[Acc.

==Definition==
The Kendrick mass unit is defined as
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/3/1039/2010/amt-3-1039-2010.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:

: m(&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 14 Ke

In words: &quot;the group &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[mass]] of 14 Ke exactly, by definition.&quot;  

: 1 Ke = 14.0156/14.000 Da = 1.00111429 Da = 1.00111429 u

==Kendrick mass defect==
When expressing the masses of hydrocarbon molecules in Kendrick mass, all [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] molecules will have the same mass defect Δ''m'' defined as:&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11605846&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughey CA, Hendrickson CL, Rodgers RP, Marshall AG, Qian K |title=Kendrick mass defect spectrum: a compact visual analysis for ultrahigh-resolution broadband mass spectra |journal=[[Anal. Chem.]] |volume=73 |issue=19 |pages=4676–81 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11605846 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Δ''m'' = ''m'' - round(''m'')  

or more rigorously

: Δ''m'' = ''m'' - ''A''·Ke

where 
* Δ''m'' is the Kendrick mass defect
* ''A'' is the [[mass number]] of the molecule
* m is the [[mass]] of the molecule (or [[isotopologue]]) which is also referred to as [[exact mass]] 
* round(''m'') and ''A''·Ke are the '''integer masses''' of the molecule

==Equivalence relation==
The Kendrick mass scale was introduced to find an [[equivalence relation]] for hydrocarbons.
The same relation could be expressed with [[modular arithmetic]] using the [[modulo operation]] without introducing a new mass scale.      

: A ~ B (mod CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)    

The above statement is read: &quot;A is modulo CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent to B.&quot;

Or, when considering the mass of the molecules A and B:

: ''m''(A) ~ ''m''(B) (mod ''m''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))  

&quot;A has the same modulo CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass as B.&quot;

In a computing code the Kendrick mass defect of a molecule M, ''Δm''(M), would be expressed as the [[remainder]] ''r'':

: ''Δm''(M) = ''r'' = ''m''(M) mod ''m''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 

or, if the [[modulo operation]] nor the [[remainder]] operation are defined 

: ''Δm''(M) = ''m''(M) - ''m''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)·round(''m''(M)/''m''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))

Note that:
* most programming languages implement the [[modulo operation]] with ''trunc'' or ''floor'' instead of ''round''
* this approach with modular arithmetic works independent of the mass units (or mass scale)  
* this approach is more generalized and allows for other building blocks than CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. in [[polymer]] chemistry
* the Kendrick mass defect ''Δm'' is defined different than the [[mass defect]] in nuclear physics

The Kratos MS 50, or EI 50, is a tool for electron ionization (EI).  The EI 50, used for relatively small molecules (as opposed to methods like MALDI), ionizes molecules via electron ionization (normally under 70 electronvolt conditions) and then accelerates them through an electric potential.  The spectroscopy is done by analyzing the different displacements by a magnet.  For equal charge, these displacements depend only on velocity, thus for the EI 50's constant kinetic energy conditions, these displacements are uniquely determined by a particle's mass.

'''Kurt Wüthrich''' (born October 4, 1938) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[chemistry|chemist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Chemistry]] [[Nobel laureate|laureate]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Aarberg]], [[Switzerland]], Wüthrich was educated in [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Berne]] before pursuing his [[Ph.D.]] under the direction of [[Silvio Fallab]] at the [[University of Basel]], awarded in 1964.  He continued post-doctoral work with Fallab for a short time before leaving to work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for two years from 1965 with [[Robert E. Connick]].  That was followed by a stint working with [[Robert G. Shulman]] at the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] from 1967 to 1969.

Wüthrich returned to Switzerland, to [[Zürich]], in 1969, where he began his career there at the [[ETH Zürich]], rising to Professor of Biophysics by 1980. He currently maintains a laboratory both at the [[ETH Zürich]] and at [[The Scripps Research Institute]], in [[La Jolla, California]].

==Career==
During his graduate studies Wüthrich started out working with [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] spectroscopy and the subject of his Ph. D thesis was &quot;the [[catalysis|catalytic]] activity of [[copper]] compounds in autoxidation reactions&quot;. During his time as a [[postdoc]] in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] he began working with the newly developed and related technique of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] to study the hydration of metal complexes. When Wüthrich joined the Bell Labs, he was put in charge of one of the first [[superconducting]] NMR spectrometers, and started studying the structure and dynamics of proteins. He has pursued this line of research ever since.

After returning to Switzerland, Wüthrich collabrated with among others nobel laureate [[Richard R. Ernst]] on developing the first 2 dimensional NMR experiments, and established the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] as a convenient way of measuring distances within proteins. This research later led to the complete assignment and of resonances for among others the [[BPTI|bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor]] and [[glucagon]].

He was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1991 and half of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2002 for &quot;his development of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution&quot;. He taught at [[Duke University]] as Handler Memorial Lecturer in [[2007]].

In Oct 2010 Wuthrich will be participating in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize winning Scientist over a brown bag lunch&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate&lt;/ref&gt;. Wuthrich is also a member on the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subsequence?==
This looks like an implementation of longest common subsequence, not longest common substring.
:It is using dynamic programming, which is used to locate the longest common subsequence.  In fact, it is nearly identical to the Wagner-Fischer algorithm, which is commonly used for the subsequence problem.  However, each cell only increments from the cell to the left.  Therefore, it avoids gaps and ensures only a substring is located.  It would be very easy to alter this to find a longest common subsequence along with either a global or local alignment (and toss in Levenshtein distance while you are at it).

==Javascript problem==
It looks as though the JavaScript here is dysfunctional. See http://granite.sru.edu/~ddailey/maxSubstring.htm for a rework of the code done by David Dwornick  based on the C++ code shown on the same page.

== Can you improve the algorithm by &quot;quitting&quot;? ==

If I've found a match that's longer than the remaining string, I can quit looking, right?

&lt;code&gt;
 def LongestCommonSubstring(S1, S2):
    M = [[0]*(1+len(S2)) for i in range(1+len(S1))]
    longest, x_longest = 0, 0
    for x in range(1,1+len(S1)):
        for y in range(1,1+len(S2)):
            if S1[x-1] == S2[y-1]:
                M[x][y] = M[x-1][y-1] + 1
                if M[x][y]&gt;longest:
                    longest = M[x][y]
                    x_longest  = x
            else:
                M[x][y] = 0
                &lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;if longest&gt;1+len(S1)-x:
                    return S1[x_longest-longest: x_longest]&lt;/span&gt;
    return S1[x_longest-longest: x_longest]
&lt;/code&gt;

Or would this extra check at each failed match hurt more than it helps?

(PS, &quot;xrange()&quot; is just &quot;range()&quot; in Python 3.)

      <comment>/* Distinction between including a header and a library */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Distinction between including a header and a library ==
A library is translated (read: &quot;compiled&quot;) object which is linked into the final object.
A header is a source file, which mostly contains declarations and rarely have any definitions.

The tutorial says that the line #include &lt;iostream&gt; includes a library -- which is not true. It includes a header. Understanding just what the preprocessor does when you #include a header is important. It most certainly does not include a library (nor link the final object with any library). Rather the preprocessor copies the header and replaces the #include directive with the content of the header and continues with the result.

While I don't think this much detail is needed for an introduction, I don't think the current &quot;includes a library&quot; mentality is good for anyone.

:Agreed. I actually came here to make exactly that comment! [[User:Daviddoria|Daviddoria]] ([[User talk:Daviddoria|talk]]) 13:27, 27 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Basic object types */ data is wrong.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objects ==
An '''object''' is an abstract idea or thing with characteristics and behaviors that can be manipulated. Objects also have names that people call them by. People use the name, characteristics, and behaviors of an object to define and to differentiate between different types of objects. An object type must be defined or declared before an object of that type can be created and manipulated. In the same way as builders cannot begin to build a school until after they have had a chance to read and understand the school's blueprint.

=== Basic object types ===
C++ defines 8 basic object types. &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Standard object types ===
C++ defines additional object types in its standard library. Examples include &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;.

=== New objects ===
New objects are declared using the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword followed by a name for the object, a body, and a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;code&gt;). The body consists of a block (&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;) of instructions that define the characteristics and behaviors of the object that can be manipulated. You can also define and manipulate other objects inside the body too.

A silly example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class example
{
    int v;
    int f();
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the class &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt; contain two members -- one member variable, called v, and one member function, called f.

=== Access specifiers ===
All members of an object are either public, protected, or private. This determines where members can be used.

=== Public ===
Public members can be called and used anywhere. Other objects and functions can call and use public members.

=== Protected ===
Protected members can only be called and used by the object and through objects that are in the inheritance tree. A object must inherit from an object in order to call and use its protected members. This may seem like a silly thing to do, but sometimes you need to share members and allow those members to behave differently in inherited objects without letting just anyone affect the behavior.

=== Private ===
Private members can only be called and used by the object itself. Other objects that inherit from the object cannot call or use private members.

=== Defining member functions outside the class definition ===
Defining the function in the example class is just like defining regular functions, except for one thing. In order to define a member function of a class you must prepend the class name and two colons to the name like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int example::f()
{
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The defines the function in the class &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;.

=Scheveningen Variation, English Attack=
With 6. Be3, white begins a standard English attack setup. White will play f3, g4, Qd2 and O-O-O in some order, setting up a kingside pawn storm targeted towards black's king. In response, black will play a6 and b5 and set up a pawn attack on the queenside against white's king.

Note that the standard [[/6...a6|6...a6]] from black transposes into a hybrid Najdorf/Scheveningen, and allows white to begin the Perenyi Attack with 7.g4 if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Describing a Programming Language ==

===Background Information===

Over the years
it has been found that trying to describe
a programming language using some natural language (e.g. English)
is unsatisfactory due to possible omissions,
contradictions, ambiguities, and vagueness.
A significant milestone was the publication of the Algol 60 Report
which used a formal grammar ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus-Naur_form BNF])
to describe the syntax of the language.
The semantics (meaning) was carefully described using English.
A variation of Extended BNF
([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBNF EBNF])
will be used in this book
as described later in this section.

There have been several attempts to formalise the semantics,
including the grammar generator used for defining Algol 68,
and the Vienna Definition Language
which was used at one stage to define the meaning of PL/1.
While theoretically adequate,
these attempts are so complicated
that they have proved to be of little practical use.

In 1956, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky Chomsky] (a linguist)
developed a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy hierarchy of formal grammars] (types 0 to 3)
for use in the study of English and other natural languages.
Type 0 is the most powerful and type 3 the least powerful.
It turns out that type-3 regular grammars are just
what is needed to describe the requirements of lexical analysis,
and that type-2 context-free grammars are just what is needed
to describe the syntax of many programming languages.
But even type 0 grammars are inadequate for describing the English language.

===Analysis Tools===

Programming tools have been developed which
can accept the description of a grammar as input,
and which produce as output the code
for using that grammar for analysis.
Note that there may be several different grammars which can be used
to describe a particular programming language,
and that not all of these grammars are usable by these tools.

Lexical analysis code using regular grammars
can be produced by tools such as lex, flex, and JavaCC.

Syntax analysis code using context-free grammars
can be produced by tools such as yacc, bison, and JavaCC.

Even if you have a suitable grammar,
such tools only automate a relatively small part of the job
of writing a compiler or interpreter.
Simple lexical and syntax analysis code can in fact
be written by hand without undue effort;
we will see some examples in later chapters.
Good hand-written code may be faster than
the code produced by the tools.

===Extended BNF===

Words in ''italics'' (e.g. ''WholeNumber'')
are used to name grammatical concepts.
It is a good idea to select names for these concepts
which are semantically meaningful to a human reader,
to make things easier to read and understand.
The Algol 60 report used diamond brackets '&lt;' and '&gt;'
rather than italics to flag grammatical concepts.

A vertical bar | is used to separate alternatives.

Single quotation marks are used to indicate characters to be used 'as is'.

The compound symbol ::= is used to mean 'is defined as'
and a semicolon ; is used to end a definition.

Square brackets [ ] are used to indicate options and/or repetition.
   [ xxx ]     xxx is optional.
   [ yyy ]*    yyy may be repeated zero or more times.
   [ zzz ]+    zzz may be repeated one or more times.

===Examples for Lexical Analysis===

We will start with some simple examples
which satisfy the rules for regular grammars.

The following defines a single decimal ''Digit''
as being any one of the characters from '0' to '9'.

   ''Digit'' ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' ;

Understood as

   ''Digit'' is defined as: '0' OR '1' OR '2' OR '3' OR '4' OR '5' OR '6' OR '7' OR '8' OR '9'.

A similar (somewhat tedious) definition can be given for
''Letter'' to cover 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z'.

A ''WholeNumber'' is a sequence of one or more decimal digits,
which can be expressed as one of two ways

First way

   ''WholeNumber'' ::= [ ''Digit'' ]+ ;

Understood as

   ''WholeNumber'' is defined as: ''Digit'' may be repeated one or more times

Second way

   ''WholeNumber'' ::= ''Digit'' [ ''Digit'' ]* ;

Understood as

   ''WholeNumber'' is defined as: ''Digit'' AND ''Digit'' repeated zero or more times.

These definitions allow whole numbers such as 007.
Some people dislike the idea of allowing whole numbers
to have leading zeroes.
We can handle this way of looking at things
by using the following definitions,
but we have to include the number zero (just 0) as a special case.

   ''NonZeroDigit'' ::= '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' ;
  
   ''Digit'' ::= '0' | ''NonZeroDigit'' ;
  
   ''WholeNumber'' ::= '0' | ''NonZeroDigit'' [ ''Digit'' ]* ; 

Understood as

   ''NonZeroDigit'' is defined as: '1' OR '2' OR '3' OR '4' OR '5' OR '6' OR '7' OR '8' OR '9'.

   ''Digit'' is defined as: 0 OR ''NonZeroDigit''.

   ''WholeNumber'' is defined as: 0 OR as ''NonZeroDigit'' AND ''Digit'' repeated zero or more times.

This last definition is a formal way of saying that a whole number
is either  0  or starts with a non-zero digit,
and that this non-zero digit
may be followed by any number of digits (including none).

In most programming languages an ''Identifier''
is any sequence of letters and digits which starts with a letter;
Some programming languages may allow a few special characters as well
(e.g. underline _ or hash #).
There may also be some restrictions on the length of an ''Identifier'',
but such restrictions are normally given as semantic constraints
expressed in a natural language such as English
rather than as part of the formal grammar
(e.g. up to Fortran 77, ''Identifier''s in Fortran were limited
to a maximum of 6 characters).

===Example for Syntax Analysis===

We now look at some examples which, in combination,
satisfy the rules for context-free grammars.

Consider an arithmetic expression such as   3 + 4 * 5 .
The normal convention is that multiplication and division
are done before addition and subtraction,
so the value of   3 + 4 * 5   is   23 .
If we wanted the addition to be done first in this example,
we would use brackets, so that   (3 + 4) * 5    has value   35 .

We can express these conventions regarding brackets
and operator priority as follows.
These definitions also specify that operators
with the same priority are applied from left to right.

   ''AddSub'' ::= '+' | '-' ;
  
   ''MulDiv'' ::= '*' | '/' ;
  
   ''Expression'' ::= ''Secondary'' [ ''AddSub'' ''Secondary'' ]* ;
  
   ''Secondary''  ::= ''Primary''   [ ''MulDiv'' ''Primary'' ]* ;
  
   ''Primary''    ::= '(' ''Expression'' ')' | ''Secondary'' | ''WholeNumber'' | ''Identifier'' ;

There are some extremely simple expressions
which are not covered by the above grammar.
Can you work out what they might be
before reading the third paragraph below?

Note that this is a relatively simple example,
with only two priority levels for operators.
Languages such as C/C++/Java have more than a dozen priority levels.

The particular aspect that makes this context-free rather than regular
is the way in which an ''Expression'' can be a ''Secondary'',
which can be a ''Primary'', which can be a bracketed ''Expression'',
i.e. ''Expression'' can be partially defined in terms of itself;
this is what is known as a recursive definition.

The expressions which are not covered include such things as  -5  or  +4.
To handle these we need to change one definition:
  
   ''Expression'' ::= [AddSub] ''Secondary'' [ ''AddSub'' ''Secondary'' ]* ;

This grammatical rule allows  -(+(-4)), but it does not allow   -+-4.

      <comment>Added missing 'x' in the synopsis of the command</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Synopsis==
&lt;pre&gt;
\ifx &lt;token-1&gt;&lt;token-2&gt; &lt;tex-code-1&gt; [\else &lt;tex-code-2&gt;] \fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The \if command denotes the start of an [[TeX/definition/if-then-else control structure|if-then-else control structure]].  The forms &lt;token-1&gt; and &lt;token-2&gt; must expand to [[TeX/definition/token|tokens]]. &lt;token-1&gt; and &lt;token-2&gt; can be either a [[TeX/definition/character|character]] or a [[TeX/definition/control_sequence|control sequence]]. If &lt;token-1&gt; and &lt;token-2&gt; both expand to the same character code then &lt;tex-code-1&gt; is processed; otherwise it is ignored. If the \else section is included and &lt;token-1&gt; and &lt;token-2&gt; expand to different character codes, then &lt;tex-code-2&gt; is processed; otherwise it is ignored.

==A small LaTeX example== 

Here is a small LaTeX example, demonstrating the use of &lt;code&gt;\if&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}


\ifx\mycmd\undefined
undefed
\else
  \if\mycmd1
  defed, 1
  \else
  defed
  \fi
\fi


\def\mycmd{1}

\ifx\mycmd\undefined
undefed
\else
  \if\mycmd1
  defed, 1
  \else
  defed
  \fi
\fi


\def\mycmd{0}

\ifx\mycmd\undefined
undefed
\else
  \if\mycmd1
  defed, 1
  \else
  defed
  \fi
\fi


\end{document}
&lt;/pre&gt; 

This example generates the output: 
&lt;pre&gt;
undefed
defed, 1
defed
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Notes===
Both ''style'' and ''class'' are HTML attributes and as such they can be made into options in their own right.

See the coding above.

When writing a style replacement, recall that the entire style expression needs rewritten, and that no outside containing quotes should be used. The other attributes are handled as separate options, as you would expect.

For the class declaration as an option, simply type e.g. ''&lt;nowiki&gt;class=collapsible selected&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' as an option entry to open the box as a drop-box and already open.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

{{#ifeq:{{#titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}|1}}|WikiProjectBannerShell
|{{template shortcut|WPBS}}
|{{template shortcut|WPB}}
}}
This template and [[Template:{{#ifeq:{{#titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}|1}}|WikiProjectBannerShell|WikiProjectBanners|WikiProjectBannerShell}}]] combine several talk page banners into a nested shell. They were designed for WikiProject banners and will only work reliably with such templates. 

The difference between the two is that WikiProjectBannerShell (WPBS) defaults to displaying a one-line summary of each WikiProject banner, while WikiProjectBanners (WPB) defaults to displaying only a &quot;[show]&quot; link.

==Usage==
WikiProjectBannerShell is normally used when more than two or fewer than six banners are present on the talk page, and WikiProjectBanners when six or more are present.

The template requires each banner to have a bit of coding inserted into it that allows it to be condensed. If a WikiProject banner has not implemented the code, the banner will not nest properly in the shell. If you find a banner that has not been coded, you can request that the code be added, on this template's [[Template talk:WikiProjectBannerShell|talk page]]. Note that {{tl|WPBannerMeta}} automatically includes the appropriate code.

Note that adding a &lt;tt&gt;/Comments&lt;/tt&gt; sub-page will automatically cause the banner shell to display  a &quot;[[Image:Information icon.svg|16px]] This page has an '''[[/Comments|assessment summary page]]'''.&quot; message.

===Syntax===
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{#titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}|1}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;optional parameters&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{FirstProjectBanner|...}}
{{SecondProjectBanner|...}}
{{ThirdProjectBanner|...}}
...
&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

Note that {{#ifeq:{{#titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}|1}}|WikiProjectBannerShell
|{{tl|WikiProjectBanners}}
|{{tl|WikiProjectBannerShell}}
}} can also be used with the same parameter options, although the defaults are slightly different.

====Optional parameters====
# Adding {{para|text|More banners...}} will display the text &quot;More banners ...&quot; instead of the standard text &quot;This page is within the scope of the following WikiProjects:&quot;. Of course, it will also display any other text, if you choose to specify it.   
# Adding {{para|collapsed|yes}} {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|WikiProjectBanners|(the default)}} will cause the outer table to be collapsed, hiding even the project names. Adding {{para|collapsed|no}} {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|WikiProjectBannerShell|(the default)}} will cause the outer table to not be collapsed, showing the summary of the banners.
# Adding {{para|banner collapsed|no}} will cause the individual banners inside the shell to be fully expanded.

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
|Message ID
|Cause
|----
|CL-2 Application Failure
|The client attempted to tune a streaming VOD video or the barker channel, however the first attempt to tune failed. The client will go on to retry the tune after the error message is displayed.
|----
|CL-4 CL_ERROR_CLIENT_DISCONNECTED
|The subscriber attempted to stream a VOD video however the converter is in the &quot;Disconnected&quot; state and as a result an error message was displayed instead of the requested video.
|----
|CL-5 CL_ERROR_CLIENT_DISC_WHILE_PLAY
|The converter is disconnected. Perhaps because they didn't pay the back balance on their account and the service disconnected while watching a VOD video.
|----
|CL-7 Invalid Parameter
|VOD passed an invalid parameter.
|----
|CL-8 CL_UNSUSPEND_FAILURE
|The probable cause of this problem is when an asset from a suspended list cannot be removed.
|----
|CL-13 EnvironmentError
|This occurs if the time has not been set on the set top box. This should not happen on a deployed system.
|----
|CL-14 Interactive Error
|A low level communication failure occurred.

This hook allows the display of up to ten extra &quot;/ link&quot; tags for taskforces. It is commonly used with {{tlx|WPBannerMeta/hooks/taskforces}}. It should be attached to the {{para|HOOK_NESTED}} hook. The parameters and their definitions are the same as in the standard implementation: see the [[Template:WPBannerMeta#Taskforces|documentation]] for more details.

This hook allows the use of up to ten additional task forces, over the five already supported in the main banner code.  It should be hung on {{para|HOOK_TF}}. The parameters have the same names and functions as in the [[Template:WPBannerMeta#Task forces|standard implementation]], although a few additional features are available with this hook. They are:
*&lt;code&gt;'''BANNER_NAME'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; needs to be passed, so that all the task forces will display on the template itself. 
*&lt;code&gt;'''category'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; needs to be passed, i.e. {{para|category|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{category|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''QUALITY_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; note that it is necessary to re-specify {{para|QUALITY_SCALE}} as it is used by the subtemplates involved.
**&lt;code&gt;'''quality'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; needs to be passed, i.e. {{para|quality|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''PRIORITY_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; needs to be respecified.
*&lt;code&gt;'''TF_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the default size of the task force icons. (It is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width, which results in a neater banner because all rows have equal height.) The default is a height of 25px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''tf n'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this parameter ''must'' be passed through to enable and trigger the display of the task force section. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1={{{floridiae|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the full page name of the task force's project page. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikibooks:WikiProject Tulips/Task forces/Floridiae&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_NAME'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the way the task force's name will appear in its piped link; redundant when {{para|TF_1_TEXT}} is used. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the Floridiae task force&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_TEXT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, replaces the default &quot;This page is supported by...&quot; text. ''Eg:&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;This page is within the scope of the ''Floridiae task force''. New members are always welcome!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''''' If defined to be &quot;none&quot;, then no output will be displayed, although appropriate categories will still be added.
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_IMAGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an image can be defined for each task force. Remember that all images '''''must''''' be free, not fair-use. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Tulipa florenskyi 4.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of the task force icon, which will override the '''TF_SIZE''' parameter, if set. (Again, it is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width.) {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_QUALITY'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, enables the quality categorizations for the main project (e.g.: Category:FB-quality Tulips pages) to be duplicated for the task force. The quality arising from {{para|quality}} and {{para|QUALITY_SCALE}} will be used; {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''tf n priority'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the use of a separate priority (or importance, if used) scale for the task force.{{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1 priority={{{floridiae-priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_ASSESSMENT_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required if quality or priority assessments are used)'' &amp;ndash; the assessment category to be used for the task force-specific quality and priority assessments. Identical in syntax to {{para|ASSESSMENT_CAT}}. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Floridiae pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → Category:FB-quality Floridiae pages}}''
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_MAIN_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying &quot;tf 1&quot; will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;TF_1_MAIN_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Floridiae pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → Category:Floridiae pages''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_SUBJECT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; may be used to include links to subjects which are specific to particular task forces.
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_n_HOOK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; enables extra code to be triggered by each task force parameter (for example, additional categories, with the use of the [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/cats|/cats]] hook);

It will also be necessary to use [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/tfnested]] if you want to display the &quot;/ project&quot; for each taskforce when the banner is nested.

This hook allows you to add up to ten optional categories, that will be added to a page if a particular parameter is defined.  Each category will be added if the corresponding parameter is non-empty. This template displays no visible output, so it can be put anywhere in the template code; common practice is to put it at the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Key Terms==

Abnormal profits (HL)
*Profit that exceeds economic profit, which includes accounting costs and opportunity costs.  Also referred to as &quot;supernormal profits&quot;

Accounting cost/profit (HL)
*Profit calculated by adding together all forms of revenue and subtracting explicit costs of doing business such as depreciation, interest, and taxes. This does not include opportunity costs.

Ad valorem tax
*An indirect tax based on the value of an economic good acquired. This may be in the form of sales taxes, value-added taxes, property taxes, and more. 

Allocative efficiency (HL)
*A situation that occurs when no resources are wasted: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.

Average costs (HL)
*Total costs divided by number of units produced.

Average revenue (HL)
*Total revenue divided by number of units produced. 

Barriers to entry (HL)
*Barriers that make it difficult for new firms to enter an industry and compete with existing producers or suppliers.

Break even price (HL)
*The price at which average revenue and average costs are equal. This makes it so that normal profit is achieved.

Buffer stock scheme
*An organization, usually run by producers or the government, that attempts to smooth out fluctuations in price and therefore also the income of producers.  

Cartel (HL)
*A group of producers that enter a collusive agreement to restrict output in order to increase prices, demand, and profit. 

Collusive oligopoly (HL)
*Where a group of oligopolists determine a co-ordinated price in order to avoid price wars.  

Commodity
*An economic good that is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. For example, gold, copper, and steel are commodities because they are virtually the same from every producer. 

Commodity agreements
*An international agreement to stabilize commodity prices in the best interest of producers and consumers. This includes mechanisms to influence market prices by adjusting export quotas and production, as well as employing buffer stocks.  

Contestable market (HL)
*A market with free or low barriers to entry, so that the firms in the industry face competition from potential entrants. 

Cross price elasticity
*The percentage change in the demand for one good divided by the percentage change in the price of a related good.  This allows a measure of the responsiveness to the change in one good's quantity to another good's price.  

Demand
*The relationship between the quantity demanded of a good or service and its price.  

Demerit goods
*Goods that have negative externalities, or have been decided by the political process as socially undesirable.

Direct tax
*A tax paid directly to the government from the taxed individual. For example, income taxes are generally paid directly to the government. 

Diseconomies of scale (HL)
*Where as a company expands in its factors of production, the company suffers increased marginal costs and decreased marginal productivity.

==Evaluating quality==
The FSI report &quot;[http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php?page=General Adapting and Writing Language Lessons]&quot; proposes three &quot;qualities&quot; by which a lesson can be evaluated. These are &quot;strength/weakness&quot;, &quot;lightness/heaviness&quot; and &quot;transparency/opacity&quot; (see chapter 3 of the report for details). We could consider using these for quality rating here. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 20:21, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
:I'll be importing [[w:Template:Grading scheme]] and [[w:Template:Importance scheme]] to make filling in this page easier.  I'm still finishing up [[Template:WikiProject Languages]].  I'll note when they're all in place. (Maybe I shouldn't have linked this page yet). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:21, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
::The grading template will help, but I expect it will need to be adapted to take account of the fact that each page is only a small part of a book unlike Wikipedia articles which are self-contained. Ideally, each lesson would have a specification against which it could be judged. I'm not so sure how useful the &quot;importance&quot; grading for each lesson would be though - perhaps this only applies to complete books, and even then I think forming an objective judgment would be very hard. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:51, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
:::The content of those templates can be created from scratch; the templates only handle links to the categories and the shades of the boxes for each level.  I think I may refactor the templates to use &quot;priority&quot; instead of &quot;importance&quot;. Some of the templates let you choose to do that manually, but I think that maybe at Wikibooks it'd be better to have &quot;priority&quot; be the default rather than the override. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:55, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
::::All the templates are fully set up and working now.  I've got the shells on this page and they're ready to be filled in. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:00, 12 June 2010 (UTC)

== Evaluating priority ==

i like &quot;priority&quot; over &quot;importance&quot;, but is there a project guideline on how to determine priority? Number of speakers (so things like Spanish and Mandarin are prioritized), historical significance (so languages like Greek and Aramaic are prioritized), linguistic significance (Latin (as the basis of Romance languages) and Esperanto (as the first major constructed language)) or the &quot;cool&quot; factor (Ancient Egyptian for the hieroglyphs and Na'vi for the pop cred)? i would like to mark up the [[Esperanto]] chapters, but i'm not sure whether Esperanto counts as low or medium. On the one hand it's pretty obscure and only spoken by a couple million people. On the other it is '''the''' constructed language - the most well-known, the most widely-used, the most mature, etc. - and it is a pretty important topic within the field of linguistics. It's one of those things where, if you're going to talk about languages you have to mention conlangs, and if you're going to mention conlangs it's pretty much a given that you're going to mention Esperanto. Is medium a good match for that? --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 15:27, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

:Both the priority and quality scales need to be filled in by WikiProject participants.  The criteria you describe above are for ''importance'' and that is why I changed it to use ''priority''.  Priority in this case allows for grading which pages within a language book are most valuable in providing the essentials needed to be able to learn/speak/write the language effectively.  Any external factors will not come into play. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:00, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

::I wonder whether tagging a particular lesson / page will always be fine grained enough. If a book were being written to provide material for school / college courses, then these usually have a fixed number of lesson periods available. In that case, each page could have some &quot;essential&quot; and some &quot;supplementary&quot; material. Teachers would probably form their own view about the value of the content for their classes anyway. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:36, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

:::The creation of the template for WikiProject Languages was primarily to test out all the features of [[Template:WPBannerMeta]].  If contributors decide they don't want to use the priority classification, it can be removed.  Ideally priority and quality would be used in combination with a table tallying each updated by a bot (which we don't have).  Contributors would then examine which high priority pages are lacking in quality and work on those first.  These classifications are not for the readers, but rather for the contributors, which is why the template is on the discussion pages.  It should help to facilitate collaboration, so whatever works best for the members of the WikiProject. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:24, 11 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[User:Rhettro|Rhettro]] ([[User talk:Rhettro|talk]]) 21:32, 10 June 2010 (UTC)I'm a little unclear on the purpose of this section.  The author explains in general terms how one would hand draw a perspective image. Yet for practical purposes, a camera/lens setting analogy would be a better way to explain how blender creates 3d images.  Otherwise this page needs some discussion about the horizen line and how perspective drawing tries to simulate how we see things.


==&quot;how does the perspactive work?&quot;==

dont you think it's need to be title?

[[Special:Contributions/216.195.185.229|216.195.185.229]] ([[User talk:216.195.185.229|discuss]]) 21:00, 10 January 2013 (UTC)

&quot;'''Blender only does 3-point perspective, not 1-point or 2-point.'''&quot;

This statement isn't correct; Blender can &quot;do&quot; all three types of perspective

1, 2 and 3-point perspectives are determined by the relationship of the picture plane (camera view) with the object, the horizon and the two combined, respectively.

The Blender user is free to fix the location of the station point and the angle of the picture plane (camera) anywhere in space and thus can create 1, 2 and 3-point perspectives (Numpad 0). Were not these three illustrations in the article created using Blender?

== Amarok ==
: Amarok is probably the best audio player for Linux.
: It's installed with KDE environment as default.

: can receive lyrisc and covers and integrates with Wikipedia.

:: Preferences-&gt; Audio-&gt; Audio System. 
[[File:Audio8en.png|center|600px]]
:4. Audacious hasn't many skins so if you want to get more download theme from: http://www.customize.org/winamp2/skins

 /usr/share/audacious/Skins

\&lt;non-letter&gt;

== Description ==
A control sequence in TeX starts with an escape character, which is usually mapped to the [[TeX/backslash|backslash]] character '\'.
This is either followed by letters to form a [[TeX/definition/control word|control word]], or by a single non-letter to form a [[TeX/definition/control symbol|control symbol]].
Control words are terminated by a non-letter, if this happens to be a space character then it is not used to effect the spacing of the document.

== Examples ==

&lt;pre&gt;
\par
&lt;/pre&gt;
will end a paragraph. This is equivalent to a blank line to TeX.

&lt;pre&gt;
\'e\`a
&lt;/pre&gt;
will typeset an acute accent over an e followed directly by a grave accent over an a: éà

== Recent edit at [[LaTeX]]==
Hi, I have recently been (rather slowly) trying to go through and add enclose=none to all of the source tags in the LaTeX book to restore it to its previous form after some software changes here.  I notice you undid this at [[LaTeX/Absolute Beginners‎]] and I thought we should discuss so we can aim for a common goal. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:26, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
:Well, I think that when the LaTeX commands are on lines by themselves they look better when they are on gray background, it differentiates them from examples better. The commands inside the text on the other hand should use just the coloring. Though I think the [[Talk:LaTeX]] is better place to discuss this, especially when I put my opinions about this issue there. :) [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 21:59, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

==[[WB:WikiProject Mathematics|WikiProject Mathematics]]==
I was attempting to restart the Mathematics Project here at wikibooks. The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics coverage here. Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;); or actual mathematics content. I know lots of different disciplines are interested in LaTeX, but I thought you might like to know about the project anyways. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:29, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

: Well, I studied maths, and as you already know I'm not alien to LaTeX. I know how to use the tools mentioned on the project page: Inkscape and gnuplot. All in all, I use Linux as my primary OS so usually end up using open tools either way. I think I could help a bit with specific questions up to university level math, LaTeX and some tools. Though it's rather unlikely I'll start fixing general math pages, sorry, don't have ''this'' much time. [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 00:14, 3 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

: See [[Discrete mathematics/Functions and relations]] [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:12, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I'm not entirely sure what the intended audience for this wikibook is, but I'm assuming it's aimed at people with only a very basic understanding of the principles of maths. Is it a good idea to begin throwing things like the slope formula at such people right on the very first page of the book? I'm not too sure what convention dictates around here, so I'll just make my suggestion here: Add something like ' ''Don't worry if this formula makes no sense at all to you. We'll explain it all, bit by bit, in the next few chapters.'' '

== FOIL ==

I really don't think the FOIL bit belongs here, as it is badly explained and really shouldn't be covered in a chapter on the most basic elements in algebra. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 19:48, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

I don't think students are yet familiar with the use of other variable other than x and y. By introducing the concept of z now, it might confuse students in the future. Also, it must be taught that the variables such as Z, are merely representations of a number(though having multiple variables does remind me of techniques I had in my second year of algebra).

The explanation of the term &quot;variable&quot; is not really correct. Letters, like &quot;a&quot; ''can'' represent a variable, but it can also represent a constant. For instance &quot;C&quot;, the arbitrary constant of integration. [[User:Fokion|Fokion]] 03:10, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

===My edits ===

I have done the following so that this page has more of a focus:

Foil- take out. As suggested, because it has nothing to do with grammar. moved to polynomials section
distributive property-moved to polynomial section
Any mention of multiple variable use (Z is linear algebra use)
Improved simple definitions and examples
introduce why Variables can be any letter.

==Stubby text==
This text follows the &quot;Distributive Property&quot; section:

&quot;For example, since each letter represents a number, let's pick some numbers and try them out.

So in y - z = x + 5, if y = 18 and z = 7, then x = 6.&quot;

Is it relevant? It seems to have landed here from someplace else?

== Extra dot (.) makes integer a real - intentional? ==
Please see second bullet point above &quot;Like Terms&quot; heading.
...and how about explaining the term &quot;coefficient&quot; before (or as) it's used - link?

== &quot;Like Terms&quot; section revamped ==
The &quot;Like Terms&quot; section was pretty badly set up and lacked information as to ''all'' the characteristics of like terms, as well as the property that they can be added or subtracted. Since this property is the major desire of identifying like terms, I completely rewrote this section.

== Dependent/Independent ==
It's quite telling how fuzzy this concept is based on the fact that there was no decisive answer for the only example given. Perhaps we should discuss functions alone, and not dependent variables. [[User:Ahhoefel|Ahhoefel]] 02:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

[[File:Tick_green_modern_2.svg|thumb|100px]]
Once you have completed everything else it is time to finish the project, and that means writing the appraisal.  This section is relatively easy to get marks in so give yourself time to do it properly.

===Did you meet your objectives?===
Way back in your Analysis you wrote down a set of objectives, copy them into you appraisal.  For each objective state if you met it and how it went. For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Objective !! Met? !! Comment
|-
| Easy to use || Yes || User feedback was positive and said...
|-
| Calculates how many chocolate bars were sold || Yes || This was performed on my frmChocolate, it was hard to do because...
|-
| Design my own chocolate bar || No || I ran out of time and found this too difficult to implement
|}
You are aiming to meet all of your objectives, but don't be afraid to mention those that you didn't meet and why you didn't meet them.

===Feedback===
Part of any completed project involves you showing the work to your target user.  You might choose to sit them down and demonstrate it, then record their feedback directly, or you might choose to send them a copy and ask them to email you any responses.  The important thing here is that you get feedback from your user that is definitely theirs.  Try and ask them for things that would like you to improve upon.  The letter / email that you receive from them should be about half a page to a page long, listing at least the following:
*General feedback about how easy the system is to use, talking about all users
*How does the system meet their objectives
*How easy was the system to set up
*Criticisms of what they don't like 
*Suggestions about how they would like the system to be improved or extended
*Signature and date

===Analyse feedback===
Now you have the feedback, was it good was it bad, does it make you think you met all your objectives?  What would you do differently next time?

===Extensions===
To get full marks you are going to have to think of some ways to improve your project.  Saying something like: &quot;I would make it better&quot; is not good enough.  What does that even mean? &quot;I would add more levels&quot; is equally naive unless you mention how this would make the system better.  These extensions must be SMART!

You need to mention 3-4 things that given another few months you would implement in your system.  Think big but not too big, the things you mention should be achievable and you need to show that you have thought out how you would make that change. For example:

&quot;I could edit my program into an online system so I only need to update the code in one place instead to having to replace the program on each machine when a new version comes out.  To do this I would rewrite my system in PHP with a MYSQL database back end.&quot;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:48, 11 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

interface for outline fonts, and our implementation of it in freetype2.library. 

font metrics are actually quite difficult and not help by the fact that the bullet interface doesn't provide a way to get the metrics for the font as a whole, meaning have to generate them in a rather horrible way. 

font sizing on AROS is not the same as on other systems. The bullet interface to FreeType is recalculating the metrics to better match the traditional Amiga way of talking about metrics, with the downside that it makes the glyphs smaller than they should be. Additionally, there's no way to get the display device DPI under AROS, making it quite impossible to have FreeType adjust the scale appropriately.

==Introduction==


Commodore Amiga MIDI Driver (CAMD) is a shared library for AmigaOS which provides a general device driver for MIDI data, so that applications can share MIDI data with each other in real-time, and interface to MIDI hardware in a device-independent way.

AmigaOS itself did not support MIDI until release 3.1 when Roger Dannenberg's CAMD library was adapted as the standard MIDI API. Commodore's version of CAMD also included a built-in driver for the Amiga serial port.

Read more [http://aminet.net/package/mus/edit/camd here]


Only copy the driver(s) you '''use''' into devs:midi/. Dont have more than one type of driver for the same hardware in devs:midi/. Ie, don`t have both mmp and uaemidi (which both uses the serial-port), for example. 

USB will poll and find all midi devices automatically 

The new camd.library does not have a built-in driver for the serial-port. Just use mmp/port 0 instead. It should be more stable than the old internal driver too.

out.0, out.1, out.2, in.0, in.1, etc. does not exist anymore. The links will have the names &lt;drivername&gt;.out.0, &lt;drivername&gt;.out.1, &lt;drivername&gt;.in.0, etc. instead.

==Midi Specs ==



===Nodes ===

Each node is hardware 


Tags 
&lt;pre &gt;
MIDI_Name (STRPTR) name of the node, usually the program name
MIDI_SignalTask (struct Task *) Task to be signaled, defaults to current task
MIDI_RecvHook (struct Hook *) the hook to be called when new messages arrive
MIDI_PartHook (struct Hook *) the hook to call when linkages are added or removed
MIDI_RecvSignal (int8) the signal to send when messages arrive
MIDI_PartSignal (int8) the signal to send when linkages are added or removed
MIDI_MsgQueue (uint32) the desired size of incoming message queue
MIDI_SysExSize (uint32) the desired byte size of the System Exclusive buffer
MIDI_TimeStamp (uint32*) pointer to the desired MIDI time stamp source.
MIDI_ErrFilter (uint16) the desired error filter for this node. see camd.h
MIDI_ClientType (uint16) the desired client type for this node. see camd.h
MIDI_Image (struct Image *) Image (suggested 32X32) for this node.
&lt;/pre &gt;



===Links ===

Links are created beween nodes 


Tags 
&lt;pre &gt;
MLINK_Name (STRPTR) name for this link
MLINK_Location (STRPTR) Cluster to connect to, Case sensitive
MLINK_ChannelMask (uint16) Mask of which MIDI channels to listen to, defaults to ~0
MLINK_EventMask (uint16) Mask of which types of MIDI events to listen for, defaults to ~0
MLINK_UserData (CPTR) User defined
MLINK_Comment (STRPTR) highest priority link will comment the cluster
MLINK_PortID (uint8) Value to copy to any msgs arriving through this link
MLINK_Private (BOOL) if TRUE, link requests to be hidden
MLINK_Priority (int8) priority of this MidiLink
MLINK_SysExFilter (uint32) data is 3 1 byte SysEx ID's to filtter with
MLINK_SysExFilterX (uint32) data is one 3 Byte SysEx ID to filter with
MLINK_Parse (BOOL) If true, CAMD will parse incoming stream into MIDI Messages
MLINK_ErrorCode, (uint32*) points to an error code buffer
&lt;/pre &gt;


A meeting of links from different applications or interfaces (in, out or both) is called a cluster. It allows messages from one link to get to other links automatically. 

&lt;pre &gt;
                Link                     Links
Application ----------&gt; Cluster ----------&gt; Application 
                                 &lt;------------ Application 
&lt;/pre &gt;




===Messages ===

And midi messages are sent 


&lt;pre &gt;
/* MidiMsg struct */
mm_Msg 
mm_Time 
mm_Status 
mm_Data1 
mm_Data2 
mm_Port 
mm_Data 
&lt;/pre &gt;

GetMidi PutMidi 



====Filters ====



lower 4bits contains the channel number, if the MIDI messages is on a channel which does not match the bits set, then message is not used 

what midi wants 
&lt;pre &gt;
note on/off
program change
pitch bend
controller change MSB
controller change LSB
controller change Boolean switch
controller change single byte
controller parameter change
undefined controllers
mode change messages
channel after touch
polyphonic after touch
system real-time messages (MIDI clock, MTC Quarter Frame)
system common messages (Start, Stop, etc)
system exclusive messages
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>/* Rescanning the SCSI Bus */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction =
This page is an TODO state. anyone is free to complete/contribute to it.
For now (2010-06-11) it contains random notes I've been collecting through the time.

TODO is a mark meaning &quot;to do&quot; (&quot;TODO&quot; is automatically recognized by some editing tools as a pending tasks).

= HARDWARE MONITORING =
== Rescanning the SCSI Bus ==
Next [http://bash.cyberciti.biz/diskadmin/rescan-linux-scsi-bus/ link] provides a quick script to rescan the SCSI bus in Linux.

There is a simpler way that most of the time will work properly:

 echo &quot;- - -&quot; &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan

An slightly more complex script example for a Qlogic card:
 #!/bin/bash
 for HBA in `ls -A /proc/scsi/qla2xxx/`
 do
    echo &quot;scsi-qlascan&quot; &gt; /proc/scsi/qla2xxx/${HBA}
 done 

Alternatively  iscsiadm can be used if available:
  iscsiadm -t discovery --type sendtargets --portal &lt;IP&gt; 
  iscsiadm -t node --targename &lt;targetname&gt;-- portal&lt;IP&gt; --login 

Amognst other documents available on the net [http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html-single/Online_Storage_Reconfiguration_Guide/index.html Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Online Storage Reconfiguration Guide] can also be a usefull help.

== [http://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode/ DMIDECODE] ==
Dmidecode reports information about your system's hardware as described in your system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard (see a sample output). This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).

== TODO [http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/ani/index.htm IPMI] ==
    What is IPMI?
    
    The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification
    defines a set of interfaces for platform management.  It is
    implemented by a large number of hardware manufacturers to support
    system management on motherboards. The features of IPMI that most
    users will be interested in are sensor monitoring (i.e. CPU
    temperatures, fan speeds), remote power control, and serial-over-LAN
    (SOL).
    
    What is FreeIPMI?
    
    FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the
    IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.  FreeIPMI provides tools and libraries
    for users to access and read IPMI sensor readings, system event log
    (SEL) entries, serial-over-LAN (SOL), remote power control functions,
    field replaceable unit (FRU) device information, and more.  More
    information about FreeIPMI can be found at the FreeIPMI webpage at:
    
    http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/index.html

1.- Add to /etc/apt/sources.list the next line:

 deb ftp://ftp.sara.nl/pub/sara-omsa dell sara

2.- Execute 
  apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install dellomsa

That install OMSA in /opt/dell. 

3.- To boot the system:

 ~# /opt/dell/srvadmin/dataeng/bin/dsm_sa_datamgr32d -run
 ~# /opt/dell/srvadmin/dataeng/bin/dsm_sa_eventmgr32d -run

===OMSA Usage Examples:===

To check the health of the disc connected to controller 0:

 ~# /etc/delloma.d/oma/bin/omreport.sh storage pdisk controller=0

The output will look similar to:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Knot
| name=Cat's paw
| image= catspawknot.png
| use = The Cat's paw  is used for connecting a rope to an object.  
* Attaching a rope to a hook (or to a post or rail where the load is perpendicular to the post) with more security than a simple [[Knots/Hitch knots/Lark's head|lark's head]].
* Joining an eye to a ring.
* Strongly joining eyes in the ends of two lines, where there is access to the end of at least one line.

| tying_instructions =
;Method 1:
Form a bight in the middle of the line, and pull it back over itself like a [[Knots/Hitch knots/Lark's head|lark's head]]. This forms two loops, turned in opposite directions. Give each loop one more full turn in the direction that will tend to tighten it (the wrong direction will undo the loop completely). Pass both loops over the hook, rail or post and pull tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.
;Method 2:
If working end of the line has an eye in it, and the standing end is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with inaccessible ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the ring or rail, then pass the standing end through its own eye (this effectively forms a [[Knots/Hitch knots/Lark's head|lark's head]]). Then pass the standing end through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.

When using the cat's paw to join two eyes, this process may be repeated several times to give several turns - as many as five in a fine fishing monofilament. Then when tightened, instead of pulling the bight up against the turns, both eyes are pulled equally, to make neat coils of turns in both eyes, meeting halfway between them.

== Usage instructions ==
* The code below is for customizing the template for a specific WikiProject.  Parameters for the standard quality classes need to be filled in, but will default to empty if not supplied.
*Specifying the &lt;code&gt;topic&lt;/code&gt; parameter will link the classification labels to the appropriate quality category in the format &quot;''X''-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;.
*The rows for ''Category'', ''Subject'', ''Project'', and ''Template'' classifications are optional but will be displayed unless {{para|quality|standard}} is specified.
*Filling in the ''X_detail'' parameter will add a drop-down box to the criteria column, permitting additional information to be added.
*The ''FB'', ''Category'', ''Subject'', ''Project'', ''Template'', and ''NB'' classifications, if used, can have the default information overridden with {{para|X_criteria}}, {{para|X_detail}}, {{para|X_reader}}, and {{para|X_suggestion}}

*Copy and paste:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Nuwa2.jpg|thumb|Nüwa, Chinese creator goddess]]
The Bible says that God made people and a great big flood. In Chinese mythology, the goddess Nüwa also made people, but rather than making a big flood, she stopped one.

==The story==
Nüwa existed in the beginning of the world. She felt lonely as there were no animals so she began the creation of animals and humans. On the first day she created chickens. On the second day she created dogs. On the third day she created sheep. On the fourth day she created pigs. On the fifth day she created cattle. On the sixth day she created horses. On the seventh day she began creating men from yellow clay, sculpting each one individually, yet after she had created hundreds of figures in this way she still had more to make but had grown tired of the laborious process.

So instead of hand-crafting each figure, she dipped a rope in clay and flicked it so blobs of clay landed everywhere; each of these blobs became a common person. Nüwa still laboriously crafted some people out of clay, who became nobles.

There was a quarrel between two of the more powerful gods, and they decided to settle it with a fight. When the water god Gong Gong saw that he was losing, he smashed his head against Mount Buzhou , a pillar holding up the sky. The pillar collapsed and caused the sky to tilt towards the northwest and the earth to shift to the southeast. This caused great calamities, such as unending fires, vast floods, and the appearance of fierce man-eating beasts. Nüwa cut off the legs of a giant tortoise and used them to supplant the fallen pillar, alleviating the situation and sealing the broken sky using stones of seven different colours, but she was unable to fully correct the tilted sky. This explains the phenomenon that sun, moon, and stars move towards the northwest, and that rivers in China flow southeast into the Pacific Ocean.

Look into any good Chinese calendar and you will find that one of the days is called Mid-Autumn Festival. As you may know already, there are three myths regarding this festival. We will talk about them in the three consecutive chapters.

==Story==
According to legend, Chang'e and her husband Houyi were immortals living in heaven. One day, the ten sons of the [[w:Jade Emperor|Jade Emperor]] transformed into ten suns, causing the earth to scorch. Having failed to order his sons to stop ruining the earth, the Jade Emperor summoned Houyi for help. Houyi, using his legendary archery skills, shot down nine of the sons, but spared one son to be the sun. The Jade Emperor was obviously not pleased with Houyi's solution to save the earth: nine of his sons were dead. As punishment, the Jade Emperor banished Houyi and Chang'e to live as mere mortals on earth.

Seeing that Chang'e felt extremely miserable over her loss of immortality, Houyi decided to journey on a long, perilous quest to find the pill of immortality so that the couple could be immortals again. At the end of his quest he met the [[w:Queen Mother of the West|Queen Mother of the West]] who agreed to give him the pill, but warned him that each person would only need half the pill to become immortal.

Houyi brought the pill home and stored it in a case. He warned Chang'e not to open the case and then left home for a while. Like Pandora in Greek mythology, Chang'e became too curious: she opened up the case and found the pill just as Houyi was returning home. Nervous that Houyi would catch her discovering the contents of the case, she accidentally swallowed the entire pill. She started to float into the sky because of the overdose. Although Houyi wanted to shoot her down in order to prevent her from floating further, he could not bear to aim the arrow at her. Chang'e kept on floating until she landed on the moon.

While she became lonely on the moon without her husband, she did have company. A [[../Jade Rabbit|jade rabbit]], who manufactured elixirs, as well as the woodcutter [[../Wu Gang|Wu Gang]], also lived on the moon.

== Cultural symbol==
This story was adapted in 2003 into a Chinese TV period drama titled ''Moon Fairy'', starring Singapore actors Fann Wong and Christopher Lee. Chang'e appears in Wu Cheng'en's novel ''Journey to the West'' and also TV adaptations of the novel. Her story was slightly changed in that she did not go to the moon on her first try but went to the heavens instead. She would later be rewarded by being allowed to live on the moon after an incident which involved her and Zhu Bajie. China's chairman, Mao Zedong, mentions Chang'e in his most famous 
poem, about his murdered wife Yang Kaihui. The legend of Lady Chang-O plays a prominent role in Amy Tan's children's book, ''The Moon Lady'', retold from her more adult novel ''The Joy Luck Club''.

The moon goddess was mentioned in the conversation between Houston Capcom and Apollo 11 crew just before the first moon landing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Houston''': Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called ''Chang-o'' has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the moon because she stole the pill for immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is only standing on his hind feet in the shade of a [[w:cinnamon tree|cinnamon tree]]. The name of the rabbit is not recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Collins''': Okay, we'll keep a close eye for the bunny girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, China launched its first lunar probe, named [[w:Chang'e 1|Chang'e 1]] (Chinese: 嫦娥一号; pinyin: Cháng'é Yī Hào) in the goddess's honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Jade Rabbit, also called the Moon Rabbit, is a rabbit that lives on the moon. In Chinese folklore, it is often portrayed as a companion of the moon goddess [[../Houyi and Chang'e|Chang'e]], constantly pounding the elixir of life for her. However, in Japanese and Korean versions of the story, it is just pounding mochi or tteok.

==The story==
[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|left|White Rabbit in the Moon making the elixir of immortality. From an 18th-century imperial robe embroidery]]
In the Buddhist story &quot;Śaśajâtaka&quot;  (Jataka Tales: no.316), one of the Jataka Tales, a monkey, an otter, a jackal, and a rabbit resolved to practice charity on the Uposatha, believing a demonstration of great virtue would earn a great reward.

When an old man begged for food, the monkey gathered fruits from the trees and the otter collected dead fish from the river bank, while the jackal wrongfully pilfered a lizard and a pot of milk-curd. The rabbit, who knew only how to gather grass, instead offered its own body, throwing itself into a fire the man had built. The rabbit, however, was not burnt. The old man revealed himself to be Śakra, and touched by the rabbit's virtue, drew the likeness of the rabbit on the moon for all to see. It is said the lunar image is still draped in the smoke that rose when the rabbit cast itself into the fire.

The Chinese version of the story the Jade Emperor replaces Śakra.

==History==
The earliest records suggesting that there is a rabbit on the moon appears in the Warring States period in ancient China. The ''Chu Ci'', a Western Han anthology of Chinese poems from the Warring States period, notes that along with a toad, there is a rabbit on the moon who constantly pounds herbs for the immortals. This notion is supported by later texts, including the ''Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era'' encyclopedia of the Song Dynasty. Han Dynasty poets call the rabbit on the moon the Jade Rabbit or the Gold Rabbit, so in the days of old people also use the words &quot;Jade Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Gold Rabbit&quot; to refer to the moon.

==Modern references==
*The moon rabbit was mentioned in the conversation between Houston and the Apollo 11 crew just before the first moon landing; see [[../Houyi and Chang'e|the previous chapter]] for details.
*The American electronic music group Rabbit in the Moon gets its name from this legend.
*In the novel ''Watership Down'' the Grim Reaper in Lapine mythology is the Black Rabbit of Inlé. Inlé is the Lapine word for Moon.

The ''Book of the Master of Huainan'', from the Han Dynasty, records that when the moon waxes, the foot of an immortal grows into a laurel. However, Wu Gang is not mentioned in that book. &lt;ref name=&quot;tao&quot;/&gt;

''[[w:Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang|Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' records that the tree on the moon is over five hundred ''chi'' high, and Wu Gang of Xihe stands under it. It is also recorded that immortals are sent to the moon to chop down the laurel tree when they make a mistake. &lt;ref name=&quot;tao&quot;/&gt;

In the earliest known version of the story as it exists now, Wu Gang's wife had an affair with [[w:Yandi|Yandi]]'s grandson and had three sons with him. Wu murdered Yandi's grandson in revenge. Consequently, Yandi ordered Wu to be banished to the moon, where he would cut down a laurel tree. However, the tree healed itself after each blow. Consequently, Wu was forced to spend eternity trying to perform a task that could never be completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;space&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Space/StarShine/Starlore/c_starshine_starlore8.htm|title=吳剛砍玉桂樹|publisher=Hong Kong Space Museum|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version of the tale, Wu Gang wished to learn to become an immortal but he did not try very hard. The [[w:Jade Emperor|Jade Emperor]] was furious, and decided to punish him. The Emperor created a cherry bay tree on the moon. Wu Gang was asked to chop itdown  in order to become an immortal. Wu Gang tried to chop down the tree but, because of the tree's self-healing abilities, it was impossible. The shadows on the moon are said to be created by the cherry bay tree. &lt;ref name=&quot;midautumn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsaboutchina.com/mid-autumn.htm|title=Mid-Autumn Festival Story|language=English|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In yet another version, Wu wished to be taught the method of eternal life. He found a teacher in the mountains. When his teacher tried to teach him to heal, Wu gave up after three days. When Wu was taught to play Chinese chess, he gave up learning after two days. When Wu received lessons in the method of eternal life, he lost interest after a day. His teacher sent him to the moon to chop down a tree of unnamed species. &lt;ref name=&quot;school&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Pangu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Pangu from ''Sancai Tuhui'']]

Christians believe that God created the world, and most scientists blame it on the big bang. China has a version of its own: A man who lay in the universe, dormant for years!

== The story ==
In the beginning there was nothing in the universe except a formless chaos.  However this chaos coalesced into a world egg for about 18,000 years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of Yin and Yang became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant with horns on his head and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky ''Yin'') and the Sky (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took 18,000 years; with each day the sky grew ten feet (3 meters) higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon.

After the 18,000 years had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the wind; his voice the thunder; left eye the sun and right eye the moon; his body became the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became the fish and animals throughout the land.  Nüwa the Goddess then used the mud of the water bed to form the shape of humans.  These humans were very smart since they were individually crafted.  Nüwa then became bored of individually making every human so she started putting a rope in the water bed and lettings the drops of mud that fell from it become new humans. These small drops became new humans, not as smart as the first.

== Origin ==
Three main views emerge to describe the origin of the Pangu myth. The first is that the story is indigenous, and developed or was transmitted through time to [[Xu Zheng]]. The evidence for this is slender.

Senior Scholar Wei Juxian states that the Pangu story is derived from Western Zhou Dynasty stories 1000 years earlier. He cites the story of Zhong and Li in the &quot;Chuyu&quot; section of the ancient classics ''Guoyu''. In it, the King Zhao of Chu asked Guanshefu a question: &quot;What did ancient classic &quot;Zhou Shu&quot; mean by the sentence that Zhong and Li caused the heaven and earth to disconnect from each other?&quot; The &quot;Zhou Shu&quot; sentence he refers to is about an earlier person, Luu Xing, who is having a conversation with the King Mu of Zhou. King Mu's reign is much earlier and dates to about 1001 to 946 BC. In their conversation, they discuss the &quot;disconnection&quot; between heaven and earth.

An indirect but possibly more substantive conclusion is that China is unique in not &quot;creating&quot; its creator. In this view, Xu Zheng or a relatively recent predecessor, perpetuates the Pangu myth from other cultural influences.

Professor Qin Naichang, head of the Guangxi Institute for Nationality Studies  proposes the myth originated in Laibin city, Guangxi, in the center of the Pearl River Valley.  He believes that there are older stories of Pangu from this region and that they originally involved two people. He suggests China has no myth about the creation of the universe and that the Chinese mythology of Pangu had come from India, Egypt, or Babylon. Apparently, this story mingled in with the origin stories of other cultures, eventually changing into the later narrative more popular today.

This is Professor Qin's reconstruction of the true creation myth preceding the myth of Pangu. Note that it is not actually a creation myth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brother and his sister became the only survivors of the prehistoric Deluge by crouching in a gourd that floated on water. The two got married afterwards, and a mass of flesh in the shape of a whetstone was born. They chopped it and the pieces turned into large crowds of people, who began to reproduce again. The couple were named 'Pan' and 'Gou' in the Zhuang ethnic language, which stand for whetstone and gourd respectively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Carus wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;P’an-Ku: The basic idea of the yih philosophy was so convincing that it almost obliterated the Taoist cosmology of P’an-Ku who is said to have chiseled the world out of the rocks of eternity.  Though the legend is not held in high honor by the literati, it contains some features of interest which have not as yet been pointed out and deserve at least an incidental comment.&lt;p&gt;P’an-Ku is written in two ways:  one means in literal translations, “basin ancient”, the other “basin solid”.  Both are homophones, i.e., they are pronounced the same way; and the former may be preferred as the original and correct spelling.  Obviously the name means “aboriginal abyss,” or in the terser German, Urgrund, and we have reason to believe it to be a translation of the Babylonian Tiamat, “the Deep.”&lt;p&gt;The Chinese legend tells us that P’an-Ku’s bones changed to rocks; his flesh to earth; his marrow, teeth and nails to metals; his hair to herbs and trees; his veins to rivers; his breath to wind; and his four limbs became pillars marking the four corners of the world, -- which is a Chinese version not only of the Norse myth of the Giant Ymir, but also of the Babylonian story of Tiamat.&lt;p&gt;Illustrations of P’an-Ku represent him in the company of supernatural animals that symbolize old age or immortality, viz., the tortoise and the crane; sometimes also the dragon, the emblem of power, and the phenix, the emblem of bliss.&lt;p&gt;When the earth had thus been shaped from the body of P’an-Ku, we are told that three great rivers successively governed the world:  first the celestial, then the terrestrial, and finally the human sovereign.  They were followed by Yung-Ch’eng and Sui-Jen (i.e., fire-man) the later being the Chinese Prometheus, who brought the fire down from heaven and taught man its various uses.&lt;p&gt;The Prometheus myth is not indigenous to Greece, where it received the artistically classical form under which it is best known to us.  The name, which by  an ingenious afterthought is explained as “the fore thinker,” is originally the sanskrit pramantha and means “twirler” or “fire-stick,” being the rod of hard wood which produced fire by rapid rotation in a piece of soft wood.&lt;p&gt;We cannot deny that the myth must have been known also in Mesopotamia, the main center of civilization between India and Greece, and it becomes probable that the figure Sui-Jen has been derived from the same prototype as the Greek Prometheus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Pangu myths==
Pangu is also honored as the creator of the world in Buyei legend, but in addition, he is also honored as the ancestor of Buyei people.  According to the Buyei legend, Pangu became an expert in rice farming after creating the world, and subsequently married the daughter of the Dragon King, and that was the beginning of the Buyei people.  The daughter of the Dragon King and Pangu had a son named Xinheng but later, the son disrespected his mother, and the angry mother returned to heaven and never came down, despite the repeated pleas of her husband and son.  Pangu was forced to remarry and eventually died on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar and Xinheng's nightmare had begun.  The stepmother treated Xinheng badly and almost killed him, and the angry Xinheng threatened to destroy the rice harvest of his stepmother.  Realizing her mistake, the stepmother made peace with Xinheng and since then, on every sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, they paid their respect to Pangu.  The day became an important traditional Buyei holiday for ancestral worship.  This legend of creation is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes Buyei from Zhuang.

===Full syntax===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = 
 |priority         = 
 |attention        = 
 |needs-bite       =

}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Assessment tags===
* {{para|quality}} &amp;mdash; this supports all quality assessments defined in the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Assessment|Languages Assessment]] page.
* {{para|priority}} &amp;mdash; this supports all priority assessments defined in the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Assessment|Languages Assessment]] page.
* {{para|attention|yes}} &amp;mdash; use this sparingly on those pages most in need of work.
* {{para|needs-bite|yes}} &amp;mdash; used to mark those pages that are in need of a sound bite from a native speaker to demonstrate proper pronunciation.
* {{para|small|yes}} &amp;mdash; used to display a smaller banner that floats to the right.

===Task force-specific tags===
* {{para|french|yes}} &amp;mdash; assigns the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/French language task force|French language task force]] to the banner.
** {{para|french-priority}} &amp;mdash; allows an independent assignment of [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Assessment|priority]] for the French language task force; will be same as {{para|priority}} otherwise.
* {{para|german|yes}} &amp;mdash; assigns the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/German language task force|German language task force]] to the banner.
** {{para|german-priority}} &amp;mdash; allows an independent assignment of [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Assessment|priority]] for the German language task force; will be same as {{para|priority}} otherwise.
* {{para|spanish|yes}} &amp;mdash; assigns the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Spanish language task force|Spanish language task force]] to the banner.
** {{para|spanish-priority}} &amp;mdash; allows an independent assignment of [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/Assessment|priority]] for the Spanish language task force; will be same as {{para|priority}} otherwise.

==Examples==
===Generic without assessments===
This can be used on non-book pages and the page will automatically be assigned NB-priority and the quality classification will be assigned based on the namespace.  Placing it on a book page will mark the page as unassessed-quality and unknown-priority.
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = Project
 |priority         = NB
 |category=no
}}
===Generic with assessments===
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = FB
 |priority         = Top
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = FB
 |priority         = Top
 |category=no
}}

===Generic with task force===
It is preferable, for book pages, to use the tall version with parameters available to fill in, rather than the horizontal version, which is more suited to non-book pages.
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages|french=yes}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages|french=yes|category=no}}

===French language task force===
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = B
 |priority         = High
 |french           = yes
 |french-priority  = Top
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = B
 |priority         = High
 |french           = yes
 |french-priority  = Top
 |category=no
}}

===German language task force===
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = C
 |priority         = Mid
 |german           = yes
 |german-priority  = High
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = C
 |priority         = Mid
 |german           = yes
 |german-priority  = High
 |category=no
}}

===Spanish language task force===
&lt;pre&gt;{{WikiProject Languages
 |quality          = Start
 |priority         = Low
 |spanish          = yes
 |spanish-priority = Mid
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{WikiProject Languages

 |spanish          = yes

      <text xml:space="preserve">From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar Wikipedia]
A formal grammar (sometimes simply called a grammar) is a set of rules of a specific kind, for forming strings in a formal language. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever context —only their form.
 
In Irony, grammars are described using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form Backus-Naur]-like notation inside a C# (or VB.NET) class that inherits from Irony.Parsing.Grammar. This is a marked difference from most other language tools like lex and yacc.  The &quot;|&quot; and &quot;+&quot; operators have been overloaded so you can string together terminals to define productions. Afterward this class can be used to parse the language and along with other Irony features to interpret it.

To create a new grammar, just create a new class file and extend the base Grammar class found in Irony.Parsing.  Here, you can set all the tokens and productions for the language as well as other properties like the list of reserved words or whether or not to create an abstract syntax tree.

The Irony project contains many examples of how to do this as well as the Grammar Explorer project which lets you test your grammar.

Typical sections in the grammar file are as follows, but obviously you can structure it however you want:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Language properties and flags&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Terminals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Non Terminals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Productions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Registration of punctuation, operators, and keywords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <comment>Added standard pre-defined terminals (from source comments)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Terminals are the tokens identified by a scanner and passed to the parser.  Irony provides a handful of key terminals that are found in almost every programming language (comments, identifiers, string literals, etc.).

=== Standard terminals ===
These terminals are already defined in the Grammar base class:

'''Empty'''

Used to identify an optional element in a non terminal:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
term.Rule = term1 | Empty;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Eof'''

Identifies end of file (using Eof in grammar rules is optional, the Parser automatically adds this symbol as a lookahead to Root non terminal

'''LineStartTerminal'''

Used for error tokens

'''SyntaxError'''

Used for error tokens

The following are used in indent-sensitive languages like Python. They are not produced by scanner but are produced by CodeOutlineFilter after scanning and before parsing:

'''NewLine'''

'''Indent'''

Indicates an indentation

'''Dedent'''

Indicates the end of an indentation

'''Eos'''

End-of-Statement terminal - used in indentation-sensitive language to signal end-of-statement.
It is not always synced with CRLF chars, and CodeOutlineFilter carefully produces Eos tokens (as well as Indent and Dedent) based on line/col information in incoming content tokens.


=== CommentTerminal ===
The comment terminal allows you to easily declare what defines a comment in your language.  Most languages provide at least a line comment, but lots of others allow the concept of a block comment.

To set up either type of comment terminal, just declare a new CommentTerminal type and set the start and end characters.

Example Line Comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
CommentTerminal LINE_COMMENT = new CommentTerminal(&quot;LINE_COMMENT&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\r\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Example Block Comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
CommentTerminal BLOCK_COMMENT = new CommentTerminal(&quot;BLOCK_COMMENT&quot;, &quot;/*&quot;, &quot;*/&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want the scanner to basically ignore your comment terminals so they don't show up in your parse tree etc., then add them to the non grammar terminal list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
NonGrammarTerminals.Add(BLOCK_COMMENT);
NonGrammarTerminals.Add(LINE_COMMENT);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== ConstantTerminal ===
Use this terminal to declare constants within your language like &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
ConstantTerminal CONSTANT = new ConstantTerminal(&quot;CONSTANT&quot;);
CONSTANT.Add(&quot;pi&quot;, Math.PI);
CONSTANT.Add(&quot;true&quot;, true);
CONSTANT.Add(&quot;false&quot;, false);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== DateLiteral ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
DataLiteralBase DATETIME = new DataLiteralBase(&quot;DATETIME&quot;, TypeCode.DateTime);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== IdentifierTerminal ===
The identifier terminal will identify those tokens in source code that represent variables expressed in the normal standard way (i.e. starts with an underscore or letter and contains only letters, numbers, and underscores) but can be configured to identify other non-standard methods of expressing variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
IdentifierTerminal IDENTIFIER = new IdentifierTerminal(&quot;IDENTIFIER&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== NumberLiteral ===
The built-in number literal terminal can identify numerous types of numbers from simple integers (e.g. 1) to decimals (e.g. 1.0) to numbers expressed in scientific notation (e.g. 1.1e2).

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
NumberLiteral NUMBER = new NumberLiteral(&quot;NUMBER&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== StringLiteral ===
Use this terminal to identify string literals; just set the start/end character(s).

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
StringLiteral STRING = new StringLiteral(&quot;STRING&quot;, &quot;\&quot;&quot;, StringOptions.IsTemplate);
&lt;/source&gt;

One of the useful properties of the StringLiteral terminal is its ability to treat a string as a template and resolve expressions embedded within like in Ruby.  Just set the IsTemplate option like above and then feed it a settings class to tell it how to find those expressions.  Your expression root (the non terminal used to resolve the embedded expressions) also needs to be added to the SnippetRoots list.

In this example, a new StringTemplateSettings is created where any expression surrounded by curly braces ({ and }) is treated as an expression (&quot;expression&quot; being the non terminal acting as the root expression):
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
StringTemplateSettings stringTemplateSettings = new StringTemplateSettings();
stringTemplateSettings.StartTag = &quot;{&quot;;
stringTemplateSettings.EndTag = &quot;}&quot;;
stringTemplateSettings.ExpressionRoot = expression;

this.SnippetRoots.Add(expression);

STRING.AstNodeConfig = stringTemplateSettings;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Keywords ===
Keyword terminals can be declared two ways: explicitly using the ToTerm method in a variable declaration or implicitly within production rules.

Explicit declaration of the keyword SELECT in SQL and then its use in the SELECT statement production:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
KeyTerm SELECT = ToTerm(&quot;select&quot;);

selectStatement.Rule = SELECT + optionalSelectArgs + FROM + ... + SEMICOLON;
&lt;/source&gt;

Implicit declaration inside a SELECT statement production in SQL:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
selectStatement.Rule = ToTerm(&quot;select&quot;) + optionalSelectArgs + ToTerm(&quot;from&quot;) + ... + ToTerm(&quot;;&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Operators ===
You define operators as terminals in the same way you would with keywords.  You define the associativity and precedence of those operators using the RegisterOperators method in the base Grammar class.

Example indicating associativity and precendence of simple binary operators:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
RegisterOperators(6, Associativity.Right, POW);
RegisterOperators(5, MULT, DIV);
RegisterOperators(4, PLUS, MINUS);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Punctuation ===
You can tell the scanner and parser what terminals are being used as punctuation in your language by using the MarkPunctuation method in the base Grammar class.  Typically, these are terminals like the left and right parentheses characters or curly braces characters.

Example indicating what terminals act as punctuation (LPAREN, RPAREN, LBRACE, and RBRACE assumed to be KeyTerm objects defined beforehand):
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MarkPunctuation(LPAREN, RPAREN, LBRACE, RBRACE);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Custom Terminals ===
You can create your own terminals if the built in ones don't fit your needs.  Just extend Irony.Parsing.Terminal and go from there.  You can also extend the built-in terminals if you need to make slight adjustments to them to fit your language if you can't do so by simply setting existing properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi

Great start! A few comments:
I suggest to provide Overview chapter with a few pages before you start with particular terminals.

1. Parsing process overview - BNF, grammar, parser, scanner concepts, different parsing algorithms, LALR(1) algorithm used in Irony. Different approaches to parser construction (traditional - code generation from grammar descirption- Lex/Yacc)

2. Irony parser construction - outline the process, how to define a grammar (transliterate from BNF), define language elements in grammar constructor, grammar rules, etc. Parsing process: source-&gt;tokens-&gt;ParseTree-&gt;AstTree (optional). Grammar Explorer - what's it used for. Have a look at my CodeProject article, it is outdated as for sample code, but it contains some introductory information like this 

3. Quick end-to-end sample. Or maybe overview of expression evaluator grammar.  

Specific comments

0. &quot;Terminals are the tokens..&quot; - this is a bit incorrect; Termianals are token recognizers, they are not tokens themselves, they produce tokens. It would help to provide an overview of the Terminal class, and its TryMatch, GetFirsts methods; some important properties like Priority, Precedence, Associativity

1. CommentTerminal - all comment terminals MUST be added to NonGrammarTerminals set, it is not a choice of developer. The reason is that comments are not mentioned explicitly anywhere in grammar rules, but Irony needs to know that they are there, so NonGrammarTerminals set is just for this purpose

2. Use &quot;var&quot; keyword in sample code when declaring variables; it is a good practice in .NET. Like
   var comment = new CommentTerminal(...); 

3. Use standard .NET practices in variable names; local variables should be camelCase, so use lineComment instead of LINE_COMMENT

4. Many of Irony standard terminals have extended config options, and they should be described in details (in the future). Considering this, I think it is better to have a separate page for each

5. Example in keyword terminal is a bit misleading:
selectStatement.Rule = ToTerm(&quot;select&quot;) + optionalSelectArgs + ToTerm(&quot;from&quot;) + ... + ToTerm(&quot;;&quot;);
The fact is - you don't need to use ToTerm here, you can use the literal directly; we should encourage this style - direct use of literals, so we should put this example first in this section

6. About Date literal;  DataLiteralBase - it is a base (abstract) class (&quot;Base&quot; indicates this) It should not be instantiated directly, only subclassed; it is base for two other classes. I did not make it abstract explicitly, but essentially it is. It is not created particularly for scanning dates. Both DsvLiteral and FixedLengthLiteral can be used to scan dates - along with other types

=Ruy Lopez, Riga Variation, Main Line=

White takes the knight on e4, sacrificing the exchange to remove black's pressure on the f2 square. Now black has two options to retake: with [[/11...Qxe4|11...Qxe4]] or [[/11...dxe4|11...dxe4]].

It turns out that 11...Qxe4, while possibly appealing because it attacks the a4 bishop, is an error. Moving the queen away lessens the pressure on the f2 square and leaves the h2 bishop hanging. White can counter the attack on his bishop with either 12. Nd4 (blocking the attack), or 12. Nc3 (defending the bishop).

Therefore, 11...dxe4 is the main line.

Black takes the rook with the pawn, correctly. Now white's next move is forced: [[/12. Qd8+|12. Qd8+]]. This is the only move white has that will divert the black queen from the attack. Note that [[/12. Qd8+/12...Qxd8|12...Qxd8]] is literally black's only legal move. White follows up thereafter with 13. Nxd8.

White's next move [[/13. Nxd8+|13. Nxd8+]] is likewise forced, completing the queen trade. There is a discovered check coming from the bishop, but nevertheless, white's knight will be hanging and black should take it next turn.

After all the active play, the dust is about to settle. Each side has a minor piece still in jeopardy. Black's best move here is to simply take the white knight, with [[/13...Kxd8|13...Kxd8]]. White will follow up by taking black's h2 bishop.

Black takes the hanging knight. White should reciprocate by moving [[/14. Kxh2|14. Kxh2]]. All other moves are inferior, as anything but Kxh2 or g3 will allow the bishop to get away. Moving g3 traps the bishop, but allows it to take another pawn before it dies.

White has taken the hanging bishop, and material balance has been restored. After the dust settles, white has a knight and bishop (and the bishop pair) for a rook and two pawns. 

Now, black must see to the protection of the weak f pawn and counter white's active light squared bishop. The move here is [[/14...Be6|14...Be6]]. This contains white's bishop, giving it nowhere to go without being taken. If white plays poorly, black may be able to trap the bishop as well. Other moves allow white's bishop to occupy the a2-g8 diagonal first.

Black plays 14...Be6, attempting to limit white's light squared bishop.

From this point, theory diverges sharply and many plausible continuations exist. The most commonly suggested of these are [[/15. c3|15. c3]], 15. Be3, and 15. Bf4.

The endgame is about equal, with some commentators giving a slight edge to white. Black has a rook and two pawns for white's bishop, knight and bishop pair. Black will usually try to trade off light squared bishops and a rook while white will try to preserve his material and the bishop pair. White's king will try to move forward and blockade black's kingside pawns and black will try to have his rooks infiltrate and undermine white's position.

Black often plays f5 at some point, and white often will reply with Bb3, f3 and g4, attempting to cut black's pawn chain. Black's king will usually head to the queenside (Kc8, Kb7) to support his pawns there.

Note that 15. Nc3 is to be avoided, as black can follow up with 15...c5! This boxes in white's light squared bishop, and black will play b5 and c4 to trap it. Down this line, white must surrender a minor piece for at most three pawns, which is thought to be advantageous for black.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Competitive priority: cost (alpha = 0.78) ==
=== Description ===

A common approach to measuring competitive priorities involves using a multiple item list and asking respondents to rate the relative importance of each priority. This scale was originally developed for use in the Boston University Manufacturing Futures Survey by Miller/Vollmann (1984) and was used by Boyer (1998). Boyer's values were later reported in Boyer/Pagell (2000). These measures have been employed in numerous studies and have been shown to have good reliability and been deemed valid as well by Ward et al. (1998).

=== Items ===

For your manufacturing plant, how important is the ability to

*reduce inventory
*increase capacity utilization
*reduce production costs
*increase labor productivity

(Likert scale ranging from 1 - not important, to 4 - very important, to 7 - absolutely critical)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advanced manufacturing technology: administrative (alpha = 0.79) ==
=== Description ===

Research has identified three broad categories of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT): design, manufacturing, and administrative. The measures presented here, based on the initial categorization of Adler (1988), have been used in a variety of research. These measures exist and continue to be used for several reasons. First, these measures have good psychometric properties. The items for each category tend to have very strong reliabilities that have been replicated across multiple studies. In addition there is strong evidence of construct validity because the measures converge and diverge as expected. However, measures such as these that tap the level of investment in a technology as being from low to high suffer from some shortcomings. In particular, the subjective nature of such likert scale items sacrifices a degree of specificity for greater generalizability.

=== Definition ===

Administrative AMTs are technologies such as electronic data interchange EDI that enable faster and cheaper communication both within an organization and across a supply chain.

=== Items ===

Indicate the amount of investment your manufacturing plant has in the following activities:

*Electronic mail
*Electronic data interchange (EDI)
*Office automation
*Knowledge-based systems
*Decision support systems
*Material requirements planning (MRP)
*Manufacturing resource planning (MRP II, including capacity requirements planning)
*Activity-based accounting systems

(Likert scale ranging from 1 - no investment, to 4 - moderate investment, to 7 - heavy investment)

In particular, the subjective nature of such likert scale items sacrifices a degree of specificity for greater generalizability.

=== Definition ===

Design-based AMTs are technologies such as CAD that reduce design cycle times and hence time to market. In addition to reducing design cycle times, these technologies also reduce design costs.

=== Items ===

Indicate the amount of investment your manufacturing plant has in the following activities:

*Computer-aided design (CAD)
*Computer-aided engineering (CAE)
*Computer-aided process planning (CAPP)

(Likert scale ranging from 1 - no investment, to 4 - moderate investment, to 7 - heavy investment)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advanced manufacturing technology: manufacturing (alpha = 0.74) ==
=== Description ===

Research has identified three broad categories of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT): design, manufacturing, and administrative. The measures presented here, based on the initial categorization of Adler (1988), have been used in a variety of research. These measures exist and continue to be used for several reasons. First, these measures have good psychometric properties. The items for each category tend to have very strong reliabilities that have been replicated across multiple studies. In addition there is strong evidence of construct validity because the measures converge and diverge as expected. However, measures such as these that tap the level of investment in a technology as being from low to high suffer from some shortcomings. In particular, the subjective nature of such likert scale items sacrifices a degree of specificity for greater generalizability.

=== Definition ===

Manufacturing AMTs are actual production technologies such as flexible manufacturing systems, computer numerical control, and group technology. These manufacturing technologies have been presented as a way to revolutionize the shop floor, to move from economies of scale to economies of scope.

=== Items ===

Indicate the amount of investment your manufacturing plant has in the following activities:

*Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)
*Robotics
*Real-time process control systems
*Group technology (GT)
*Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)
*Computerized numerical control machines (CNC)
*Automated material handling systems
*Environmental control systems
*Bar coding/automatic identification

(Likert scale ranging from 1 - no investment, to 4 - moderate investment, to 7 - heavy investment)

=== Comments ===

In general, particular attention needs to be paid to the measurement of performance. A review of the operationalization of organizational performance by Richard et al. (2009) highlights the limited effectiveness of commonly accepted measurement practices. Their article is strongly recommended for reading: [http://jom.sagepub.com/content/35/3/718.abstract Richard et al. (2009): Measuring Organizational Performance: Towards Methodological Best Practice.

==1. What are the characteristics of amphibians?==
Amphibians live half of their lives in water and half on land. They are cold-blooded vertebrates.  Amphibians are able to breathe through their skin, making them very sensitive to anything they come in contact with, including human hands. When observing amphibians, one should never touch them.  Amphibians have toes rather than claws.

==2. Name the two main orders of amphibia and tell how to distinguish between them.==
;Order Anura (frogs and toads): Adult frogs and toads are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed digits, protruding eyes and the absence of a tail. Most have a semi-aquatic lifestyle, but move easily on land by jumping or climbing. They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes; and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and develop in water. 

;Order Caudata (newts and salamanders): Cuadata have slender bodies, short legs, and long tails. The moist skin of the amphibians fits them to habitats either near water or under some protection on moist ground, usually in a forest. Some species are aquatic throughout life, some take to the water intermittently, and some are entirely terrestrial as adults. Salamanders superficially resemble lizards, but are easily distinguished by their lack of scales. They are capable of regenerating lost limbs.

==3. Distinguish between toads and frogs.==
The use of the common names &quot;frog&quot; and &quot;toad&quot; has no taxonomic justification. From a taxonomic perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered &quot;true toads&quot;. The use of the term &quot;frog&quot; in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic with smooth or moist skins, and the term &quot;toad&quot; generally refers to species that tend to be terrestrial with dry, warty skin. An exception is the Fire-bellied toad (''Bombina bombina''): while its skin is slightly warty, it prefers a watery habitat.

==4. How do amphibians protect themselves?==
The first line of defense for amphibians is to not be seen by a potential predator.  The small size and coloration of many species help in this regard, but sometimes, rather than blending in, frogs are very brightly colored.  The coloration in this case serves as a warning, for these frogs are poisonous.

Many frogs contain mild toxins that make them distasteful to potential predators. For example, all toads have large poison glands—the parotid glands—located behind the eyes on the top of the head. Some frogs, such as some poison dart frogs, are especially toxic.

Salamanders have the ability to detach their tails at will.  When a predator captures a salamander by the tail, the salamander detaches its tail and escapes.  The tail ''regenerates'' or grows back.

==5. Make a list of amphibians that should be found in your locality. Identify five and tell where you found them. OR Collect pictures or sketch five different amphibians which you can identify and tell where they are found.==

{{Species id
| latin_name=Gymnophiona
| common_name=Caecilians
| image =Dermophis mexicanus.jpg
| range =Caecilians are found in wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia, India and Sri Lanka, parts of East and West Africa, the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean and in northern and eastern South America.
| description=Caecilians completely lack limbs, making the smaller species resemble worms, while the larger species with lengths up to {{units|1.5 meters |5 feet}} resemble snakes. The tail is short or absent.  They have a strong skull, with a pointed snout used to force their way through soil or mud.[2] In most species, the number of bones in the skull are reduced and fused together, and the mouth is recessed under the head. Owing to their underground life, the eyes are small and covered by skin for protection, which has led to the misconception that they are blind. This is not strictly true, although their sight is limited to simple dark-light perception. All caecilians possess a pair of tentacles, located between their eyes and nostrils. These are probably used for a second olfactory capability, in addition to the normal sense of smell based in the nose.

{{Species id
| latin_name = Rana catesbeianus
| common_name = Bullfrog
| image = Bullfrog - natures pics.jpg
| range = The American Bull Frog is native to North America. They are found in the United States, Canada and Mexico, east of the Rocky Mountains, but have been introduced to many other localities throughout the world. In Europe and the western U.S., measures are often taken to control its spread because it competes with, and often drives out, native species.
|description = The bull frog is a large species that has many similarities to its 'sister species' of toad, and can grow to a length of 6 inches (15 cm) with a weight of up to 1.5 lb (750 g). Females are typically larger than males. They are generally varying shades of green or brown, with dark brown, dark green, or black blotching and a yellow or white underside.  Bull frogs are carnivorous and will consume almost anything that fits into their mouth which they can overpower, including insects, small mammals, fish, snakes, and even other frogs. They tend to eat more dragonflies than flies.  The adult frog can live up to 13 years.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Bufo americanus
| common_name = American Toad
| image = Bufo americanusPCCA20060417-3352B.jpg
| range = The American toad is a common species of toad found throughout the eastern United States and Canada.
|description = The American toad is a medium sized toad usually found in the range from 2 to over 3 1/2 inches. The color and pattern is somewhat variable. The Eastern American toad has spots that contain only one to two warts. It also has enlarged warts on the tibia or lower leg below the knee. While the belly is usually spotted, it is generally more so on the forward half (in some rare individuals there may be few or no spots).
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Hyla versicolor
| common_name = Grey Tree Frog
| image = Bufo 6759.jpg
| range = Grey tree frogs inhabit a wide range, and can be found in most of the eastern half of the United States, as far west as central Texas. They also range into Canada in the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, with an isolated population in New Brunswick.
| description = Grey tree frogs live primarily in trees, spending time in wooded areas, usually not far from a permanent water source. On rainy evenings they can often be found calling in or near shallow, temporary pools of water. They are nocturnal and insectivorous, consuming most any small arthropod they can catch. Mating occurs throughout the spring and summer months.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Hyla crucifer
| common_name = Spring Peeper
| image = H crucifer USGS.jpg
| range = There are two subspecies of the spring peeper, the northern (P. c. crucifer) and the southern spring peeper (P. c. bartramiana). The northern is similar to the southern except for a strong dark marking on the southern frog's belly. The southern spring peeper is limited to northern Florida and southern Georgia, while the northern can be found all over the east of the USA and eastern Canada.
| description = The spring peeper is a small frog, attaining an adult size between 0.75 and 1.5 inches (up to 40mm) long. They have a dark cross on their backs roughly in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;, though sometimes the marking may be indistinct. The color variations of the spring peeper are mostly tan, brown, olive green, or gray. Females are lighter-colored, while males are slightly smaller and usually have dark throats.  Spring peepers are nocturnal frogs, so they are mostly heard but not seen. And they are especially easy to hear due to their extremely loud mating call which gives them the name &quot;peeper&quot;.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Lithobates sylvaticus
| common_name = Wood Frog
| image = Rana sylvatica.jpg
| range = Wood Frogs are found from northern Georgia and in isolated colonies in the central highlands in the eastern to central parts of Alabama, up through the northeastern United States, and all the way across Canada into Alaska. It is the most widely distributed frog in Alaska. They can be found from southeastern Alaska to north of the Brooks Range.
| description = Wood Frog is the common name given to Lithobates sylvaticus, previously Rana sylvatica. They are the only frogs found north of the Arctic Circle. In winter, as much as 35-45% of the frog's body may freeze, and turn to ice. Ice crystals form beneath the skin and become interspersed among the body's skeletal muscles. During the freeze the frog's breathing, blood flow, and heartbeat cease. Freezing is made possible by specialized proteins, glucose and perhaps accumulation of urea, which prevent intracellular freezing and dehydration. Wood Frogs primarily breed in ephemeral pools rather than permanent water bodies such as ponds or lakes. Adults emerge from hibernation in early spring and migrate to nearby pools. There, males chorus (a quacking sound) and mating occurs.  Adult Wood Frogs spend summer months in moist woodlands, forested swamps, and bogs where they forage and maintain body moisture as surrounding environments dry out. Females' eggs are formed by late fall. By late fall or early winter, they leave forested swamps and travel to neighboring uplands to overwinter. Some may remain in moist areas to overwinter. They tend to hibernate in the upper organic layers of the soil, under leaf litter, and in close proximity to breeding pools.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Rana
| common_name = Leopard Frog
| image = Green-leopard-frog-in-swamp.jpg
| range = Once abundant in North America and Canada, their population has declined in recent years because of pollution and deforestation. Leopard frogs are often used as environmental indicator species because of their heightened sensitivity to chemical pollutants found in the air and water.
| description = Leopard frogs, which are also called meadow frogs and grass frogs, are a collection of so-called true frog within the genus Rana. They are commonly used as dissection specimens in biology classrooms.  Leopard frogs are recognized by their green or brown coloration with distinct light-edged dark spots across the back and white underside. They also have a characteristic line of raised glandular skin extending from each eye to the groin.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Pseudacris regilla
| common_name =Pacific Chorus Frog
| image = Pseudacris regilla.png
| range = The Pacific Chorus Frog, formerly the Pacific Tree Frog (Hyla regilla) is a species of chorus frog native to the pacific coast of North America from Baja California in Mexico, through the states of California, Oregon, Washington (it is the Washington state frog), and into Canada and extreme southern Alaska. It ranges east into Nevada and Idaho. 
| description = This is probably the most commonly heard and encountered frog in California and its call is often heard as a nighttime background sound in Hollywood movies. The Pacific tree frog can reach up to about 5 cm in length. The males are often smaller than the females. These frogs can have highly variable color on their bodies anywhere from gray, brown, tan or bright green and can even change between them. They are usually a pale or white color on their bellies. They have many variations of markings on their back and sides that are usually dark and spotty. The one identifiable mark is a dark stripe that goes over the eye from the nose to the shoulder. Their skin is covered in small bumps. They have long legs compared to their bodies and they tend to be slender. Their toes are long and are only very slightly webbed. On the end of each toe, there is a round sticky pad that is used for climbing and sticking to surfaces.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Litoria caerulea
| common_name =Australian Green Tree Frog
| image = Caerulea3 crop.jpg
| range = The Australian Green Tree Frog, simply Green Tree Frog in Australia, White's Tree Frog, or Dumpy Tree Frog (Litoria caerulea) is a species of tree frog native to Australia and New Guinea, with introduced populations in New Zealand and the United States. 
| description = The Green Tree Frog can grow up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length. Its color depends on the temperature and color of the environment, ranging from brown to green; the ventral surface is white. The frog occasionally has small, white, irregularly shaped spots on its back, up to five millimeters in diameter, which increase in number with age.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Cryptobranchus alleganiensis
| common_name = Hellbender
| image = Cryptobranchus alleganiensis.jpg
| range = The range of the Eastern Hellbender (C. a. alleganiensis) in North America extends from southwestern and south central New York, west to southern Illinois, and south to extreme northeastern Mississippi and the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia. A disjunct population occurs in east-central Missouri. The Ozark Hellbender (C. a. bishopi) subspecies exists as a disjunct population in southeastern Missouri and adjacent northwest Arkansas.  Hellbenders are considered endangered in Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Ohio and rare or of &quot;special concern&quot; in Georgia, New York, North Carolina and Virginia.
|description = The Hellbender is a large aquatic salamander native to North America whose habitat includes large, swiftly flowing streams with rocky bottoms. Common names include the &quot;snot otter&quot; and &quot;devil dog.&quot;  Hellbenders have a flat body and head, with small eyes. Like all salamanders, they have short legs and thin bodies. Their tails, however, are especially keeled to help propel them through water. They have four toes on their front legs and five on their back ones.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Necturus maculosus
| common_name = Common Mudpuppy
| image = Necturus maculosus maculosus.jpg
| range = The Common Mudpuppy is a species of aquatic salamander found throughout the northeastern United States, and parts of Canada. 
|description = Mudpuppies prefer shallow water with lots of places to hide, but have been found at depths of up to 90 feet. The mating season is late autumn however eggs are not laid until late spring when 50 to 100 eggs are deposited in a nest cavity under a rock or other object. It takes 1 to 2 months for the eggs to hatch and 4 to 6 years for the young to reach maturity. Mudpuppies may live for up to 20 years. The common mudpuppy is nocturnal, but can be active in the day in muddy or weed-choked waters. It is carnivorous and feeds on fish, fish eggs, crayfish, insects, and molluscs.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Siren intermedia
| common_name = Lesser Siren
| image = Siren intermedia 2.jpg
| range = The Lesser Siren is found in the United States, primarily from Virginia to Florida, and west to Texas (ranging into northeastern Mexico as far as Vera Cruz), and north to Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.
|description = The Lesser Siren appears distinctly eel-like, with an elongated body, 7-26 inches (18-68 cm) in length. They have a pair of greatly reduced front legs, but no back legs. Their head is flattened and blunt with feather-like external gills on each side. They vary in color, from olive green to black, sometimes with darker colored speckling.  The Lesser Siren is nocturnal, spending its days hidden in the debris and mud at the bottom of slow moving bodies of water. They feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates, including various kinds of worms, snails, and crustaceans. They will also eat the tadpoles and eggs of other amphibians.
}}

{{Species id
| latin_name = Pseudobranchus striatus
| common_name = Northern Dwarf Siren
| image = P striatus USGS.jpg
| range = South-eastern United States
|description = The Northern Dwarf Sirenis a salamander lacking hind legs.  It retains its gills into adulthood.

==6. Describe the life history of some amphibian.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Life cycle of a frog}}

==7. Explain the economic value of amphibians.==
Amphibians are insect eaters, so they are very valuable for controlling mosquito populations.  They are also the preferred dinner for several mammal, bird, fish, and reptile species.

Amphibians are valuable for medical research.  They are raised and sold to research institutions.  

The larvae of newts and salamanders are sold as fish bait.

Amphibians are closely monitored by ecologists, because they are among the first animals affected by environmental problems such as pollution and the destruction of the ozone layer.

==8. Where do toads spend the winter or dry season? ==
Toads burrow below the frost line and hibernate for the winter.  Plant matter actually generates a bit of heat as it decays, so toads prefer areas with plenty of leaf litter and fallen logs.

==9. Identify two species of frogs by their sound or imitate the sounds of two different species of frogs.==
Here are the calls of three frogs.

For more frog calls, [http://www.folkways.si.edu/search/AlbumDetails.aspx?ID=2421# Smithsonian Folkways Recordings] has several frog calls available on CD or for download.

==10. How do frogs and toads sing? What makes the noise so loud?==
Frogs call by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth that bulge out during the amplification of the call.

Some frogs lack vocal sacs, but these species can still produce a loud call. Their mouths are enlarged and dome-shaped, acting as a resonance chamber that amplifies their call.  The body of a guitar does much the same thing, having a large hollow section that causes the sound to resonate inside before escaping to the outside atmosphere.

==11. Do one of the following:== 
;IMPORTANT: In the 1990's, amphibian populations in the United States and Canada began a precipitous and mysterious decline.  Many frogs were discovered in Minnesota with unexplained deformities, including extra limbs, missing limbs, deformed limbs, and missing eyes.  As a result, many species of amphibians are now protected by state and federal laws.  When observing wild amphibians, it is extremely important that they not be handled.  Doing so can spread disease to these creatures, causing further decline.  Before venturing out, make sure your Pathfinders understand and appreciate the danger facing amphibians today.  Do not allow your group to capture or otherwise harass them, and do not destroy their environment.  Rather than pursuing the two options (a and b) listed for this requirement, it may be wiser to substitute an alternate requirement.  One possibility is to have your Pathfinders research the amphibian population crash.

===a. Observe a toad in your yard or neighborhood to find out.&lt;br&gt;(1) Where and when it sleeps,&lt;br&gt;(2) When it leaves its home for food,&lt;br&gt;(3) How fast it can travel,&lt;br&gt;(4) How far it can jump, and as many other interesting things as you can find out about it, and write an essay covering the details requested in the first section of this question.===
It is recommended that instead of investigating wild amphibians, the student should research them using other available resources, including the Internet, books, and encyclopedias.  It is recognized that observing them in the wild is by far more fascinating, but it also carries the potential to do great harm to the amphibian population.  See the notes in section b for more details.

===b. Hatch some amphibian eggs and watch them through their growth cycle and write an essay covering the details.===
Frog eggs can be purchased from http://www.nilesbio.com/subcat367.html - but only in the spring.  

According to  [http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/terrestrial/amphibians/mknutson_5003869_field_guide.html Field Guide of Amphibian Larvae and Eggs of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa], a publication of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), ''&quot;State and federal laws protect amphibians from exploitation. Collection permits are required from the appropriate state or federal authorities before capturing, handling, or collecting amphibians.&quot;''

It is therefore recommended that you not attempt to collect amphibian eggs on your own.  You can download this book as a PDF from the page cited above.  Even if you do not live in Minnesota, Wisconsin, or Iowa, the species covered in this book may be indigenous to your area.

The USGS publication further states, ''&quot;To prevent the spread of disease to native populations, any frogs or salamanders you raise should not be released back into the environment. Lab-raised amphibians can be anesthetized and euthanized with benzocaine or tricaine methanesulfonate (MS 222, Green 2001). If you anticipate difficulty complying with this guidance, you should not undertake raising larvae in captivity.&quot;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think a better pattern here would be to move the FLWOR to the recurse() function, and let main() just do the typeswitch.  One of the most helpful articles on typeswitch is MarkLogic's [http://developer.marklogic.com/pubs/4.1/books/dev_guide.pdf application developer guide] (see Chapter 8, &quot;Transforming XML Structures With a Recursive typeswitch Expression&quot;).  Instead of main() and recurse(), the functions there are called dispatch() and passthru().  Function names aside, I think the FLWOR rightly belongs outside of the typeswitch.

I think there are a number of misleading statements on this page. (It's also very confused about whether it's trying to be even-handed or not.)

Firstly, it's true (there is evidence) that the learning curve for XSLT is longer than for XQuery. This isn't surprising, as XSLT is a larger language. However, the evidence from those who have taught XSLT is that the main reason for this is that the rule-based approach to writing transformations is unfamiliar to most users. Yet this page is advocating a similar rule-based approach to transformation using XQuery, which does not have built-in language support for the feature. If you have to learn this coding pattern anyway, might it not be true that the benefits of XQuery in terms of learning curve disappear?

As for using XML syntax, it's true that many new users (especially those from a programming rather than authoring background) find this off-putting, but it's not true that it makes XSLT language harder to learn or that it reduces productivity. And it's not true that the feature of using XSLT to transform XSLT is &quot;not wildly used&quot; [sic]. It's used in nearly every non-trivial application of XSLT that I have seen. (By non-trivial, I mean an application that uses more than about 20 stylesheets).

The statement &quot;In the face of these realizations and a number of new use cases, the W3C created a second language&quot; is historical revisionism. The original group that created XQuery started work before XSLT was published, and for the first couple of years of their work they were largely unaware of XSLT; they were not interested in it because their aim was to create a database query language, and XSLT was not billed as such.

In comparing XSLTs template rules to what can be achieved with typeswitch, a key feature of template rules has been forgotten. This is that template rules can be overridden by more selective template rules using the notions of priority and precedence. Customizing a library of template rules by overriding selected rules is key to reuse with XSLT, and XQuery has no equivalent (at least, until higher-order functions appear in XQuery 3.0).

@Michael Kay:  Thank you for your critique here.  I agree with your points about the article's internal editorial confusion - I've completed an edit designed to impose editorial balance, while more clearly stating what proponents of the typeswitch method have found to be the advantages of an XQuery approach.  More edits will hopefully come - including addressing self-transformation, priority, and precedence more rigorously.

 &lt;td&gt;Two forces, one of 300 N and the other of 200 N, act at a point on a body, and are perpendicular to each other. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Construct (on paper or using software) the vector representing the sum of the two forces.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Construct the vector representing the sum of the two forces in Exercise 1 when the forces form an angle of &lt;math&gt;45^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;with each other.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Two forces, one of 100 Newtons and one of 175 Newtons, act at a point on a body, and form an angle of &lt;math&gt;60^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;with each other. Construct the vector that represents the resultant of the two forces.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt; 

deepcopy would have come handy in exercises you didn't have to solve regarding object reference, thus no answer is excpected here.
