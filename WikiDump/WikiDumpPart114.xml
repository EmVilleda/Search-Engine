      <comment>/* Verb formation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the curious things about Finnish is that there are essentially two parallel languages. There is the spoken language or '''puhekieli''' which follows one set of grammar rules and rules for sentence construction, and a related but different language called '''kirjakieli''' used only in formal written settings such as books, magazines, letters, and in certain formal spoken settings such as in formal speeches, and semi official communication media such as news broadcasts.

The Finn begins life imbibing the rules of ''spoken language'' from parents, grandparents and siblings which happens quite naturally and ''without formal education''. He or she will have been exposed through books to the more formal ''written language'' through books, though until the age of learning to read aloud and write, this will not have been a generative process. From the age of about seven right through to late teen, native Finns have to be taught the rules and contructions of the ''written language''. This happens at school in lessons called '''äidinkieli''' or ''mother tongue'' (which is 'an ironically bad name given that most children will only have ever heard their mothers using ''puhekieli'' and that in äidinkeli lessons usually try to &lt;u&gt;prevent&lt;/u&gt; children from using in their written work, the language they actually learnt from their mothers (which was '''puhelkieli''') and teach them how to use '''kirjakieli'''. This takes years. Finnish kids spend hours each week in formal lessons from the age of seven through through to their late teens in formal lessons learning how to use the written language. 

For some reason which is not entirely clear, foreigners learn the language in the reverse sequence. Formal lessons begin teaching only the formal written language and not the spoken language. This may be because Finns have spent hours and hours learning this language form and decide to put the foreigner through the same torture. A kinder explanation is that both forms are valid and that teachers regard it better to teach the formal language (which is more regular and rule bound). The sad truth is though, that the native speaker regards puhekieli as quite easy to learn (because he or she learned it so easily as a child). Foreigners are frequently left to struggle on their own without formal assistance to learn the spoken language, and then only after they have learned the written language. Teaching the formal language first may help the really keen foreigner who is eager to write books in Finnish, write to newspapers, and understand official communications from government and private companies. But sadly this makes very little sense because he or she is left unable to understand people in everyday situations such as shops, hotels and restaurants, and Finnish movies and t.v. drama programmes remain completely incomprehensible. When seeking employment, a foreigner who has had instruction in the '''written language''' is able to answer questions (because Finns of course understand both forms of the language, even though it is odd to hear people speaking in the written language) but many foreigner fail before this because they did not even understand the question (because it is delivered in ''spoken language'' which he or she has not been taught. It is little wonder that most foreigners only get the lowest paid jobs and many remain unemployed. 

Spoken Finnish has its own grammar rules which are in some ways similar to, but in other ways different from the forms used in the formal written language. Spoken language has different rules for verb formation, and there many audible differences in the formation of words. Unless the learner of Finnish gets to hear spoken language or see it written down (which is quite rare) then he or she will only ever use the formal language and he will actually sound somewhat &quot;odd&quot; to the native speaker and may have great difficulty in understanding others who will be speaking a different language to the one that he learned in the language classes or read in his Finnish language teaching texts. He will be understood, but it is not natural to hear people speaking in the formal language and therefore the foreigner always stands out from the crowd.

There is nowadays a great informalilty in written communication between persons in the form of emails, cell phone texting and real time internet in which use of the everyday puhekieli is acceptable and even quite normal. However, in formal writing situations, such as customer communication, letter writing, most advertising, magazines, school examinations, puhekieli is not used and only the formal language is used.

This section aims to teach the informal spoken language and and how it compares with the formal language.

== Verb formation ==

== Verb formation ==

Verbs are formed slightly differently in '''puhekieli'''. The first main differences are that the first person plural forms are generally in the passive form seen in the written language, i.e. &quot;Me mennään kahville&quot; (&quot;Let's get some coffee.&quot; Literally, &quot;We go to coffee&quot;). The second main difference is that sounds [[wikt:elide|elide]]. In other words, parts of words disappear; in other words, there are elements that are present in the formal language forms that are modified in the spoken language. Sometimes two separate words form a contraction. This happens to a lesser extend in the formal language but is extremely common in the spoken form. These modified words do not appear in most dictionaries so unless the foreigner sees how this happens he can become totally lost when listening to any conversation as he will have no tools with which to decipher what is being said.  

In this section we will see how the formal language and spoken languages differ and you will begin to get an idea of how to understand this everyday language better.

*'''Puhekieli'''
**Kirjakieli
***''English''
****comments, special notices and &lt;u&gt;highlighted differences&lt;/u&gt; and (optional text or spoken forms)

Let's look first at the OLLA verb ''to be''. This is somewhat irregular just like its counterpart in the written language.  Later we will look at some other verbs.

   |he ovat|| &lt;u&gt;'''ne&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;on'''&lt;/u&gt; '''||''They are''
|}

Notes to the above table

1. As in the formal language, the verb OLLA in the spoken language is also irregular so it is just necessary to learn the various personal forms. Note especially that whereas in the formal language it is not always necessary to give the the personla pronouns min', sinä, me, and te, in the spoken language these are almost always spoken and not ommitted. 

2. Note the very different verb form accompanying the third person plural (i.e. following '''me''' (''we''). The verb form is identical to the passive present tense and not the active present tense as seen in all the other forms. 

3. Note that in the formal language, the correct form for ''She'' is '''hän''' and that '''se''' is reserved as a pronoun for animals and inanimate objects.  In the spoken language  the form '''se''' is sometimes used in informal situations to talk about people. However, in formal situations (for example in job interviews) it is best to stick to '''hän'''. Finnish does not regard using '''se''' for a person as insulting, as it might in English.

4. Note the third person plural form uses either of the two possible plural forms '''ne''' or '''he''' for the pronoun (again, '''ne''' can refer to people in informal situations) but the verb form is the same as the singular form '''on''' (i.e. not '''ovat''').

5. In very formal written language (not shown), '''te''' is sometimes written with an initial capitalization (i.e. '''Te''')


And now the regular past tense (imperfect).

1. Note the use of the past passive form '''oltiin''' (which was '''ollaan''' in the present tense). Otherwise the shift from past to present tense in puhekieli is much the same as with the shift in kirjakieli.

2. As in the present tense the -vat ending is not used. The only difference between third person singular and plural is in the choice of pronoun, i.e. '''hän''' or '''se''' becomes '''he''' or '''ne'''. The verb part '''oli''' is the same in both singular and plural. 

And now the perfect tense

|}


Note

1. Note the active participle in pukekieli is '''ollu''' (ollut in kirjakieli) and that the passive shift in the 2nd person plural ''we'' form takes the passive particple form '''oltu'''.

2. Note also that whereas in the written language the plural of ollut is oleet, in the formation of plural verb forms the particple stays in the singular '''ollu'''.  


and in the pluperfect (pluskvamperfekti)

   |he olivat olleet|| '''ne &lt;u&gt;oli&lt;/u&gt; ollu''' or '''he &lt;u&gt;oli&lt;/u&gt; ollu'''||''They had been''
|}

Two main things to note here.

1. The final '''t''' in '''ollut''' in the written language elides in the spoken language and become '''ollu''' without the '''t'''. This happen to all the '''-nut -nyt -sut -syt -lut -rut''' particle endings in the spoken language 

2. The active voice in the spoken language for the '''me''' (= ''we'' or third person plural) uses the equivalent passive verb forms in all tenses, so '''olemme''' &gt; '''ollaan''', '''olleet''' &gt; '''ollu''', and '''olimme''' &gt; '''oltiin'''

== Negative verb formation ==

And now, here comes the way the negatives are formed


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center width=75% style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:maroon;&quot;
   |+ style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;|'''EI OLLA VERBI - kielteinen preesens''' (''Verb Not To Be  - Negative Present Tense)
|- 
   ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;| Written Language
   ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;| Spoken Language   
   ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;| English
|- 
   |  en (minä) ole||&lt;u&gt;'''emmä oo'''&lt;/u&gt; ||''I am not''
|-  
   |et (sinä) ole|| '''et sä oo'''||''You are not''
|-
   |hän ei ole|| '''ei se oo''' or '''hän ei oo'''||''She is not''
|- 
   |emme ole|| &lt;u&gt;'''me ei&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;olla'''&lt;/u&gt; ||''We are not''
|-  
   |ette ole||'''te ette oo'''||''You all are not'' (plural)&lt;br&gt;''You are not'' (formal singular)
|-   
   |he eivät ole|| '''ne ei oo''' or '''he ei oo'''||''They are not''
|}


Note the following

1. The verb form '''olla''' in '''me ei olla''' is the negative passive '''olla''' and not the dictionary form '''olla'''. This '''olla''' is formed by taking the passive form '''ollaan''' and dropping the final '''an''' which in this case just happens to be the same as the dictionary form. This will not always be the case. Take for example the verb '''ottaa''' (''to take''). In spoken language '''me otetaan''' means ''we (will) take'' or ''we are taking'' and in the negative this becomes '''me ei oteta''' or ''we won't take'' or ''we are not taking''. 

Reminder! The rule for forming the passive participle in the present tense depends on the verb type.  Verbs which in the dictionary form end with a &lt;u&gt;consonant&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;a single '''a''' or '''ä'''&lt;/u&gt; simply add ''''-an''' or '''-än''' to the dictonary form to male the passive,  and drops the ''-an'' or ''-än'' when forming the negative. For verbs of type 1 the ending added to the dictionary form is '''-taan''' or '''-tään''' ((e.g. '''sanoa''' &gt; '''sanotaan''' &gt; '''ei sanota'''), but if the penultimate letter is a or ä then the a or ä changes to e before adding the stem ending (so, '''ost&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;a''' &gt; '''ost&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;taan''' &gt; '''ei ost&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ta)'''.

2. The logical formation in spoken language of ''I am not'' would be ''en mä oo'' but in practice '''en''' and  '''mä''' fuse to form '''emmä'''.

3. Note that though '''emme''' is used in the formal written language the word ''emme'' is NOT used in the spoken language. The normal negative form used is ''me ei''.

|- 
   | emme olleet|| '''me ei oltu''' or '''ei me oltu'''||''We weren't''
|-  
   |ette olleet||'''te ette ollu''' or '''ette te &lt;u&gt;ollu&lt;/u&gt;'''||''You all weren't'' (plural)&lt;br&gt;''You weren't'' (formal singular)
|-   
   |he eivät olleet|| '''ne ei ollu''' or '''he ei &lt;u&gt;ollu&lt;/u&gt;'''||''They weren't''
|}


Note in the table above how in the formal language, the negative verb part is in the plural form '''olleet''' when the person is in the plural ''(we, you guys, they)'' but in the spoken language the negative verb part stays in the singular '''ollu'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of early-stage private equity available for business entrepreneurs.  Other than your personal funds, there are the following sources:

(1) Angels are wealthy individuals who invest in the early-stage of start-up companies.  The benefit of using angels for early-stage financing is that it is less complicated and generally requires less expense than venture capital financing.  However, there are downsides to using angels.  Often these individuals can only provide a one-time investment, which may require a greater number of investors to provide all of the needed financing and create an administrative burden.  Also, many times angels are not sophisticated investors and may have unrealistic expectations regarding the return on the investment.  When financing is obtained from angels it is important for the entrepreneur to ensure that the angel is an “accredited investor” under securities laws.  

(2) Venture capital is a fund of pooled investments that is managed by a venture capitalist.  It generally becomes involved in the early stage of a company with the intent of growing the business, where a return on its investment will be realized through an eventual IPO or trade sale.  The benefits of venture capital are that the funds generally have enough resources to provide much of the company’s needed financing, and many venture capitalists can also provide assistance with general business issues, including formulating a business strategy, recruiting, and providing introductions into the business community.  However, the downside of using venture capital is that it requires shared equity, and many venture capitalists insist on also sharing control of the company (usually through representation on the board of directors).  This financing is generally not available to smaller start-up companies, as the venture capital funds generally desire to make investments upwards of $500,000 to $1,000,000.

      <comment>/* Active Angel Groups */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The following are sources for early stage companies to consider:

== '''Active Angel Groups''' ==

=== '''General''' ===

An active angel group consists of high net-worth individuals who join together to invest collectively in entrepreneurial firms.  The active angel group meets regularly (often monthly) to review business proposals.  Often entrepreneurs are asked to make presentations to the membership of the group.  If the active angel group decides to make an investment in a start-up business, the angels work together to conduct &quot;due diligence&quot; to validate the business plan, statements and history of the entrepreneurial team.

The members of active angel groups tend to be former entrepreneurs themselves and are attempting to make a return on their investment, but often are also trying to “give back” to their communities by spurring economic growth, which leads active angel groups to want to invest locally as opposed to nationally.

Some active angel groups are more likely to invest in firms that are recommended by people they trust; therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to network in the local community to gain a referral.  Examples of people to contact include: entrepreneurs who are backed by angels, attorneys who specialize in equity investments in start-up businesses, accountants and business counselors.

=== '''Process ''' ===
Active angel groups conduct several stages of review before making funding decisions.  While no two groups of active angels are alike, below is a general list of stages of review:

# Application/Business Plan
#* Angel group websites will contain information regarding the process to complete their application, which often requires submission the entrepreneur’s business plan.
# Pre-Screening
#* Once an application has been completed or a business plan has been submitted, the angel group will review it to determine if the potential investment opportunity meets the angel group’s general requirements and investment preferences.
# Screening
#*If an application is accepted for further review, the entrepreneur will often be asked to meet with a subset of the active angel group to allow the group to further understand the nature of the potential investment, receive more information regarding the business plan, and answer the angels' questions.
# Investment Meeting
#*If the angels in attendance at the Screening stage show interest in the entrepreneur's business, the entrepreneur will be invited to present in front of a meeting the entire active angel group.  The presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.  These types of investment meetings are usually held on a monthly basis.
# Due Diligence
#*If the entire angel group shows interest in the business, a period of due diligence will begin.  This due diligence will be conducted by those angels and specialists with knowledge of the specific industry under consideration.  The due diligence will be a thorough review of the entrepreneur’s business plan and business including the management team, marketing opportunities, a site visit, customer calls, and financially analysis.  This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.
# Term Sheet
#*If the angel group decides to invest in the entrepreneur, a term sheet for the investment will be negotiated.  This term sheet will guide the lawyers in preparing investment agreements and will determine the relationship between the angel group and the entrepreneur.

=== '''Examples''' ===
*[http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/ Angel Capital Association]: Association of angel groups that provides information and education for entrepreneurs on angel investing.

*[http://www.newvantagegroup.com/ New Vantage Group]: Angel group focusing on Mid-Atlantic region.

*[http://www.kauffman.org/ Kaufmann Foundation]: Provides advocacy and education for entrepreneurs.

I am curious to know what people think about including a portion on &quot;how to properly create a powerpoint.&quot; I think we have all sat through poorly made powerpoints, and I know there is a proper way to do one. What does everyone thing about including this???</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to manage all code-tables and selection lists in a consistent way across multiple applications.

Specifically:
* XML files that are exported to external sources should not use numeric codes that are not descriptive of the semantics of a category.
* Any codes that are passed as RESTful parameters should use URL-friendly codes (lowercase and dashes)
* All user views of codes should use &quot;labels&quot; that may be contextual to a specific language
* Role-based access should allow separate forms that only code-table administrators should have rights to modify

== Method ==
One of the most tedious and time consuming parts of developing many XRX applications is effective management of all of the code-tables within an XML applications.  Without a strategic framework to manage codes many projects bet bogged down with the details of inconsistent code-table management.

In general our approach is to treat code-tables and their own data sets.  A separate collection which is a child of the main application collection called &quot;code-tables&quot; is used to manage code tables for that application.

Small code-tables are usually stored in XML files with one file per entity.  These code table files store a list of all items for that code table including the labels, the value and the definition of that value.  According to ISO/IEC 11179 guidelines all code values, like data elements, should have definitions that are approved by a data governance process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
XRX applications need standards for viewing lists of items as well as HTML view of specific items.

== Method ==
One of the first functions of most web applications is to provide some way to browse and view data.  With XRX application we call these functions '''list-items''' and '''view-item'''.  These are generic XQuery scripts that are located in a '''views''' sub-collection of the main application collection.  View are by their name, read-only views of the XML data.

=== Listing Items ===
In general, the list-items function must show a brief summary of each record.  It is usually displayed in a table view with each column helping to identify a record and distinguish this record from other records.  The following are typical requirements of a list-items XQuery

* Display a single line representation of a record
* Display the records in a logical order
* Display columns that help identify the record
* Allow for pagination for large record sets
* Provide links to key per-record functions such as viewing the full record, edit or delete

== View Item ==

* The view-item query provides a read-only view to a specific record.  It required a parameter of the record identifier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Numbers ==

=== Computation ===
===== + =====
Returns the sum of nums. (+) returns 0.

&lt;code&gt;
(+ [] [x] [x y] [x y &amp; more])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
user=&gt; (map + [1 2 3] [1 1 2])
(2 3 5)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

===== - =====
If no ys are supplied, returns the negation of x, else subtracts the ys from x and returns the result.

&lt;code&gt;
(- [x] [x y] [x y &amp; more])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (- 1 2 3)
-4
user=&gt; (- -1)
1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
===== * =====
Returns the product of nums. (*) returns 1.

&lt;code&gt;
(* [] [x] [x y] [x y &amp; more])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (* 1 2 3 4)
24
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

===== / =====
If no denominators are supplied, returns 1/numerator, else returns numerator divided by all of the denominators.

&lt;code&gt;
(/ [x] [x y] [x y &amp; more])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (/ 1 4)
1/4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== inc ====
Returns a number one greater than num.

&lt;code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (inc 41) 
42
user=&gt; (inc 1/4)
5/4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (dec 99)
98
user=&gt; (map dec [2 3 4])
(1 2 3)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== min ====
Returns the least of the nums.

&lt;code&gt;

2
user=&gt; (quot 5 2)
2
user=&gt; (quot 6 2)
3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== rem ====
Remainder of dividing numerator by denominator.

&lt;code&gt;
(rem [num div])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (rem 5 2) 
1
user=&gt; (rem 4 2)
0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

true
user=&gt; (== (+ 1 2) 3 2.999)
false

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== -&gt; ====
This is the &quot;threading&quot; operator.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(macroexpand-1 '(-&gt; true (if &quot;clojure&quot;)))
=&gt;(if true &quot;clojure&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

this:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (-&gt; &quot;abc&quot; .toUpperCase ,, (.replace ,, &quot;B&quot; &quot;-&quot;))
&quot;A-C&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
is equivalent to:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (.replace (.toUpperCase &quot;abc&quot;) &quot;B&quot; &quot;-&quot;)
&quot;A-C&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

NOTE: you do not need to insert ',,', since clojure treats them like whitespace,
but marking the forms second position this way enhances readability.

However -&gt; works on everything
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (-&gt; true (if ,, inc dec) (map ,, [1 2 3]))
(2 3 4)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
or expanded
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  (map (if true inc dec) [1 2 3])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
So one can also use macros and normal functions in -&gt;,
i.e. non-methods.

Here is an example that should make every devoted Programmer fall in love with lisp,
if he compares it with equivalent Java code.
Reading the name of the first entry in a zip file:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (import '(java.net URL) '(java.util.zip ZipInputStream))
nil
user=&gt; (-&gt; &quot;http://clojure.googlecode.com/files/clojure_20081217.zip&quot; URL. .openStream ZipInputStream. .getNextEntry bean :name)
&quot;clojure/&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== cond ====
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
user=&gt; (cond false 1 true 2)
2
user=&gt; (cond nil 1 2 3)
3
&lt;/source&gt;

==== condp ====
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(let [a 5]
  (condp = a
    1 &quot;hi&quot;
    5 &quot;fun&quot;))
-&gt; &quot;fun&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The test expression (1 and 5 in the above example) is inserted as first parameter to the predicate function, the comparison expression (here a) as second. condp throws an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if no clauses are matched in the above example. condp also allows to add a single default expression after the clauses whose value will be returned if no clauses matches.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(let [a 7]
  (condp = a
    1 &quot;hi&quot;
    5 &quot;fun&quot;
    &quot;no match&quot;))
-&gt; &quot;no match&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (doc +)
-------------------------
clojure.core/+
([] [x] [x y] [x y &amp; more])
  Returns the sum of nums. (+) returns 0.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== find-doc ====
Prints documentation for any var whose documentation or name contains a match for applied argument (regex, string, pattern).
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (find-doc &quot;count&quot;)
-------------------------
clojure.core/assoc
([map key val] [map key val &amp; kvs])
  assoc[iate]. When applied to a map, returns a new map of the
    same (hashed/sorted) type, that contains the mapping of key(s) to
    val(s). When applied to a vector, returns a new vector that
    contains val at index. Note - index must be &lt;= (count vector).

====get====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (get {:a 1, :b 2} :a) 
 ;; ⇒ 1
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; also accepts an optional third argument which is returned if key is not found in map:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (get {:a 1, :b 2} :e 0) 
 ;; ⇒ 0

 ;;maps are functions of their keys (and keys likewise), they delegate to get:
 ({:a 1, :b 2, :c 3} :a) 
 ;; ⇒ 1
 (:b {:a 1, :b 2} 99)
 ;; ⇒ 2
&lt;/source&gt;

==== assoc-in ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def nested-structure { :level 0, 
         :nested1 { :level 1, 
           :nested2 { :level 2, 
             :final-data &quot;initial data&quot;}}}) 

 (assoc-in nested-structure [:nested1 :nested2 :final-data] &quot;new data&quot;)
 ;; ⇒ {:level 0, :nested1 {:nested2 {:level 2, :final-data &quot;new data&quot;}, :level 1}}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== merge ====
Combine two maps into a more massive map
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (merge {:a 1} {:b 2})
 ;; ⇒ {:a 1, :b 2})
 (merge-with + {:a 1} {:a 2, :b 3})
 ;; ⇒ {:a 3 :b 3}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using &lt;tt&gt;merge-with&lt;/tt&gt; ([http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/1.2.0/clojure.core/merge-with ClojureDocs]) you can specify what course of action to take for collisions, here we decide to join collisions into a [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/API_Examples#Sets|set using &lt;tt&gt;union&lt;/tt&gt;]] ([[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Cookbook#Sets|sets in the Cookbook]]):

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 ;; We have two maps with sets of normal users and malicious users
 ;; and we'll try merging them
 (use 'clojure.set)

 (def group1 {:normal #{&quot;Alice&quot; &quot;Bob&quot;} :malicious #{&quot;Eve&quot;}})
 (def group2 {:normal #{&quot;Spock&quot; &quot;Alice&quot;} :malicious #{&quot;Sauron&quot;}})

==== update-in ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def my-map {:a 1 :b 2}) 

 (update-in my-map [:a] #(- % 4))

&lt;/source&gt;

== Struct Maps ==
==== accessor ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (defstruct employee :name :id)    
 (def e (struct employee &quot;John&quot; 123))
 e
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;John&quot;, :id 123}

 (&quot;name&quot; e) ; FAIL: string not an accessor
 ;; ERROR ⇒ java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)

 (:name e)                                                         
 ;; ⇒ &quot;John&quot;

 (def employee-name (accessor employee :name))  ; bind accessor to e-name
 (employee-name e) ; use accessor
 ;; ⇒ &quot;John&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== assoc ====

==== struct ====

See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Clojure_Programming/Examples/API_Examples/Advanced_Data_Structures#struct-map struct-map] for more.

==== struct-map ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (defstruct employee :name :id)
 (struct employee &quot;Mr. X&quot; 10)
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. X&quot;, :id 10}
 (struct-map employee :id 20 :name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;)
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;, :id 20}
 (def a (struct-map employee :id 20 :name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;))
 (def b (struct employee &quot;Mr. X&quot; 10))

 ;; observe that :name and :id are accessors
 (:name a)     ; ⇒ &quot;Mr. Y&quot;
 (:id b)       ; ⇒ 10
 (b :id)       ; ⇒ 10
 (b :name)     ; ⇒ &quot;Mr. X&quot;

 (assoc a :name &quot;New Name&quot;)
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;New Name&quot;, :id 20}
 a                   ; note that 'a' is immutable and did not change
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;, :id 20}
 (def a1 (assoc a :name &quot;Another New Name&quot;)) ; bind to a1
  a1
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Another New Name&quot;, :id 20}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Array Maps ==

== Sets ==
==== union ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 #{1 2 2 3 \a 4 \a &quot;test&quot; &quot;test1&quot; &quot;test&quot;}
 ;; ⇒ #{1 \a 2 3 4 &quot;test&quot; &quot;test1&quot;}
 (clojure.set/union #{1 2 3} #{1 4 7})
 ;; ⇒ #{1 2 3 4 7}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== index ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (clojure.set/index [{:a 1 :b 2} {:a 1 :b 4}] [:a :b])
 ;; ⇒ {{:b 4, :a 1} #{{:a 1, :b 4}}, {:b 2, :a 1} #{{:a 1, :b 2}}}
 (clojure.set/index [{:a 1 :b 2} {:a 1 :b 4}] [:a])
 ;; ⇒ {{:a 1} #{{:a 1, :b 4} {:a 1, :b 2}}}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== select ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (clojure.set/select odd? #{1 2 3 4})
 ;; ⇒ #{1 3}
&lt;/source&gt;
==== project ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (clojure.set/project [{:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} {:a 4 :b 5 :c 6}] [:a :b])
 ;; ⇒ #{{:b 2, :a 1} {:b 5, :a 4}}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== join ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (clojure.set/join #{{:a 1 :b 2} {:a 3 :b 4}} #{{:c 5 :d 6} {:c 1 :d 8}} {:a :c})
 ;; ⇒ #{{:d 8, :c 1, :a 1, :b 2}}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Zippers ==
==== zipper ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (-&gt; (zip/vector-zip [[1 2] 3 [[4 5] 7 8]])
  zip/down
  zip/right
  zip/right
  zip/down
  zip/down
  zip/right
  (zip/edit inc)
  zip/root)
 ;; ⇒ [[1 2] 3 [[4 6] 7 8]] 
&lt;/source&gt;

A zipper is a way to modify a tree in a functional way- To do this conveniently, there needs to be a way for you to &quot;drill down&quot; a branch in the tree and perform a local edit, without having to tediously rebuild the upper areas of the tree again. In this example, the vector-zip function converts nested arrays into a zipper. Then we &quot;drill down&quot; the zipper with &quot;down&quot; and &quot;right&quot;. Once we've reached the node we want to edit, we do so with &quot;edit&quot;, in this case, incrementing the number. Then we can call &quot;root&quot; to convert the zipper back into nested arrays. Note that we were able to efficiently make a pinpoint change in the tree in a very elegant manner.

==== zipmap ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (zipmap '(\a \b \c) '(1 2 3))
 ;; ⇒ {\c 3, \b 2, \a 1}
 (let [ks [1 3 4]] (zipmap ks (map inc ks)))
 ;; ⇒ {4 5, 3 4, 1 2}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This handbook is intended to provide guidance on the process required to obtain a special certificate of airworthiness for aircraft in the amateur-built category in Canada. In a nut shell, it documents the documentation process. This is probably the least fun part of building a plane and the most difficult to follow.


__TOC__

== Who's In Charge? ==

In order to better understand all of the processes involved, it's good to get an understanding of where they all come from.

=== Transport Canada ===
It all starts with Transport Canada.  The following quotes are directly from the Transport Canada Web Site.

:&quot;Transport Canada is responsible for transportation policies and programs. It ensures that air, marine, road and rail transportation are safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible.&quot;

:&quot;Transport Canada reports to Parliament and Canadians through the minister of Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities&quot;

=== The Act and Regulations ===

Clearly Transport Canada is the Federal Department responsible for air transportation. Transport Canada gets its authority from the Aeronautics Act.  The [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/A-2/index.html &quot;Aeronautics Act&quot;], [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/A-2/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_4_9 Section 4.9] provides the Governor in Council with the ability to make regulations respecting aeronautics and in particular, respecting &quot;the design, manufacture, distribution, maintenance, approval, installation, inspection, registration, licensing, identification and certification of aeronautical products.&quot;

The [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/SOR-96-433/index.html &quot;Canadian Aviation Regulations&quot;] (CARs) are regulations created under the Aeronautics Act.  CAR [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/SOR-96-433/page-3.html#anchorbo-ga:s_500_01-gb:s_507_01 section 507.03] contains the provisions for the issuance of a &quot;Special Certificate of Airworthiness&quot; for amateur-built aircraft. In order to qualify for a Special Certificate of Airworthiness - Amateur-built, the aircraft must meet the criteria found in [http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/regserv/affairs/cars/part5/standards/standard507.htm &quot;Standard 507 - Flight Authority and Certification of Noise Compliance&quot;]. [http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/regserv/affairs/cars/part5/standards/a507sd.htm Appendix D of standard 507] contains the initial standard operating conditions for amateur-built aircraft.

[http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/regserv/affairs/cars/part5/549.htm Section 549.01 of the &quot;Canadian Aviation Regulations&quot;] contains the requirements for a person who intends to construct an aircraft and obtain a special certificate of airworthiness in the amateur-built category.

=== Exemption ===

Despite the above regulations, there is currently an [http://www.tc.gc.ca/aviation/applications/exemptions/docs/en/1963.htm exemption], issued by the Minister of Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities, which exempts a person applying for special certificate of airworthiness in the amateur-built classification from the requirements of CARs section 549.01 and Chapter 549 of the Airworthiness Manual.  The exemption includes an appendix A which lays out the standards of design and construction for amateur-built aircraft.  The contents of appendix A are similar to the contents of Chapter 549.

=== MD-RA Program ===

MD-RA is short for Minister's Delegate Recreational Aviation. What is this? The Aeronautics Act section 4.3 allows the Minister to authorized any person or class of persons to exercise any powers, duties or functions of the Minister under the Act.  There are some restrictions, but essentially, the Minister can delegate responsibility. An MD-RA Inspector is a person has been delegated by the Minister to perform inspections on aircraft under construction and, upon completion, issue the initial Special Certificate of Airworthiness and a restricted flight authority. MD-RA Inspection services has a website and co-ordinates the work of the MD-RA inspectors.

=== Website Links ===

:[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/air-menu.htm www.tc.gc.ca/eng/air-menu.htm]
:[http://www.md-ra.com/en www.md-ra.com/en]

== What Procedures Do We Follow? ==

The exemption from section 549.01 of the CARs and chapter 549 of the Airworthiness Manual - Airworthiness Standards - Amateur-built Aircraft defines the procedures that must be followed.

Appendix A Part I contains the following requirements:

* Inform the Minister of the intention to construct the aircraft.
* Identify himself or herself as the builder.
* Show that the aircraft design meets the requirements of this standard
* Confirm that the major portion of the aircraft will be constructed or assembled individually, as a unique project
* Have the aircraft inspected during construction so that enclosed areas that will not be accessible after final assembly can be inspected
* Have the aircraft inspected when it is fully assembled and equipped, but before the first flight, at the site of the planned test flight.

=== Letter of Intent ===

The first step before building is to file a letter of intent.  A blank Letter of Intent form can be obtained from the MD-RA website. 

On the letter of intent you fill in your personel information and the make, model and serial number for the aircraft.  Next you indicate the construction materials by checking off the appropriate boxes.

If you are building your own design or building only from plans you check the appropriate box.  If you are building a kit you need to indicate if the major portion of the aircraft (more than 50%) is fabricated from raw material and assembled by an individual or group of individuals.  This is a requirement of the [http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/regserv/affairs/cars/part5/standards/549/sub-a.htm#549.5 Airworthiness Manual Chapter 549 (549.5)].  Transport Canada maintains a [http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/maintenance/aarpe/recreational/amateur.htm link] on their website which points to the FAA [http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/ultralights/amateur_built/kit_listing/media/amateur_built_kit_listing.pdf list] of approved kits.

If your kit isn't listed the inspector will complete the [http://www.md-ra.com/pdfs/51_chklst.pdf 51% checklist] that is available from the MD-RA website while at your shop.  You must meet the major portion rule or your project cannot be registered as an amateur built aircraft.

If you have purchased the project from someone other than the original supplier of the kit or plans, you must provide a bill of sale or a release signed by the vendor giving the MD-RA permission to release information to the new purchaser.  Make sure the make, model and serial number a clearly indicated.

Finally, fill in the payment information and mail or fax the letter of intent to the MD-RA Inspection Service:

:MD-RA Inspection Service&lt;br&gt;
:2469 Aviation Lane,&lt;br&gt;
:London, ON  N5V 3Z9&lt;br&gt;

:phone: 519-457-2901 or 877-419-2111&lt;br&gt;
:fax: 519-457-0908 or 877-800-6362&lt;br&gt;

It may also be possible to email the a scan of the signed form to md-ra@md-ra.com but I would suggest calling them first.

You can now start work on your project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">['''Note''': the purpose of this story is to imaginatively connect into a narrative the many facts we have provided in the section on the Greeks. This should not be read as history, but as historical fiction. Our hope is that students reading it will more easily remember some of the details of Ancient Greek Theatre.]

Dionysus lifted his scrawny, baby-sized arm and declared,
&quot;Worship me here. In the clearing. I like it.&quot;
And so the people did. There were only a small number of followers in the beginning. Maybe 12. During this period, a local could see the small cluster of dionites roaming through the hills with a chubby dwarf clinging to their backs.  In a time before performance, the dionites worshiped the little Dionysus on street corners and nearby farms where there were lots of cattle. They were never quite audience-specific, but immensely grateful for anyone or thing that could shed a moment of its time for some praise.  Their worshiping usually consisted of singing, dancing, and a sucking on the flesh of the little dwarf god, Dionysus, for his pores secreted the finest wine.  Cast parties were rampant, but not without an adequate pigeage of the dwarf.  This, of course, could only be accomplished by putting Dionysus in a knee high wooden barrell, where the dionites would hike up their robes and stomp him in order to cull massive quantities of wine.  As attendees began to gain in size, street corners and fenced off cattle-yards would not suffice any longer.  The little Dionysus and his/her 12 apostles formed a production company, Agora &amp; Friends Stage Co.  The little Dionysus entitled himself as artistic director and the rest of the company members he called the chorus.  They all agreed unanimously, like they usually do, and at the same time.  For their first performance the AFSC chose a nice flat clearing for their large audience turnout.  

The chorus roamed the polis to find 28 other members that were identical in likeness, sexuality, and orientation in order to expand the experience of their worship that was already quite erect.  The original chorus members knew that this would please their little Dionysus greatly for he loves to be worshiped.  &quot;Worship me a lot. And give me lots of standing ovations and cast parties were the wine shall be milked from my flesh all night long. This is what I want and what you need to have good theater.&quot; said the little Dionysus.  

Once the chorus reached a whopping 40 identical members, they were inseparable.  They all grew to be very close friends who always walked together and gossiped heavily, frantically vocalizing on every bit of human tension they crossed in public. They were quite atmospheric. The chorus were notorious for holing up in city alley-ways awaiting passerby's and would often deploy random acts of pillage and evil, in short R.A.P.E. These raucous affairs were performed solely to accumulate patronage points with the chubby dwarf god Dionysus, whom usually attributed these massive celebrations with a monologue of some kind.  The field performances lasted for quite sometime. Audience members began to dwindle and the hecklers seemed to attended out of sport largely because no one took the ceremonies seriously.  

The dionites packed up their little chubby messiah and fled to the forests where they could find safety and peace for a clandestine production meeting.  &quot;Children! We must leave the plains.  They are not working for us. I don't know why. Decibilus, you are the sound designer. What is wrong with the sound, my child?&quot; asked little Dionysus. 

&quot;Well, my lord. Sound is strange. But it is good. We need sound. And we want the audience to want the sound as much as we do.&quot; said Decibilus.  

&quot;This is right young Decibilus! We want them to hear what we are saying about me.  How do we achieve this?&quot; asked Dionysus.  

&quot;Well, you see my lord. I don't know because sound design is kind of a new thing for me. I'd rather just suck the wine from your flesh.&quot; 

&quot;Of course you would! But no wine for you until we fix the sound.&quot;  

&quot;We could move to a hillside.&quot; said House Managus Maximus. 

&quot;Will this work Decilibus? If we change the seating area to that of a hillside?&quot; asked Dionysus.  

&quot;Well, uh. Yeah. Sure. Why not. What do you think Acousticus?&quot; 

&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; said Acousticus.  

And so they fled to the southern hillside of the acropolis and prepared for worship. At the base of the hill, Tekk Directus began constructing a large square platform to be built for the chorus to stand-on.  Scenus Designus took much offense to Tekk's aesthetic taste and demanded him to knock off the edges and form a circle.  Tekk Directus refused to do any modification unless Scenus Designus would agree to make a child with him on top of his platform. Scenus agreed and 9 months later, Orchestrus was born. 

Orchestrus was a wonderful dancer. She loved to join in with the members of the chorus for musical numbers and songs. When cast parties came along, however, Orchestrus was never invited because she got a little too drunk at her first cast party. Orchestrus insisted on singing karaoke and giving lap dances to all the actors in the company. One actor in particular that she fancied was Mattus Broderikus. Mattus Broderikus was the best dramatic actor around. He found Orchestrus' antics captivating. The next day, he asked her out and she gladly accepted. Unfortunately, the relationship only lasted a few months before Mattus found the woman of his dreams: Sarah Parkus. The break-up devastated Orchestrus, and she swore to never trust another actor again.  A few months later, she realized she was pregnant. Orchestrus gave birth to a little boy, named Skennus, after his grandparents. 

Now, Orchestrus demanded child support since Skennus was after all the son of Mattus, but as an actor Mattus was dirt poor and had to find other ways to help out with the child. So, instead of trying to supply funds he didn't have, Mattus agreed to look after the infant several days a week by taking him to work at the theater. But from birth the child was a hell raiser and constantly making all kinds of disrupting noises. After a while Mattus' fellow actors decided the child was too much of a distraction and that something needed to be done. Since Mattus could not go back on his word to watch Skennus, and since leaving the kid on a random street corner was frowned upon, he decided to enlist the help of Shoppicus Constructus to build a small hut like building where the child could be kept out of sight. But as every good parent knows, you must check in on your child. So every time someone needed to change masks or costumes they went into the shack to check on the child and make sure it was okay.

      <comment>/* Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The word psychotherapy comes from ancient Greek words psychē, meaning spirit or soul, and therapeia, to nurse or cure. Today, psychotherapy is a general term that refers to any of a range of techniques in which an intentional interpersonal dialogue is used to treat psychological distress or problems in living. Although some forms of psychotherapy are conducted in group settings, it is typically delivered in one-to-one sessions with a mental health provider. Provision of psychotherapy was initially restricted to psychiatrists but has evolved to now include diverse practitioners including psychologists, social workers, nurses, and counselors. Psychotherapeutic techniques are quite diverse but all are built around an experiential relationship through dialogue meant to enhance individual adaptation via healthier modes of communication and behavioral responses.

Over the years, psychotherapy and psychopharmacology have emerged as standard interventions to help patients overcome psychiatric illnesses. These treatment approaches can be used individually or in combination. Currently, substantial evidence confirms the efficacy of many psychotherapeutic modalities. Evidence is especially clear for time-limited therapies in the management of anxiety and mood disorders and also in promotion of health and sense of well-being in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and chronic medical problems. Therapeutic alliance and the skill of the therapist are the most important factors determining the outcome of any form of psychotherapy.

This chapter provides the medical student with a brief overview of key forms of psychotherapy. Given that a substantial literature in the field has accumulated over decades of research, this review provides only an overview of the therapeutic techniques. This chapter offers brief descriptions of the following subtypes of psychotherapy:

*Psychodynamic therapy
*Brief psychodynamic therapy
*Behavioral therapy
*Cognitive behavioral therapy
*Interpersonal therapy
*Dialectical behavior therapy
*Family therapy
*Couples therapy
*Supportive therapy
*Group therapy

== Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) ==

Psychodynamic therapy defined the practice of psychiatry in the first half of twentieth century. It evolved mainly from Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytical principles, with significant contributions from Anna Freud, Karl Jung, and Melanie Klein, among many others. The basic emphasis is on how early childhood experiences are vital in molding and establishing the psychological mechanisms which predominantly drive the unconscious. The aim of psychodynamic therapy is to identify, bring to notice, and reprocess repressed conflicts from previous experiences which are being unconsciously enacted in current interpersonal interactions leading to maladaptive patterns of behavior. PDT works best for mild to moderate problems in adjustment, as well as for depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders (1). Characteristics of patients who often do well with this form of therapy include those with psychological mindedness, motivation to get better, and the ability to trust and collaborate with therapists.                

PDT can be long-term (1-5 sessions/week for a number of years), intermittent, or brief (&lt;6 months in duration or 6-40 sessions in total). Irrespective of the duration, this form of therapy begins with a comprehensive assessment which lasts between 1-4 sessions. Apart from history taking, this phase involves explaining the process of therapy to the patient, and evaluating whether the patient has the ego-strength and is suitable to undergo PDT. Initial elements of transference and counter-transference (which are described soon herein) also may begin to emerge. Follow up sessions usually take place at a particular time every week. Therapeutic alliance is one of the most important factors determining the outcome of PDT. 

Exploration of the unconscious drive is done by free association and dream analysis. In free association, the patient is encouraged to speak whatever comes to his mind without inhibition or censorship. The therapist uses &quot;active listening&quot; and looks for patterns or references relating to current interpersonal and developmental conflicts which can help understand the unconscious process. Freud’s critical work on dreams has led to the use of dream analysis in understanding the unconscious. Freud called dreams as &quot;the royal road to the unconscious.&quot; He described dream work as the process by which a latent dream is converted to a manifest dream by symbolization, displacement and condensation. In dream analysis, the therapist tries to reverse this process and thereby, identify the latent components, which in turn, reveal the unconscious desire.

During the course of psychodynamic therapy, the processes of transference, counter-transference and resistance repeatedly occur which may indicate or lead to the underlying unconscious conflicts or desires. The therapist must be aware of and assess these phenomena in therapy. Transference is an emotion experienced by a patient towards the therapist which is based on experiences from previous relationships. Counter-transference is the emotion evoked in therapist towards the patient which is determined by his or her past experiences. The therapist’s efforts to understand transference helps in understanding how the past is continually re-enacted in present. Counter-transference is important to recognize as it might interfere with therapy. 

Resistance is the unconscious blocking of the therapeutic process. It can manifest in a number of ways such as showing up late for appointments, staying silent during sessions and avoiding talking about core issues. Defense mechanisms constitute the executive function of the ego and help reduce anxiety. They can be healthy or pathological. Key defenses include denial, projection, splitting, projective identification, undoing, isolation of affect, intellectualization, introjection, and repression. Suppression, sublimation and humor are identified as mature defense mechanisms. 

Therapists work with patients to identify and deal with transference, resistance, and defense mechanisms. Several strategies are used to achieve this such as making an observation, interpretation, clarification and validation. Therapy eventually guides the patient in reprocessing previous conflicts which, in turn, helps break the maladaptive behavior patterns of the present. As the goals of therapy are realized and the patient has consolidated the tools learnt to overcome conflicts and maladaptive behaviors, the termination phase of therapy begins, with the therapist setting a date to end sessions.

It is important for therapists to have their own therapy to understand their own contribution to the therapeutic process.  Good supervision and peer support are also vital tools.

Principles of psychodynamic therapy have revolutionized physician-patient interactions in all specialties. Even though in some respects it has fallen out of favor recently in comparison to briefer therapies, PDT still holds a unique position in psychotherapy and to a great extent underlies all the psychotherapies currently available.  Longer term outcome studies reveal that psychodynamic therapies may yield profound and permanent personality maturation.

== Brief Psychodynamic Therapy (BPT) ==

Alexander and French listed the benefits of time limited therapy using psychodynamic principles. In this era of emphasis on optimal resource utilization and cost-benefit analysis for interventions brief therapies have regained popularity. Such brief therapies may emphasize issues to do with cognitive, behavioral or psychodynamic (2). Similar to long-term psychodynamic therapy, BPT aims to identify and reprocess repressed conflicts from previous experiences which are being unconsciously enacted in the current interpersonal interactions and thus causing maladaptive patterns of behavior. However, BPT differs from long-term psychodynamic therapy in several aspects. 

The usual number of sessions in BPT varies from 12-40 and is usually completed in six months, following an initial comprehensive assessment that establishes a therapeutic alliance and identifies the major problem area (3). Using this as a template for future sessions, developmental conflicts, defense mechanisms, transference, counter-transference, and resistance are identified and reprocessed to promote a corrective emotional experience in therapy. Given a shorter duration of therapy, the therapist has a more active role compared to long-term psychodynamic therapy, which involves a substantial reliance on limited but sometimes pivotal interpretations. In BPT, the therapist uses challenge, confrontation, and anxiety-provoking techniques while guiding the patient towards conflict resolution (4). Considering such an active and often anxiety- provoking therapeutic work to achieve outcomes, it is important that patients in BPT are able to trust and work with the therapist and also can openly acknowledge emotional distress from an interpersonal viewpoint (5).

Several types of BPT have evolved based on drive, relational, and integrative (using both drive and relational) models. Examples include:

*Brief focal psychotherapy (Tavistock-Malan): This involves an average of 20 sessions focused on internal conflicts present since childhood and processing of transference reactions. The termination date is determined after a few sessions.
*Time limited psychotherapy (Boston University-Mann): This usually consists of 12 sessions focused on resolution of the chronic distress due to negative self-image.
*Short-term dynamic psychotherapy (McGill University-Davanloo): This entails a flexible approach over 5-25 sessions aimed at resolution of oedipal conflict. 
*Short-term anxiety provoking psychotherapy (Harvard University-Sifneos): This aims to resolve oedipal conflict via anxiety-provoking questions and confrontation.

Clinical applications: BPT has been shown to be effective for a variety of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients with depressive and eating disorders of mild-moderate severity also benefit from this therapeutic approach. Well-designed research studies are needed in the future to assess its long-term efficacy (6).

== Behavioral Therapy ==

Behavioral Therapy (BT) utilizes techniques derived from both Pavlov’s classical and Skinner’s operant conditioning. BT identifies maladaptive behaviors as the source of psychological distress and attempts to improve quality of life by altering and modifying these. BT works best for specific behavioral symptoms such as phobias and compulsions. 

Several subtypes of BT have been developed for use either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy or cognitive therapy for treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders:
 
a) Systemic desensitization: This technique, initially developed by Wolpe, is particularly helpful for phobic disorders with a clearly identifiable precipitating factor. In the initial phases, relaxation techniques including deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation are taught and practiced. A hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli is constructed with the help of the patient. For example, a person afraid of using an elevator would go through therapeutic steps of first imagining standing in front or riding the elevator, then on to seeing pictures of elevator, then going to a building with an elevator, standing in front of the elevator, and eventually taking the elevator. Therapy moves from the least anxiety- provoking stimulus to highest (7). The patient is first exposed to the least anxiety- provoking stimulus and then encouraged to use the relaxation techniques till the anxiety decreases. This phenomenon, called reciprocal inhibition, continues until the patient is habituated and no longer feels anxious in response to that particular stimulus. Once this is achieved, therapy will progress along the hierarchy to the next stimulus. This process is repeated until the patient is ready to move to the next step on the hierarchy.

b) Flooding/Implosion: This is based on the concept that escape or avoidance of an anxiety-causing situation (phobia) maintains the fear. Patients are exposed to anxiety- provoking stimulus (not graded exposure) either in vivo (flooding) or imaginary (implosion) and not allowed to leave till their anxiety subsides (habituation). Compared to systemic desensitization, flooding leads to severe anxiety initially and may not be tolerated very well by some patients.

c) Aversion therapy: This is based on a &quot;punishment model&quot; and used to treat substance abuse disorders and paraphilias. A maladaptive behavior is combined with aversive (noxious) stimulus to decrease the repetition of maladaptive behavior. An example of this is an individual with alcohol dependence is given disulfiram. The next time this individual drinks alcohol, he will experience adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, flushing and headache. Similar techniques have been used to treat paraphilias. Though aversive conditioning may be effective initially, there is skepticism about compliance and long term benefits.

d) Exposure and response prevention: This is a key technique to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (8). Patients are trained to refrain from performing rituals (compulsions) despite having increased anxiety stemming from obsessional thoughts, images or impulses (response prevention). For example, a patient whose obsessions involve fear of contamination is asked to touch various surfaces (exposure) but refrain from washing hands (response prevention). Over time, this helps to break the vicious cycle of compulsive acts in response to obsessions.

e) Token economy: This is commonly used in settings where children, adolescents, and patients with mental retardation are treated. Desired adaptive behaviors are reinforced with tokens such as stars or tickets. Tokens are accumulated and exchanged at the end of a specified time period for gifts such as snacks, toys, watching television, or playing video games. When maladaptive behaviors occur then there is a penalty with a certain number of tokens is taken away. What makes a behavior desired or maladaptive and the rewards/penalty associated with them are clearly communicated in advance to the patients. Hence this technique promotes acquisition of good behaviors and autonomy.

f) Modeling: A patient initially observes a peer or a therapist perform a desired behavior that is positively reinforced. This is followed by the patient imitating the behavior to also get rewarded for this enactment. This leads to learning adaptive behaviors. Modelling is also referred to as social learning.

g) Shaping: This involves gradual change from a learned response to a desired one. Shaping is brought about by positive reinforcement of successive approximations of desired behavior.

h) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): In CBT, behavioral techniques are used as an adjunct to cognitive strategies that reinforce learning. Examples include activity scheduling, graded task assignment, relaxation exercises, assertiveness training, thought record, coping cards, and biofeedback. Details of CBT are listed in the next section.

== Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ==

Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) was initially developed by Aaron T Beck for treatment of depressive disorders (9). Since then, CBT has gained widespread acceptance for managing anxiety disorders and has also been tailored to help patients with bipolar disorder, eating disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, and even psychotic disorders. CBT is a short term therapy with emphasis on collaborative relationship between therapist and patient. 

Theoretical background: Information processing utilizes cognitive representations also termed as core beliefs or schemas. These schemas and the resulting automatic thoughts influence emotions and behavior and help deal with a great number of stimuli that we are constantly being exposed to (10). Multiple factors at the biological, developmental, social levels contribute to the formation of schemas. 

Psychiatric disorders are characterized by dysfunctional schemae and maladaptive thoughts (cognitive distortions) that lead to abnormal affect and maladaptive behavioral patterns that reinforce core beliefs. Examples of dysfunctional core beliefs include Beck’s cognitive triad of pervasive negativity towards self, world, and the future as well as excessive fear of physical or psychological danger in anxiety disorders (11). Commonly seen cognitive distortions include over-generalizing, selective abstraction, minimization/ magnification, catastrophizing, and dichotomous thinking. CBT aims to empower patients with the ability to become aware of and change these maladaptive core beliefs and cognitive distortions.

CBT does not claim this model is the causal factor of psychopathology and reiterates the importance of taking into account multiple etiological factors including biological, social stressors. The usefulness of pharmacotherapy in helping patients is also noted (13).

Outline of CBT Sessions: The total number of hourly sessions varies from 5-20, with an average number being 12-16. Patients with residual symptoms or recurrent illness may find &quot;booster&quot; sessions helpful to maintain response (14). The first few sessions are aimed at getting comprehensive history and identifying current problems. Based on the problems, an attempt is made to elicit, test, and modify maladaptive schemae and cognitive distortions. Formal joint agenda setting, homework, and feedback are important tools to reinforce learning, maintain focus, and move in the right direction. Socratic questioning, emotional state during sessions (15), imagery, and role play are useful in uncovering and dealing with cognitive distortions. Generation of alternatives, examining evidence, decatastrophizing, reattribution, thought recording, and cognitive rehearsal are some of the techniques used to modify schemae/cognitive distortions (16).

=== Thought Record ===

;Event
: What happened? What were you doing? Who was involved?	Automatic thought
: Note down the most important thoughts/images which troubled you during that time.
;Emotion
: Which feelings or emotions (sadness, anxiety, anger etc)
: Did you feel in that situation?
;Adaptive answer
: What is the evidence for the automatic thought? Are there any alternative explanations for the event?	Result
: Asses how much do you believe now in your automatic thoughts (0-100%) and in the intensity of your emotions (0-100%)

Clinical Applications: There is significant research supporting efficacy of CBT in depressive and anxiety disorders (17). CBT has also been shown to be effective for dysthymia and in combination with medications for major depressive disorder, panic disorder, OCD, and generalized anxiety disorder. CBT principles have been used for modifying overvalued ideas seen in eating disorder and for symptom recognition, relapse prevention, and medication adherence in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder.

== Interpersonal Therapy ==

Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a brief, time-limited therapy developed in the 1970s for the treatment of depression. This approach is based on the premise that depression is often closely intertwined with the patient’s interpersonal relationships. The goals of IPT include reduction in symptoms and enhancement of communication skills in significant relationships. IPT is thus unique in its focus on improving patient interpersonal relations and social functioning and, thereby, improving depressive symptoms. Over the years, IPT has gradually evolved to become one of the foremost treatment modalities for depression, apart from pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). IPT assumes the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms occurs in a social and interpersonal context and, further, that the onset, response to treatment, and outcomes are influenced by interpersonal relations between the patient and significant others. 

Historically, Harry Stack Sullivan’s interpersonal theory of emotions formed the basis of interpersonal therapy. Over the years, Klerman and Weissman became leading exponents of and researchers in the field. Techniques utilized by these authors focus on the goals of 1) changing communication, and 2) solving interpersonal problems to help improve interpersonal relationships to improve emotional well-being. In contrast to CBT, IPT focuses on changing relationship patterns (not on distortions in cognitions); furthermore, there is minimal focus on systematized homework assignments in IPT. Typically, IPT is time-limited and usually once-a-week, for 12 to 20 sessions. The approach taken by most IPT therapists is to identify one or two problem areas and correlate the interpersonal aspects of these issues with symptom formation and maintenance. IPT can be divided into three phases: the initial phase, the middle phase and the termination phase.

Initial Phase: This is focused on a confirmation of the diagnosis of depression and education about depressive symptoms. This is followed by understanding significant interpersonal relationships and, thereafter, identifying target problem areas. After confirming the suitability for IPT, the therapist introduces principles of IPT to the patient, conducts an interpersonal inventory, and establishes a working formulation in the interpersonal context. The patient is assigned a limited sick role’ to provide relief from performing the social role. The interpersonal formulation is based on one of four key interpersonal problem areas: grief, interpersonal deficits, interpersonal role disputes, or role transitions. 

Middle Phase: This largely involves therapy &quot;work.&quot; The therapist works with the patient to implement specific strategies related to one of the four problem areas. Furthermore, the therapist highlights how changes in patient interpersonal relationships relate to changes in symptomatology.
 
Termination Phase: Here the therapist discusses termination and encourages patients to understand and describe specific changes in their psychiatric symptoms, especially as they relate to improvements in the identified problem area. The therapist also assists the patient in consolidating gains, and helping him identify early warning signs of symptom recurrence.

== Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) ==

DBT evolved mainly from Marsha Linehan’s efforts to decrease chronic suicidal/self-injurious behavior in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) (18). DBT uses a combination of cognitive, behavioral, and supportive strategies along with acceptance and mindfulness principles. It aims at enhancing and expanding patient motivation as well as their capability to reduce dysfunctional behavior.

Theoretical background: Emotional vulnerability is dependent on biological factors such as temperament and impulse dyscontrol. In the presence of an invalidating environment (such as parental/caretaker neglect or abuse), emotional dysregulation may emerge which constitutes the core problem (19). In response to stress, these patients engage in maladaptive behaviors such as suicidal, self-injurious, or avoidance to escape from distressing emotions (20). Such a pattern is often reinforced and learned. DBT uses problem solving, validation, and dialectics to break this cycle and develop healthier ways to manage stress.

Initially while problem solving, behavioral analysis is used to identify the sequence of internal events (emotional state), external events (stimulus), and consequences associated with problem behavior. Several strategies such as cognitive modification, behavioral skills training, solution analysis, didactic approach, and insight development are used to break the maladaptive cycle. Validation is a process of non-judgmental, active listening with communication of acceptance of patient’s experiences.

Dialectical strategies underlie all the principles used in DBT and promote acceptance and change, flexibility with stability, and nurturing with challenging, to help patients overcome their limitations.

Outline of DBT Sessions: In the pretreatment stage, orientation is provided and informed consent and commitment to the program are obtained. The initial duration of ongoing DBT is usually one year (21). Priority is given to replace risky behaviors such as suicidal or self injurious behaviors with healthy alternatives.

DBT is delivered in four different settings: individual therapy, group skills training, telephone consultation, and therapist consultation. Patients individually meet for one hour every week with their primary therapist and review their treatment goals. This therapist is responsible for coordination of care across all the modes.

Group skills training uses a didactic approach and empowers patients with skills such as:

*Mindfulness to increase awareness and be in the present moment
*Emotional regulation to understand and accept emotions and thereby, reduce emotional vulnerability. 
*Interpersonal communication skills
*Self-management to promote realistic goal setting, dealing effectively with environmental factors and relapse prevention
An individual therapist is available for telephone consultation at all times for crisis intervention. If the primary therapist is not available, coverage is arranged. Furthermore, therapists meet once a week for consultation, peer supervision, and feedback about using DBT effectively.

Clinical Applications: Most of the DBT research has focused on treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT has been shown to be effective in reducing suicidal/self injurious behaviors, and number of hospitalizations (22).  Studies of the efficacy of DBT are ongoing in patients with substance abuse, eating disorders, and depression.

== Family Therapy ==

This focuses on the family system as a whole. Family therapy views the functionality of the system as a whole to decipher individual behavior patterns amid complex interactions within the family system. It assumes people are best understood as operating in systems and treatment must include all relevant parts of the system. While many clinicians view families as an important aspect of understanding individual illness and treatment; others view family disequilibrium as the core issue, with individual illness a result of or solution to such disharmony (23).

Von Bertalanffy’s concept of &quot;general systems theory&quot; introduced principles that provide an organismic approach to understanding biological beings. General systems theory applies to biological processes of considerable complexity since any living system must have boundaries in order to regulate its exchange with systems outside of itself. Over the years, general systems theory has been applied to the assessment of family systems and subsystems that also must have clear boundaries to stay functional. Further work by Minuchin helped define a continuum of families ranging from enmeshed (with permeable and diffuse boundaries) to disengaged (inappropriate rigid boundaries). Families with clear boundaries lie in the middle of this continuum and are considered the most functional. A significant related concept is that of &quot;Family homeostasis,&quot; by which as a system, the family unit attempts to maintain a relatively stable state; when subjected to an incongruent force, it tries to restore back to a state of pre-existing equilibrium (24). 

While conducting a comprehensive initial evaluation, a convenient tool used for family assessment is the three-generational genogram. Initially developed by Bowen, this genogram maps family relationships and provides a structure with which difficulties are explored by the therapist. During the initial phase of treatment, the therapist tries to better understand family strengths, preferred styles of thinking, contributory cultural issues, and the life cycle phase for the family. Furthermore, the therapist establishes and strengthens therapeutic relationships, defines goals of therapy, and switches focus from the individual to the family. The middle stage, where majority of therapy &quot;work&quot; happens, is an attempt to bring about change. This middle stage focuses on goals defined as primary. These goals could involve persistently inflexible patterns of family functioning, definition of family boundaries, or presentation of alternative modes of interacting for the family. The termination phase involves a review with the family of goals that  were or were not achieved. The original problems and alternatives suggested are revisited and often the sequences leading to the pathology are reconstructed. The therapist also acknowledges problems may arise in the future and suggests how the family might then use skills they learned to help solve any such future conflicts (25).

Therapists use other techniques to assist dysfunctional families. Reframing involves the therapist understanding the patient’s or family’s perspective or frame and countering this frame with another alternate view. Enactment involves the playing out of the family problems in the session. Boundary making is utilized to change the psychological distance between family members. Unbalancing techniques are used to change the hierarchical relationship of members of a family system or subsystem. Paradoxical techniques are occasionally used to make the family unit understand why a symptom is being maintained in their system (24, 25).

== Couples Therapy (CT) ==
Psychotherapists experienced in couples therapy can assist in a number of ways (24). Therapy can help couples perceive and appreciate differences in ongoing individual challenges and the struggles rotted in the relationship. The life history of each person in couples therapy is important as is the history of the relationship itself. Different values, assumptions, and expectations may not be intentional, much less, personal. Mundane concerns over children, careers, and life transitions often stir up misunderstandings, stress, and unnecessary stress between couples. Thus, couples in therapy may gain perspective, learn new skills, discuss struggles and resentments without rancor.  Couples’ issues often include intimacy, power, decision making, parenting, leisure activities, and miscommunication (24).
Outline of CT Sessions: Psychodynamic review of problems with either one or both partners can address misunderstandings that inevitably arise when two families unite formally in marriage or informally by way of sustained intimacy. In practical terms, both partners are usually seen together by two co-therapists at weekly to monthly intervals for an average of 6-10 sessions of 1-1½ hours. 
Clinical Applications: To resolve conflicts, couples must confide in a therapist to safely explore sources of and possible solutions to problems or failings in the relationship. Such exploration needs to be taken up in an open, understanding, reassuring manner in order for a couple’s relationship to heal and grow. One or both in a couple may harbor concerns that inhibit their acceptance of therapy. Unstated fears often persist that a psychotherapist will be judgmental or partisan. Similar fears that the therapy will drive the couple apart rather than draw them closer commonly occur. One partner may fear that a shameful or guilt-ridden secret will be uncovered. Stigma for having marital problems is a frequent anxiety. However, not only is seeking out help is a healthy sign of maturity and hope rather than insecurity, it can be the basis upon which a couple may renew trust, esteem, and conviviality (24).

== Supportive Therapy (ST) ==
Supportive psychotherapy is the most widely practiced form of individual psychotherapy today. As such, supportive psychotherapy is a general term for widely used techniques that improve, if not optimize, adaptation by way of directly addressing situational stress, such as chronic illness—mental or somatic—as well as acute stress as with bereavement. Supportive psychotherapy often spans a long term with brief contacts, although it can take a limited form of more extended sessions within a brief period (26). 
Outline of ST Sessions: The general framework of supportive psychotherapy include attention to indications and patient selection, treatment phases, session management, professional boundaries, as well as a wide range of issues in the therapeutic relationship, e.g., therapeutic alliance, transference, countertransference, and therapist self-disclosure. The synthetic nature of supportive psychotherapy can be conceptualized across four major areas (26):
*Establishment and maintenance positive therapeutic alliances
*Formulation of patient problems, i.e., how to come to a thorough understanding for patient evaluation and case formulation)
*Targeting realistic treatment goals for and with patients, i.e., help maintain or reestablish best possible levels of patient function in the face of limitations to do with personality, talent, and existential circumstances
*Fluency in expressions to patients, i.e., practical techniques of immediate and frequent use.
Clinical Applications:  Supportive psychotherapy is actually a continuum from merely supportive efforts such as a case manager may use, toward more expressive psychotherapy appropriate to the level of patient psychopathology and resilience. Supportive psychotherapy is especially pertinent for patients vulnerable to psychotic regression in the course of non-directive psychodynamic psychotherapy, or who have limited capacity to forge and sustain close relationships, or who are less skilled at verbalizing distress.  Regardless of the clientele, essential aspects of supportive therapy include close attention to and elicitation of expressed emotions as &quot;ventilation&quot; as well as possible insight. It also includes overt explanation and education by the therapist to assist patient understanding of themes, struggles, and conflicts in their lives in order to facilitate confidence that such difficulties can be overcome. Similarly, supportive psychotherapy can entail open expressions by the therapist that are intended to boost confidence or restore morale. Supportive psychotherapy also often includes counseling advice or direct recommendations about specific problems.

== Group Therapy (GT) ==
Every human being is raised in group environments. In fact, there are multiple groups interacting with any individual—families, schools, religious or social clubs, or work. Group psychotherapy can address inadequacies acquired in earlier group experiences from childhood through adolescence and beyond. In group therapy, patients join together with others to share problems or concerns, to better understand themselves and others, and to learn from and with others. It helps patients enhance interpersonal relationships and otherwise learn about themselves. It mobilizes feelings of isolation, depression or anxiety that the group and/or leader can help interpret so patients may make significant change and feel better about the quality of their lives (27). 
Outline of GT Sessions: For over 60 years, group therapy has been widely used as a standard treatment to help group members share and resolve problems of their own as well as those of their group peers. Group psychotherapy entails a small number of people (generally no more than eight or ten) who meet together regularly (most often weekly) under the guidance of one (or sometimes two) therapists (28). 
Clinical Applications: Supportive, behavioral, cognitive, and psychodynamic approaches arise in the course of group therapy. Most commonly, dynamic group therapy fosters a wide variety of transference relationships than is likely in individual therapy. Group therapy has given rise to a great many permutations that include more didactic or focused therapeutic themes. For example, anxiety management or social skills groups combine cognitive and behavioral techniques to treat specific problems common to all group members. Self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous frequently rely on techniques of group dynamic that also build a supportive and instructive milieu. Moreover, principles of group therapy and group dynamics underlie broader applications in other settings such as business consultation, schools management, and community organizations. 

== Patient Selection ==
No clear rules govern the referral of patients to particular modes of psychotherapy. Still, the suitability of particular patients for particular therapeutic techniques can be broadly outlined. Some basic principles of selection are: 
*Patients who are vulnerable to psychotic breakdown are unsuited to non-directive approaches
*Patients who have little capacity of making and sustaining relationships
*Patients who are less verbally able are also relatively unsuited to non-directive approaches. 
Psychotherapy can redress problems in prior critical learning periods. One such critical learning period is early childhood (about 2 to 5 years). Heinz Kohut emphasized that here, parents or other adults &quot;mirror the grandiose self&quot; of the child (28). This grandiosity derives from how children are (or should be) surrounded by praise and love with every minor achievement warmly applauded. However, as is all too clear in any psychiatric clinic, not every child had sufficient such tonic boosting to inure solid self-image.  Indeed, many exit childhood sensing that they are unwanted, fundamentally bad, or failures or less favored than a sibling, and so on.  

A second critical learning period for self-esteem is adolescence when parental influences wane or even become negative, while peer group influences become vital and avidly sought as peer group acceptance fosters high self-esteem. Yet many adolescents are rejected by their peers—they may be unattractive, disabled, or newcomers to an area where the peer group is &quot;full&quot; and does not require or even stigmatizes new arrivals.  Such rejection by peers can further compound low self-esteem acquired early childhood or even efface high self-esteem previously engendered by parents. Self-esteem is difficult to alter after adolescence.  It is true that important life events may have effects both positive, such as success in college or career, or negative as in being rejected by a desirable college or failing in a career. But in the clinic many successful, happily married people still have problems ensuing from bad experiences in early childhood or adolescence. It takes a time and effort to substantially improve self-esteem.

Ferdo Knobloch recognized the value of &quot;corrective experience,&quot; elaborating ideas of Alexander and French (29) who saw how therapy can offer a re-run of bad experience.  Knobloch (30) noted how individual psychotherapy can refurbish defects in the original parent/child relationship when, over a long course of care with a reassuringly supportive therapist, the patient can overlay bad early learning with newly positive experiences. Such therapy emphasizes the importance of childhood experiences as the therapist adopts aspects of the role of parent via patient transference. Here the good therapist is able to elevate the patient into something of an equal, in the way that a good parent eventually assists a child to separate and individuate as a health, self-actualized adult.

However, if low self-esteem arose in negative adolescent experiences, individual therapy cannot effect a re-run.  Parent figures are importent at this stage. What is instead needed is a re-run with a group that represents the adolescent peer group. This re-run can most effectively be achieved with group therapy, as other treatment group members understudy the role of adolescent peers. Here transference is not to the therapist but to the peer group as a whole.

== Summary ==

Research that spans neuroscience and psychoanalysis is rapidly enhancing the scientific foundation of all types of psychotherapy as insights accrue concerning critical learning periods, narrative capacity, and neuroscientific discoveries in of existential adaptation.  In practical terms, the sequelae of negative childhood events are perhaps best addressed by individual therapy whereas those due to adversities in adolescence are likely to benefit from group therapy.  It is less widely appreciated but quite important to appreciate that such research also directly links psychotherapy to evolution, particularly the emotive and rational capacities and reactivities of highly social species such as Homo sapiens. Most patients are able to give a clear account of how they felt about themselves in childhood and adolescence, and these reports should be taken into account in deciding between individual and group therapy as well as in guiding the course of any dynamic therapy toward the resolution of and recovery from problems in living.

Besides case, the role of a noun in a clause may be indicated with an {{navi|Glossary|adp|adposition}}. This may occur either as a {{navi|Glossary|preposition}} before the noun, as in English, or as an {{navi|Glossary|suffix}} at the end of the noun, as in [[Chinese]], [[Japanese]], and [[Korean]], a greater degree of freedom than human languages allow. For example, &quot;with you&quot; may be either ''hu nga'' or ''ngahu.'' When used as suffixes, they are much like the numerous cases found in [[Hungarian]] and [[Finnish]]. 

==Attested adpositions==
Adpositions may be stressed when they occur as prepositions, but not as suffixes, where they have no effect on the stress of the noun.

Various locative and temporal adverbs are derived from these: ''ne’ìm'' &quot;toward the back&quot;, ''nefä'' &quot;upwards&quot;, ''nekll'' &quot;downwards&quot;; ''ta’em'' &quot;from above&quot;;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Perhaps related to the ''em'' in ''emza’u'' &quot;to pass a test, ''overcome'' a challenge&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''mawkrr'' &quot;after, afterwards&quot;; ''srekrr'' &quot;before, beforehand&quot;. Note also ''kä neto'' &quot;go away (toward the distance)&quot; and ''tok mìso'' &quot;be there in the distance&quot;, both perhaps based on the particle ''to'' &quot;than&quot;. ''Srese’a'' &quot;to prophesize&quot; is literally &quot;to foresee&quot;, ''sre+tse’a.''  

There are words besides traditional adpositions that have the same dual preposition/suffix use, such as ''sì'' &quot;and&quot; and ''pe+, -pe'' &quot;which?&quot;, though the latter case is a dual prefix/suffix (''peu, ’upe'' &quot;what?&quot;—see {{navi|Questions|}}), never a preposition.

Though a prefix, the adverbial ''nì-'' &quot;-ly&quot; functions as a generic adposition: '''''nì'''fya’o alaw'' &quot;'''in''' a clear manner&quot;. It may be used where no specific adposition is correct; ''mì fya’o,'' for example, would mean literally &quot;'''in''' the way, '''on''' the path&quot;, not *&quot;in the manner&quot;.

== Lenition and the ambiguity of short plurals ==
When used as prepositions, certain of these trigger {{navi|Glossary|lenition}}, marked &quot;+&quot; in the table above. One of the leniting prepositions is ''mì'' &quot;in&quot;, as in ''mì sokx'' &quot;in the body&quot;, from ''tokx'' &quot;the body&quot;. This may cause some ambiguity with short plurals: ''mì sokx'' could also be short for ''mì aysokx'' &quot;in the bodies&quot;. When ''mì'' is used as a suffix, however, the noun is not lenited.

Thanks for your message, I made the mistake (as I quite often do) of  reading &quot;This is not an...&quot; is &quot;This is an&quot; so I thought you were a bot or something :P. I've found things really interesting here, a lot of books I've looked at seem inactive, I've had a few ideas to make write them, and done so, reading that it's good to be bold. It seems quite often people talk about making a change, but they don't actually do anything (maybe worried about other people?) So hope to step out and make those changes to the best of my intuition, any advice? --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 12:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

== Welcome Matt ==

Hey! This is [[User:Arunreginald|Arun Reginald]]. I have been actively involved in just about every nook and cranny of the [[Java Programming]] book and I sincerely think that the feedback you left on the book is highly valuable and may take the book in the right direction. I would like to help you in editing the book and making the book as readable and enjoyable as it can possibly be. I haven't been editing for a while now but would be grateful if a new set of eyes could look through the [[Java Programming]] book. Report anything you find that may need cleaning up and I will make sure that is done. Thanks again for your comments and feedback. Hope to see more ideas sprouting up from your end. Cheers &amp;ndash; [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 00:51, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your message, as mentioned Java Programming talk page sorry I've been a way for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've quite enjoyed looking through the book and thinking about how the end product would look like, I think there's quite an uphill struggle but I certainly hope to try and (with the help of others) get the project on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just forgive me if I make a mistake, wikibooks is very new to me and using wikis in general is quite against what I'm used to (where development happens quite behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 19:21, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

== Hi Mattylaws ==

I'm new on wikibooks and interrested in doing a dutch translation of this wikibook,
i translate cause it makes it easier for me to learn and remember so i was wondering if i can
publish the translated pages as i go on ?

and i wanted to ask if there's a way of communication with the others working on the java programming wikibook.

Hope to hear from you.

Can you provide me with more info about when to use the four tildes, &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;
Is this just for the discussion area or should I be using this when editing books?
[[User:Dwitt|Dwitt]] ([[User talk:Dwitt|talk]]) 22:08, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

:Only on personal posts, contributions to book contents shouldn't be signed. Signing posts will also confer them some protection from edits and deletions, it is normal practice to prevent removal of posts before 30 days have passed (this can vary from situation to situation, the minimum timeframe used on the project is 7 days, but it shows you how important it is to have the time of the edit visible) and editing other users signed posts is frowned upon. Another practice is to add indentation to replies so its easier to read and to understand to what does the reply relate to (like I just did).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:24, 16 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Add a paragraph about XForms itself, and a paragraph about this wikibook</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''XSLTForms''' is a client-side implementation of XForms.  It requires no plug-in in the browser, and it requires no special software on the server.

'''XSLTForms''' implements XForms by using XSLT to transform an input XHTML + XForms document to an XHTML+Javascript (AJAX) document; the XSL transformation is unique to XSLTForms.

The transformation can be run wherever an XSLT 1.0 engine is available.  Some users run the transform server-side, using Apache and PHP; IIS and .NET; Jetty; or eXist).  Others run it client-side, in the user's browser, using the XSLT engines built into Internet Explorer, Mozilla FireFox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari.

XForms is a technology for XML-based forms.  It is defined by a [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/ specification] developed by the [http://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium], and many users of XForms use it for forms on the Web, but XForms is designed as a vocabulary module that can be plugged into any host XML vocabulary.  One of the most widely used implementations of XForms is embedded in Open Office and uses the Open Document Format (Open Office's XML) as its host vocabulary.  For an introduction to XForms you may want to consult a general introduction to the technology (several books have been published on paper and on the Web, including a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XForms WikiBook] on the subject); in its current state this wikibook mostly focuses on topics specific to the XSLTForms implementation of XForms and won't suffice for you to learn XForms on your own.

This wikibook describes XSLTForms and its use as an XForms implementation.  It begins with an introductory section that provides some background information on the package, then continues with some beginning examples.  Later sections describe the use of XSLTForms with various HTTP servers and the solutions to common problems.   The largest section of the wikibook is a description of the current status of XSLTForms, describing features implemented and not implemented, extensions to the specification and how to use them, and listing known restrictions of the implementation.  Note that because XSLTForms is actively maintained, the status section has a disappointing tendency to fall out of date.  You may have to take what it says with a grain of salt, and some of the limitations listed there may have been lifted by the time you read this book.

      <comment>Try to provide some of the installation information I wish I had had when I first started using XForms</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Installing and using XSLTForms to support Web-based applications requires two steps:

# Download and install XSLTForms on your server, and point your forms to it as described below.
# If your forms involve submission of form data to the server, you'll need to make arrangements for your server to accept PUT or POST requests.

If you're using the version of XSLTForms included with MarkLogic server or the eXist XML database, both of these tasks are already taken care of for you, as part of the installation and configuration of the XML database.  See the documentation!

If you're not using eXist or MarkLogic, you'll need to read the rest of this page.

== Installing XSLTForms proper ==

Prospective users of XSLTForms are sometimes frustrated because they cannot find anything that look like proper installation instructions.  (This page is an attempt to correct that situation, for those who find it.)  Part of the problem is that some users find it hard to believe that installation of an XForms implementation can be as simple as it is.

First, you must download a copy of XSLTForms.  The easiest thing to do is probably to go to the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsltforms/ Sourceforge Project Home Page] for XSLTForms and look for a download button; clicking on that button will cause your browser to download a ZIP file containing the most recent release package for the software.

When this page was last revised (July 2012), the most recent package was [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsltforms/files/latest/download 1.0RC] (1.0 release candidate).

Note:  earlier releases are still available, including  
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsltforms/files/xsltforms/Beta%203/xsltforms-beta3.zip/download Beta 3], 27 Feb 2011
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsltforms/files/xsltforms/Beta%203%20RC/xsltforms-beta3RC.zip/download Beta3 Release Candidate], 12 Sep 2010

Unless you have a special need for an older version rather than the current version, however, you should take the latest available package.

Next, you must unzip the ZIP file and get it onto your HTTP server.  Remember the location where you put it.  (If you do not know how to get files onto your Web server, you will need to consult other sources to learn how to do that, before continuing here.)  

Finally, you must add an XML stylesheet instruction to your XForms, which points to the &lt;tt&gt;xsltforms.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; stylesheet in the package you just installed.  So if your site is named &lt;tt&gt;forms.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; and you installed XSLTForms in &lt;tt&gt;/lib/xsltforms-1.0RC/&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;xsltforms.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; file is in that directory (do check, sometimes the release packages are wrapped in an extra layer and you'll find the stylesheet one directory level further down), you'll add a line like

&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;http://forms.example.com/lib/xsltforms-1.0RC/xsltforms.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

to the XHTML+XForms documents you want to deliver with XSLTForms.  In practice, you may prefer to use a relative URI rather than an absolute URI (so the stylesheet instruction will read &lt;tt&gt;... href=&quot;../../../lib/xsltforms-1.0RC/xsltforms.xsl&quot; ...&lt;/tt&gt;); that makes it easier to test forms on a test machine before putting them on a production server.

== Accepting PUT and POST ==

Arranging for your server to accept PUT or POST requests from an XForm is an entirely separate matter.  In principle, setting the server up to handle such requests is completely independent of your XForms implementation (though in practice some server-side XForms implementations include server-side support for PUT and POST in the package).  

This is not the place to go into details, but in general the options available include:

* installation of a WebDAV server (or more commonly configuration of some other server software to support WebDAV requests); possibilities include
** WebDAV support in Apache
** WebDAV / Delta V support in Subversion
** Apache support for WebDAV using Subversion as the file store

* configuration of a generic HTTP server to accept PUT or POST

Because they involve accepting and processing data from potentially unknown (and thus potentially untrustworthy and hostile) clients, PUT and POST unavoidably represent a security risk for your system.  In consequence, most Webmasters and system administrators will have firm views on the right way to set things up to manage the risk properly.  Users of XForms will need to work with the Webmaster to ensure that things are set up in a way that will let you get your work done and won't expose your site to unavoidable security problems.

XForms can be used as a convenient way to provide more sophisticated user interfaces for Web pages even without submitting data to a server, so for some purposes you may not need to set your server up for PUT and POST. 

And for XForms applications you just want to run on your own machine, the support for &lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt; URIs in current versions of XSLTForms may make it unnecessary to configure a WebDAV server.

      <comment>Turn this section into something like continuous prose.  Add some description of the XSLTForms project itself.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">XSLTForms has its origin in the [http://ajaxforms.sourceforge.net/ AJAXForms] project, an open source project (under the Lesser GNU Public License, LGPL) undertaken by AjaxForms S.L. of Pontevedra, Spain.  

AJAXForms is a server-side XForms 1.0 implementation:  it uses a Java program controlled by Ant to converts XForms documents (i.e. XML documents in the XHTML and XForms namespaces) into HTML documents and Javascript files.  The result is an AJAX-based HTML page which behaves as specified by the XForm input, but which can be viewed and processed with existing browsers (which do not support XForms natively).

The Java program used by AJAXForms to do the transformation is mainly based on an XSLT 1.0 transformation, but it also uses Jaxen (a Java XPath engine) to analyze XPath expressions.

AJAXForms has been dormant and unsupported since November 2006.

The XSLTForms project picked up the AJAX Javascript libraries developed by AJAXForms and replaced the Ant-driven server-side Java transformation with an XSLT 1.0 transformation that can run either on the server or in the browser.  The first commits to the XSLTForms project's [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsltforms/ SourceForge repository] were in November 2008.  Since then, several versions of the software have been released; these have all been labeled beta as beta releases, until 2012, when a 1.0 release candidate (1.0RC) was put out.

A number of users contribute comments, suggestions, and occasional code, but most of the work on XSLTForms is done by Alain Couthures, the founder of AgenceXML of Eysines, France (on the outskirts of Bordeaux).

==Key==
In the ''Part of speech'' column there will be a letter indicating ow the word is to be used. Here is a key, listing the abbreviations and explaining what these stand for:

adj = adjective - describes an object (e.g. The key was '''green''', The idea is '''disturbing'''.)

adv = adverb - describes how a verb is done (e.g. I ran ''quickly'', She ''easily'' passed the test.)

conj = conjunction - connects two words, clauses or phrase together (e.g. life ''or'' death, I would vote for my gerbil ''but'' I'm sane.)

exp = expression

int = interjection - used to convey emotion, not related to any other part of speech (e.g. '''Ow'''!, '''Hooray'''!)

n = noun - an object (e.g. dog, chair.)

num = number (e.g. Four, One.)

prep = preposition - the location of the object, relative to something else (e.g. Smoke ''over'' water, the ball is ''on'' the table.)

pron = pronoun - One of: I, You, She, He, They, We, It or One.

v = verb - an action, one which can be used both transitively and intransitively(e.g. We '''celebrated''', we '''celebrated''' the party.)

vi = intransitive verb - verbs which can only be done without objects (e.g. Trees ''rustled'', he ''died''.)

vt - transitive verb - verbs which must be applied to an object (e.g. I ''killed'' him, I ''am'' a hamster.)

This template is intended to be used to format an entry in an English to Esperanto word list.

==Usage==

To use it, first you use &lt;tt&gt;[[Template:Esperanto/en-eo start|&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo start&amp;#125;&amp;#125;]]&lt;/tt&gt; then one or more instances of this template, then &lt;tt&gt;[[Template:Esperanto/en-eo end|&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo end&amp;#125;&amp;#125;]]&lt;/tt&gt;.

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo
  |&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;English word&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Esperanto translation&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Part of speech code&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |comment=&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Extra comments about the word&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |extra=&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Extra information code&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |example=&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;An example of the word in use (you can use an instance of [[Template:Esperanto/eo-en example|&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/eo-en example&amp;#125;&amp;#125;]] here)&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |exampleN=&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Additional examples (N can be 1-10)&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &amp;#125;&amp;#125;

===Examples===
The following example code:

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo start&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo
  |apple
  |pomo
  |n
 &amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo
  |English
  |angla
  |adj
  |example=&amp;#123;&amp;#123;esperanto/eo-en example|Mi parolas (la) anglan (lingvon).|I speak English.|lit=I speak (the) English (language).&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 &amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Esperanto/en-eo end&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

produces the output:

{{Esperanto/en-eo start}}
{{Esperanto/en-eo
 |apple
 |pomo
 |n
}}
{{Esperanto/en-eo
 |English
 |angla
 |adj
 |example={{esperanto/eo-en example|Mi parolas (la) anglan (lingvon).|I speak English.|lit=I speak (the) English (language).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who uses XSLTForms?

For a start, XSLTForms ships with software products from a variety of sources.

* XSLTForms is a part of release 4.1 of '''[http://www.marklogic.com Mark Logic]''''s MarkLogic Server; the Mark Logic Application Builder is built using XSLTForms.  A demonstration can be found at http://www.marklogic.com/products-and-services/application-builder/

* XSLTForms is also bundled with the open-source XML database '''[http://exist.sourceforge.net/ eXist]''' from version 1.4 on.  A [http://exist.sourceforge.net/xforms/xforms.html demonstration] is available on the eXist Web site.  There is also a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XRX/XSLTForms_and_eXist section] on XSLTForms and eXist in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XRX/ XRX WikiBook].

* '''Xerox''' uses XSLTForms  in its '''[http://docushare.xerox.com/ DocuShare]''' product (among others), as well as in wikis, weblogs, and content-repository administrative pages; background information is given in a [https://docushare.xerox.com/dsdn/dsweb/View/WeblogEntry-42 blog post] on Leigh Klotz's [https://docushare.xerox.com/dsdn/dsweb/View/Weblog-572 Standards and Technology] weblog.

A number of users and organizations use XSLTForms for their XForms applications.  Some of these are publicly available tools for working with particular vocabularies:

* Joe Carmel (formerly the chief of Legislative Computer Systems at the U.S. House of Representatives) has published [http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/aboutstratxform.html an information page] and [http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/stratmlxform3.xml an XForm] for editing documents in the StratML (Strategic Plan Markup Language) XML vocabulary.  Andre Cusson of 01 Communications has extended Carmel's work to make [http://www.hyperbase.com/xml/cosmos/resource/apps/stratedit.xml a form for StratML Part 2 documents]. 
 
* Steven Cameron's [http://sourceforge.net/projects/schema2xforms/ Schema to XForms] project uses XSLTForms for its interactive [http://collinta.com.au/xsltforms/designer.xml Schema Designer] user interface.

* Oracc (the [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/index.html Online Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus], a collaborative effort of scholars at several institutions) uses XSLTForms to manage the search interface to the [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao State Archives of Assyria Online (SAAo)] and other corpora.

Other publicly available uses of XSLTForms are intended as demonstrations or examples:

* Alain Couthures maintains [http://www.agencexml.com/xsltforms.htm a set of XForms examples] at the AgenceXML web site.

* The [http://wiki.jewishliturgy.org/w/index.php?title=Home Open Siddur Project] uses XSLTForms in its (&quot;pre-alpha&quot;) demo of a Web application for putting together a siddur from component parts and compiling the results to HTML. [''Broken when visited 20 July 2012'']

* Steven Pemberton's tutorials [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2010/xforms11-for-html-authors/ XForms for HTML Authors] and [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2010/xforms11-for-html-authors/part2.html XForms for HTML Authors, Part 2] use XSLTForms for the free-standing examples of the form interactions.  

* Michael Sperberg-McQueen has published a [http://blackmesatech.com/2011/12/pl0/index.xhtml simulator for Nicklaus Wirth's PL/0 virtual machine] which uses an XForms interface to step through the execution of the virtual machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tests and performance measurements were made.

They show that the XSL transformation time is very short, whatever the browser.

The time to initialize the structures of the XPath interpreter and processing of interactions with the user depends on the performance of the browser's JavaScript engine.

Some results here: http://www.web21th.com/samples/performances.htm 

These tests were made in May 2009, with some modifications in XSLTForms source in order to introduce probes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quick intros to making good sounds on your puredyne system :)

==Important: A note about Jack==
On Linux there are different &quot;infrastructures&quot; for sound. Some of them are tailored towards everyday basic use, but some are built for professional low-latency work. [[w:jackd|JACK]] is in this second category and lots of the audio software described below '''actually uses JACK''' for its audio input/output.

For many of these applications it's a good idea to start JACK up first. Go to ''Menu &gt; Audio &gt; Jack control'' to launch a graphical controller and then press the big green ''Start'' button :)

==Specific tools==

===DJing with Mixxx===
[[Image:Mixxx Puredyne.png|400px|right]]
Mixxx is free DJ software which does what most DJ software does - it lets you play and mix your music collection live using an interface a lot like a physical decks-and-mixer. So if you're familiar with DJ mixers you'll probably be able to get started straight away - but it's easy - try this:

# When launched, Mixxx asks where your music collection is. Point it at the folder containing your MP3/Ogg/etc files. (This step is optional)
# If you have done the above step then your files will be listed in the middle of the Mixxx interface, and you can drag-and-drop your chosen file onto the space at the top where waveforms are shown. (If not then you can use ''File&gt;Open'' to choose a track from anywhere you like.)
# Press the pause/play button for the track (either at the top-left or top-right, depending which of the two channels you put your track in). The music should start playing, and you should see the waveform scrolling past as it plays. ''(After a short while Mixxx will also try to guess the tempo and will put markers on the waveform showing where it thinks the beats are.)''
# Now with that track playing, you're free to cue up the next track on the other channel. Now you're a DJ.

===Programming sound/music with Puredata===

Here is a fantastic tutorial on pure data, indeed on making electronic music in general:

[Programming Electronic Music in Pd| http://www.pd-tutorial.com/english/index.html]

===Programming sound/music with SuperCollider===

[[w:SuperCollider|SuperCollider]] is a programming language and a highly-efficient audio engine, which work together to provide a neat way to design real-time music+sound in very flexible ways.

SuperCollider on Linux uses the standard Linux text editors - maybe you're already familiar with '''vim''' or '''emacs''' or '''gedit'''.

[[Image:Puredyne-supercollider-eee.png|400px|right]]
# Make sure JACK is running (see above)
# Choose the menu option ''Menu &gt; Audio &gt; SuperCollider'' (there's a vim option and an emacs option, choose one)
# What will happen is that the text editor will launch, as well as a window for supercollider output (in vim it's a separate window, in emacs it's the lower pane of the main window), and also a graphical interface to start/stop the '''audio server'''.
# Press the '''Boot''' button to start the audio server running. You should see output messages as this happens.
# Run some code. For example, in the empty document window type:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;{SinOsc.ar(MouseX.kr(100, 1000))}.play&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then with your cursor in the same line as that text press F6 (on vim) or Ctrl+C Ctrl+X (on emacs), which should run the command and make some audio output - a mouse-controlled sine wave.

To get further into SuperCollider see the help documentation, or search the web for tutorials...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Card Support ==

To know if your card is supported the best things to do is to check this website:

[http://linuxwireless.org/ http://linuxwireless.org/]

You will find all the links to the different drivers that your card needs, and the optionnal firmware. Please note, that everything named sta or staging usually means that it is a software that does not have the quality required yet to be merged in the main Linux tree, but are provided so that at least you can try out things right away. Depending on your hardware you could be lucky or unlucky with a staging driver.

If Puredyne is missing software/firmware/modules for your card, please check this website first so that you can point us to the right info and we can see what is possible. If your card is indeed supported well, and the driver missing please file an [https://bugs.launchpad.net/puredyne-live/ enhancement request here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Persistent Storage for running the Live version of PureDyne==

When you run the Live version of PureDyne, it does not, by default, save any changes you make during your session.  

If you want to save your settings and any software changes you make, you have to also have a persistent storage partition named live-rw  

This is easiest on a flash drive.   Get a flash drive you can re-format that has a fair amount of space.  At least 4 GB - 8 or 16 is better, if you're going to do a lot of new installs.   You can use a USB stick, an SD card, whatever you have.   Use Gparted or some other Linux utility to re-format it as:
&lt;pre&gt;
A.  A primary partition
B.  filetype EXT2 or EXT3
C.  with the label live-rw.   This label, live-rw (lower case, as typed) is what
 the system looks for.  If Puredyne finds it, it stores any changes you make to that 
partition, and reads them from that partition the next time you boot. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this persistent storage on a flash partition, you can boot PureDyne from a CD, DVD or USB stick on any computer and have the same persistent environment. 


CAUTIONS - 

If you boot up and none of your changes are there - the system for some reason didn't recognize your flash drive.  Unplug it, re-plug it, and reboot.

BACK UP THE CONTENTS OF YOUR FLASH DRIVE REGULARLY to your hard disk or somewhere - you don't want to lose those directories.  You can format a new flash drive with the label live-rw and copy the contents to that, too - two copies of your personal environment. 


==Wallpaper==

For wallpaper on your desktop to be persistent over sessions, it has to be in /user/share/xfce4/backdrops - wallpaper anywhere else won't be used the next time you boot.  If you are using persistent storage (above) or a full install, use ' sudo cpy &lt;whatever the path and name of the image you want&gt; /user/share/xfce4/backdrops ' 

==Screensaver==
If you're running an installation piece or suchlike then you might want to disable the screensaver. You can use the system preferences to activate/deactivate the XFCE screensaver - '''but!!!''' - if your computer supports [[w:DPMS|DPMS]] (which it probably does) then [[w:X11|X11]] automatically blanks the screen after ten minutes, which is '''separate''' from the screensaver stuff.

To disable screen blanking, launch a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this line:

&lt;code&gt;
xset -dpms
&lt;/code&gt;

      <comment>/* Step 3: Choose your flavouring */ nums</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Five steps to produce your own customized Puredyne LiveCD:

==Step 1: Required tools==
If you're using a '''debian''' or '''ubuntu''' system, first make sure you have installed the development tools that will be used by broth:

 sudo apt-get install live-build build-essential devscripts bzr

If you're running from '''puredyne''' then these are already installed.

==Step 2: Get broth==
Get Broth from Launchpad via bazaar:

&lt;code&gt;
bzr branch lp:broth
&lt;/code&gt;

This will download a folder called &quot;broth&quot; containing the latest version of the broth scripts and config files.

==Step 3: Choose your flavouring==
===3.1. Changing the list of packages to be installed===
In case you want to remove one of the main entries of the CUSTOM default recipe, edit the profile for the type of live media you are creating, in our case:

&lt;code&gt;
cat stock/chroot_local-packageslists/puredyne-CUSTOM

 #include &lt;audio&gt;
 #include &lt;desktop&gt;
 #include &lt;dev&gt;
 #include &lt;firmware&gt;
 #include &lt;hardware&gt;
 #include &lt;medibuntu&gt;
 #include &lt;net&gt;
 #include &lt;system&gt;
 #include &lt;wm&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Each of these &quot;#include&quot; statements includes a separate file, in which desired package names are listed.

Since we wanted all of the above, we contine to edit only one of the included entries:

&lt;code&gt;
cd stock/chroot_local-packageslists/
nano audio
&lt;/code&gt;

We can delete any application name we don't want (or &quot;comment it out&quot; by adding the hash sign # in front). Is worth to say we not just removed but added software we needed after checking the repos for packages to include:

&lt;code&gt;
sudo aptitude search nmap
&lt;/code&gt;

and then adding the exact package name in the &lt;net&gt; file:

&lt;code&gt;
nano stock/chroot_local-packageslists/net
&lt;/code&gt;

===3.2. Adding your own scripts/datafiles===
The path &lt;code&gt;stock/chroot_local-includes/&lt;/code&gt; contains files and folders that will be directly added to the disk image. So, if you wanted there to be a folder &lt;code&gt;/etc/john&lt;/code&gt; in the finished product, with a couple of data files in, you would create the folder &lt;code&gt;stock/chroot_local-includes/etc/john&lt;/code&gt; and put the data files into it.

Sometimes you want to add files not to a hard-coded path, but to the user's '''home folder'''. (For example this might be useful for changing a configuration file for the live user.) In many Linux distributions, this is done by adding files into &lt;code&gt;/etc/skel&lt;/code&gt;, and they are then copied into the user's home folder when the user is created. So for example, if you wanted the user to have a file in their home folder called &quot;orig.jpg&quot;, in broth you need to place it in &lt;code&gt;stock/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/orig.jpg&lt;/code&gt;.

==Step 4: Let's cook==
More or less this was the drill, the when you are happy just run:

&lt;code&gt;
./broth.sh -o CUSTOM
&lt;/code&gt;

and wait for a bit (aprox. 20-40min depending on you network connection to the repos). This phase takes a while, and outputs pages and pages of text info, because many packages are being installed to the live image.

(You'll normally be asked for your password at the start. That's OK.)

==Step 5: Serve==
When the process finishes you'll see something like:

&lt;code&gt;
P: Begin unmounting filesystems...&lt;br /&gt;
soup is ready!
&lt;/code&gt;

The image will be waiting for you in:

&lt;code&gt;
../puredyne-build-i386/binary.iso
&lt;/code&gt;

Finally, burn your image to a CD or DVD and you are done! (You can use a program like k3b to burn .iso images)

==Other customisations==
* Some cron jobs and scripts? Add to includes in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;/stock/chroot_local-includes/etc/cron.d/&lt;/code&gt;

==Questions==

* when i ran broth for the first time, it took a good while to produce the image, such time lapse has not being significantly reduced after subsequent .iso builds, is there a way to make the process faster, like avoiding the download of packages that are already on the local?
** You (or the local network admin) could set up a [http://www.go2linux.org/debian-ubuntu-package-proxy-server .deb cache server], but that's not particularly easy/quick to set up.
* is there a way to modify the splash screen used by grub?
** Yes. The easiest way is to replace &lt;code&gt;stock/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/images/desktop-base/grubsplash-puredyne-logo-simple.png&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are various ways to get hold of Puredyne (see http://puredyne.goto10.org/download.html). You can buy a special USB stick, or you can download the ISO (disk image) and put that onto a CD/DVD/USB stick yourself. Then you're ready to get started:

==Booting your live system (USB/CD/DVD)==

# Insert the disk/stick into your computer.
# Turn on the computer.
# Many computers will automatically boot from the disk/stick. (On a Mac you may need to hold the &quot;c&quot; key while the Mac starts up, to boot from drive.) 
:*If your computer doesn't automatically boot from CD, you need to change a setting in your computer's BIOS. Most PCs allow you to enter the BIOS settings quickly after you start your computer. You are usually prompted to press F12 or F2 to enter the BIOS (check your computers manual if no information is displayed at boot). &lt;br&gt; Once you entered the BIOS settings, look for the Boot Sequence. You should change the sequence so that the CD drive is first in the list, the hard drive later. It differs per computer how this is done, please check the manual of your computer if you are unsure how to change these settings. 


==Preparing Puredyne on a live-bootable USB stick==

1. Burn the .iso disk image as a bootable CD or DVD -- e.g., on my Mac, I had to go to disk utility and &quot;burn image.&quot;

2. Make sure the .iso file you downloaded is available on the file system of the machine where you're going to prepare the USB stick. It's OK if it's a Mac or NTFS partition -- puredyne can mount them.

3. Boot from the disk. (Or, if you have a virtual-machine app, you could boot right from the iso.)

4. Open an xterm window (terminal icon near lower left), then mount the location of the iso. It might take some trial and error to find out which device to mount. Hard disks and USB drives attached to the system are under /dev/sd(a,b,c...), with a number suffix for partitions. The partition editor gparted can help you find the device ID by size (but note, DON'T make any changes with gparted!):

&lt;code&gt;
gksudo gparted
&lt;/code&gt;

Then use the drop-down menu at top right to look for the volume that's the same size as the iso location. For instance, on a machine with a 120GB hard drive, /dev/sda shows 111.79 GB and /dev/sdb shows 3.77 GB -- so obviously sda is the built-in hard drive and sdb is the memory stick. sda1 is the HD's first partition; sda2 is the second and so on.

Also, while in gparted, look for the device ID for the USB stick that you're going to prepare.

Once you know that, do this, including the partition number.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo mkdir /media/iso
sudo mount /dev/[name] /media/iso
&lt;/code&gt;

e.g.,
&lt;code&gt;
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/iso
&lt;/code&gt;

If it's a Windows partition, you might need to specify filesystem type:

&lt;code&gt;
sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/[name] /media/iso
&lt;/code&gt;

5. The rest is easy. Use &quot;CD&quot; or &quot;DVD&quot; depending on which you downloaded and replace &quot;path/to&quot; with the real iso location.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo make-live-device.sh /media/iso/path/to/puredyne-910-carrot_and_coriander-DVD.iso /dev/sd#
&lt;/code&gt;

(where # is the letter of the target USB stick -- '''don't include the partition suffix!''' Write sdc rather than sdc1.)

It'll take a few minutes, but then you'll have a persistent live bootable stick. It will make a smaller partition at the beginning for the iso contents and then use the rest of the stick to save any files that you changed or added later. So it's a good idea to get a stick with more space than you will actually need for the iso.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h1&gt; Bluegreen 2 &lt;/h1&gt;

I am a student at the University of Minnnesota studying Agricultural Industries and Marketing. I am a member of the WRIT 3562W course that is working on Paul V. Anderson's &lt;u&gt;Technical Communication&lt;/u&gt; Wikibook.

&lt;h2&gt; Interests &lt;/h2&gt;

I grew up on a farm in a rural town of Minnesota, which is why I am now pursuing a career in agriculture. I also enjoy reading, writing, and public speaking. My older brother and I bond over Minnesota sports, including Gopher football and the Minnesota Twins. I am a big fan of musicals, singing loudly, and sleeping in late.

&lt;h2&gt; Goals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Graduate with a bachelor of science in the spring of 2011&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Obtain a communications or marketing career in the agronomy industry&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Own a dairy calf&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Do some sort of agriculture tour on every continent&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Play the keyboard at Target field&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;Watch the Twins play outside Minnesota&lt;/ol&gt;</text>

Has the contributor or The FreeBSD Documentation Project been contacted?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:07, 4 January 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' but convert the license and keep the copyright attribution. Darklama pointed out that the FSF compatible with the GNU FDL. The issue of our dual licensing doesn't cause any issue since the CC-BY-SA is even more permissive.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:58, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

: '''Comment''' I don't think there is a problem if the work was licensed under the BSD license. The BSD license does not require that derived works continue to use the BSD license, thus we could say its now CC-BY-SA+GFDL. The requirement to keep the copyright notice is not really any different from the requirements for the GFDL and CC-BY-SA. The disclaimer is not really all that different from [[Wikibooks:Risk disclaimer]] which books are allowed to use. The issue might be the assumption that the work was BSD licensed. All the work really says is it choices to uses the same license as the FreeBSD Handbook and includes the requirements without actually mentioning a specific license. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:26, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

:: &lt;s&gt;The problem with the disclaimer is that it is a requirement of the license terms we can't change the licenses because that makes them incompatible. It would cease to be enforcible.&lt;/s&gt; The [[Wikibooks:Risk disclaimer]] is optional and subjective.
:: Another interesting aspect that you raise it that we can just decide to change the BSD license without really creating a derived work (or that in itself creates one), that is not so, only owners of content can re-license it (not users). [http://boycottnovell.com/2008/02/04/civitl-wars-in-free-software/ This issue caused some fighting on the free software front].   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:53, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

::: The work did became a derived work when changes were made to it by Wikibooks contributors. The people who contributed changes to the work agreed to re-license the work when they submitted their changes to Wikibooks. [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#FreeBSDDL The Free Software Foundation seems to think the licenses are compatible]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:56, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

:::: You are probably correct I haven't verified the changes made (the site sees to be down) and I agree with you on the &quot;BSD license does not require that derived works continue to use the BSD license&quot; if the requirement was only the statement of including the copyrights then there wouldn't be any issue. In any case as you found out the FSF thinks it is compatible so I'm inclined to agree (since the other format requirements they impose, even if not directly covered result in the same). We can keep some form of reference to the license conversion, next to the required attribution. Any one opposed the conversion ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:58, 27 January 2010 (UTC) 

::::I see the statement that the copyright must remain intact, but I don't see any statement that the content can be relicensed, on either this book or at [http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html the Free BSD license page]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:35, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

:::::My understanding is that since the license doesn't make any demands for the continued use of it (or an updated version like the GFDL) any subsequent derivative works can be re-licensed (as Darklama stated above and it has been a common practice on BSD software), respecting the normal requests of attribution since it is not a [[w:Copyleft|Copyleft]] (all rights reserved license). That is why the FSF states it is compatible, and in fact the required text is somewhat duplicated on the GFDL and the CC-BY-SA (without mention of formats but I'll trust the FSF on that).
:::::The link I provided above about the conflicts regards direct copy and re-licensing of software, without any change it would be (and people have argued about it) wrong, but we have similar conundrums on the project already. That is why I like to point out that we use the GFDL+Exceptions (and have had a long attrition with Darklama on the subject) but that hasn't prevented us to import GFDL content and impose the limitation of future works, against, at best the expectations of the original author(s), because the GFDL is a powerful copyleft license that requires derived works to be available under the same copyleft. I doubt anyone will make a fuzz about the issue but the bottom line is similar or even more problematic just because the GFDL is copyleft.
:::::In this case I have no issues, we are changing a non-copyleft license (that doesn't reserve rights) using (or abusing) the right as creators of a derivative version to re-license it into a compatible license. If your concern is on the moral grounds to do so, I fell your pain but this is how it works and the freeer version hopefully will continue to be available, just not our derived version.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:41, 27 January 2010 (UTC)      

::::::[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Relicense''' I don't claim to be an expert on licensing, so if everyone else has no problem, go ahead and relicense so that we can keep content and leave the potential for future contributors to add further content. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

Book has serious POV issues and is not written for children. It also has tons of link spam. It is a translation of a book that was deleted from German Wikijunior after rfd. It also says things that are just flat out untrue. For example it says that &quot;metal&quot; is a &quot;metaphor for an exaggerated opinion of oneself (&quot;me tall&quot;).&quot; Best case, this is original research. [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:17, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

::::I think that language differences may be a barrier to understanding here. I'm saying that in America, metal is most often metaphorically associated with strength and birds are most frequently associated metaphorically with the concept of freedom, not &quot;a person who flies&quot;. I'm pretty sure that &quot;Me Tall&quot; juxtaposed to &quot;metal&quot; in English would be considered a pun, rather than a metaphor. The concept of metaphor in English seems to me to be rather narrower than you are suggesting in the text. If you can find something that explicitly says metal is a metaphor for an enhanced sense of worth then feel free to cite it. Until then, I'm going to continue to believe it's something you just made up and therefore original research. The article you have cited above does not even contain the _word_ metal. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:56, 5 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::: I'm not going to go back and forth with you.

::English Wikibooks and German Wikibooks are separate projects, with their own ways of doing things.  I don't pretend to understand the nuances of German Wikibooks policies, but here, at least, we delete books that violate [[WB:NPOV]] if we decide the violation is inherent in the book (so it can't just be fixed), regardless of what the subject of the book is.  (I get a very uncomfortable feeling about this use of the phrase {{nowrap|''dogmatic religion''}}, because I suspect it may be the result of a translation in which a rich set of cultural associations is lost, and another whole different set of cultural associations is added, so that the outcome of the translation may be deeply misleading about what was originally meant.)

* {{comment}} I think the whole book probably suffers from language barriers. I suspect the work doesn't translate vary well.

::: The &quot;educational value of the book&quot; was your concern. The language Pi invites children to learn a secret language, which is very motivating for children. The language Pi allows young children to use a word like [[Wikijunior:Children's TV Lexicon/tree|tree]] to avoid an insult and motivate another child to investigate the meaning of the word, which is educational [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3APilingual_Primer.pdf&amp;page=28]. The insults young children otherwise may use for each other are neither funny, nor educational and have the potential to cause quarrel, so the simple use of &quot;tree&quot; as an insult turns 3 negative aspects into positive aspects (including the educational aspect). --[[User:Fasten|Fasten]] ([[User talk:Fasten|talk]]) 18:59, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The integer primitive type with the largest range of value is the {{Java:long}}, from -2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;-1. If you need greater or lesser values, you have to use the &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; class in the package &lt;code&gt;java.math&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; object can represent &lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt; integer (as large as the RAM on the computer can hold) as it is not mapped on a primitive type. Respectively, you need to use the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; class for great decimal numbers.

However, as these perform much slower than primitive types, it is recommended to use primitive types when it is possible.

== BigInteger ==
The &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; class represents integers of almost any size. As with other objects, they need to be constructed.  Unlike regular numbers, the &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; represents an immutable object - methods in use by the &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; class will return a new copy of a &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt;.  

To instantiate a &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt;, you can create it from either byte array, or from a string.  For example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.23: 1 quintillion, or 10^18. Too large to fit in a long.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
BigInteger i = new BigInteger(&quot;1000000000000000000&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

&lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; cannot use the normal [[Java Programming/Mathematical functions|Java operators]]. They use the methods provided by the class.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.24: Multiplications and an addition.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
BigInteger a = new BigInteger(&quot;3&quot;);
BigInteger b = new BigInteger(&quot;4&quot;);

// c = a^2 + b^2
BigInteger c = a.multiply(a).add(b.multiply(b));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It is possible to convert to a {{Java:long}}, but the {{Java:long}} may not be large enough.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.25: Conversion.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
BigInteger aBigInteger = new BigInteger(&quot;3&quot;);
long aLong = aBigInteger.longValue();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== BigDecimal ==

The &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; class cannot handle decimal numbers. The &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; class represents a floating point value of arbitrary precision.  It is composed of both a &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt;, and a scale value (represented by a 32-bit integer).

[[Image:Keyxcoin-closed.png]]

See http://puredyne.org/download.html for more details.

== Create your own bootable USB ==

Of course you can also create your own bootable USB stick. It takes a bit more effort, but it's well worth it! Using the provided make-live-device.sh script you can easily create a liveUSB or liveHD directly from an existing ISO, or better, directly from Puredyne itself!

      <text xml:space="preserve">These instructions work for both the CD edition and the DVD edition. (Note: for the CD edition you'll need a blank CD of at least 700MB, some are smaller!)

== Burning the puredyne image onto a disc ==

=== On Linux ===

Burning a disc on Linux can be done with a lot of different applications. We recommend [http://www.gnome.org/projects/brasero Brasero]. First, insert an empty disc in your computers disc drive. After starting Brasero, choose '''Burn image'''. In the Image burning setup, click on '''path''' and select the puredyne iso file. After that press '''Burn'''.

If the burn button is not available, this means something is wrong. Perhaps the disc or DVD you inserted in your drive is not writable or has already got data on it. Check the disc and try again.

=== On Windows ===

There are plenty of disc burning applications for Windows (such as [http://infrarecorder.org/ Infrarecorder]). Start your favourite disc burning application and choose to burn a disc image from an iso file. Select the Puredyne iso file and burn the disc.

=== On Mac ===

Insert a blank disc. Start '''Disk Utility''' (it's in the ''/Applications/Utilities'' folder on most Macs). From the File menu, choose '''Open Disk Image''' and select the ISO to be burned. In the list of volumes, you will now see an item representing the ISO file. Select it. Click the Burn button and follow the instructions.

== Booting from the disc ==

To boot from disc, insert the disc into your disc-drive and (re)boot your computer. In most cases, your computer will automatically boot from the Puredyne disc.  (On a '''Mac''' you may need to hold the &quot;c&quot; key while the Mac starts up, to boot from drive.) After about a minute the desktop should appear (it logs in automatically). You are ready to start using Puredyne.

=== Changing the BIOS ===

If your computer doesn't automatically boot from disc, you need to change a setting in your computer's BIOS. Most PC's allow you to enter the BIOS settings quickly after you start your computer. You are usually prompted to press F12 or F2 to enter the BIOS (check your computers manual if no information is displayed at boot). 

Once you entered the BIOS settings, look for the Boot Sequence. You should change the sequence so that the disc drive is first in the list, the hard drive later. It differs per computer how this is done, please check the manual of your computer if you are unsure how to change these settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the digital divide? ==

The digital divide refers to the division of the world into people who have access to ICTs and those who do not have access to these technologies. Inasmuch as ICTs are the enabling technologies in the Information age, the digital divide is an important development concern of the 21st century.

A digital divide can exist between urban dwellers and rural folk, between the educated and the uneducated, between socio-economic classes, between ethnic groups, and between men and women. There is also a digital divide between countries and geographical regions. Specifically, in terms of Internet backbones, the US, Canada and European countries are well connected whereas Asia, the Pacific region, Latin America and the Carribean still have to improve their Internet backbones.

== Are women more disadvantaged in the information age? ==

In a research paper titled “Gender, Information Technology, and Developing Countries: An Analytic Study,” Nancy Hafkin and Nancy Taggart argue that “[w]omen within developing countries are in the deepest part of the [digital] divide, further removed from the information age than are the men whose poverty they share.” Among the obstacles to greater women’s access to ICTs are literacy and education, language, time, geographical location, and social and cultural norms.

Literacy and education are prerequisites in the use of information technologies. However, girls and women especially in developing countries are less likely than men to earn the basic education needed to use information technologies. Similarly, women and other marginalized groups are less likely to learn an international language such as English, which limits them to resources written in their native tongue.

Women’s time is a resource that is in high demand but in short supply. That women are often burdened with domestic concerns such as childcare and household work keeps them from devoting time to Internet use, which is viewed as a leisure activity.

In developing countries, the geographical location of Internet public access centers also affects women’s access to the Internet. The more popular model of the Internet café tends to alienate women. Internet cafés have predominantly male users. In order to increase access for women, public access centers to the Internet should be located in more gender-neutral areas such as libraries, schools and public markets.

Women’s access to information technologies is also affected by social and cultural norms. Some cultures discourage women from interacting with men outside their family. This limits women’s learning opportunities. One way of addressing this limitation is to hold “women only” days in public access centers and to have “women only” telecenters.

:'''Box 6. Impact of Information Technology on Gender Issues: Trafficking'''''
{{TextBox|
One of the most sinister aspects of information technology, especially the Internet, is its contribution to the sexual exploitation of women. The amount of sexually explicit material on the Web and the ease of access to it are well known. The most common search performed on any search engine on the Internet is for the word “sex”. Recently, the Internet has become a tool for the prostitution of women, with women being tricked or forced into performing sex acts recorded as digital photos that appear on globally accessible Web sites. There are many ways of selling sex on the Internet. In Brazil customers can book prostitutes on the Web. Global sex syndicates use the Web to recruit women from all over the globe. These point to the globalization of the sex trade.

On the other hand, anti-trafficking activists in Brazil and elsewhere are setting up Web sites to warn women about sex slavery. The MiraMed Institute in Russia operates a Web site, an electronic newsletter and an Internet chat room in Russian to combat trafficking in girls and women from Russia. Thus, information technology is employed by both the profiteers and their opponents.

== What about access to the Internet for those with physical disabilities? ==

Korea is a leader in the effort to build an information environment that encourages persons with disabilities to use information technologies. In December 2000, Korea passed the Digital Divide Law “to help ensure universal, unlimited access to the telecommunications networks and use of the telecommunications services for low-income earners, rural residents, the disabled, the aged, women, etc., who have difficulties in accessing or using the telecommunications services for economic, regional, physical or social reasons...[to] improve the quality of living for these people and thereby contribute to the balanced growth of the national economy.”{{nwiicite|15}}

Bobby is a comprehensive Web accessibility software tool designed to help expose and repair barriers to accessibility and encourage compliance with existing accessibility guidelines.

Bobby was created at CAST ( http://www.cast.org), a non-profit research and development organization whose goal is to expand opportunities for people with disabilities through the innovative use of computer technology. Bobby is designed for developers to test web pages and generate summary reports highlighting the most critical issues affecting site accessibility before posting to the Web or to Intranets.

CAST has worked closely with the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to develop an evaluation tool that employs their Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and provides page and site evaluation support for developers.

The law sets accessibility guidelines for telecommunications services to help the poor. Other provisions would subsidize PC purchases of poor and disabled people; support the development of access technologies for the disabled; and support infor-mation providers for the disabled, the elderly, the poor, and the fishing and farming industry.

The private sector also participates by providing infrastructure using satellite and solar-power technologies. Telephone lines and broadband Internet access have been installed in lightly populated small islands.{{nwiicite|16}}

== Are people unable to access the Net because of language? ==

One aspect of the digital divide is the dominance of one language-English-in the Internet. Sixty-eight percent of Web content is written in English and 40.2% of Internet users access the Internet in English.{{nwiicite|17}} But non-English speaking users outnumber English-speaking users of the Internet. The most widely spoken language worldwide is Chinese, with more than 1.2 billion speakers (as of 2000). But only 3.9% of Web content is written in Chinese and only 9.8% of Internet users access the Internet in Chinese.

Japanese is only the tenth most widely spoken language (with 126 million people) but Japanese is the second most important language (in terms of content) on the Web. Hindi, Arabic, Bengali and Malay are all in the top 9 most widely spoken languages but these languages do not have a significant share of Web content.

== How does the Internet handle fonts and characters of different languages? ==

Different languages are encoded differently, making machine translation difficult.

Thus, the Unicode was established. The Unicode Standard is “a character coding system designed to support the worldwide interchange, processing, and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world.”{{nwiicite|18}} Developed, extended and promoted by a non-profit organization, the Unicode Consortium (www.unicode.org), the Unicode Standard makes international communication easier. Work at the Unicode Consortium is continuous as it aims to extend the Unicode Standard to accommodate all the characters needed in international communication.

:'''Box 8. The tribulations of the Khmer font on the Internet.{{nwiicite|19}}'''''
{{TextBox|
There are many difficulties in using the Khmer language in the Internet. First, the Khmer language represents a relatively small market. There are only about 12 million Khmer speakers in the world. Of the 11.4 million living in Cambodia, less than 10,000 use the Internet. This in turn contributes to the difficulty in creating Khmer content. Second, text entry is difficult. The Khmer alphabet has 150 letters, while a standard keyboard has only 47 keys. Typing Khmer language is highly complex. Almost all consonants, for example, have two different forms, depending on their position within a word. Written Khmer also omits spacing between words. In order to avoid manually inserting a space at the end of every line, the user has to download a special software that adds invisible spaces in between words. Moreover, whereas English only needs one alphabet layer, and French up to two (to accommodate accented letters), the Khmer script uses up to four layers.

There are a variety of initiatives and projects to facilitate the electronic use of the Khmer language. The Open Forum of Cambodia, for example, offers a file conversion program that translates texts from Khmer to Khmer. This may sound odd but it is necessary because there are different Khmer font systems that are incompatible with each other. The UNICODE Consortium, which is in charge of the character coding system to facilitate “worldwide interchange, processing and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world,” has proposed a solution for the Khmer language. However, there are complaints that the solution is flawed, not user-friendly, and was developed without any official Cambodian input.

== How is technology addressing language barriers? ==

Various (machine) translation services are available. While their quality is not as good as that of professional (human) translation, translation software continues to be developed and improved. Some of these translation tools are downloadable software; some are automated online services; and others are Web services rendered by human translators.

:“One of the things that I’m looking forward to is the ability to translate languages in real time, breaking language barriers. You’ll be able to speak on the telephone in one language, and the caller will be able to hear you in another language. It will allow many people to have immediate access to more information at their fingertips.”

:(David K. Allison, technology historian, on the potential of the microprocessor in the next 25 years.)

Human translation is far more accurate than machine translation. But prices for these services are sometimes prohibitive. A translation expert from http://www.wordzone.com says the price for their services is based on the languages to be used and the number of words in the text.{{nwiicite|20}}

== What is open source? How does it help narrow the digital divide? ==

Open source is a certification standard issued by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) that states that the source code of a computer program is made available free of charge to the general public. The rationale for this movement is that a larger group of programmers will be able to produce more useful and more stable programs for everyone to use if they are able to examine the source code. The concept relies on peer-review and collaborative software development by programmers from around the world.

In contrast, closed software has source codes that are kept confidential by the developer, like a secret recipe. The limitation is that only the developer can make improvements on the software.

Open source software is not only robust but also relatively inexpensive. Countries that are unable to spend on proprietary software and want to uphold intellectual property rights would find open source software very attractive.

== Is open source the same as freeware? And shareware? ==

Open source, freeware and shareware are terms that are used to describe programs depending on how these programs are distributed.

Programs are called open source when they are distributed with their source code. The OSI uses a more formal definition upon which they base the certification of a program.{{nwiicite|21}}

Freeware, on the other hand, are programs that are distributed for free. The source code is not necessarily distributed with the software.

Shareware is used to describe a program that is distributed for free but with restrictions. Common restrictions are that the program will work for only 30 or 60 days, or that some features are not fully functional. These restrictions are usually removed once the user pays a fee.

== Should developing countries consider using open source? ==

Yes. Open source software (OSS) has been touted as a highly viable option for developing countries, for several reasons.

''Open source is interoperable''. By its very nature, open source software is able to operate in a variety of machines and operating systems. It is also a good foundation for Government Information Systems. It is easier to facilitate data exchange among the databases of various companies or government agencies using open source. Data exchange is crucial in the development of a robust e-government infrastructure.

''The cost and copyright issues with open source are fewer''. The cost of OSS, if any, is usually just the distribution costs. It can be copied and, generally speaking, used freely with no restrictive copyright problems. While there will be training costs in the use of the software, these will be at local rates.

''The adaptability of open source'' allows it to be used in old computers. The hardware requirements of open source are not high, and existing computers can be used. Furthermore, open source software integrates well with networks running other software.

''Open source is reliable''.This stems from the fact that it is open to scrutiny by any interested programmer. When bugs are found during the development of an open source program, thousands of programmers from around the world have the potential to examine the code and find a solution (often called a “fix”) in the program’s source code. Moreover, security holes and virus outbreaks are quickly addressed because of access to the source code. This is all done for free by volunteers in the open source community. In contrast, closed source programs rely on in-house program developers to create a fix.

''Technical support'' of open source is outstanding due to the culture of cooperation in the open source community. Volunteers give free technical support to users. Web sites are set up for reporting of bugs and sharing of fixes for free. On the other hand, with commercial software millions of dollars are spent in setting up call centers and technical support facilities. These costs are ultimately transferred to the customer.

== What is the disadvantage of open source? ==

Unlike proprietary software, OSS is less likely to provide documentation and professional technical support.{{nwiicite|22}} In general, OSS does not have as much documentation as proprietary software. Neither does OSS have a full-time technical support department to address customer’s questions or complaints. Although the open source community has Web sites that give support to people who have questions, support is given on a voluntary basis. There is no accountability in OSS. An OSS user cannot complain to any particular company when a question or complaint about OSS is left unanswered. Thus, while OSS usually costs less to acquire, the cost of total ownership must be considered when deciding on OSS or proprietary software.

:'''Box 9. Best Technical Support Award Goes to an Open Source Community'''''
{{TextBox|
In 1997, the International Data Group (IDG), a world leader in Technology media, research and events bestowed the Best Technical Support Award to the Linux Community. Linux is an open source operating system.

As something you can download for free, Linux doesn’t come with the support of a commercial entity, but that’s exactly why many readers said they like it. “The online support via Usenet, Web pages, and IRC is far better than anything that you can get from a commercial vendor, as far as resolving real-world problems,” wrote one InfoWorld Electric forum participant, who offered the analogy of a Microsoft Access customer calling Microsoft on a hard-to-solve problem. “So imagine, if you will, that the Microsoft staffer on the line directs you to a Web page where you can download free of charge the latest release of SQL Server and a free copy of C++ in order to solve your problem, and then follows this up a week later by emailing you a program that was written in his/her spare time that extends your program in some new way ... `Impossible! [It will] never happen!’ you say ... [but] this sort of thing literally happens hundreds of times, every day of the week, all year long.”

But can free support from other users really be relied upon as much as support that you’ve paid for? Many Linux users insist that it can. “While it seems to defy logic, it coincides with my experience,” another reader wrote. “With most commercial software, you pay and still don’t get any support. Many times [the vendors] deny that there are bugs in their software. If I have problems with a widely used freeware program, there is somebody or other on Usenet who knows the answers. Even better, a search may tell you that your question has already been posed and answered. On the other hand, if I am using free software that is not widely used, the author is usually not swamped with questions and hence [is] always willing to answer questions about his or her baby.”

== What are developing countries doing to develop their information infrastructure? ==

The biggest challenge is still how to ensure that adequate and reliable information and communication services are available. Majority of developing countries have low telephone density and low PC penetration. These translate to low Internet penetration.

To develop their information infrastructures, most countries have universal service/ access strategies/policies.

The International Telecommunication Union defines universal service as “the provision of telecommunications services permitting access to a defined minimum service of specified quality to all users everywhere, and, in light of the specific national conditions, at an affordable price. The notion of universal service also includes service to disadvantaged users.”

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has established a regulatory framework for basic telecommunications services that includes a set of principles that signatories should follow when developing their universal service policies.{{nwiicite|23}} The universal service core principles include:{{nwiicite|24}} (1) transparency; (2) non-discrimination; (3) competitive neutrality; (4) non-burdensome application; and (5) affordable rates.

The concept of universal access has also been introduced in the development literature. Universal access has its roots in the US Communications Act of 1934, which covers telephone, telegraph and radio services and aims to ensure adequate facilities at reasonable charges. The law aims to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin or gender.

The advent of the information society requires the extension of the concept of universal access beyond telephone, telegraph and radio services. Technology has introduced communication and information products and services that require a higher level of skills and abilities, such as the mobile phone or the Internet. But in essence, universal access remains a target for the quality of delivery of certain technologies.

Universal access is a goal that a country can define in many ways-for example, in terms of the ratio of telephones to people and in terms of a percentage of the population within a certain distance or travel time from a phone (e.g., the country’s entire population is within 20 kms or 1 hour travel of a telephone).

:'''Box 10. Malaysia Phones Home'''''
{{TextBox|
Malaysia has made tremendous strides in providing universal access to telecommunication services. From less than 50,000 main telephone lines in 1960, the Malaysian network grew to over 4.5 million by 2000. Teledensity (main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants) has grown 34 times over the same period, from 0.6 to 19.9. The rise in teledensity has paralleled Malaysia’s impressive economic growth.

Malaysia has also made impressive strides in household telephone penetration, the basic measurement of universal service. Less than 10% of Malaysian families had a fixed telephone line 20 years ago whereas by the end of 2000 that figure had risen to 69%.

Malaysia has taken a number of steps to reduce discrepancies in nationwide telephone access. A rural public telephone programme has been successful in installing at least one public telephone in all of Malaysia’s 4,000 or so villages. The country’s telephone tariffs are also pro-rural in that fixed line rentals are cheaper for inhabitants of Sabah and Sarawak and those connected to small exchanges.

The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) proposes to create a fund to which all operators would contribute based on their revenue. Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TMB) is one of five major telecommunications companies. Designated as the Universal Service Obligation (USO) provider under the previous universal service regime, TMB receives contributions from the fund for providing service in uneconomic areas. The MCMC is proposing that other operators assume this responsibility in areas where TMB is not present.

The MCMC distinguishes between collective and individual access. Collective access is through public locations such as payphones, whereas individual access is availability of service in the home. Priority should be given to collective access, says MCMC, and Internet access should be included in the definition of universal service.

== The idea of universal service is not new. What are they doing differently today? ==

Today countries are looking at a market-based approach to expanding information and communications infrastructure and services.

The telecommunication sector has traditionally been seen as a natural monopoly{{nwiicite|25}}. In the past, many government-operated telecommunications facilities established a State-run monopoly as part of the strategy for jump-starting national telecom infrastructure.

Recently, however, government-owned telecom monopolies have come under criticism. Competition, now considered as one of the most important principles in telecommunications reforms, is projected to encourage the flow of private capital, which is likely to bring down the prices of telecom services. Competition drives telecoms to widen service areas to untapped markets. This helps improve the deployment of telecommunications to niche sectors that a monopoly may refuse to serve altogether. Last but not the least, innovations in telecommunications technologies are more easily deployed in a competitive market where players need to set themselves apart from the other players.

== Does liberalization work? ==

In April 2000, Singapore opened the telecommunications market to full competition as part of the move to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore as the region’s leading communications and information technology hub. It is estimated that within three years following full market liberalization, the total investment from the new activities (excluding 3G mobile and fixed wireless investments) will be about US$1.8 billion. It is further estimated that some 2,500 new jobs will be created.{{nwiicite|26}}

In 1995, the Telecommunications Act of the Philippines was enacted, setting a policy of competition and liberalization for the telecommunications sector. The years that followed showed a marked increase in the number of main lines installed,{{nwiicite|27}} with the number more than doubling from 1.4 million in 1995 to 3.35 million in 1996. This figure increased to 5.77 million in 1997. This striking increase in penetration was brought about by the entry of new telecommunications companies in a competitive arena.

These are only two examples of the positive effect of introducing competition in the telecommunications markets.

== What are governments doing to improve their national information infrastructure? ==

Many governments in the Asia Pacific have developed national information infrastructure plans.

:'''Box 11. Competition in Estonia'''''
{{TextBox|
When Estonia regained independence in 1991, the government embarked on an ambitious project to bring the nation into the digital age. Today, Estonia boasts of one of the most modern telecommunications networks in Europe, low connectivity costs and high rates of computer literacy, even by Western European standards. Twenty-eight percent of Estonia’s population is connected to the Internet.

Estonia’s strategic investment in wiring the entire country has led to an explosion in ICT applications in banking, education, health, transport and public administration. Through a progressive de-monopolization of the telecommunications industry-mostly through the liberalization of the wireless sector-a more aggressive and diversified approach to the advancement of ICT-related solutions has emerged. These varied options-combining wireless, lease lines and fiber-optic networks-allow for a sustained roll out of infrastructure and improved rural connectivity.

Singapore is already into its fourth ICT development plan. From 1981 to 1985, Singapore implemented its National Computerisation Plan with a focus on a Civil Service Computerisation Program and on developing the IT industry and IT manpower. The years 1986 to 1991 saw the extension of government IT systems to the private sector under the National IT Plan. IT 2000, implemented between 1992 and 2000, called for transforming Singapore into an Intelligent Island. The current plan, Infocomm 21, 2000 - 2005, envisions Singapore as a global infocomm capital, e-economy and e-society.

Japan has created an IT Strategy Council to develop a strategy and plan on infostructure development.{{nwiicite|28}} Priority will be placed on the following five policy areas:

1. Promotion of High-Speed and Ultra-High-Speed Internet Infrastructure

2. Digitization of School Education and Reinforcement of Human Resource Development

3. Enhancement of Network Content

4. Promotion of Electronic Government and Electronic Local Government

5. Reinforcement of International Activities

Thailand has also been moving toward becoming an information-oriented society. Its National IT Policy focuses on three pillars of IT development.{{nwiicite|29}} First, invest in the nation’s national information infrastructure. Second, invest in the improvement and development of human resources. The third pillar is a government computerization program which runs parallel to the more active role the government plays in facilitating the country’s IT development.

Thailand’s National IT Policy, IT2000{{nwiicite|30}}, also focuses on the need to provide universal telecommunications service to both urban and rural areas. This is supported by a telecommunications master plan that attempts to address three themes: liberalization, privatization, and the establishment of a telecommunications regulatory regime. There are also efforts to promote computer utilization by reducing import tariffs for computers (hardware and software) and imposing mandatory computer literacy for civil servants.

== What about broadband deployment? ==

The various government efforts at hastening broadband deployment fall under three categories..{{nwiicite|31}} These are:

1. The light touch involves minimal government intervention in the private sector’s expansion of broadband networks and services. This approach focuses on transparent regulatory frameworks to encourage competition and open access. Government commits additional funds to skills improvement, education and training, and occasionally research and development. Switzerland and New Zealand use this approach.

2. The cooperative approach focuses on reducing the digital divide by targeting areas and groups where market forces will not adequately address disparities in access. This approach acknowledges that private sector broadband services will provide business centers, major cities and other more affluent areas with broadband even without the assistance or intervention of the government. Thus, the government should be able to focus more on access in poorer rural areas. The government may also focus more on distance education or telemedicine. The United States, Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom use the cooperative approach.

3. Comprehensive National Broadband Plans are nationwide efforts to create an IT proficient populace through infrastructure development and training. Involving government and industry-wide coordination, this approach emphasizes universal broadband access, transparent regulation and extensive education and training programs. Korea, Norway, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan have comprehensive national information infrastructure programs.

== How can governments promote convergence? ==

In most developing countries, the obstacles to convergence are more legal and regulatory than technological. While the technology to make convergence happen is readily available, existing legal and regulatory provisions-which were enacted at a time when communication technologies were separate, distinct and discrete (i.e., radio vis-à-vis television; broadcast vis-à-vis cable transmissions, among others)impede its growth.

An example of a legislative approach to promoting convergence is the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) 1998 of Malaysia{{nwiicite|32}} (Table 4). This legislation provides for an institutional and regulatory framework to harness the potential of convergence to drive the multimedia industry. The Malaysian model provides for generic main legislation, with specific issues addressed in regulations but sub-ject to regular review. It created a new a horizontal licensing framework for the old telecoms and broadcasters as well as the online service providers that is not based on the technology employed but on the intentions of the parties in provid-ing the types of services concerned. In addition, the process of deregulation was greatly expedited with the emphasis on access, interconnection, inter-operabil-ity of networks and services, competition and quality of service. All of these industries, some of which were already beginning to overlap, were then regulated under the CMA (Table 4).

== What are the regional efforts in developing regional information infrastructure? ==

In November 2000, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN; www.aseansec.org) put together an e-ASEAN Framework Agreement to help de-velop the competitiveness of the ASEAN ICT sector, reduce the digital divide, pro-mote cooperation between the public and private sectors and promote the liberaliza-tion of trade in ICT products, ICT services and investments to support the e-ASEAN initiative.

The e-ASEAN Framework focuses on the implementation of five key initiatives:

1. Facilitation of the establishment of the ASEAN Information Infrastructure

2. Facilitation of the growth of electronic commerce

3. Liberalization and facilitation of trade in ICT products and ICT services, and of investments

4. Capacity building and e-society

5. E-government

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC; www.apecsec.org.sg) Telecommunications and Information Working Group (TEL) has established a Program of Action for Information and Communications Infrastructure. Its initiatives include:

1. promoting the deployment of advanced, secure and reliable information infrastructure

2. encouraging greater build out of the Internet to promote greater broadband accessibility, availability and use,

3. examining the impact of the Internet and broadband accessibility, availability and use on the economy, especially on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs);

4. facilitating R&amp;D activities and analyses (financial, technical and policy) of technologies and applications to meet ICT access needs of the APEC region,

5. strengthening its participation and cooperation with the private/business sector in the development of information communications infrastructures and services

6. promoting further the cooperation among governments, businesses, academic communities and social institutions in meeting these challenges;

7. studying and undertaking collaborative projects to advance the implementation of next generation networks and technologies; and

8. continuing to support cooperative activities for better sharing and utilization of the information infrastructure among member economies.

To complement these goals, human capacity building is also on the TEL agenda. One of TEL’s goals is to triple the number of people with access to the Internet. It aims to enhance cooperation among training and development organizations, promote e-commerce related training programs and experiences, and provide more opportunities in ICT. The TEL also intends to implement training projects specifically addressing the concerns of developing economies.

Also, at the Brunei APEC Summit in November 2000 the e-APEC Task Force was created to develop an e-APEC Strategy that identifies the necessary policy environment and specifies appropriate goals and actions. The e-APEC Strategy is a forward-looking, long term and action-oriented plan with three pillars.{{nwiicite|34}} First, it seeks to create an environment for strengthening market structures and institutions. Second, it aims to facilitate an environment for infrastructure investment and technology development. Lastly, it strives to enhance human capacity building and promote entrepreneurship.

:'''Box 12. African Information Society Initiative (AISI)'''''
{{TextBox|
In May 1996 the ECA Conference of Ministers adopted a resolution entitled “Implementation of the African Information Society Initiative.” Its action framework calls for the elaboration and implementation of national information and communication infrastructure plans to include the development of institutional frameworks; human, information and technological resources in all African countries; and the pursuit of priority strategies, programmes and projects which can assist in the sustainable build up of an information society in African countries. The African ministers are convinced that building Africa’s information society will help Africa to accelerate its development plans, stimulate growth, and provide new opportunities in education, trade, health care, job creation and food security, and thereby help African countries to leapfrog stages of development and raise their standards of living.

The present programs of the AISI cater to different aspects of the development of the Region’s Information Infrastructure:

* The National Information and Communication Infrastructure (NICI) provides the framework for integrating ICT strategies and plans into national and sectoral development plans to facilitate the achievement of national and sectoral development priorities and goals.

* Scan-ICT is an initiative that aims to build African capability to collect and manage key information needed to support the growing investment in ICTs. The goal is to create a pan-African ICT network that will be coordinated and supported by an observatory/research institute.

* Information Technology Centre for Africa (ITCA) focuses on making policy and decision makers aware of the many benefits of ICTs for accelerating the socio-economic development of the continent.

== Will developing countries be able to catch up with developed countries with respect to ICT infrastructure? ==

Developing countries have unique advantages as they build their ICT infrastructure “late in the game”. These are:

''Knowledge of best practices''. Developing countries have the advantage of knowing the best practices from countries that developed their infrastructure earlier. This knowledge is important for avoiding major mistakes that have occurred in the past.

''Fully developed technology''. Developing countries also have the advantage of choosing fully developed hardware and software. Customers who use technology or software that is prematurely deployed incur costs in maintenance or, worse, incompatibility. Developing countries will benefit by using reliable and mature technology.

''Lower cost''.As the technology of certain hardware matures, the production of the hardware further improves. This translates to a corresponding decrease in cost.

For developing countries, the question is not whether to build and/or improve their information infrastructure. The question is “when” and “how”.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]]

Hummus is a classic dish (best enjoyed with pita bread) likely originating from the mid eastern cultures. This recipe incorporates entirely raw ingredients for a truly healthy, delicious taste. 

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chick peas]] soaked and sprouted
* 1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seed]]
* 3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1/4 white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 skinned [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1/3 cup sun dried tomato
* 5 tablespoons agave
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 3 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 pinch [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

==Procedure==

Soak chick peas for 12 to 24 hours then let sprout for 1 to 2 days. Make sure to rinse three times a day while sprouting. 

Add all ingredients except olive oil, paprika and fresh parsley into a blender or food processor and let mix until smooth. Refrigerate for best taste. Sprinkle olive oil, paprika and parsley when serving.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

For a spicy taste you may add roasted red pepper or a dash of cayenne pepper.

==Serving==

It is best to refrigerate before serving. Adding fresh parsley and paprika along with drizzling olive oil over the hummus really takes it over the top. You may serve with pita bread for dipping. Chips or fresh vegetables compliment nicely as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gobackreallyfar machine
6th Century. When Greek theatre fully came into fruition Thespis came upon the scene and snapped his fingers and proclaimed it, “Fabulous. Cast party at my place!” 

Scott: Smart one. 
Rob: Funny one but not that bright. (three watts)

In production of The Trojan Women, Rob and Scott decide to drag out a device they hadn’t used since the Hobbit and that nasty incident with the ring, they talked  to jump back into the “Gobackreallyfar machine (tm)” and venture back to greek times to get more insights into the production. 

They are talking about the production and how they can make it authentic. 
Euripides hears Scott and Rob talking about a play. He kidnaps Rob and ransoms Rob to Scott to make a ending for his play. 
RB gets kidnapped. Scott uses his knowledge to save RB and the greeks build it all. And Euripides steals it all and takes the credit. 
Scott enlists 15 greek citizens and three more and a few more with slightly better movement skills. 
Euripides is the villan and needs an ending for ALL of his plays. 
There has to be a Transformer. 
Reason that the Chorus all wears masks is so that they can't be noticed. Scott steps in for Thespis when he swinus flu.
Thespis gets killed with some kind of weapon... But runs off stage to die. Scott has to step in. 
 
Greek Theatre: Some ideas.
Introduction to the actual look of the area: Tumbling down the seats as they fall into the Theatron and landing in the orchestra just as someone comes up from the underworld in the middle of a production? Machina picks up one of them and flies them around? 
Meeting the actor(s)? Actors? Chorus? Writers? 
Masks and costumes: Maybe Rob sneaks away and puts on a mask to come back and scare Scott? 
Euripides was notorious for ending plays with a God sweeping in to make it all okay. Maybe Rob and Scott really screw things up and the God sweeps in to make it all good again.

For an intro to one, how about it go something like this?

Rob: What are we doing today Scott?
Scott (as he goes for the dial): Rob were are going to investigate City Dionysia.
Rob (puzzled): City Dionysia? Where's that at?
Scott: Not Where, Rob, but what.

They begin to go backwards in time. The two of them land in the outskirts of a Greek festival. As they arrive they see a man standing off to the side and he is praying to Dionysus. The man is Thespis, and when he notices Rob &amp; Scott, he runs over to the two and excitedly shouts, &quot;Hey you, quickly come here!&quot; He looks up to the sky and shouts, &quot;Praise be to thee Dionysus!&quot; He then averts his attention to Rob &amp; Scott, &quot;We must hurry if we are to get you into you Chorus costumes!&quot; 

(If this is like-able then someone who can write well can take this and put it into more of a story.)

Just an idea. 

And it came to pass that in the city of Ashe, two men were discussing a production of 'The Trojan Women'. They stood upon the steps of the library and those that passed by could catch little bits of the conversation in passing. 

&quot;I am telling you that every single piece of a theatre in the Greek world had a name. Every bit of it.&quot; Scott was heard to remark to Rob.
&quot;Right. Actor. Scenery. Proscenium. Stairs. Seats.&quot; As Rob begins to list off all the words he remembers from his classes as he counts them off on his fingers. 
&quot;You are slightly right.&quot; Scott begins, &quot;Scenery came from the Skene. Proscenium came from Proskenion. So much of our theatre world came from the Greeks.&quot; Scott continued to grin even as Rob looked blank to him. &quot;Tell you what, let's go see for ourselves.&quot; As he began to move through the theatre as they walked and made their way all the way to the back of the prop room. &quot;Right here, I haven't used this in several years but I can see it could help you.&quot;
The curtain is drawn back and there stands the Gobackreallyfar machine (tm), or so the gilded sign says across the top of it. Scott reaches for the door, &quot;Step right in. Next stop, ancient Greece.&quot; 
They arrive in Greece and either come upon Thespis as mentioned above or they run into Euripides who kidnaps Rob to get Scott as he is giving Rob a tour of the theatre (thus being knowledgeable enough for Euripides to want Scott to help him with his plays. 
If we use the Thespis angle, I would guess we let Thespis tour them around the theatre and they meet everyone and chaos ensues when Rob decides to jump on the machina and wreck the set? 
If we use Euripides, Scott has to step in as the director type and make a whole production happen with the same people from the other angle. 
We have a lot of good things on the page and need to implement them into this story as well. 
Working for an ending with Euripides as he finished all of his stories with a God coming in to save the whole place. 

I like the idea of them meeting Thespis and moving on to Euripides later. I think that if we start with them meeting Thespis and getting a tour of the parts of the theatre, then we will have a better chance to use more of our research. Maybe Euripides kidnapped them because he didn't want Thespis to have an advantage in the festival, and thought they could help him finish his play.

Zeke's episode plan:
Dr. Peascotty and Funkman take the gobackreallyfar machine to 420 B.C.E. They go get some lunch before Dr. Peascotty gives Funkman a lesson on the architecture of the ancient greek theatre. While they are out to lunch, they meet up with a very distressed Euripides who needs their help. The festival Dionysia is only two days away, and he can’t think of a way to finish his latest masterpiece, Electra. What’s worse, he has a bet with Sophocles that he will win first prize in the festival this year, and, due to some recent bad luck gambling, he doesn’t have the money to pay Sophocles if he looses. 

Dr. Peascotty and Funkman agree to help him finish his play in return for a tour of the Theatre of Dionysus. Euripides agrees and hurries them off to the theatre where he gives the a brief explanation of the parts of the theatre and what they are used for. He goes over, the Theatron, the orchestra, the skene, the Thymeli and how it is an altar honoring Dionysus, the paradoi, etc. until he finally gets to the Machina. Dr. Peascotty has the idea to just let the Gods fix the plot. Euripides loves this idea and thanks them.
The travelers decide to stay for the festival, Euripides wins. Happy ending.

Caitlin's and Kirby's episode plan:
Dr. Peascotty and Funkman take the gobackreallyfar machine to 468 B.C.E. Funkman has been cast in Trojan Women, and needs help with his acting so Dr. Peascotty takes him to 468 B.C.E. to watch the City Dionysia and show him how acting was done in Ancient Greece.  There was a big hubub.  They realize everyone is headed to the Theatre to watch the first play, and the show is about to start.  Dr. Peascotty takes him in and explains several aspects of the theatre, such as how actors compensated for the masks and costumes, how important diction was etc.  The audience also stomps it's feet, which Peascotty explains.  Then, the third actor comes out, and the crowd goes wild.

== Page blanking ==
I noticed you blanked [[Cookbooks:Cocoa Balls]] shortly after creating it. As you see in the welcome message above, should you want to have the module removed, you can request that by tagging it with the {{tlx|delete}} template. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:43, 17 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sound test ==
If you don't have sound, even though the application's volume is turned all the way up, Puredyne's audio channels might be muted. You can unmute the audio using a simple application.

{{TODO|Add a script/example/method to generate sound from terminal.}}

=== Volume Control using a GUI ===

Open up '''Mixer''', it is located in the Puredyne menu under '''Audio -&gt; Mixer'''. 

[[Image:Xfce4-mixer.png‎]]

Make sure that the sliders of the channels you are using are not all the way at the bottom (muted) and the mute buttons off. If so, turn them up to your desired level. If you don't see any sliders at all, you might have to add the specific controls first. No worries, its simple. Click on the &quot;Select Controls&quot; button and you will be presented with a small list of controls available:

[[Image:Xfce4-mixer2.png]]

Select the ones you need (or all of them) and go back to step 1 adjusting the levels.

=== Volume Control using a terminal ===

You can also control the volume using '''alsamixer'''. Open a terminal and type '''alsamixer''' and '''ENTER'''. Alsamixer is started. 



You can navigate using your keyboards arrow-keys. Left and right arrows select different channels, and up and down arrows control the level of a channel. 

If you have no sound, it could be that one of the channels is muted. Channels that are muted have a '''MM''' at the bottom of the channel. The levels can still be turned all the way up (see image below). 

[[Image:Puredyne-alsamixer-muted.png]]

To un-mute a channel, select it using the arrow keys, and press '''M'''. The '''MM''' at the bottom of the channel should be replaced with '''00'''.

== Advanced sound module tweaking ==

For some cards some tweaking is required, for example you need to pass some arguments to the sound driver (module) in order to work properly. This is usually the case for exotic, rare or very recent hardware.

{{TODO|give the generic procedure and give an example.}}

== Reloading Alsa modules ==

There are different reasons why you would need to reload entirely the Alsa modules, for example:
* some modules crashed or your manually removed some and don't know which ones need to be reloaded
* udev is making a mess of your cards order, ie you specified in alsaconf that you want your internal sound card to be card0, but it ends up being card1 every now and then during boot time.
* something weird is going on and you need to reload the whole sound system without having to reboot

Use this command

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo alsa force-reload
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Opening a terminal ==

The terminal is a more efficient way of navigating Puredyne. Opening applications, copying files, checking your settings - you can get around the whole system in a terminal. While our documentation files will concentrate on navigating Puredyne through the graphical user interface (GUI), the advantage of using a terminal is both a better understanding of the system and, eventually, speed. Regardless of whether you will use it day-to-day, there are bound to be times when you will need a terminal. 

There are four ways to open a terminal: 

* Click on the Terminal icon [[Image:Puredyne-terminal-icon.png]] in the bottom toolbar
* Right click on the desktop and choose &quot;Open Terminal Here&quot; from the context menu
* click on the main menu icon  in the bottom toolbar and choose &quot;Terminal&quot;
* Press the following key-combination on your keyboard '''CTRL+ALT+ENTER'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Switching and adding workspaces =

Puredyne gives you four desktop workspace areas as a default. Users of systems with a single desktop workspace might find getting used to four of them tricky at first – the workspaces look the same and it can be easy to lose windows by forgetting where you’ve put them. However, the advantage is that you have more space to spread your applications. Give it a try! 

== Switching workspaces ==

There are three ways to switch between workspaces: 

# use the mouse to select one of the desktops, in the row of grey desktop images on the lower right hand part of the screen. The darkest desktop icon is the one you are currently on. 
[[Image:Puredyne-workspaces.png]]
# Use '''Ctrl+Alt+Arrowkey left''' and '''Ctrl+Alt+Arrowkey right''' to move from desktop to desktop
# You can also switch workspaces with your function keys: '''CTL+F1 (or F2, F3, F4)'''

== Adding workspaces ==

To increase or decrease the number of workspaces you have: 

* In the main Puredyne menu, choose Settings -&gt; Workspaces 
* Enter the number of workspaces you would like in the number box and click '''close'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Starting applications is easy! 

Use the main Puredyne menu by right clicking on your desktop, and navigate the applications by their grouping – Multimedia, Graphics, Network, etc. Select the application you would like to start. You start the application by clicking on it in the menu.

You can also start applications from the terminal.[[Puredyne/Terminal| Open a terminal]], type the name of the application and ENTER.

== Switching between applications ==

When you have multiple applications running, you can switch between them with '''Alt+Tab'''. 

[[Image:Puredyne-switch-apps.png]]

Keep the '''Alt''' key pressed and hit '''Tab''' multiple times to see the focus switch from one application to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Changing Mouse Settings = 

To alter the settings of your mouse, go to the pure:dyne menu (by right clicking on the desktop) and go to '''Settings''' and select '''Mouse'''. In this application you can change the behavior of your mouse.

[[Image:Puredyne-mouse-settings.png]]

You can set the mouse to '''left handed''' or '''right handed''', change the motion settings (making the mouse more or less responsive), change the '''drag and drop threshold''' and last but not least adjust the '''double click speed'''.

In the '''cursor''' tab, you can change the size and appearance of your cursor. 

In the '''accessibility''' tab you can turn on mouse emulation. You can for instance provide alternative keyboard sequences for cursor movement and mouse button operations if you are unable to operate a mouse.

To configure Puredyne to use the correct timezone, [[Puredyne/Terminal|open a terminal]], type the following and follow the instructions on screen: 
    &lt;code&gt;tzselect&lt;/code&gt;


Alternatively, you can also use dpkg, the Debian package utility to change this setting system-wide with the folling command:

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Adding new Users and Groups = 

== Users and Groups ==

Access to a Linux system is based on users and groups. You need a user account and password to login. Every user also belongs to one or more groups. A group is a set of users who are &quot;alike&quot;. For example, a group named  '''audio''' might contain all users who work with audio and need access to the soundcard of a computer, while the group named '''plugdev''' might contain all users who need automount of pluggable storage devices. What groups you are in determines which files and hardware you can access and how you can access them. When you login, Linux remembers who you are, and makes access decisions based on your identity. The '''whoami''' command displays the current user. The '''groups''' command displays the user's groups.

    &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;groups&lt;/code&gt;

== Adding New Users ==

You can add new users with the '''adduser''' command. Open a terminal, go '''root''' and type '''adduser''' followed by the desired username. You will be prompted for a password for this new user, and various other information (full name, initial home directory, etc.).

    &lt;code&gt;adduser luther&lt;/code&gt;

== Adding a User to a Group ==

When you create a new user, s/he is only part of one group, his/her own. This user will therefore not have  permission to access any other files besides his/her own, and will not be able to fully access certain hardware, such as cdrom, modem, sound and video card. To give a user these rights, you need to add him/her to the groups s/he needs access to.

The default Live CD user, lintian, has access to the following groups:

    &lt;code&gt;lintian dialout cdrom floppy audio video plugdev powerdev&lt;/code&gt;

To add a new user to an existing group, use '''adduser''' again, followed by the username and name of the group you want to add the user to. To add luther to group audio, go root and do:

    &lt;code&gt;adduser luther audio&lt;/code&gt;

To add a user to multiple groups at once, use '''usermod''', followed by '''-G''' and the names of the groups, then '''-a''' and the name of the user. Use a comma between the group names, no space! Another luther example: 

    &lt;code&gt;usermod -G dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,video,plugdev,powerdev -a luther &lt;/code&gt;

== Adding groups ==

You can add new groups using the '''addgroup''' command, followed by the name of the group. And you can remove groups with '''groupdel'''. 

    &lt;code&gt;addgroup &lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;groupdel &lt;/code&gt;

== Changing Passwords ==

To change your own or another users password, use '''passwd''' followed by the name of the user. To change the password for user luther, you go '''root''' and type '''passwd luther''', you will be prompted for the new password twice.

    &lt;code&gt;passwd luther&lt;/code&gt;

== Removing Users ==

You can remove users from a system using the '''deluser''' command. Open a terminal, go '''root''' and type '''deluser''' followed by some options (depending on your wished) and the name of the user to be removed. To view all options of deluser, type '''man deluser'''. 

For instance, to remove user &quot;luther&quot; and his home folder, and making a backup  of all files contained in the userhome and the mailspool-file to a file named luther.tar.bz2 or luther.tar.gz, you type:

    &lt;code&gt;deluser  --remove-home --backup luther&lt;code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Installing New Software =
To install new softare, you can use '''aptitude'''. Aptitude is an application that makes installing and removing software packages easy. 

[[Puredyne/Terminal|Open a terminal]] and type '''sudo aptitude''', to start aptitude as root. Aptitude is started and should look like this:

[[Image:Puredyne-aptitude.png]]

As an example, we'll install figlet, a small ascii art text banner generator. To find figlet in aptitude, type '''/''' (slash). A search form appears.

[[Image:Puredyne-aptitude-2.png]]

Type '''figlet''' and press '''ENTER'''. You wil see figlet listed, selected by a white bar. In front of the name of the package, is a letter. The letter '''i''' means it is already included, '''p''' means it is not installed yet.

[[Image:Puredyne-aptitude-3.png]]

Press '''+''' (shift plus) to select the package for installing. The package listing turns green.

[[Image:Puredyne-aptitude-4.png]]

Type '''g''' to start the installation. You see an overview of what aptitude plans to do when you execute the installation. Purple packages will be removed, green ones will be installed. Type '''g''' again to execute the installation. When the installation is finished, aptitude prompts you with '''press any key to continue'''. After that you return to the first screen of aptitude. 

To quit aptitude, type '''q'''

[[Image:Puredyne-aptitude-5.png]]

To test if your installation of figlet was successful, in a terminal type: 


    &lt;code&gt;figlet it worked!&lt;/code&gt;

This should have the following stunning result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Setting Correct DPI =

In rare cases, the display of fonts by the system is incorrect. They are displayed either too big or too small. To fix this, you need to find out what the current Dots Per Inch (DPI) settings are, and what they should be. 

Adjusting the DPI can be done if you have installed pure:dyne on your machine. You could also do it when using the Live CD, but the new settings will be lost after a reboot.

== What is DPI? ==

Dots per inch (DPI) is a measure of spatial resolution, the number of individual dots or pixels within the span of one linear inch (2.54 cm). It refers to the physical size of an image when it is reproduced as a real physical entity, for example printed onto paper, or displayed on a monitor. 

A correct DPI setting is important. It determines how fonts are rendered on your screen. Linux applications use the DPI reported by the X server when converting from font point size to pixels. &quot;Sans 10&quot; will be a smaller number of pixels if your X server is configured at 75 DPI than if it is at 100 DPI. So if your DPI setting is too low, all fonts are displayed too small and vice versa.


== Find out DPI settings ==


To see what DPI the X server is currently set to, open a terminal and type '''xdpyinfo | grep resolution''':

    &lt;code&gt;
    xdpyinfo | grep resolution
     resolution:    96x96 dots per inch
    &lt;/code&gt;


The best way to find out what the DPI setting '''should''' be, is to grab a tape measure or ruler and measure the size of your screen (in inches). To determine the proper DPI, divide the horizontal screen resolution by the horizontal dimension in '''inches''' and the same for the vertical resolution and dimension.


''To convert '''millimeters''' to '''inches''', calculate using '''1 millimeter = 0.03937 inch''' ''


For instance, a 17 inch screen with a resolution of 1280x1024 should have a DPI of:

1280 / 13.3 = 96 DPI 

1024 / 10.6 = 96 DPI 

DPI = 96 x 96


If this is the same as the result xdpyinfo gave you, your system is correctly configured. If the results are different, you need to find out what dimensions the system &quot;thinks&quot; your screen has.


To find out if the X server has the same ideas about the size of your screen use '''xdpyinfo ''' again, this time with the argument '''dimension'''. Note that this time the size is in '''millimeters''', just to make it more confusing ;):

    &lt;code&gt;
    xdpyinfo | grep dimension
      dimensions:    1280x1024 pixels (338x270 millimeters)
    &lt;/code&gt;


''To convert '''inches''' to '''millimeters''', calculate using '''1 inch = 25.4 millimeters''' ''


If the real size of the screen differs from the results xpdyinfo gives you, you need to tell the X server what size the screen really is.

== Changing display size in xorg.conf ==

As root, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the display size in millimeters, to '''Section &quot;Monitor&quot;''' (replacing the values with your own):


    &lt;code&gt;DisplaySize	338      270&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Mount Local Partitions =

In pure:dyne the mounting of local partitions is automatic (supported filsystem include FAT16/32, NTFS, HFS+, ext3 and reiserfs). When a partition is mounted a partition, you can read from and write to it. If it is a linux partition, you have to be root to write to it.
''
To prevent trouble later on, only write to a mounted linux partition if you know how to properly change permissions of files''

In case you need to manually mount some partitions, here is how to do it:

== Using Command Line ==

You can also mount a local partition manually, using the command line. First you must make a mount point. The standard place for mounting storage devices is in '''/media'''. Go root and make a mount point like this: 


    &lt;code&gt;sudo su
          mkdir /media/my-partition
    &lt;/code&gt;

If you don't know what your partition is called, you can type:

    &lt;code&gt;fdisk -l&lt;/code&gt;

[[Image:Puredyne-mount-partition.png]]

This gives you a list of all your partitions, their size, type, etc. Choose the one you want to mount, and mount it like this (replacing sda6 with the name of your partition):


    &lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda6 /media/my-partition&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Play Music =

If you double click on a music file (mp3 or ogg for example), a default music application will open to play your file. 

[[Image:Puredyne-soundfile.png]]

If you right click on your music file, you can choose the application you would like to use to play the file. We recommend choosing Audacious for a quick and easy, light music player. 


=== Opening Audacious to Play Music ===

[[Image:Puredyne-audacious.png]]

* Right click on your music file, and select 'Open with'
* Choose 'Open With Audacious'
* Once open, you can press play, stop, move forward and backward using the simple graphical interface


=== Making a Playlist ===

[[Image:Puredyne-audacious-2.png]]

* You can create a music playlist by clicking on the list icon on the right of the player
* A playlist viewer will open. Drag the music files that you wish to add to the playlist, into the list area 
* You can rearrange the files by dragging and dropping them in the sequence you like


=== Playing music in terminal ===

If you prefer a simpler solution you can try [[http://moc.daper.net/  mocp]] for playing any kind of audio (Ogg Vorbis, mp3, FLAC, WAVE, AU, AIFF, SVX, SPH, IRC, VOC).

Simply type mocp in terminal will start it. You can browse trough your file system and find the file you want to play. 

On the left you have your files and folder and on the right you have your playlist. 

* arrows = Browse up and down
* tab = change from the file list to play list
* space = play/stop

* a = add to playlist
* d = remove from playilst
* r = repeat
* s = shuffle
* h = help
* q = quit

You can also add a full folder by pressing 'a' on a folder - it will go trough all your folder recursively. You can also use theme to change the colors, and config file. 


=== I don't have sound! === 

If you don't have sound, even though the application's volume is turned all the way up, pure:dyne's audio settings might be muted. Have a look at [[Puredyne/Sound| getting sound to work]] for details on how to solve the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Burn CDs and DVDs =

Burning CDs and DVDs on pure:dyne is very simple. In this small tutorial we'll explain how to use [http://www.gnome.org/projects/brasero Brasero]. 


Brasero allows you to create audio and data CD/DVDs, copy CD/DVDs, and burn an existing CD/DVD image to disc. When you start the application, you can choose on of these 4 options. 

== Audio and Data CD/DVD ==

First you need to put an empty, writable CD/DVD in your CD/DVD drive.

To add files to your project, use the browser panel within brasero. Simply browse for the files you want to include and either double click, or drag them from the browser panel to the project window on the right. 

When you start adding files to your project, the bar at the bottom of Brasero indicates how much space your files take up (or time, in the case of an audio CD/DVD). When your project gets too big, the end of the green bar turns red and you receive a warning. To remove files, click and drag them out of the brasero window and release your mouse button. Your cursor will change into a trashcan and the file has been removed.

When you are finished adding files or music to your project, click on the '''burn''' button. In the disc burning setup you can select your CD/DVD writer and give your project a title. To finally start the burning process, click on '''burn'''. 

If the burn button is not available, this means something is wrong. Perhaps the CD or DVD you inserted in your drive is not writable or has already got data on it. Check the disc and try again.

== Disc Copy ==

To copy a CD/DVD, insert the CD/DVD you want to copy into your disc drive. Start Brasero and select '''Disc Copy'''. When you click '''Copy''', the disc you inserted will be copied to a disc image. After this is done, Brasero will prompt you to insert the empty CD/DVD (your disc drive will eject the original CD/DVD). Insert the emtpy CD/DVD and Brasero will start burning the copied disc image to the empty CD/DVD.

If the burning does not start automatically, and you get an error, the CD/DVD you inserted is probably not writable. 

== Disc Image ==

Insert an empty CD/DVD into your disc drive. After starting Brasero, choose '''Burn image'''. In the Image burning setup, click on '''path''' and select the puredyne iso file. After that press '''Burn'''.

If the burn button is not available, this means something is wrong. Perhaps the CD or DVD you inserted in your drive is not writable or has already got data on it. Check the disc and try again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Connect to Internet =

When you boot from the liveCD, and you already have a network cable plugged, you should be connected automatically (if there is a DHCP server present on the local network). If you plug your network cable after you have booted, the system should attempt to get you connected as well.

You can also check if your connection is working by checking the status of the network manager icon on the bottom right of the desktop in the system tray. From you can also configure extra parameters (ie, fixed IP, gateway, etc).

Similarly if you have wireless network card installed that is recognised by Puredyne then the network manager will automatically scan for access-points and you can select one from the systray icon. Your settings and keys will be kept until you reboot, unless you have a persistence mode on.


== Configuration from the GUI ==

Using Puredyne, you can connect to Internet in several ways. The easiest way is to use the '''Network Manager applet''' in the system tray in the bottom right corner of the screen. It allows you to quickly configure your settings and provides a simple user interface. You can save the network settings of different locations, allowing you to quickly change them when you move from place to place. 

Another way to connect is by using the terminal, using '''ifconfig''' for wired and '''iwconfig''' for wireless connections.


=== Wired Connection using Network Manager applet ===

The Network Manager applet is located in the lower right corner of the screen and, when you are not connected to any network, looks like 2 computers with a white cross on red background:

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-8.png]]

If there is a DHCP server present on your network, all you have to do is plug the ethernet cable into your computer and wait a few seconds. You will see an icon [[Image:Puredyne-nm-7.png]] which indicates that network manager is trying to get an IP address. You should automatically receive an IP, and once its done [[Image:Puredyne-nm-5.png]] you are connected. 

If there is no DHCP server present, you need to set an IP manually. Right-click the network manager icon [[Image:Puredyne-nm-6.png]] in the system tray and choose '''Edit Connections'''.

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-1.png]]

You'll be presented with an editor for all types of network connection. We'll choose the '''wired''' tab to edit our ethernet connection settings.

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-2.png]]

Click on the '''Edit''' button to edit the default connection (note: you can of course also use '''Add''' to create a new connection).

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-3.png]]

Choose the '''IPv4 Settings''' tab and select '''Manual''' from the drop-down menu. Fill in a valid IP, Subnet mask and Gateway address. If you are not sure what to fill in, ask your network administrator. Click Apply to activate your settings. You might be asked to provide the administrator password to change system-wide network settings. Once you're done, you can click on the network manager icon in the system tray again and choose the entry you have just edited.


=== Wireless Connection using Network Manager ===

To connect to a wireless network all you have to do is use the network manager applet in the lower right corner again. Left-click on the icon [[Image:Puredyne-nm-6.png]] and you will be presented with a context menu of available wireless networks.

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-9.png]]

Choose one you want to connect to and, in case that the network is secured with a key, enter the key into the dialog that pops up and wait until the icon turns into a couple of vertical blue bars. [[Image:Puredyne-nm-4.png]] Voila. If you didn't get connected, check and re-enter the password or select another network. Note: if this is the first time you choose a network you might be asked to enter a password for the default keyring in which the password will be stored so you don't have to re-enter it the next time you connect to the network. 


== Configuration from the command line ==

=== Wired Connection ===

First, you need to find out what the name of your network interface is (if you already know, skip to the next step).

    &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt;


dmesg (diagnostic message) prints out a whole list of messages from the system. If you just plugged your network cable, one of the last messages should be something like:

    &lt;code&gt;e100: eth0: e100_watchdog: link up, 100 Mbs, full duplex&lt;/code&gt;

The standard name is eth0 but it could be eth1, eth2, etc.

Now you can activate the network interface and ask for an IP (only works if a DHCP server is present). sudo means that you execute the following command as root.

    &lt;code&gt;
          sudo ifconfig eth0 up
          sudo dhclient eth0
    &lt;/code&gt;

After dhclient has given you an IP, you are ready to go online!

If there is no DHCP server present, you need to set your IP manually. Find out which IP is available (ask a system administrator if you don't know) and do (replace the IP with your own):

    &lt;code&gt;
          sudo ifconfig eth0 up
          sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.100
    &lt;/code&gt;

To test if you are indeed connected, you can ping a website or IP.

    &lt;code&gt;ping puredyne.goto10.org&lt;/code&gt;



=== Wireless Connection ===

Unfortunately, in pure:dyne, not every wireless network card is supported. To find out if your network card is supported, type '''dmesg''' and see if your wireless network interface appears in the list. If your wireless card needs to be turned on, do this first!).

    &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt;

If it appears, you should be able to connect. First you need to activate the network interface (dmesg should have given you its name):

    &lt;code&gt;sudo ifconfig eth2 up&lt;/code&gt;

After that you need to connect to a specific wireless network. This is done with '''iwconfig'''. If you want to see a list of all the networks around you, use '''iwlist scan''':

    &lt;code&gt;sudo iwlist scan&lt;/code&gt;

[[Image:Puredyne-nm-10.png]]

Networks with '''Encryption key: off''' are open and without password. '''essid''' is the identifying name of a wireless network. Replace my-network with the name of your network, and eth2 with the name of your wireless network interface. dhclient only works if a DHCP server is present. 

    &lt;code&gt;
          sudo iwconfig eth2 essid my-network
          sudo dhclient eth2
    &lt;/code&gt;

After '''dhclient''' has given you an IP, you are ready to go online!

If there is no DHCP server present, you need to set your IP manually. Find out which IP is available (ask a system administrator if you don't know) and do (replace the IP with your own):

    &lt;code&gt;
          sudo ifconfig eth2 up
          sudo ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.100 
          sudo iwconfig eth2 essid my-network
    &lt;/code&gt;

To test if you are indeed connected, you can '''ping''' a website or IP.

    &lt;code&gt;ping www.puredyne.goto10.org&lt;/code&gt;

=== Encrypted/closed networks ===

Networks with '''Encryption key:on''' can either be WEP or WPA encrypted. Here we'll only discuss how to join WEP encrypted networks. You can connect using the same command as before, except you need to provide the password of the network. 

There are two ways to enter a password, in '''ascii''' and '''hexadecimal'''. Ascii is a character encoding based on the English alphabet, an ascii password could be for example &quot;topsecret&quot;. Hexadecimal is a numeral system with a base 16. The hexadecimal version of &quot;topsecret&quot; would be &quot;74:6f:70:73:65:63:72:65:74&quot;. If you enter an ascii password, use '''s:my-password''', if you use a hexadecimal one, you can leave out the '''s:'''. Replace my-password with yours.

    &lt;code&gt;
          sudo iwconfig eth2 essid my-network key s:my-password
          sudo dhclient eth2
    &lt;/code&gt;

To test if you are indeed connected, you can '''ping''' a website or IP.

    &lt;code&gt;
          ping puredyne.goto10.org
    &lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a workflow process that allows an internal team to review web content before it is transferred to a public web site.  When the documents have been marked &quot;approved for publication&quot; they must be transferred to a public web server in a controlled way.

== Methods ==
There are many ways to transfer XML documents from one server to another.  This document will describe an set of basic methods that may vary based on your local configuration.  In this document the following figure will be used.

[[Image:XQuery-publishing-dmz.png|border|center|800px|alt=Configuration of Internal Content Management Systems and Publishing Server in DMZ|Configuration of Internal Content Management Systems and Publishing Server in DMZ]]

== Simple Publication Workflows ==
Many organizations have strict policy guidelines on who has permission to publish content to a public web site.  Before content is transferred to a public web site.  Documents that intent to be published typically go through a series of stages:

* '''draft''' - documents that are in very early stages of a quality control process
* '''under-review''' - documents that are being reviewed by a editorial team for quality such as content quality, spelling and typographical errors
* '''approved-for-publication''' - documents that have been approved for publication on a public web site.

All documents that have been marked '''approved-for-publication''' can then be transferred from an internal content site to the public web server.  In general only specified users with specified roles are allowed to mark documents as '''approved-for-publication'''.

== Simple Publishing Scripts ==

There are several options to creating publishing scripts.  We will begin with a very simple script and then add features.

=== Publishing with HTTP PUTs and DELETEs ===
This simplest way to publish documents is to use the eXist (or EXQuery) [httpclient http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient] library.  This library has PUT and DELETE operations that can be used to problematically add and delete web content on your publication server.

Here is an example of the httpclient:put() function:

   httpclient:put($url as xs:anyURI,
                  $content as node(),
                  $persist as xs:boolean,
                  $request-headers as element()?) item()

'''Pros:''' very simple to use
'''Cons:''' no central audit trail of who published what and when

=== Publishing with a POST service ===
An alternative is to create a central publishing service on your public web site that will coordinate
all publishing events.  This can be done by using the HTTP POST client function and then writing a single
publication server to catch and log all publication events.

   httpclient:post($url as xs:anyURI,
                  $content as node(),
                  $persist as xs:boolean,
                  $request-headers as element()?) item()

You must remember to use the cast to xs:anyURI for the URL. For example:

   let $post-status :=
      httpclient:post(xs:anyURI('http://example.com/db/get-doc.xq'), $doc-to-publish, true(), ())

=== Publishing with a Callback ===
It is frequently easier to instruct a web service on the public web server that you now have a new resource that is ready to published but not push the entire file to the public web site in the request.  Only a URL to the resource is sent to the public web server that includes four parameters:

* the user publishing the document
* any authentication credentials
* the type (publish or delete)
* a comments on the reason for publication or deletion
* the identifier of the document to be pulled from the central content management system by the public web server or the id of the document to be deleted

The public web server then calls a function to load that resource from
the content management system inside the system.  This can be done with standard URL parameters.  Note that in this case the passwords will be in the web log files.

Example of getting URL parameters with: publish-with-callback.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: The user that will execute the login :)
let $user := request:get-parameter('user', '')

(: The pass that will execute the login :)
let $pass := request:get-parameter('pass', '')

(: The full URL of the document we are going to bring over :)
let $url := request:get-parameter('url', '')

(: the /db location we are going to put the new document into :)
let $db-loc := request:get-parameter('db-loc', '')

(: This is the document fetch from the internal CMS server :)
let $get-doc := doc($url)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this style is more secure since only documents that exist on the internal content management system are candidates for publishing.

=== Publishing Audit Logs ===
If you use a central web service for publishing you can now log all publishing events in a single centralized log file.  This file can then
be used to report and audit who changed what content on the public web site and when.

The following example shows how all publishing events can be added to a log file that shows what users published what files and when they were published or deleted.  In the example below the type code should be set to be publish or delete.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $audit-log :=
&lt;publish-event&gt;
   &lt;type-code&gt;publish|delete&lt;/type-code&gt;
   &lt;user&gt;{$user}&lt;/user&gt;
   &lt;dateTime&gt;{current-dateTime()}&lt;/dateTime&gt;
   &lt;db-loc&gt;{$db-loc}&lt;/db-loc&gt;
&lt;/publish-event&gt;

(: check that the log file exists and if not then create it :)
let $check-log-exists :=
  if (doc-available($log-file))
     then ()
     else
        xmldb:store(
           functx:substring-before-last($log-file, '/'), 
           functx:substring-after-last($log-file, '/'), 
           &lt;publish-events/&gt; )

(: this inserts the audit record at the end of the log file :)
let $update := update insert $audit-log into doc($log-file)/publish-events
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Using Certificates ===
It is sometimes not possible to create a secure connection between an internal CMS systems and the publishing web site.  An alternative method is to provide certificates to each system that is authorized to publish documents to the publishing server.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Autobooting into your application =

This is useful if you have an art installation you want to be able to turn on and automatically run your program, or if you want different setups to choose from (starting without a graphical desktop for example).

== The simple way ==
is to use the autostarted app list in xfce, which is found in the main menu. Here you can add commands to be executed when xfce starts.

== The more complex way ==
This way we use the GRUB bootloader to choose between different setups called 'runlevels' (explained below). With this method it is possible to choose exactly what processes we want the computer to run.This is mostly taken from [http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/801 nescivi's howto on booting into SuperCollider], and will show an example of loading &quot;emacs -sclang&quot; without the graphical interface. A small program called screen is also used, which allows you to have a shell, that you can exit (but any programs that are running will keep running) and resume later on, even after having logged out and in again.

=== GRUB ===
In GRUB you have to add an entry to boot into the runlevel you want.
In the file /boot/grub/menu.lst, copy the field of your pure:dyne entry and at the end of the the kernel line add the number of the runlevel you are going to use (3 is a good choice), for example:

   title myKoolInstallation
   root(hd0,0)
   kernel /live/vmlinuz1 ramdisk_size=100000 boot=live username=lintian persistent hostname=puredyne vga=791 3
   initrd /live/initrd1.img
   boot


=== Runlevel ===
Runlevels are basically a series of scripts that will be executed when booting or halting the system. On Debian systems, you will find these in directories called /etc/rcN.d where &quot;N&quot; is the number of the runlevel. Choose one of the runlevels that aren't really used (2 is used by Debian as a default, 6 is usually connected to shutting down), and adapt that runlevel.
In this directory you have to place all the symlinks for scripts that need to be executed and you can take away the ones you don't need (for example the one starting the graphical interface).
To start screen, emacs and sc, make a symlink like:

   sudo ln -s /home/lintian/mystartupscript.sh S99sclangpatch



=== Startup script ===

Make a file called mystartupscript.sh in your home directory and fill it with this:

   echo &quot;starting sclang script&quot;
   cd /dev
   /sbin/MAKEDEV console
   echo &quot;made devices&quot;
   chmod 666 /dev/console
   route add -net default gw 129.102.145.254
   cd /home/linitan/
   su lintian -c &quot;/usr/bin/jackd -R -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p256 -n2 &amp;&quot; #start jack
   su lintian -c &quot;/usr/bin/screen -c /home/lintian/.screenrc&quot;
   echo &quot;sending command&quot;
   su lintian -c &quot;/usr/bin/screen -X screen -t supercollider 1 bash startemacs.sh&quot; #start supercollider
   echo &quot;command sent&quot;


then make the file executable for all users:

   sudo chmod 755 mystartupscript.sh


=== .screen ===
Make a file called .screen in your home directory and fill it with this:

   startup_message off
   console off
   bash
   detach
 

then make the file executable for all users:

   sudo chmod 755 .screen


=== startemacs.sh ===

(SuperCollider specific)
In this file you have to set a couple of paths, so libraries can be found. And you have to start emacs with the startup file of the user, as that is where you'll probably have put the special sclang-commands.
Make a file called startemacs.sh in your home directory and fill it with this:

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

   export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH

   emacs -u lintian -sclang



then make the file executable for all users:

   sudo chmod 755 startemacs.sh
   

=== .sclang.sc ===

(SuperCollider specific)
This file should already exist in your home directory and be configured to your needs. Add this part at the end to load your patch:


   fork { 
	0.1.wait; 
	s.quit;
	0.5.wait; 	
	s.boot;
	1.wait;
	
	s.doWhenBooted( {
		{  &quot;/home/lintian/SuperCollider/startMyCoolPatch.scd&quot;.load }.defer;
		});
   };


=== Disabling the graphical desktop ===
To prevent xfce from starting we have to remove a symlink in the runlevel directory:

   sudo rm /etc/rc3.d/S30gdm


=== Shutting down ===
Currently pure:dyne prompts you to 'remove any disk in the tray and push ENTER' as a part of the shut down procedure. This will change soon, but in the mean time we can fix it with a small hack.

   sudo nano /etc/rc0.d/S89live-initramfs

and in this file, remove this part:

   if [ -z ${QUICKREBOOT} ]; then
       if [ -x /usr/bin/eject ]
       then
               eject -p -m /live/image &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
               [ &quot;$prompt&quot; ] || return 0
       fi
       stty sane &lt; /dev/console
       # XXX - i18n
       echo &quot;Please remove the disc and close the tray (if any) then press ENTER: &quot; &gt; /dev/console
       if [ -x /sbin/usplash_write ]; then
           /sbin/usplash_write &quot;TIMEOUT 86400&quot;
           /sbin/usplash_write &quot;TEXT-URGENT Please remove the disc, close the tray (if any)&quot;
           /sbin/usplash_write &quot;TEXT-URGENT and press ENTER to continue&quot;
       fi
       read x &lt; /dev/console
   fi



You might also want to turn off the computer with the power button. In which case, edit...

=== And it runs... ===
Now the whole thing should be running as desired and you can login to the computer after it has booted. Type:

   screen -r

to enter the app you have started.

=== Other tweaks ===
If you do not want to attach a keyboard and mouse to the computer, it may be necessary to make a change in the BIOS of the computer, to ensure that the computer doesn't halt when there is no keyboard found. Look for an option concerning &quot;halt on any errors&quot; or the like, and make sure it will not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Sharing Files across local network =

There are various ways to share files across local networks, some of which are more complex than others. For most compatibility with all types of host systems (i.e. Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, *BSD) use the Samba protocol (explained further down). For exchanging files between GNU/Linux (and even OS X) computers, other methods can be much easier and quicker to setup. We'll cover these solutions first, then deal with a simple Samba setup.

== sshfs ==

One of the most secure and quickest methods is sshfs, a fuse based filesystem that uses ssh. First, install sshfs by [[Puredyne/Terminal | opening a terminal]] and typing:

   sudo aptitude install sshfs

When its done installing, create a mount point:

   mkdir mnt
   cd mnt &amp;&amp; mkdir mymount

You can then mount any directory from hosts that run the ssh daemon (sshd). Here, we mount the home directory of user lintian with the IP address of 192.168.1.55 on the mount-point mymount:

   sshfs -P 22 lintian@192.168.1.55: mymount/

Once this is done, you can do operations like ''cp'' or ''ls'' in the ''mymount/'' directory, just like any other directory in your home. This way, you can also access all files in lintians home directory using the file-manager [[Puredyne/Thunar | Thunar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Frequently Asked Questions =

'''What is the default login and password?''' The default login and password are ''lintian'' and ''live''. There is no root password.

'''I booted the live CD, but where are my files??? ''' When booting the Live CD, your files are not displayed automatically. You have to mount the part of your hard disc that contains your files. See [[Puredyne/Mount Local Partitions | this page]] for instructions.

'''The sound is not working. Why?''' Alsamixer is probably muted. type alsamixer in a terminal and press &quot;m&quot; on the channels you want to unmute (probably Main and PCM). Use your left and right arrow keys to switch between channels. Use your up and down arrow keys to alter the volume. Press ESC to exit alsamixer.

'''Are you going to support &lt;insert favourite piece of hardware here&gt;?''' If this hardware is supported on GNU/Linux and if you're nice we'll have a look and try to make it work. Give us a beep on the [http://lists.goto10.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/puredyne pure:dyne Mailing List].

'''Are you going to distribute &lt;insert favourite software&gt;?''' Short answer: If it makes sense yes. Long answer: Puredyne aims to provide a stable and optimzed platform for artists working in the fields of real-time audio and video processing. Even though some usual &quot;office tools&quot; are provided (browser, mailer, spreadsheet, text editor ...) it is not our goal to provide *all* of them. It is possible though for a user to install these manually and even share them with other Puredyne and Ubuntu system users.

'''How should I report a bug?''' Check out how to report bugs, defects or suggest enhancements [[Puredyne/Report Bugs | here]]. If you are having problems with this, you can always send us a message on the [http://lists.goto10.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/puredyne pure:dyne Mailing List].

'''I dont like this user:pass, can I change it?''' You can create as many new users as you want. Open a terminal and type: sudo useradd -m -G users,floppy,disk,lp,dialout,audio,video,usb,wheel -d /home/&lt;USERNAME&gt; &lt;USERNAME&gt;. You can then change the pass with passwd &lt;USERNAME&gt; Log out and try your new user!

'''Does pure:dyne use a realtime kernel?''' If you're using the live install (liveHD, liveUSB or liveCD/DVD), then yes you are using a RT kernel and the system is already configured to take advantage of that.

'''I see ''clocksource tsc unstable'' while booting, can I fix it?''' Yes, it should be harmless but you can fix that by booting with ''clocksource=hpet''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reporting problems or suggestions ==
The &quot;launchpad&quot; site is where we keep track of puredyne bugs/questions/feature-requests.

If you find a problem, or have a suggestion for improvement, add an item to the &quot;bug tracker&quot;:

* https://bugs.launchpad.net/puredyne-live


== Writing a bug report ==
The goal of any bug report is to let a developer know about a defect in his/her software, so s/he can fix it. The key to doing this succesfully is to describe the bug is such a way, that the developer can recreate the problem, find the cause and remove the cause to eliminate the problem. Writing clearly and being precise is essential. When you fill in the detailed description part of a new ticket, please keep the following points in mind.

=== How to describe the issue ===
* The developer has to be able to recreate the problem you encountered in order to fix it. If you can't sit next to him/her to show what went wrong, the next best thing is to give '''detailed instructions''' on '''how they can make the problem happen'''.
* Not every computer is the same, so always include a '''description of your particular hardware'''. At least include what brand and computer model you used, and any other relevant hardware. For instance if you had a sound related problem, report what sound card you used. 
* '''Include the version number of pure:dyne''' you are using, and if the problem relates to a software, also include the version number of the software.
* '''Include complete error messages''', if you get any. Don't leave out beginnings or ends, just copy and paste the whole message. These messages provide essential information for the developer.
* To create a ''clean'' bug report, don't try to fix the problem yourself before reporting the problem. Often you make the problem worse or at least harder to describe. So when something goes wrong, '''freeze''' and visit the URL above :)
* If you think you know what is the problem, please include your ideas! But don't forget to still include all other details and error messages related to the bug.
* '''Write clearly and be precise''' (don't forget, you are writing to a programmer ;))

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronominal verbs are verbs that, put simply, include pronouns. These pronouns are ''me, te, se, nous'', and ''vous'' and are used as either direct objects or indirect objects, depending on the verb that they modify. When pronominal verbs are conjugated in perfect tenses, être is used as the auxiliary verb. There are three types of pronominal verbs: reflexive verbs, reciprocal verbs, and naturally pronominal verbs.

==Reflexive Verbs==
Reflexive verbs reflect the action on the subject.
*Je ''me'' dépense. - I exert ''myself''.
*Nous ''nous'' dépensons. - We exert ''ourselves''.
*Ils ''se'' dépensent. - They exert ''themselves''.
Reflexive verbs can also be used as infinitives.
*Je vais me dépenser. - I'm going to exert myself.
Either the conjugated verb or the infinitive can be negated each with slightly different meanings.
*Je ne vais pas me dépenser. - I'm not going to exert myself.

In perfect tenses, the past participles agree with the direct object pronoun, but not the indirect object pronoun, in gender and plurality. Therefore it would only agree when the reflexive pronoun is the direct object. Also remember that the past participle does not agree with the direct object if it goes after the verb.
*Elle s'est blessée. - She injured herself.
*Nous nous sommes blessé(e)s. - We injured ourselves.
*Elle s'est cassé les orteils. - She broke her toes.
*Nous nous sommes cassé les orteils. - We broke our toes.

==Reciprocal Verbs==
With reciprocal verbs, people perform actions to each other.
*Nous nous rencontrons. - We meet each other.
*Like reflexive verbs, the past participle of reciprocal verbs agrees in number and gender with the direct object if it goes before the verb. It therefore agrees with all reciprocal pronouns that function as direct objects.
*Nous nous sommes rencontré(e)s. - We met each other.
The reciprocal pronoun can also function as an indirect object without a direct object pronoun.
*Nous nous sommes parlé. - We spoke to each other.
*Elles se sont téléphoné. - They telephoned one another.
*Vous vous êtes écrit souvent? - You wrote to each other often?

==Naturally Pronominal Verbs==
Some verbs are pronominal without performing a reflexive or reciprocal action.
Tu t'affoles? - Are you panicking?
*In perfect tenses, these verbs agree with the direct object if it goes before the verb. Otherwise, the past participle agrees with the subject.
*Elle s'est affolée. - She panicked.
Some verbs have different meanings as pronominal verbs.
*rendre - to return, to give back
*se rendre (à) - to go (to)

==Reflexive Verbs Conjugation Patterns==

'''Reflexive Verbs''' in French are actions that one does to oneself.

They can be recognised because their infinitive form has the pronoun ''se'' in front of it or ''s''' before a vowel.

When conjugating a reflexive verb you must use the correct reflexive pronoun.

The following table shows which reflexive pronoun to use with different forms of the verb:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Subject 
! Reflexive Pronoun
|- 
| je || me
|-
| tu || te
|-
| il || se
|-
| nous || nous
|-
| vous || vous
|-
| ils || se
|}

----

Here is an example conjugation of a reflexive verb:

'''se chauffer - to warm yourself up'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
! '''Present'''{{ref|present}}
! '''Passé Composé'''{{ref|passé}}
! '''Futur Proche'''{{ref|futur}}
|-
| Je '''me''' chauffe || Je '''me''' suis chauffé || Je vais '''me''' chauffer
|-
| Tu '''te''' chauffes || Tu '''t''''es chauffé(e) || Tu vas '''te''' chauffer
|-
| Il '''se''' chauffe || Il '''s''''est chauffé || Il va '''se''' chauffer
|-
| Elle '''se''' chauffe || Elle '''s''''est chauffée || Elle va '''se''' chauffer
|-
| Nous '''nous''' chauffons || Nous '''nous''' sommes chauffé(e)s || Nous allons '''nous''' chauffer
|-
| Vous '''vous''' chauffez || Vous '''vous''' êtes chauffé(e)(s) || Vous allez '''vous''' chauffer
|-
| Ils '''se''' chauffent || Ils '''se''' sont chauffés || Ils vont '''se''' chauffer
|-
| Elles '''se''' chauffent || Elles '''se''' sont chauffées || Elles vont '''se''' chauffer
|}

{{note|present}}'''1.''' The futur simple, passé simple, imperfect, conditional and subjunctive are all conjugated with the reflexive pronoun in the same position as in the present.

{{note|passé}}'''2.''' All reflexive verbs take être in the passé composé and therefore have an ''e'' added to the past participle for females and an ''s'' for plural.

{{note|futur}}'''3.''' When a reflexive verb is put as an infinitive behind any other verb (e.g. vouloir, pouvoir, aller...) it still takes the appropriate reflexive pronoun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You spend a lot of time in French learning the grammatical rules - there are some verbs which break these rules, and they are listed below, with what they do.

Also see [[wiktionary:Category:French verbs]] and [[wiktionary:fr:Catégorie:Verbes français]].

=='''Introduction'''==

[[Image:MIT_Main_Apr09.JPG|left|thumb|161px|  Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]

''Scratch'' is open source software developed at the MIT Media Labs to enhance programming skills and creative potential for young learners.  ''Scratch'' can be downloaded easily from the [http://scratch.mit.edu ''Scratch'' Home Page] and provides a shared space for anyone to post their completed creative project.  Additionally, learners can also ''see'' as well as access the code for displayed projects which enables knowledge transfer and other ''Scratch'' programmers to pickup hints on how to create an effect.  It is an effective way to instruct younger learners to use basic programming skills to author &quot;fun&quot; projects that involve animation, repetitive movement, sound, and design effects.  ''Scratch'' projects are submitted from around the world and can be displayed in galleries that combine themes and shared concepts.  At last count, April 10, 2010, there were over 956,114 projects displayed in the galleries which can be browsed at http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries

Due to ''Scratch'' being open source software, it can be utilized within formal education.  Therefore, the ''Scratch'' website also contains resources for educators interested in using ''Scratch'' to help them find ways to incorporate the software into their instruction.

=='''Getting Started'''==

[[Image:Scratch Rainbow nevit.gif|left|thumb|120px|''Scratch'' Script]]
[[Image:Scratch Cat.png|right|thumb|200px|''Scratch'' Sprite]]


Once the free software is downloaded, a first-time user will open ''Scratch'' and find a ''Scratch'' sprite displayed at the lower right of the screen.  This is a default character for the action that will be programmed and this sprite can be exchanged for any number of other images or even a random, surprise sprite.  Likewise the default background for the action, or background stage, can be substituted with another image.  The area for program code itself can be found to the far left and this is created by dragging preset &quot;blocks&quot; or instructions over to this work area and allowing them to &quot;lock&quot; into place, one above another, creating the script for the sprite.  Within the interlocking blocks themselves any of the numeric variables can be easily changed to repeat an action a number of times for example, or to alter the position of the main sprite on the screen using the x and y axis.

The script contains code for such actions as sprite movement, sound, duration of activity and image appearance.  Without separating the blocks of code from the script, variables can be changed to alter the actions of the sprite.  This feature allows for programmers to easily view how a change in variables affects what the sprites do while the script is running.   

One of the unique features of ''Scratch'' is its ability for the final product to be interactive.  Within the code options, users can insert code that will allow for them to record sound, for example, and have the sound played, once the program is running, when a sprite is clicked with the mouse.  With this feature, and others like it, users can create games that allow for players to interact with the program, not just from a design angle, but also with the finished product itself. 

Creating and running a ''Scratch'' program is something an 8 year old can accomplish with a little bit of effort and ''Scratch'' can introduce basic programming concepts to learners as young as age 10 thereby supporting basic computer literacy skills.  

I offer this because my 7 year old grandson literally had a first-time project up and running within 30 minutes after a few basic instructions from me.  Clearly, the Media Lab researchers accomplished their goal of revealing basic programming skills, and instruction, to very young learners with minimum fuss. 

===&lt;h2&gt;Help&lt;/h2&gt;===

Should users need assistance in creating their ''Scratch'' project, the ''Scratch'' site offers a wealth of helpful information ranging from discussion boards, sample projects, FAQs and video tutorials on using features of the software.  

Once users create a ''Scratch'' account with password, they are also able to download any of the scripts that already exist for projects in the gallery, and this is often an easy method for seeing how to create a unique effect that another user has already demonstrated.  It is not considered good ''Scratch'' etiquette to download another user's entire project and rename it as your own.

=='''Applications of Scratch'''==
''Scratch'' has a variety of ways it can be used from classrooms with students to adults in a business setting.  The following sections are just a sample of how ''Scratch'' might show up in people's lives.

===&lt;h2&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;===

''Scratch's'' ability to allow students from around the world to explore modular programming in an easy, productive way supports growth in thinking logically the way real programmers do.  It supports individual creativity in building interactive games, that may contain music and videos, in a productive activity that provides immediate feedback.  By clicking on the green &quot;Go&quot;  flag at the top right of the script to start, the project will run the scripts and display the actions in the stage area within seconds.  By clicking on the red &quot;Stop&quot; button placed at the end of the block instructions, they can abort any action that immediately shows they have not programmed it exactly the way they wish yet.

This concept of immediate feedback permits students to stay engaged and move at a pace that suits their needs. ''Scratch's'' use, when studied in Computer Clubhouses, confirms the engaging nature of the program as well as the result of students learning computer programming even though that wasn't the goal of their use of ''Scratch'' (Jonassen, Howland, Marra, &amp; Crismond, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D., Howland, J., Marra, R., &amp; Crismond, D. (2008). ''Meaningful learning with technology''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  This immediacy also enables students to not only experiment with creating projects, but also to quickly arrive at finished projects that they can be proud to post.

Students of any discipline could use ''Scratch'' within the classroom.  Besides the obvious computer programming skills ''Scratch'' helps students learn, ''Scratch'' also incorporates math in terms of how sprites move.  Students can control how their sprites function on the screen by manipulating their x and y axis positions.  For the language arts, science and social studies classrooms, the subject matter of students' creations could be geared toward the respective disciplines (at a minimum) which would still provide students with the opportunity to learn the required curriculum elements but incorporate programming as well.  Re-enactments of historical moments, stories relating to curriculum topics, could also be designed in ''Scratch''.  Since ''Scratch'' allows for music and the recording of original sounds, it obviously applies very directly to music courses as well.  Yet another application might be for an art class since ''Scratch'' users can design their own sprites and manipulate the appearance of existing designs.

Teachers can also use ''Scratch'' to present materials to parents and teachers.  The following is a project in process that I made for parents to be able to click on and view at the Open House night where I work: [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/alk308/861909 ALK308 ''Scratch'' Project].  Teachers needing helping can visit [http://scratched.media.mit.edu/ ScratchEd] for assistance with how to implement the technology into the classroom and for general resources to help them with the tool.  Discussion boards are even available for fellow interested educators to communicate with one another directly on their use of ''Scratch''.

===&lt;h2&gt;Recreation&lt;/h2&gt;===
Like the research in Jonassen, et al. (2008) shows, students enjoy working with ''Scratch''.  Therefore, since the program is free to download, students could obtain the program for their home computers as a means of entertainment that is teaching them something simultaneously.  This recreational practice would be an ideal way for kids to spend time in a productive but fun environment as opposed to some other alternatives students seek on the Internet.  As a matter of fact, some of the research done with ''Scratch'' shows that urban students, ages 8-18, enjoyed utilizing ''Scratch'' after school hours (Maloney, J., Peppler, K., Kafai, Y., Resnick, M., &amp; Rusk, N., 2008). &lt;ref&gt;Maloney, J., Peppler, K., Kafai, Y., Resnick, M., and Rusk, N. (2008). ''Programming by choice: Urban youth learning programming with Scratch''. Retrieved from http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of other recreational uses, people involved in community activities could utilize ''Scratch'' as a way of presenting information to the public in an engaging way (interactive information provided at a stand in a shopping mall for example).  For example, organizations like the Girl Scouts/Boy Scouts could use ''Scratch'' when they're advertising what they have to offer to the public.

An example of an entertainment or fun scratch project can be found at [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/wab6/864136 WAB6 ''Scratch'' Project]

===&lt;h2&gt;Business&lt;/h2&gt;===
Businesses could use ''Scratch'' as an alternative to other forms of presenting information, particularly in training employees on business policies or other less exciting necessities.  Its interactive capabilities and animation could add some interest value to adults with information that might not be interesting otherwise.

''Scratch'' allows users to post projects online, free of charge, and even group them by a particular category name, which would be an asset to any business who would want to use ''Scratch''.  Their work would be easily shared with people across the world. Also, sharing of information could be done from home making particular trainings, like those mentioned above, not necessarily something that would need to occur within the workplace.

==Advantages of WiZiQ Over Other Services==
WiZiQ has some key advantages over other web conferencing or learning platforms. The first key advantage is that the free part of the service has many key features and capabilities. Many of the competing platforms only offer key features for upgraded pay users. The second key aspect is that users do not need to download and install software on their computers to run this application. It is truly an online service where users connect to the WiZiQ server on the web. Another key capability is the ability to instantly set up ad-hoc sessions as needed. Users can be anywhere in the world where there is a network connection - thus worldwide collaboration is truly available. Also key is that WiZiQ is aimed at the education market: it is optimized for teachers to set up and advertise classes and for students to search and find desired sessions.

==Transformative Effects of WiZiQ==
WiZiQ opens up a world of potential ad-hoc educational opportunities. In addition to the power of using WiZiQ in a formal school setting as a technology platform , the tool offers the opportunity for both teachers and students to participate in educational opportunities as they desire. Teachers are given the opportunity to teach what they are interested in teaching, advertising the session on WiZiQ and delivering the lessons. Learners have the opportunity to look for learning opportunities that they want to participate in. This is a exciting new paradigm where learning is available as both the teacher and learner want to make it happen. Both teachers and learners now are empowered to control their learning experiences.

==Paid Private or Public Classes==
With WiZiQ, teachers have the ability to charge for their teaching. Private classes can be arranged between teachers and learners for specific learning or remedial help. The teachers have the ability to charge the students for their time. Public online lessons can be for a fee, learners who sign up for the courses will agree to pay for their lessons. WiZiQ will arrange the class management and takes a commission for their efforts[http://wiziq.typepad.com/wiziqcom/2009/11/commission-structure-of-paid-classes.html WiZiQ commission structure].

==Introduction==
The following information is a compilation of material found on Speech recognition software across the internet. After an introduction to what speech-to-text is, and what type of software is available, educational applications for their use are provided. 
==Definition==
[[File:Microphone gooseneck.jpg|left|thumb|This is a typical computer microphone&quot;]]'''Speech recognition''' which is often referred to as '''automatic speech recognition''' or '''computer speech recognition''' converts spoken words to text. The term &quot;voice recognition&quot; is sometimes used to refer to speech recognition where the recognition system is trained to a particular speaker. This is the case for most desktop recognition software. Therefore, for most desktop recognition software there is an element of [[w:speaker recognition|speaker recognition]], which attempts to identify the person speaking which helps the software recognize what is being said. Speech recognition is a broad term which means it can recognize almost anybody's speech. An example of this is a call-center system designed to recognize many voices.  Voice recognition is a system trained to a particular user, where it recognizes their speech based on their unique vocal sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Speech Recognition&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech [[w:recognition|recognition]] applications include voice dialing such as the type that is built into many cell phones, call routing such as the type that you experience when you call a call-center&lt;ref name=&quot;lumenvox&quot;&gt;http://www.lumenvox.com/company/edu/&lt;/ref&gt;, [[w:domotic|domotic]] appliance control and content-based spoken audio search such as the type used by the government to pick up key words spoken on a wire tap, simple data entry which is like the type used in phone surveys&lt;ref name=&quot;lumenvox&quot;/&gt;, preparation of structured documents such as a medical report, speech-to-text processing such as a type you would use to write a letter or [[w:email|email]]&lt;ref name=&quot;How Stuff Works&quot;&gt;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/speech-recognition.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, and in aircraft [[w:cockpit|cockpit]]s in terms of [[w:Direct Voice Input|Direct Voice Input]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/HLTsurvey/ch1node4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first speech recognizer appeared in 1952 and consisted of a device for the recognition of single spoken digits &lt;ref&gt;Davies , K.H., Biddulph, R. and Balashek, S. (1952) ''Automatic Speech Recognition of Spoken Digits'', J. Acoust. Soc. Am. '''24'''(6) pp.637 - 642&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Speech Recognition with Windows XP&quot;&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/moskowitz_02september23.mspx&lt;/ref&gt;Another early device was the [[w:IBM Shoebox|IBM Shoebox]], exhibited at the [[w:1964 New York World's Fair|1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

One of the most notable domains for the commercial application of speech recognition in the United States has been health care and in particular the work of the [[w:medical transcription|medical transcription]]ist (MT). According to industry experts, at its inception, speech recognition (SR) was sold as a way to completely eliminate transcription rather than make the transcription process more efficient, hence it was not accepted. It was also the case that SR at that time was often technically deficient. Additionally, to be used effectively, it required changes to the ways physicians worked and documented clinical encounters, which many if not all were reluctant to do. The biggest limitation to speech recognition automating transcription, however, is seen as the software. The nature of narrative dictation is highly interpretive and often requires judgment that may be provided by a real human but not yet by an automated system. Another limitation has been the extensive amount of time required by the user and/or system provider to train the software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

A distinction in ASR is often made between &quot;artificial syntax systems&quot; which are usually domain-specific and &quot;natural language processing&quot; which is usually language-specific. Each of these types of application presents its own particular goals and challenges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

==Software==
===Microsoft===

'''Windows Speech Recognition''' is a [[w:speech recognition|speech recognition]] application included in [[w:Windows Vista|Windows Vista]] and more recently, [[w:Windows 7|Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Speech_Recognition&lt;/ref&gt;

====Features====
[[File:Vista icon.svg|thumb|right|200px|Vista Logo]]

Windows Speech Recognition allows the user to control the computer by giving specific [[w:hands-free computing|voice commands]]. The program can also be used for the [[w:Transcription (linguistics)|dictation]] of text so that the user can control their Vista or Windows 7 computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech Recognition with Windows XP&quot;/&gt;

Applications that don't present obvious &quot;commands&quot; can still be controlled by asking the system to overlay numbers on top of interface elements; the number can subsequently be spoken to activate that function. Programs needing mouse clicks in arbitrary locations can also be controlled through speech; when asked to do so, a &quot;mousegrid&quot; of nine zones is displayed, with numbers inside each. The user speaks the number, and another grid of nine zones is placed inside the chosen zone. This continues until the interface element to be clicked is within the chosen zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

Windows Speech Recognition has a fairly high recognition accuracy and provides a set of commands that assists in dictation.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} A brief speech-driven tutorial is included to help familiarize a user with speech recognition commands. Training could also be completed to improve the accuracy of speech recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

Currently, the application supports several languages, including English (U.S. and British), Spanish, German, French, Japanese and Chinese (traditional and simplified).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windowsvista/speech.aspx Windows Speech Recognition in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; Support for additional languages is&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

====History====
In 1993, Microsoft hired [[w:Xuedong Huang|Xuedong Huang]] from Carnegie Mellon University to lead its speech efforts. Microsoft has been involved in research on speech recognition and text to speech.&lt;ref name = &quot;msdn&quot;&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163663.aspx Talking Windows: Exploring New Speech Recognition And Synthesis APIs In Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; The company's research eventually led to the development of the [[w:Speech Application Programming Interface|Speech API]] (SAPI).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

Speech recognition technology has been used in some of Microsoft's products, including Microsoft Dictation (a research prototype that ran on [[w:Windows 9x|Windows 9x]]). It was also included in [[w:Microsoft Office|Office]] XP, Office 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA010565111033.aspx Using speech recognition for the first time in Office - Help and How-to - Microsoft Office Online]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[w:Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP|Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP]], [[w:Windows XP Tablet PC Edition|Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]], and [[w:Windows Mobile|Windows Mobile]] (as ''[[w:Microsoft Voice Command|Microsoft Voice Command]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/may02/SpeechRecognitionPocketPC.asp Speech Recognition for the Pocket PC :: May 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, prior to Windows Vista, speech recognition was not mainstream. In response, Windows Speech Recognition was bundled with Windows Vista and released in 2006, making the operating system the first mainstream version of Microsoft Windows to offer fully-integrated support for speech recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

====Technical details====
Windows Speech Recognition relies on [[w:Speech Application Programming Interface|Microsoft SAPI]] version 5.3 (included in Windows Vista) to function&lt;ref name=&quot;msdn&quot;/&gt;. The application also utilizes Microsoft Speech Recognizer 8.0 for Windows as its speech profile engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Windows_ Speech Recognition&quot;/&gt;

===Apple===
[[File:Apple Computer Logo rainbow.svg|thumb|left|200px|Apple Computer logo]]
'''MacSpeech''' was a company that developed [[w:speech recognition|speech recognition]] software for [[w:Apple Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers.  In 2008, its previous flagship product, [[w:iListen|iListen]], was replaced by [[w:MacSpeech Dictate|Dictate]], which is now built around [[w:Nuance Communications|Nuance's]] licensed [[w:Dragon NaturallySpeaking|Dragon NaturallySpeaking]] engine. MacSpeech was established in 1996 by current CEO Andrew Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macspeech.com/pages.php?cID=4&amp;pID=24 MacSpeech - Speech Recognition Solutions for Mac OS - The MacSpeech Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; MacSpeech was the only company that developed voice dictation systems for the Macintosh. Its full product line was devoted to speech recognition and dictation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia MacSpeech&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacSpeech&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial voice dictation product for [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] was [[w:IBM|IBM]]'s [[w:IBM ViaVoice|ViaVoice]] , but [[w:ScanSoft|ScanSoft]], the company that had exclusive global distribution rights to ViaVoice, merged with [[w:Nuance Communications|Nuance]] and stopped developing ViaVoice for Macintosh. (The first dictation software for Mac OS 9 was Articulate System's PowerSecretary.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://db.tidbits.com/article/5334?print_version=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia MacSpeech&quot;/&gt;

At the 2008 [[w:Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld Expo]], MacSpeech's newly-revealed Dictate was a winner of the MacWorld 2008 Best of Show award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/131642/2008/01/bos.html Macworld | Editors' Notes | Macworld Expo Best of Show award winners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia MacSpeech&quot;/&gt;

===Dragon NaturallySpeaking===


'''Dragon NaturallySpeaking''' is a [[w:speech recognition|speech recognition]] software package developed and sold by [[w:Nuance Communications|Nuance Communications]] for [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[w:personal computer|personal computer]]s. The latest release of Dragon Naturally Speaking is version 11.0, released in August 2010. As with the previous version (10.1), this package supports both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of [[w:Windows XP|Windows XP]], [[w:Windows Vista|Vista]] and [[w:Windows 7|7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;64-bit support&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/naturallyspeaking/support/vista_64bit.asp | title=Nuance product support for Microsoft Windows Vista | accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.co.uk/windows7/ | title=Nuance product support for Microsoft Windows 7 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia NaturallySpeaking&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking&lt;/ref&gt;The four editions to this latest release are Home, Premium (formerly known as &quot;Preferred&quot;), Professional, and Legal. Nuance Communications claim these newest versions are faster and 15% more accurate &quot;right out of the box&quot; as compared with Dragon 10. [http://www.nuance.com/for-business/by-product/dragon/product-resources/whats-new-version-11/index.htm] 
====Features====
NaturallySpeaking utilizes a minimal user interface. As an example, dictated words appear in a floating [[w:tooltip|tooltip]] as they are spoken, and when the speaker pauses, the program [[w:Transcription (linguistics)|transcribes]] the words into the active window at the location of the cursor. The software has three primary areas of functionality: dictation, text-to-speech and command input. Not only is the user able to dictate and have their speech transcribed as written text, or have a document synthesized as an audio stream, but they are also able to issue commands that are recognized as such by the programme. In addition, voice profiles can be accessed through different computers in a networked environment, although the audio hardware and configuration must be identical on both machines.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia NaturallySpeaking&quot;/&gt;

====History====
Dr. James and Janet Baker founded Dragon Systems in 1982 to release products centred around their voice recognition prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=Dragon Systems history |accessdate =2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:DragonDictate|DragonDictate]] was first released for [[w:DOS|DOS]], and utilized [[w:hidden Markov models|hidden Markov models]], which is a method of using statistics for the recognition of speech. At the time, the hardware was insufficiently powerful to address the problem of [[w:word segmentation|word segmentation]], and DragonDictate was unable to determine the boundaries of words during continuous speech input. Users were forced to pronounce one word at a time, each clearly separated by a small pause. DragonDictate was based on a [[w:trigram|trigram]] model, and is known as a [[w:discrete signal|discrete]] speech recognition engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/dd-faq.html#What | title=DragonDictate product information |accessdate = 2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia NaturallySpeaking&quot;/&gt;

Dragon Systems released NaturallySpeaking 1.0 as their first continuous dictation product in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=Dragon NaturallySpeaking 1.0 released |accessdate =2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was then purchased in June 2000 by [[w:Lernout &amp; Hauspie|Lernout &amp; Hauspie]], a corporation that had been involved in financial scandals as reported by the [[w:New York Times|New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/dragon-systems-sputters-after-belgian-suitor-fails.html?pagewanted=all | title=Dragon Systems purchased by Lernout &amp; Hauspie | accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=2001-05-07 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the bankruptcy of Lernout &amp; Hauspie, the rights to the Dragon product line were acquired by [[w:ScanSoft|ScanSoft]]. In 2005, ScanSoft launched a ''de facto'' acquisition of [[w:Nuance Communications|Nuance Communications]], and rebranded itself as [[w:Nuance Communications|Nuance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/news/pressreleases/2005/20050509_nuance.asp | title=ScanSoft and Nuance to Merge | accessdate = 2010-02-03 |date=2005-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia NaturallySpeaking&quot;/&gt;

===Other Software===

==Educational Applications==
Dragon Speech Recognition Premium (formerly known as &quot;Preferred) and Professional solutions are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Section 508 requirements. These products are among others that Nuance Communications offers through Education licensing at &quot;academic pricing&quot; to qualifying educational individuals and educational establishments (http://www.nuance.com/for-business/by-industry/education/education-validation/eligibility_definitions/index.htm). Further, Nuance offers a variety of software licensing programs such as their Open License Program  (OLP) for volume needs. The value is a cost-effectiveness over desktop products through the efficiencies of a business to business relationship.

Speech Recognition software is widely available to everyone at a fairly reasonable price. Therefore, teachers need to look at how they can use this type of software to enhance their curriculum. There are number ways that the use of this type of software can improve the education of students. Some of the ways are listed here. 
===Helping Students with Physical Disabilities===
Helping students with physical disabilities be successful in the classroom can be a challenge to any teacher. Finding ways for these students to do the same activities as other students can take a lot time, and requires that teachers fully understand the limitations of their students. What can be most challenging is keeping in mind that these students still have the same or better mental abilities then the other students in a class. 

The use of speech recognition software allows students that have little or no motor skills in their arms and hands to be able to produce typed reports, manage software, and perform research with a computer, just like other non-disabled students. &lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Voice Recognition in Special Education&quot;&gt; http://www.rehabtool.com/forum/discussions/97.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helping Students with Learning Disabilities===
[[File:Students working on class assignment in computer lab.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Student's writing a paper]]
Student with learning disabilities struggle to learn in a variety of ways. Some have problems reading and writing. Although speech-to-text software does not help these students improve their ability to spell, the software allows students to write without worrying about spelling. Having students place their ideas down in writing can help teachers to work with students to improve their grammar. Improving a students' grammar in their writing, helps the student fix the grammar in his/her speech as well. &lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Voice Recognition in Special Education&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Secondary&quot;&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VCJ-3XMGN91-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1215028011&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fc3ce5bd58895ec5faac3b22472080a2&lt;/ref&gt;

For many students with learning disabilities that can spell, the process of typing can be frustrating. Therefore speech-to-text can be helpful in helping them speed up their writing process. When students that have learning disabilities have attention span issues, sitting down to type a paper can be very difficult, therefore these speech-to-text software can help these students push their writing to new levels. &lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Voice Recognition in Special Education&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Secondary&quot;/&gt;

===Read Instruction===
Advances in Speech Recognition Software have created an environment in which students can read to a computer and the computer can evaluate their reading abilities. Studies on this individual learning technique show potential, but the software is still not up to the level it needs to be for complete instruction. Current software requires supervision from teachers that can assist students that are having problems. This technology is not new, and it has improved but many of the problems that it faced in the past are still being overcome. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED292059&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED292059&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ738601&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ738601&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to this type of use of the technology is that it gives teachers the ability to differentiate the instruction to each student, and it allows students that have advanced reading levels not to be held back by students that have learning disabilities. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neirtec.org/reading_report/report.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language Learning===
One of the most creative uses for Speech Recognition Software is to help language learning. Language software is available that can check a student's ability to speak languages. For example, a student learning Spanish can be asked state specific words in Spanish. The computer can then evaluate their ability to speak the words properly. Other ways this software can work is in translate a passage from their first language to Spanish. In this case students can be asked to silently read the passage in their native language then stating to the computer what the phrase would be in Spanish. Finally, the software can speak to the student in Spanish and then evaluate the students response to the original statement to determine if it was correct. In all of these cases, each question would have had to have been programmed into the computer. Although in the future, computers may have the ability to evaluate a students response and then respond back with its own customized response.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Column/The-Human-Factor/Speech-Recognition-in-Education-Unexploited-Opportunities-29807.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future Design==
The future of speech recognition is one numerous invitations. Although the technology has been around for over 50 years, there are hundreds potential applications and improvements to the software that will take place. Some items that are on the horizon include universal translators that can be used to help with language barriers&lt;ref name=&quot;DARPA&quot;&gt;http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2006/11/01/darpa-speech-to-speech-research/&lt;/ref&gt;, improved reading instruction software, one-on-one teaching tools with better interaction, and voice activated research tools&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldthinktank.net/art128.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most dramatic possibilities for speech recognition are that someday computers may be able to interpret our comments and respond back with their own ideas. At this point speech recognition may become speech understanding. &lt;ref name=&quot;How Stuff Works&quot;/&gt; Imagine saying to your alarm clock wake me up at 6:00 am, and have it say back to you, I just connected to your datebook in your cell phone and see that your first appointment tomorrow is at 7:00 am, 30 minutes from here. Do you want get up at 5:30 instead? Although this sounds like science fiction, the possibility for these communications and interpretations are here today, they just need to be merged together.

An example of this can be seen in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V86vF0n-sA&amp;feature=player_embedded video] where a paper of glasses can be turned into a audio and video recorder and as the author points out eventually these will be able to connect to our smart phones so that we can communicate with our glasses so that an image of our computer screen can appear on the inside of ours glasses and we then can manipulate our desktop environment displayed our glasses through voice commands creating a completely hands free, computer anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2010/01/speech-recognition-is-only-part-of-the-future.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://my.advisor.com/doc/05918&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is Squeak?==
'''Squeak''' is a programming language based on [[Smalltalk]] by a group at [[History of Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] that included some of the original Smalltalk-80 developers, Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldberg.  It is object-oriented and primarily visual.

''Squeak'' was developed with the idea that it would be sufficiently easy to understand that children would be able to use it.  Programming is accomplished by clicking and dragging commands onto the graphical sprite that the user wishes to control.  The language is powerful enough that it has been used to write other programming languages.  It can, however, have a bit of a steep learning curve in comparison to some of its less powerful derivative projects such as [[Scratch]].

[[Image:EToys_on_OLPC-dual_mode_display.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Screenshot of the Squeak interface.]]

==Using Squeak==
''Squeak'' can be used in a variety of ways depending on the level of sophistication of the user. Aside from introducing learners to the basics of object-oriented programming without the burden of a complicated coding syntax, it can be used to create book-like presentations, animations, games and combinations of the above in ways that are much more interactive than the types of software normally used for the purpose.

One of the developers of ''Squeak'', Alan Kay, has used it as a presentation tool in place of more traditional tools like Powerpoint.  In [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6605997857319097923#docid=-124161889929978086 this video], he uses it to give a presentation on various educational topics.  For example, around minute 42, he shows the effects of an optical illusion by manipulating two instances of a graphic of a table, one vertical, one horizontal; this would not be possible to do on the fly with Powerpoint.

A variety of topics can be taught in the context of ''Squeak'' in a multidisciplinary manner. Cartesian coordinate geometry is employed to move the sprites around the screen, and ''Squeak'' could be used to enhance math lessons on the topic.  Basic grammar could be taught using the sprites to represent nouns, and the commands to represent verbs, etc..  Constructivist lessons in literature might include learners creating animations describing how they believe characters would behave if something different were to occur in a story they are reading. Simulations could be developed to test hypotheses or demonstrate understanding of scientific principles.  

In addition to the direct pedagogical uses of the ''Squeak'' environment, there is also a community of users that form a support network for the tool as well as an audience with which to share projects and from which to get ideas.  The [http://www.squeakland.org/showcase/everyone/ Squeakland showcase] has 163 pages of user submitted projects as of May, 2010. Because ''Squeak'' is open-source, all the source code for the projects is available for use to help understand develop one's own programs. Many of the uploaded projects are tutorials explaining how to accomplish various tasks in the programming language.  Because of its inclusion on each of the One Laptop Per Child initiative's laptops, the ''Squeak'' community provides a means of communicating with learners from all over the world.

== Other Applications of Squeak ==
Squeak is the basis of a number of other applications that are either written in Squeak or have forked off of the Squeak project in some way.  Many of these applications have kept the educational philosophy of their parent project and have transformative applications themselves.

=====EToys=====
EToys is a form of Squeak that is included on every [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/The_Children%27s_Machine OLPC laptop] that is shipped. Like many of the other Smalltalk based applications, EToys is very compatable with Constructivist pedagogy.

According to the [http://www.squeakland.org/about/intro/ Squeakland website], EToys is highly engaging for learners and can be used in a variety of ways from a simple sketching application to a more complex object oriented programming environment. Children using it learn to think iteratively, develop computer fluency, critical thinking and problem solving skills. The end result, EToys advocates insist, is a sense of accomplishment and increased self esteem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Interrogatives ==
{{wikipedia|Interrogative}}
Questions in English often start with an ''interrogative'' which describes the type of information being asked for. Some examples are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Interrogative || Example question || Example answer
|-
| what || What is this? || This is an apple
|-
| who  || Who is that? || That is my teacher.
|-
| where || Where is the restroom? || The restroom is down-stairs.
|-
| when || When does class start? || Class starts at six o'clock.
|-
| why  || Why are you studying English? || I'm studying English because of my work.
|-
| how  || How does my dress look? || Your dress looks great!
|}

Note how the word order changes between the question and the answer.

== Yes-no questions ==
{{wikipedia|Yes-no question}}
In yes-no questions (so-called ''polar questions'') the word order is usually the same, but instead of the interrogative comes a verb to make a Verb-Subject-Object sentence. Below are some examples of yes-no questions:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Verb || Example question || Positive answer || Negative answer || Negative answer with positive explanation
|-
| do  || Do you like apples? || Yes, I like apples. || No, I don't like apples. || No, I like/prefer oranges.
|-
|-
| be  || Is this red? || Yes, this is red. || No, this isn't red. || No, this is blue.
|-
| be  || Are you studying English? || Yes, I'm studying English. || No, I'm not studying English. || No, I'm studying French.
|-
| be  || Will you sing a song? || Yes, I'll sing a song. || No, I won't sing a song. || No, I will read a story.
|}

Usually, simple positive or negative answers will be shorter. It is enough to say: &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;, &quot;No, I don't.&quot;, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;, &quot;No, it isn't&quot;, etc.

Should this book be targeted to students or teachers?  In many situations teachers of English in non-English speaking countries do not have formal training or education regarding teaching methodology.  I am for instance an &quot;assistant language teacher&quot; instructing English in Japanese classrooms.  I have no credentials in teaching but perform the duties of a teacher daily.  This book could be a great guide and resource for new teachers of English abroad. Feb. 2010. Mark Johnson</text>

Introduction
The Children of Israel were armed when they went up from Mitzraim assembled in their tribal ranks, even though it was not planned as an initial encounter for them. 
Exodus 13:17 &quot;And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had Be-Shallach (let the people go), that Yahweh led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for Yahweh said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:&quot;

The Targum Johnathan for this passage tells us that some Israelites had escaped by this route earlier and had met with their death at the hands of the Philistines.   The Book of Jasher also records this event of some of the tribe of Ephraim going in disobedience to Yahweh's word believing that the time of their deliverance had come.   Their presumptuous act caused them to be given over to the Philistines and overcome by them and their bones lay where they fell for many years, which would have been a disturbing sight for the people had they journeyed that way.   Book of Jasher 75:1-20

The people were not trained for war and going that way would have caused them also confrontation by the Philistines. When Yahweh first sets us free, he doesn't take us directly into (spiritual) warfare because we would be tempted to return to our old ways.  

In spite of the inevitable complainers and grumblers that we read about in the balance of the portion, Moses has effectively given enough of the children of Israel a “vision for the freedom” that awaits the chosen nation as it travels east to Canaan.  This vision is not only for the Land of Promise flowing with milk and honey coupled with the prophecies that were a part of the heritage of the patriarchs, but also a vision about being the chosen nation of the Almighty.

Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had firmly commanded the Children of Israel, saying, “Yahweh will surely remember you, and you shall bring up my bones from here with you.” They journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham, at the edge of the Wilderness. Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day and by night. Yahweh did not remove the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night from before the people.


The Bones of Joseph
And while the rest of the Children of Israel were preoccupied with requesting valuables, we find Moses gathering the skeletal remains of Joseph. 
These bones of Joseph represents a picture-type of the whole House of Israel in this passage of scripture, in that these bones point to a future date in prophecy that these dried bones shall have life breathed into them and once again live.  These skeletal bones are representative of the scattered diaspora of the whole house of Israel around the globe later to be rejoined and caught up again in one place as a unified body unto Messiah Yeshua in the valley of Jezreel.  Moses obeys the Ruach and carries the remains of what is to become a latter day reminder of who the people of Israel are.  These bones represented more than mere mortal bones, but were a representation of the physical embodiment of latter day Israel.  These skeletal bones were symbolic of the people of Israel as one body, and the latter day plan of Yahweh for the Children of Israel.  Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.  Truly, Moses here represents a picture-type of Messiah Yeshua. His concern was for the whole house of Israel, and he was determined to not leave any part of the body behind.


Next Israel faced the Red Sea
In the Targums it is called the Sea of Suph and is identified as what was once part of the Gihon river of the Garden of Eden.   &quot; And they journeyed from Succoth, the place where they had been covered with the clouds of glory, and sojourned in Ethan, which is on the side of the desert. [[JERUSALEM. IS. And the Word of Yahweh conducted the people by the way of the desert of the sea of Suph;&quot;    Targum Johnathan 13:18
&quot;And Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall you encamp by the sea.&quot;   Exodus 14:1,2
 
After the punishing plagues and the expulsion from Egypt, the &quot;house of slavery,&quot;  it seemed that the Israelites would never have to face their brutal oppressors again, but Pharaoh hardened his heart and aroused the Egyptians to follow.
When we follow Yahweh we often find ourselves at the &quot;Red Sea&quot;, where we are straightened between the enemy and impossible circumstances and our only salvation is in divine intervention.

&quot;And Pharaoh approached; and the Children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, Egypt was traveling after them!  And they were very frightened, and the Children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.&quot;    Exodus 14:10
Imagine the trauma!  The Red Sea is before them, and what seems like the entire Egyptian nation is surging toward them, from behind.   All appears lost.   

When the Israelites faced the Red Sea, they not only were provided a way to leave which was supernatural, but they also lost their primary enemy, the Egyptian army.  If we will only trust Yahweh, He will not only provide a way of escape for us, but will also in the process destroy the army chasing us. 
Within the camp there were evidently four groups, those who believed the Word of Yahweh and were ready to go forth into the sea, those who wanted to fight, those who wanted to return and those who wanted to use strategies to confuse them.  (Targum Johnathan 14:13)

&quot;And they said unto Moshe, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore have you dealt this way with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?  For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.&quot;  (11,12 )
He answered each accordingly and assured the people that “Yahweh will fight for you, while you will remain silent” (verse 14).  Moshe will raise his staff, the sea will split, and the people will proceed through the sea on dry land.&quot;

Just a short time earlier the people were crying out to God for a deliverer.  When Yahweh sent one, they didn't like the results.  Believe it or not, no matter how bad things look to the eyes,  God is in control.   Trust Him!

Not all who had come out had received the redemption in the passover, they had gone through the form, but their hearts were unchanged.   Many followed the cloud and were baptised in the cloud and in the sea but were not part of spiritual Israel.   Only those who believe by faith in the redemption of Yeshua are truly redeemed,  only faith will enable us to stand when tests and trials come.    1 Corinthians 10: 1-11

&quot;And the angel of Yahweh, that went before the camp of Israel, traveled and went from behind them; and the pillar of cloud traveled from before them and it stood from behind them. And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness, and it lit up the night, and the one did not approach the other all the night&quot;   (14:19-20).   To the Egyptians it was darkness, to the Israelites light, and the attack which they had begun, ceased.
&quot;And Yahweh said unto Moshe, Why do you cry unto me?  speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: But you lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.&quot;   14:15,16

But Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of Yahweh which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.

Don't return to your &quot;Egypt&quot;, go forward into victory and watch Yahweh defeat your enemies.   
:20 &quot;And it (the angel of Yahweh) came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.&quot;  
What appears to be Yahweh's direction and blessing to you may not be the same to your enemies.   To the Israelis, Yahweh's protection was a blazing flame.   To the Egyptians, a dark thick cloud.  Flames bring light, which results in understanding and comfort.  Darkness produces confusion, fear and prevents clearness of mind.
24 &quot;… in the morning watch Yahweh looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians.&quot; 

The Targum Johnathan tells us that Yahweh threw  &quot;flakes of fire and hail&quot; upon them and that He broke the wheels of the chariots so that it was hard driving them  (14:24)   He loosened the &quot;lug bolts&quot; on their &quot;tires&quot;  and everything came apart, wheels flying everywhere.  This would tend to make it more difficult to escape the trap being laid for them.

For Israel this was a 'mikvah', a baptism - a cleansing and a separation from Egypt. It was intended to be a death to the bondage and slavery of Egypt and a grave in which all that their old life represented was buried.    Out of that watery grave, they arose to a new life and a new hope - they were in effect a new people. This is now a type of what 'baptism' - immersion does now for us as believers.   We die to the old life and bury it under the waters of baptism and rise to a new life by the power of His resurrection.  Baptism now saves us from the power of sin.  1 Corinthians 10: 1-13;  Romans 6: 3-11;   Colossians 2:12-15

With great rejoicing they celebrated their deliverance led by Mirium the prophetess in dancing and singing His praises. But three more days into the wilderness and they are again tested by the lack of water and complain. They have now arrived at Marah, seven days from their exodus.

When Israel left Egypt and went through the sea,  they were separated from  Egypt and Pharaoh lost his claim on them.  In the same way, when we go through the 'sea' of burial of the old man in baptism  (Romans 6:3-5), we are separated from the world and the enemy loses his power over us.

At the time of their release, there was no question of their appreciation of their redemption from the bondage and slavery.  As time progressed however, the very real images of the suffering are dimmed in the light of their trials and they begin to look back on the 'pleasures' in Egypt. The lusts of the flesh start to dominate and Yahweh has to take us through the wilderness to starve the 'flesh' out of us. It is only in adversity that we discover the flesh in us.

When we look at things in the natural, the flesh will take over, we need to keep our minds on the things of the spiritual and walk in faith on the Word He has given us.    Fears and anxieties come in when we look to our own resources.
We need to put our trust in Him and pray for the necessary provision to come, and we have His promise  --   Philippians 4:7 

&quot;And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Messiah Yeshua.&quot;   The ultimate peace of God comes from knowing Yeshua as Messiah and we find Him in the Torah.


At Marah 15:22-25 
&quot;And the people murmured against Moshe, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto Yahweh; and Yahweh showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,&quot;.   
Yahweh changed their murmuring and made the bitter waters sweet.
 
The Targum  Jerusalem says,   25. &quot;And Mosheh prayed before Yahweh, and the Word of Yahweh showed him the tree of Ardiphne, and he cast it into the midst of the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There did the Word of Yahweh show unto him statutes and orders of judgment, and there He tried him with trials in the tenth trial. 26. For I am Yahweh who heals you by My Word.]&quot;   - ( 14:25-26  -  Divine Name changed)

The Ardiphne, Hirdoph, and sometimes Rododaphne, is described in Shemoth Rabba as a tree which grows beside water and bears flowers like lilies, of a bitter taste. The name is given also to the bitter herbs eaten with the passover. (Tr. Pesachim, 39.) The old commentator in the Yalkut says, &quot;This was one miracle within another, --bitter waters made sweet by a bitter tree.&quot;

This is a type of Yehsua impaled on a tree that was cast into the bitter waters of the curse from sin, which then became life-giving water to all who drank from that source. Provision was also made in that for healing of the body, as He said, &quot;I am Yahweh, who heals you&quot;   15:26    His healing power is for the whole man - spirit, soul and body.

The Torah is a &quot;A tree of life&quot;. Just as Moshe was provided a tree to sweeten the bitter waters, Yahweh has given us His Torah to sweeten our lives which are bitter without it. Yahweh here at Marah reveals His &quot;statutes and orders of judgement&quot; and promised them that if they would keep them, &quot;I will put none of these diseases on you which I brought upon the Egyptians.&quot;    14:26b
It was here that Yahweh also instructed them in Sabbath-keeping.  

Their arrival at Marah in on the seventh day of the Feast established as Unleavened Bread, the last Sabbath of the Feast. Here Yahweh completes the work of redemption, applying the work of the atonement to their lives in deliverance from the curse of sin and sickness and giving them His laws. They are being established as His people.


Provision of Manna  
In chapter 16, Yahweh provides manna for them during that week and any excess that they collected turned to worm-infested slime. On Friday however, twice the normal collection of the manna does not spoil, as the residue is used on the Sabbath, to teach them to observe the correct day of the week as the Sabbath. Israel had just left a country whose calendar used an eight-day 'week'. All recollection of the Sabbath had been forgotten by the people as a whole, during their time of slavery and hard labour.  Yahweh tests them here on their willingness to keep Shabbat.

They responded to the sight of the manna by giving it its name 'manna'. Basically meaning 'what is it?' or literally from Hebrew &quot;from Him&quot;. The manna was a gift from heaven - -  &quot;they ate angels food&quot;   Psalm 78:24-25

It was white like coriander and tasted like a confectionery made from honey.
It was there every morning six days a week, a double portion being there on the day before Sabbath for forty yeas until they came into the promised land and it ceased the day that they ate the produce of the land.   Joshua 5:10-12
According to Yahweh's instruction, Moshe takes some of the manna and places it before the Testimony  16:34

Chapter 17 reveals how Yahweh struck the rock in the desert to provide water.   
Paul illustrate how this Rock was a type of Messiah in 1 Corinthians 10. As Moshe struck the rock in the desert, so Yahweh struck the Rock of Israel, Yeshua,  to bring forth living water for His people's spiritual need.


Dealing With the Flesh   
While fighting Amalek, when Moshe held up his arms and hands with the rod,  Israel won.  When Moshe lowered his hands, the enemy prevailed. Moshe stands in as an intercessor for them while they fight the battle. Aaron and Hur brought a rock for Moshe to rest on and held up his arms until the battle was complete. This was the establishment of his authority in the spiritual realm to triumph over Amalek, a type of the fleshly nature.  

Moshe was holding up a banner and that is why Moshe built an altar and called it &quot;Yahweh Nissi&quot; - Yahweh is my banner. Our victory is in Yahweh, under His banner.
We have a pictorial presentation in the natural what happens in the spiritual when a believer comes out of the world. There comes a time when the battle with the flesh has to be engaged and the enemy overcome. Amalek represents the fleshly nature of man which we will overcome if we wage warfare in prayer with Yahweh as our banner.

The decree was issued  -  &quot;Write this memorial in a book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. ..... ..... ....  Because Yahweh has sworn: Yahweh will have war with Amalek from  generation to generation.&quot;    17:16

&quot;Because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then , they that are in the flesh cannot please God.&quot;   Romans 8: 7-8

The fleshly, natural mind is completely against God and those who are of the natural mind-set of the things of this world are personally at enmity with Yahweh..  Even the apparently 'good' things of this world find no acceptance with Him.    James 4: 4  
   
&quot;Do not love the world, or the things in the world.   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him&quot;   
												1 John 2:15
The love of the things of this world is idolatry  -- i.e. a love for that which is not of the Father, but that which is generated by the 'god' of this world.   If the enemy has our worship. he has a claim on our lives. His appeal is to the lusts of the flesh which are accessible through our earthly members. We are exhorted to guard our hearts with all diligence, for from within the heart spiritual life or death is generated.  (Proverbs 4:23)

&quot;Therefore put to death your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.  Because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience .. .. &quot;  Colossians 3: 5-6a

&quot;But put on the Lord, Yeshua the Messiah and make no provision (take no forethought) for the flesh, to fulfil its lusts.&quot;Romans 13:14

&quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.   And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.&quot;    Romans 12:1-2

It is only by having our minds renewed by the Word that we can have the mind that is of Yeshua the Messiah, so as to live like Him and to not even consider satisfying our own desires, whether they be desires of the mind or of our physical flesh.  While ever we think according to the way of the world we will be kept in bondage to the old nature with its deceitful lusts which war against the spiritual man.

We have to prove what is the good and the perfect will of God by His Word.   That is the revelation which He has given us of His will, for us to know what He requires of us. So offering up our lives, we present them to Him to live according to His purposes which are in His Word.

=Introduction=

This section covers both qualitative and quantifiable physical properties of solids.

A viable knowledge of mechanical engineering rests on a basic understanding of engineering materials; and the behavior of such materials is the empirical foundation upon which the entire science of solid mechanics is built.  Although this is the very beginning, a basin of information is presented that facilitate powerful and sophisticated reasoning by even the simplest means.

=Introduction=

All solid materials display an approximately linear response to moderate loads.  This is manifested in Hooke's law:

 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x = \frac{\sigma_x - \nu (\sigma_y + \sigma_z)}{E} &lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_y = \frac{\sigma_y - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_z)}{E}  &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_z = \frac{\sigma_z - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_y)}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=&lt;/math&gt; the normal stress&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E=&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus (Young's modulus)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=&lt;/math&gt; the normal tension

The figure below illustrates the stress-strain curve of some material.  Hooke's law is valid in the linear interval marked &quot;Elastic region&quot;.  The term elastic, as in elastic deformation, refers to the absence of energy dissipation and permanent deformation.  Elastic deformations retract upon unloading.  &lt;br&gt;

A material's capacity to endure plastic deformation without breaking is called ductility.  Mild steel, copper and gold are all examples of ductile materials.  

The picture to the left displays a test specimen which has undergone a ductile failure during tensile load.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page shows how to facilitate statistical analysis by creating new SPSS variables via ''recoding'', i.e., remapping values from existing variables.

Let's say you want to combine or “collapse” categories because the number of responses in one category is too small for statistical analysis.  

Instead of having ages range from 1-100 and having 100 options as it does when on a ratio scale of measure, you could recode age into ordinal variable ageCategory that has just three values: 29 and under, 30-60, and 61+.  

When recoding variables, it is generally a good idea to first write the desired mappings between the values of the old and new variables, as illustrated in the table below.  

Here, a variable measuring frequency of religious attendance is used to demonstrate the technique: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Old Codes !! New Codes
|-
| 0=never || 1=never to infrequently
|-
| 1=less than once a year || 1=never to infrequently
|-
| 2=about once or twice a year || 1=never to infrequently
|-
| 3= several times a year || 1=never to infrequently
|-
| 4=about once a month || 2=relatively frequently
|-
| 5=two to three times a month || 2=relatively frequently
|-
| 6=nearly every week || 2=relatively frequently
|-
| 7=every week || 2=relatively frequently
|-
| 8= several times a week || 2=relatively frequently
|-
| 9=no answer || 9=no answer
|}

It is time to actually perform our recode.  Drop the “Transform” menu at the top of data editor window:
[[File:09recodingvariables01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on “Recode into Different Variables”, as choosing the “Recode into Same Variable” would destroy the values of the existing variable.  (The only time you'd use that is when fixing fouled labels.)
[[File:09recodingvariables02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You will now see the “Recode into Different Variables” window.  Choose the source variable from the list on the left and click the arrow (which then points left) to insert the variable into the “Numeric Variable → Output Variable” box. In this example, variable &quot;attend&quot; is selected for recoding:
[[File:09recodingvariables03.png|center|thumb|400px|]]

Now type the new variable name and label in the “Output Variable” box and click Change.  
[[File:09recodingvariables04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Now click “Old and New Values.”  You'll get the following window:
[[File:09recodingvariables05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

For each row of our table at top, enter Old Values on the left, New Values on the right and click “Add”.  That will put them into the “Old → New” list.   
As you can see, our screenshot shows original values 0 through 3 have been recoded as “1.”  Values 4 through 8 have been recoded as “2” in the new variable.  These recodings could have also been specified as ranges, by selecting the radio button next to “Range” and entering a range of source values.  

When you are finished, click “Continue” and “OK.”

That will return you to the Data Editor window.  In the Data View, drag the new variable from the very last column down and left until it is next to the column it recodes.  

You might expect this to be done for you but the final step is to click the Variable View tab, and in the new variable's Values cell, edit the Value Labels to reflect the newly recoded values:
[[File:09recodingvariables06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click “OK” and you’re done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computing variables in SPSS refers to computing with existing variables to create new variables.  

One common reasons is creation of a scale measure that combines several existing variables into a single variable, such as to summarize a phenomenon of interest.  

In our Genetic Counselors study, a subject investigated was attitude towards (an unpleasant operation, my apologies) abortion.  Participants were asked a set of seven questions to learn in what circumstances s/he believed abortion should be allowed.  E.g., Do you think a woman should be allowed to obtain an abortion if she has been raped?  If she doesn't want any more children?  Et cetera.  While the individual questions are useful for gaining a sense of the participant's views on whether or not abortion should be legal in specific cases, by combining the variables it is possible to get a better overall measure of opinion on abortion permissiblity.  Specifically, we could simply add the number of Yes answers across the seven questions for a sum for each study participant of 0 to 7.  

To simultaneously create and compute this variable, which we'll call abscale, click “Transform”  → “Compute Variable”:
[[File:10computingvariables01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The resulting window allows you to specify a numeric computation using existing variables:
[[File:10computingvariables02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

On the left, under “Target Variable,” is where you name the new variable.  Under “Numeric Expression,” you build a formula using the numeric keypad, mathematical operators and functions, and the variables in your data set.  Combine these elements as desired.  To move a variable into the “Numeric Expression” box, highlight it and click the arrow key.  

In our example, seven variables are added to create the new scale: abscale.  To do this we have only to add the abortion variables, as shown above.  Once you're done, click “OK.”  Your new variable will then appear in the Data Editor under the “Variable View,” on the ultimate row.
[[File:10computingvariables03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You'll notice that a “Label” value is missing, a void we recommend you always immediately fill with a descriptive label, e.g., &quot;views on abortion; should range from 0 to 7&quot;.  

In order to ensure that you created the scale accurately, check the frequencies and/or descriptives:  click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics” → “Frequencies”:
[[File:10computingvariables04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click your newly created variable, then the arrow to move it into the “Variable(s)” box, and you will get a window like this:
[[File:10computingvariables05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click OK and your Output Window will show a frequency distribution table for your new variable:
[[File:10computingvariables06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Following these steps, you can realize any new variables math, your data, and interest can conceive, with an assurance that your intentions have been met.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the functions you will often want to perform in the Data View of the Data Editor is sorting by a variable's values, to bring those of similar value together.  This can be a very useful when exploring the raw data in your dataset.  There are two ways to do this.  One is quite simple, the other allows for sorting on more than one variable.

The simple way to sort variable values is to make sure you are looking at the Data View tab.  Then scroll to the variable by which you want to sort.  Right click on its column heading and a context menu will appear:
[[File:12sort01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

At the bottom of the context menu are two sorting options: &quot;Sort Ascending&quot; and &quot;Sort Descending.&quot;  Choosing the first will move the smallest values to the top of the data set while a descending sort will bring up the largest values.  Keep in mind that SPSS automatically (unlike Excel) moves all rows in unison, so you don't need to worry about cases becoming misaligned when sorting.

Sometimes it's useful to sort on multiple variables, which means that SPSS will sort the data set by the values of the first variable, then breaks ties in that sort by sorting on the values of the second variable, and so on. 

To sort on multiple variables at once, choose &quot;Data&quot; -&gt; &quot;Sort Cases&quot;:
[[File:12sort02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You'll get this dialog window:
[[File:12sort03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The &quot;Sort Order&quot; box allows the choice between Ascending or Descending order once again.  On the left is a list of all the variables in the data set.  Choose them, the most important sort first, by clicking the variable involved and then the blue arrow, and repeat:
[[File:12sort04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Save your data set after sorting to retain it as the default sorting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two variables can be considered to correlate when there is a systematic change in their scores.  The purpose of correlation is to improve estimates and/or make predictions about a population. Simple linear correlation is particularly useful for improving best estimates of a dependent variable by accounting for its relationship with the independent variable using the straight-line formula.

In SPSS we are able to run correlations between two interval/ratio variables.  To do so, click on  “Analyze” → “Correlate”.  You will be shown three options. If you have two interval/ratio variables, choose “Bivariate….”  
[[File:22correlation01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The pop up window will ask you to select two variables to move into the “variable” box to the right of the window. Select the variables of interest.  In this example, we will use a religiosity scale and a spirituality scale as our two variables. Make sure that the box next to Pearson’s r is checked.  
[[File:22correlation02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then Click “OK.”  

You'll get the following table:
[[File:22correlation03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

This table is called a correlation table.  On the diagonal each variable is correlated with itself, thus they are perfect correlations of 1.0.  The table is also symmetrical, meaning the cells above the diagonal are identical to those below the diagonal, thus you really only need to examine one set of cells – either those above or below the diagonal.  

As far as what the cells tell us... The first value in the cell correlating religiosity with spirituality reports a correlation coefficient of .585.  Correlation coefficients range from -1.0 to +1.0.  An absolute value of 1.0 indicates a perfect correlation, which is rare in the social sciences.  A negative correlation means that as one variable goes up, the other goes down.  A positive correlations mean that as one variable goes up, the other also goes up.  A correlation of .585 is positive, meaning as religiosity increases, so, too, does spirituality.  But the correlation is not perfect, meaning some of the variation in spirituality is not explained by the variation in religiosity.

The asterisks at the end of the correlation indicate that the correlation is significant.  The p-value of the significance is indicated in two places – at the very bottom of the table where the asterisks are defined and just below the correlation coefficient, where the p-value is provided.  In this case, the p-value is .000, which means the odds of finding this relationship between these two variables just due to chance is less than .001, or less than 1 in a thousand.  This indicates there is a significant relationship between religiosity and spirituality.

The last value in the cell is the sample size for the correlation – 646.  If you were to correlate more than two variables simultaneously, which you can do in SPSS by simply adding more than two variables in the correlation dialogue, the sample sizes being compared can vary due to things like missing values or non-response.

Technically, before conducting a correlation, one should always run a scatterplot to insure that the relationship between the two variables is linear.  This is done in SPSS by clicking on “Graphs” → “Chart Builder”.
[[File:22correlation04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once the Chart Builder window is open, click on Scatter Plot.  Select the first display example of a scatter plot graph and drag the display into the large box located towards the right of the pop up window.  Select your independent variable from the side scroll bar and drag it to the X-axis on the box to the right.  Select your dependent variable from the side scroll bar and drag it to the Y-axis on the box to the right.
[[File:22correlation05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once this is done, click “OK.”

You will get something similar to the graph below:
[[File:22correlation06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

This scatter plot illustrates that there is something like a linear relationship between the two variables.  Basically, no one who scores high on religiosity scores low on spirituality.  However, there are some people who score low on religiosity but who score high on spirituality.  Even so, the general trend is a linear relationship, which means these two variables are suitable for correlation and regression analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whenever you run an analysis in SPSS, the results will automatically open in the Output Window.  

Often, when the Output Window first opens, SPSS will still be shown to be ''Processing...'' your requests.  Once the analysis is complete, the Output Window will display the results, e.g., 
[[File:06understandingoutputwindow01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The above is an Output Window after ''descriptive statistics'' were run on a variable “age”.  The window includes menu bar tooling to edit, save, and print results, as well as a left panel with a special hierarchical tree of links to the output in the main panel that allows you quick output navigation.  That left panel again:
[[File:06understandingoutputwindow02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

“Output”, the root of the tree, represents the whole output window.  If your SPSS preferences are set as ours were to &quot;include Syntax in the log&quot; ([[../Changing_Preferences_to_Include_Syntax_in_Output|next page]]), “Log” will be the next item, pointing to your &quot;[[../SPSS syntax]]&quot;, i.e. the SPSS language commands that produced your output.  The next item, “Frequencies”, indicates that a frequencies analysis was conducted.  Included first in that are the &quot;statistics&quot;, i.e., the mean, median, and mode of the variable “age”:
[[File:06understandingoutputwindow03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Next comes the frequencies table, reporting the absolute number of each age found in our study participants:
[[File:06understandingoutputwindow04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Finally, because of the /HISTOGRAM NORMAL portion of our Syntax, a histogram of the variable “age” is given, complete with normal curve:
[[File:06understandingoutputwindow05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Thus, the Output Window serves two purposes.  It presents the results of your analyses, and keeps a record of everything you've done (if you turn on the syntax; see next page).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is Syntax?==
Syntax is computer programming language.  SPSS use a specific form of syntax that is unique to SPSS. Although the nature of SPSS does not require that you utilize syntax, it can be your friend. Knowledge of syntax is particularly beneficial if you are repeating the same task in SPSS with different variables; it can save you from tedious, repetitive clicks. 

==Starting Simple: Frequency Tables==
Using the example data set on genetic counselors, suppose you want a frequency table for the variable “attend” because you want an idea of how often genetic counselors are attending religious services.   In SPSS click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  → “Frequencies” (this is covered in more depth in Chapter 14). Select the variable “attend.” After you click “continue,” this should show up in your output window:
[[File:24syntax01.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Now, suppose you want a frequency table of the variable “relig” in order to see what religions many of the genetic counselors identify with. You could repeat the above procedure but choose “relig” instead of “attend.”  Or you can use syntax.  

To begin using syntax, go to “File” → “New” → “Syntax,” like this:
[[File:24syntax02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A new white window will pop up that looks like this: 
[[File:24syntax03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

This window is the Syntax Editor window and it allows you to control the many statistical tests available in SPSS (and many other functions) using programming language rather than point and click mouse movements.

One of the easiest ways to get started using syntax is simply to change your Preferences in SPSS to include syntax in the Output Window (see Chapter 7).  You can then use that syntax to run the same commands or similar commands in the Syntax Editor window.  

Returning to the example...  Since we want to run the frequencies on the variable “relig,” we can start by returning to the original output window where you can copy the syntax from your original command just above the frequency table.  The syntax is located in the red box below: 
[[File:24syntax04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

To copy the syntax, you will have to double-click on it, then select it and hit CTRL+C (the copy command in most operating systems).  Now return to the Syntax Editor window and paste the syntax into the blank syntax window you have already opened, it should look like this: 
[[File:24syntax05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

While it is beyond the scope of this chapter to explain all of the syntax commands available in SPSS, the above commands are relatively straightforward.  Let's begin with the first word:
:FREQUENCIES

This is a command that will tell SPSS which statistical test to perform.  In our case, we simply want Frequencies.  The second word is paired with an equals sign and includes our variable of interest:
:VARIABLES=attend

This is a modifier for the first word, FREQUENCIES, that tells SPSS which variables will be analyzed.  The last part of the syntax simply tells SPSS how to organize the analysis and output:
:/ORDER=ANALYSIS.

The period “.” at the end of ANALYSIS tells SPSS that is the end of a series of commands, so the software knows where this small program ends.

Now, erase the word “attend” and replace it with the word “relig,” which is the name of the religious affiliation variable in our example dataset, and click the blue arrow which tells SPSS to run the syntax. The blue arrow is circled below: 
[[File:24syntax06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The new frequency table for the variable “relig” should pop up in your output box.  Voila! You have successfully run a small computer program using SPSS syntax. Your output window will now have frequencies for both variables and should look like this:
[[File:24syntax07.png|center|thumb|400px]]

==Another Example: ANOVA==
This same idea of copying the syntax and using it in the Syntax Editor to quickly run repetitive tasks can be illustrated using several of the variables in the example data set.  Let's pretend you want to know if the religiosity of genetic counselors varies by their attitudes towards women obtaining abortions.  In our sample data set there are seven variables examining attitudes toward abortion, each for a different reason.  You could run the ANOVA seven times, pointing and clicking through the menus each time for each of the seven abortion attitudes variables.  Or you can run it once, copy the syntax, paste it six times into the Syntax Editor, and simply replace the independent variable with the other six abortion attitude variables.

To run the initial ANOVA, click “Analyze” → “Compare Means”  →  “One-Way Anova” (covered in more detail in Chapter 21).  For the dependent variable, you would select “relscale” and in the “Factor” box (which is where the independent variable goes), put the first abortion attitudes variable, “abpoor.” Run the test and you'll see this: 
[[File:24syntax08.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Now, if we wanted to see if the religiosity of genetic counselors varies by their attitudes towards women getting abortions because they are single and do not wish to marry the father of their unborn baby (“absingle”), we begin by copying and pasting the syntax from the ANOVA statistical test in the Output Window into the Syntax Editor window. Replace the variable “abpoor” with the variable “absingle.” The syntax window should look like this:
[[File:24syntax09.png|center|thumb|400px]]

If you wanted to, you could also copy this syntax and paste it five more times, then replace the abortion attitudes variable in the syntax each time.  When you're ready, run the test, click “Run.”  (Note: You can run all six tests at one time by highlighting them all and selecting “Run”.)  In your Output Window you should see this:
[[File:24syntax10.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Once again, genetic counselors' religiosity varies by their abortion attitudes.  However, regardless of whether or not the results show there is no significant relationship, what is important is that you can save time and energy by using syntax, particularly when you have a repetitive task you need to run many times.  This chapter has only scratched the surface of syntax in SPSS; it can be used to run the entire program, avoiding the Data Editor window almost entirely.  It should also be noted that other statistical software, like SAS and R, rely much more heavily on syntax.  SPSS is known for being more user-friendly as it allows people to point and click to run tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Charts and graphs are a way of organizing data so it can be read and interpreted more easily.  In order to choose which type of chart or graph to use you must first decide the level of measurement, i.e., whether the variable is nominal/ordinal or interval/ratio scale. Next, consider the objective behind creating a chart and the target audience. For example, if your audience is the general public, you want your graph to be colorful, uncluttered, and include an overview of the statistics presented.  If your audience is more technical, you may want to use more tables.

One rule of thumb to chart design is the “lost in the parking lot” test: if a stranger were to stumble upon your graph, would s/he have enough information in a simple enough format that spontaneous understanding would occur?

As stated before, choosing which type of graph to create requires that you first determine the level of measurement. In statistics, the basic rules are as follows:
* For nominal/ordinal variables, use pie charts and bar charts
* For interval/ratio variables, use histograms (bar charts of equal interval)

Let's now utilize the Genetic Counselors data set to create and interpret different types of graphs.

==Pie Charts==
This classic chart type is particularly useful for conveying the sense of each constituent's share of a total.  

To share our own pie, first click on the “Analyze” button.  A long menu will drop:
[[File:13creatingcharts01.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Move your mouse to “Descriptive Statistics” and click “Frequencies”:
[[File:13creatingcharts02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A &quot;Frequencies&quot; window will pop up:
[[File:13creatingcharts03.png|center|thumb|400px]]
This is the box where you decide which variables to use and the type of graph/chart to create.

Remember that pie charts are based on a nominal or ordinal variable, so we choose one, &quot;relig&quot;, the self-reported religious affiliation of our survey participants.  Click it and and move it to the Variable(s) box by clicking the blue arrow:
[[File:13creatingcharts04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Next you want to click on the Charts... button and a new window will pop up, prompting selection of type of chart to create. Click on Pie charts. You can also determine if you would like frequencies or percentages to appear with your pie chart:
[[File:13creatingcharts05.png|center|thumb|400px|This window is where you will choose to create not only pie charts, but also bar charts, and histograms.]]
For this example, considering the data as percentages of a total will be most useful, so click Percentages and Continue.

This will return you to the “Frequencies” window. Click OK and the Output Window will pop up and display the requested pie chart, with the source data above it:  
[[File:13creatingcharts06.png|center|thumb|400px]]
From this pie chart we are able to easily see that “Protestant” takes up most of the chart and therefore, most surveyed people consider themselves Protestant.  By referencing the box above the pie chart we can also determine exact percentages and frequencies, for example, that the Jewish percentage of Genetic Counselors is 9.8%.

==Bar Charts==
Bar charts are useful for projecting a sense of competition among categories. Like pie charts, bar charts are used with variables on the nominal/ordinal level of measurement. 

To create a bar chart you use the same steps to create a pie chart, except when the “Frequencies: Charts” window pops up, you of course click Bar charts instead of Pie charts:
[[File:13creatingcharts07.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Let's create a bar chart of our genetic counselor's religiosity, as measured by religious service attendance, to learn the category that &quot;wins the competition&quot;. 

Again we click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics” → “Frequencies”, but this time choose variable “attend”, moving it over via the blue arrow, and clicking on Charts..., then clicking on the Chart Type “Bar charts”.  Finally, we click Continue and OK.  The requested bar chart will be displayed in the Output Window:
[[File:13creatingcharts08.png|center|thumb|400px|N.B. The frequencies along the left are absolute numbers. (Choosing Percentages might have been more helpful.)]]
Here, just as in the pie chart output, you can see the frequencies and percentages in the box located above the bar chart. As you can also see, the most frequent answer when asked “How often do you attend religious services” is “several times a year”. You can also see that the answers are weighted to the left and with this we can more or less instantly conclude that the genetic counselors surveyed do not, as a group, attend religious services as often as they might.

==Histograms==
Histograms, also known as frequency histograms, are similar to bar charts except that the columns of a histogram touch and are of equal interval.  

As stated earlier, interval/ratio variables are used when creating a histogram.

For this example we will use our &quot;age&quot; variable and so see how age varies across genetic counselors.  To do this we again click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics” → “Frequencies”.

Next, just like before, move your chosen variable (age) over using the blue arrow and click on Charts..., Histograms, Continue, and finally, OK.  The Output Window will pop up, displaying first the frequency table:
[[File:13creatingcharts09.png|center|thumb|400px|The frequency and percentage table behind histograms is often large. This is because it accounts for every score, not just a range of scores.]]

And then the histogram:
[[File:13creatingcharts10.png|center|thumb|400px|Notice on the upper right we are also shown the data variable's mean, standard deviation, and sample size.]]

Through this chart we can see that the most frequent answer when asked each person’s age was just under 30 years old. If you were to look at the frequency chart you would see that 57 people answered 28 years old (the &quot;Valid&quot; bar) and 56 people answer 29 years old. This explains why the bar abutting 30 is highest. 

Remember that whenever you present a chart or graph you should provide a clear interpretation geared toward your audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Confidence Intervals help us estimate the precision of our statistics relative to the sampled population. Confidence Intervals are a range of values of a parameter, e.g., a mean. We express this interval with a specific degree of confidence. This degree of confidence tells a reader how confident we are that the population parameter falls within our stated interval.

For this example, we will use the variable “sprscale”, representing answers to question “How Spiritual do you consider yourself?” in our example data set made up of genetic counselors.  This variable allowed the sample of genetic counselors to rank how spiritual they are on a scale of 1 to 10.

To compute a confidence interval in SPSS, you begin by selecting “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  → “Explore.” Once the “Explore” window pops up, scroll down on the left list until you find “sprscale,” then click on the arrow that will send it to the dependent list:
[[File:16confidenceintervals01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Now, click on “Statistics” to pop up a smaller window:  
[[File:16confidenceintervals02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Check the “Descriptives” box and type in the level of confidence that you would like to use.  For this example we'll use 95%. Click “Continue” then “OK.”  The Output Window will now pop up with a variety of statistics, including the confidence interval:
[[File:16confidenceintervals03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The confidence interval we found for how spiritual Genetic Counselors are on a scale of 1 to 10 is 5.99 to 6.36.  We interpret this in plain language by saying “We are 95% confident that the true mean spirituality on a scale of 1 to 10 for the population of genetic counselors is between 5.99 and 6.36.”

== Product Rule ==

When we wish to differentiate a more complicated expression such as
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = (x^2+5x + 7) \cdot (x^3 + 2x - 4),&lt;/math&gt;
our only way (up to this point) to differentiate the expression is to expand it and get a polynomial, and then differentiate that polynomial. This method becomes very complicated and is particularly error prone when doing calculations by hand.  A beginner might guess that the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, but this is not true.  To take the derivative of a product, we use the product rule.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivatives of products (Product Rule)'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = f(x) \cdot g'(x)+f'(x) \cdot g(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

It may also be stated as

:&lt;math&gt;(f\cdot g)'=f'\cdot g+f\cdot g' \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

or in the Leibniz notation as

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{d}{dx}(u\cdot v)=u\cdot \dfrac{dv}{dx}+v\cdot \dfrac{du}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

The derivative of the product of three functions is:

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{d}{dx}(u\cdot v \cdot w)=\dfrac{du}{dx} \cdot v \cdot w + u \cdot \dfrac{dv}{dx} \cdot w + u\cdot v\cdot \dfrac{dw}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the product of two or more functions occurs in many mathematical models of physical phenomena, the product rule has broad application in physics, chemistry, and engineering. 

===Examples===

*Suppose one wants to differentiate ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin(''x''). By using the product rule, one gets the derivative ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'') = 2''x'' sin(''x'') + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;cos(''x'') (since the derivative of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 2''x'' and the derivative of sin(''x'') is cos(''x'')).
*One special case of the product rule is the '''constant multiple rule''', which states: if ''c'' is a real number and ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') is a differentiable function, then ''c&amp;fnof;''(''x'') is also differentiable, and its derivative is (''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;'')&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'') = ''c'' &amp;times; ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x''). This follows from the product rule since the derivative of any constant is zero. This, combined with the sum rule for derivatives, shows that differentiation is linear.

====Physics Example I: rocket acceleration====
[[File:Oracle rocket.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The acceleration of model rockets can be computed with the product rule.]]
Consider the vertical acceleration of a model rocket relative to its initial position at a fixed point on the ground.    Newton's second law says that the force is equal to the time rate change of momentum.  If F is the net force (sum of forces), p is the momentum, and t is the time,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F = \frac{dp}{dt}.
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the momentum is equal to the product of mass and velocity, this yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F = \frac{d}{dt}\left( mv \right),
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where m is the mass and v is the velocity.  Application of the product rule gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F = v\frac{dm}{dt} + m\frac{dv}{dt}.
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the acceleration, a, is defined as the time rate change of velocity, a = dv/dt,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F = v\frac{dm}{dt} + ma.
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the acceleration,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a= \frac{F - v\frac{dm}{dt}}{m}.
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the rocket is losing mass, dm/dt is negative, and the changing mass term results in increased acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandler |first1=David |last2= |first2= |month=October |year=2000 |title=Newton's Second Law for Systems with Variable Mass |journal=The Physics Teacher |publisher= |volume=38 |issue=7 |page=396 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Courtney |first1=Michael |last2=Courtney |first2=Amy |authorlink= |eprint=0903.1555 |title=Measuring thrust and predicting trajectory in model rocketry |class= |year= |version= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physics Example II: electromagnetic induction====
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the induced electromotive force is the negative time rate of change of magnetic flux through a conducting loop.

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromotive force (emf) in volts and
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the magnetic flux in webers.  For a loop of area, A, in a magnetic field, B, the magnetic flux is given by

&lt;math&gt; \Phi_B = B\cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the angle between the normal to the current loop and the magnetic field direction.

Taking the negative derivative of the flux with respect to time yields the electromotive force gives

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{E} &amp;= -\frac{d}{dt} \left( B\cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta) \right) \\
&amp;= -\frac{dB}{dt} \cdot A \cos(\theta) -B \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} \cos(\theta)- B \cdot A \frac{d}{dt}\cos(\theta)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In many cases of practical interest only one variable (A, B, or θ) is changing, so two of the three above terms are often zero.

===Proof of the Product Rule===

Proving this rule is relatively straightforward, first let us state the equation for the derivative: 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ f(x+h)\cdot g(x+h) - f(x) \cdot g(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

We will then apply one of the oldest tricks in the book—adding a term that cancels itself out to the middle:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ f(x+h)\cdot g(x+h) \mathbf{- f(x+h) \cdot g(x) + f(x+h) \cdot g(x)} - f(x) \cdot g(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that those terms sum to zero, and so all we have done is add 0 to the equation.  Now we can split the equation up into forms that we already know how to solve:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = \lim_{h \to 0} \left[ \frac{ f(x+h)\cdot g(x+h) - f(x+h) \cdot g(x) }{h} + \frac{f(x+h) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g(x)}{h} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Looking at this, we see that we can factor the common terms out of the numerators to get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = \lim_{h \to 0} \left[ f(x+h) \frac{ g(x+h) - g(x) }{h} + g(x) \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Which, when we take the limit, becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = f(x) \cdot g'(x) + g(x) \cdot f'(x) &lt;/math&gt;, or the mnemonic &quot;one D-two plus two D-one&quot;

This can be extended to 3 functions:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[fgh] = f(x) g(x) h'(x) + f(x) g'(x) h(x) + f'(x) g(x) h(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
For any number of functions, the derivative of their product is the sum, for each function, of its derivative times each other function.

Back to our original example of a product, &lt;math&gt;h(x) = (x^2+5x + 7) \cdot (x^3 + 2x - 4)&lt;/math&gt;, we find the derivative by the product rule is 
:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = (x^2+5x+7)(3x^2+2) + (2x+5)(x^3+2x-4) = 5x^4+20x^3+27x^2+12x-6\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note, its derivative would &lt;big&gt;'''''not'''''&lt;/big&gt; be

:&lt;math&gt;{\color{red}(2x+5) \cdot (3x^2+2) = 6x^3+15x^2+4x+10}&lt;/math&gt;

which is what you would get if you assumed the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives.

To apply the product rule we multiply the first function by the derivative of the second and add to that the derivative of first function multiply by the second function. Sometimes it helps to remember the memorize the phrase &quot;First times the derivative of the second plus the second times the derivative of the first.&quot;

===Application: proof of the Power Rule===

The product rule can be used to give a proof of the power rule for whole numbers. 
The proof proceeds by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction mathematical induction]. We begin with the base case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; f_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; then from the definition is easy to see that
:&lt;math&gt; 
f_1'(x) = \lim _{ h \rightarrow 0} \frac {x+h - x} h = 1
&lt;/math&gt; 

Next we suppose that for fixed value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, we know that for &lt;math&gt; f_N(x) = x^N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_N'(x) = Nx^{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the derivative of &lt;math&gt; f_{N+1}(x)= x^{N+1}&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt; f_{N+1}'(x) = ( x \cdot x^N) ' = (x)' x^N + x\cdot(x^N)'= x^N + x\cdot N\cdot x^{N-1} = (N+1)x^N. 
&lt;/math&gt; 
We have shown that the statement &lt;math&gt;f_n'(x)=n\cdot x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and that if this statement holds for &lt;math&gt; n=N&lt;/math&gt;, then it also holds for &lt;math&gt;n=N+1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement must hold for &lt;math&gt;n=1, 2, \dots&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quotient Rule==

There is a similar rule for quotients.  To prove it, we go to the definition of the derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &amp;=  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{f(x + h)}{g(x + h)} - \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}{h} \\
                               &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h)g(x) - f(x)g(x + h)}{h g(x) g(x + h)} \\
                               &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(x + h)}{h g(x) g(x + h)} \\
                               &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(x)\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} - f(x)\frac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h}}{g(x) g(x + h)} \\
                               &amp;= \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x) g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This leads us to the so-called &quot;quotient rule&quot;:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivatives of quotients (Quotient Rule)'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[{f(x)\over g(x)}\right] = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Some people remember this rule with the mnemonic &quot;low D-high minus high D-low, over the square of what's below!&quot;

===Examples===
The derivative of &lt;math&gt;(4x - 2)/(x^2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{(4x - 2)}{x^2 + 1}\right] &amp;= \frac{(x^2 + 1)(4) - (4x - 2)(2x)}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \\
                                                  &amp;= \frac{(4x^2 + 4) - (8x^2 - 4x)}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \\
                                                  &amp;= \frac{-4x^2 + 4x + 4}{(x^2 + 1)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Remember: the derivative of a product/quotient '''is not''' the product/quotient of the derivatives. (That is, differentiation does not distribute over multiplication or division.)
However one can distribute before taking the derivative.  That is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left((a+b)\times(c+d)\right) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(ac+ad+bc+bd\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The '''chain rule''' is a method to compute the derivative of the functional composition of two or more functions.

If a function, ''f'', depends on a variable, ''u'', which in turn depends on another variable, ''x'', that is  ''f = y(u(x)) '' , then the rate of change of ''f'' with respect to ''x'' can be computed as the rate of change of ''y'' with respect to ''u'' multiplied by the rate of change of ''u'' with respect to ''x''.

&lt;center&gt;'''Chain Rule'''&lt;br&gt;
If a function ''f'' is composed to two differentiable functions ''y(x)'' and ''u(x)'', so that ''f(x) = y(u(x))'', then ''f(x)'' is differentiable and,

&lt;math&gt;\frac {df}{dx} = \frac {dy} { du} \cdot\frac {du}{ dx}\,\! &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The method is called the &quot;chain rule&quot; because it can be applied sequentially to as many functions as are nested inside one another.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.brown.edu/help/derivtips.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''g'' which is in turn a function of ''h'', which is in turn a function of ''x'', that is 

&lt;math&gt;f(g(h(x)))&lt;/math&gt;, 

the derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''x'' is given by 

&lt;math&gt; \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and so on.  

A useful mnemonic is to think of the differentials as individual entities that can be canceled algebraically, such as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{\cancel{dg}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{dg}}{\cancel{dh}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{dh}}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

However, keep in mind that this trick comes about through a clever choice of notation rather than through actual algebraic cancellation.

The chain rule has broad applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering, as well as being used to study related rates in many disciplines. The chain rule can also be generalized to multiple variables in cases where the nested functions depend on more than one variable.

== Examples ==
===Example I===
Suppose that a mountain climber ascends at a rate of 0.5 kilometer per hour. The temperature is lower at higher elevations; suppose the rate by which it decreases is 6 °C per kilometer. To calculate the decrease in air temperature per hour that the climber experiences, one multiplies 6 °C per kilometer by 0.5 kilometer per hour, to obtain 3 °C per hour. This calculation is a typical chain rule application.

===Example II===
Consider the function ''f''(''x'') = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It follows from the chain rule that

|-

|-

|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{df}{dx} = 6x(x^2+1)^2&lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify.
|-
|}

===Example III===
In order to differentiate the trigonometric function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(x^2),\,&lt;/math&gt;
one can write:

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(x^2)&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Function to differentiate
|-
| &lt;math&gt;u(x)  = x^2&lt;/math&gt; || Define u(x) as inside function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(u)&lt;/math&gt; || Express f(x) in terms of u(x)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{df}{du} \cdot \frac {du}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;  || Express chain rule applicable here
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{d}{du}\sin(u) \cdot\frac {d}{dx}(x^2) &lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute in f(u) and u(x)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = \cos(u) \cdot 2x &lt;/math&gt;  || Evaluate derivatives
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = \cos(x^2)(2x)&lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute u in terms of x.
|-
|}

===Example IV: absolute value===
The chain rule can be used to differentiate &lt;math&gt;\left|x\right|&lt;/math&gt;, the absolute value function:

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x)  = \left|x\right|&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Function to differentiate
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x)  = \sqrt{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; || Equivalent function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;u(x)  = x^2&lt;/math&gt; || Define u(x) as inside function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x)  = [u(x)]^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; || Express f(x) in terms of u(x)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{df}{du} \cdot \frac {du}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;  || Express chain rule applicable here
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{d}{du}u^\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac {d}{dx}(x^2) &lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute in f(u) and u(x)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}u^{-\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2x&lt;/math&gt;  || Compute derivatives with power rule
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2x &lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute u(x) back in terms of x
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{x}{\left|x\right|}&lt;/math&gt;  || Express &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; as absolute value.
|-
|}

===Example V: three nested functions===
The method is called the &quot;chain rule&quot; because it can be applied sequentially to as many functions as are nested inside one another.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;f(g(h(x))) = e^{\sin(x^2)}&lt;/math&gt;, sequential application of the chain rule yields the derivative as follows (we make use of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\frac{de^x}{dx}=e^x&lt;/math&gt;, which will be proved in a later section):

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f(x)  = e^{\sin(x^2)} = e^g&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Original (outermost) function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;h(x)  = x^2&lt;/math&gt; || Define h(x) as innermost function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;g(x)  = \sin(h) = \sin(x^2)&lt;/math&gt; || g(h) = sin(h) as middle function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{df}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;  || Express chain rule applicable here
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dg} = e^g = e^{\sin(x^2)} &lt;/math&gt;  || Differentiate f(g)&lt;ref&gt;The derivative of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;; see [[../Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithm Functions]].&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dg}{dh} = \cos(h) = \cos(x^2) &lt;/math&gt;  || Differentiate g(h)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dx} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;  || Differentiate h(x)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} e^{\sin(x^2)} = e^{\sin(x^2)}\cdot \cos(x^2)\cdot 2x&lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute into chain rule.
|-
|}

==Chain Rule in Physics==
Because one physical quantity often depends on another, which, in turn depends on others, the chain rule has broad applications in physics.  This section presents examples of the chain rule in kinematics and simple harmonic motion.  The chain rule is also useful in electromagnetic induction. 

===Physics Example I: relative kinematics of two vehicles===
[[Image:Physics intersection.png|400px | right | thumb | One vehicle is headed north and currently located at (0,3); the other vehicle is headed west and currently located at (4,0).  The chain rule can be used to find whether they are getting closer or further apart.]]

For example, one can consider the kinematics problem where one vehicle is heading west toward an intersection at 80 miles per hour while another is heading north away from the intersection at 60 miles per hour.  One can ask whether the vehicles are getting closer or further apart and at what rate at the moment when the northbound vehicle is 3 miles north of the intersection and the westbound vehicle is 4 miles east of the intersection.   

'''Big idea:''' use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles.

'''Plan:'''
#Choose coordinate system
#Identify variables
#Draw picture
#Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles
#Express c in terms of x and y via Pythagorean theorem
#Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt
#Substitute in x, y, dx/dt, dy/dt
#Simplify.

'''Choose coordinate system:'''
Let the y-axis point north and the x-axis point east. 

'''Identify variables:'''
Define y(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading north from the origin and x(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading west from the origin.  

'''Express c in terms of x and y via Pythagorean theorem:'''

&lt;math&gt;
c = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt:'''

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Apply derivative operator to entire function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)&lt;/math&gt; || Sum of squares is inside function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\left[\frac{d}{dt}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dt}(y^2) \right]&lt;/math&gt; || Distribute differentiation operator
|-
| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\left[ 2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt}\right] &lt;/math&gt;  || Apply chain rule to x(t) and y(t)}
|-
| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{x\frac{dx}{dt} + y\frac{dy}{dt}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify.
|-
|}


'''Substitute in x = 4 mi, y = 3 mi, dx/dt = −80 mi/hr, dy/dt = 60 mi/hr and simplify'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dc}{dt} &amp; = \frac{4 mi \cdot (-80 mi/hr) + 3 mi \cdot (60) mi/hr}{\sqrt{(4 mi)^2 + (3 mi)^2}}\\
&amp; = \frac{-320 mi^2/hr + 180 mi^2/hr}{5 mi}\\
&amp;= \frac{-140 mi^2/hr}{5 mi}\\
&amp; = -28 mi/hr\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the two vehicles are getting closer together at a rate of 28 mi/hr.

===Physics Example II: harmonic oscillator===

[[Image:Simple harmonic oscillator.gif|right|frame|An undamped spring-mass system is a simple harmonic oscillator.]]

If the displacement of a simple harmonic oscillator from equilibrium is given by ''x'', and it is released from its maximum displacement ''A'' at time ''t = 0'', then the position at later times is given by

&lt;math&gt; x(t) = A \cos(\omega t), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω = 2 π/T'' is the angular frequency and ''T'' is the period of oscillation.  The velocity, ''v'', being the first time derivative of the position can be computed with the chain rule:

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Definition of velocity in one dimension
|-
| &lt;math&gt;  = \frac{d}{dt} A \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; || Substitute x(t)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = A \frac{d}{dt} \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; || Bring constant A outside of derivative
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = A (-\sin(\omega t)) \frac{d}{dt}(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;  || Differentiate outside function (cosine)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -A \sin(\omega t) \frac{d}{dt} (\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;  || Bring negative sign in front
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -A \sin(\omega t) \omega &lt;/math&gt;  || Evaluate remaining derivative
|-
| &lt;math&gt;v(t) = -\omega A \sin(\omega t). &lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify.
|-
|}

The acceleration is then the second time derivative of position, or simply ''dv/dt''.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Definition of acceleration in one dimension
|-
| &lt;math&gt;  = \frac{d}{dt} (-\omega A \sin(\omega t) )&lt;/math&gt; || Substitute v(t)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -\omega A \frac{d}{dt} \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; || Bring constant term outside of derivative
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -\omega A \cos(\omega t) \frac{d}{dt} (\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;  || Differentiate outside function (sine)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -\omega A \cos(\omega t) \omega &lt;/math&gt;  || Evaluate remaining derivative
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a(t) = -\omega^2 A \cos(\omega t).  &lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify.
|-
|}

From Newton's second law, ''F = ma'', where ''F'' is the net force and ''m'' is the object's mass.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;250pt&quot; |Newton's second law
|-
| &lt;math&gt;  = m (-\omega^2 A \cos(\omega t))&lt;/math&gt; || Substitute a(t)
|-
| &lt;math&gt; = -m\omega^2  A \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; || Simplify
|-
| &lt;math&gt; F = -m\omega^2  x(t).&lt;/math&gt;  || Substitute original x(t).
|-
|}

Thus it can be seen that these results are consistent with the observation that the force on a simple harmonic oscillator is a negative constant times the displacement.

==Chain Rule in Chemistry==
The chain rule has many applications in Chemistry because many equations in Chemistry describe how one physical quantity depends on another, which in turn depends on another.  For example, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles, all of which can also depend on time. 

===Chemistry Example I: Ideal Gas Law===
[[Image:Ideal gas isotherms.png|thumb|right|300px| Isotherms of an ideal gas. The curved lines represent the relationship between pressure and volume for an ideal gas at different temperatures: lines which are further away from the origin (that is, lines that are nearer to the top right-hand corner of the diagram) represent higher temperatures.]]

Suppose a sample of ''n'' moles of an ideal gas is held in an isothermal (constant temperature, ''T'') chamber with initial volume ''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The ideal gas is compressed by a piston so that its volume changes at a constant rate so that ''V(t) = V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - kt'', where ''t'' is the time. The chain rule can be employed to find the time rate of change of the pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;UBC&quot;&gt;University of British Columbia, UBC Calculus Online Course Notes, Applications of the Chain Rule, http://www.ugrad.math.ubc.ca/coursedoc/math100/notes/derivative/chainap.html Accessed 11/15/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal gas law can be solved for the pressure, ''P'' to give:

&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{ n R T}{V(t)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P(t)'' and ''V(t)'' have been written as explicit functions of time and the other symbols are constant.  Differentiating both sides yields

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = n R T \frac{ d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{V(t)}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant terms, ''n'', ''R'', and ''T'', have been moved to the left of the derivative operator.  Applying the chain rule gives

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = n R T \frac{ d}{dV} \left( \frac{1}{V(t)}\right)\frac{dV}{dt} = n R T (- \frac{1}{V^2}) \frac{dV}{dt}, &lt;/math&gt; 

where the power rule has been used to differentiate ''1/V'',  Since ''V(t) = V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  - kt'', ''dV/dt = -k''.  Substituting in for ''V'' and ''dV/dt'' yields ''dP/dt''.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = - n R T k \left( \frac{1}{(V_0-k t)^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Chemistry Example II: Kinetic Theory of Gases===
[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|300px|The temperature of an ideal monatomic gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its atoms. The size of helium atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 atmospheres of pressure. The atoms have a certain, average speed, slowed down here two trillion fold from room temperature.]]

A second application of the chain rule in Chemistry is finding the rate of change of the average molecular speed, ''v'', in an ideal gas as the absolute temperature ''T'', increases at a constant rate so that ''T = T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + at'', where ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial temperature and ''t'' is the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;UBC&quot;/&gt;  The kinetic theory of gases relates the [[root mean square]] of the molecular speed to the temperature, so that if ''v(t)'' and ''T(t)'' are functions of time,

&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \left( \frac{3 R T(t)}{M} \right) ^{1 \over 2}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the ideal gas constant, and ''M'' is the molecular weight.

Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} v(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{3 R T(t)}{M} \right) ^{1 \over 2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule to express the right side in terms of the with respect to temperature, ''T'', and time, ''t'', respectively gives

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dT} \left( \frac{3 R T}{M} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\frac{dT}{dt}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the derivative with respect to temperature, ''T'', yields

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{3 R T}{M} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \frac{d}{dT}\left( \frac{3RT}{M}\right) \frac{dT}{dt}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the remaining derivative with respect to ''T'', taking the reciprocal of the negative power, and substituting ''T = T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + at'', produces

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{M}{ 3 R (T_0 + a t)} \right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}\frac{3R}{M}\frac{d}{dt}\left( T_0 + at \right).  &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the derivative with respect to ''t'' yields

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{M}{ 3 R (T_0 + a t)} \right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}\frac{3R}{M} a.  &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{a}{2} \left( \frac{3R}{M (T_0 + a t)} \right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent.  These are functions that crop up continuously in mathematics and engineering and have a lot of practical applications.  They also appear in more advanced mathematics, particularly when dealing with things such as line integrals with complex numbers and alternate representations of space like spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems.

We use the definition of the derivative, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;,
to work these first two out.

Let us find the derivative of sin ''x'', using the above definition.

|-
|}

Now for the case of cos ''x''.

|&lt;math&gt; = -\sin{x} \, \!&lt;/math&gt;||solution
|}

Therefore we have established

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cos(x) = -\sin(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}



To find the derivative of the tangent, we just remember that:

&lt;math&gt;\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is a quotient.  Applying the quotient rule, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tan(x) = \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, remembering that &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, we simplify:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\sec^2(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}  \tan(x) = \sec^2(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

For secants, we again apply the quotient rule.

:&lt;math&gt;\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} \sec(x)&amp;=\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\\
&amp;=\frac{\cos(x)\frac{d 1}{dx}-1\frac{d \cos(x)}{dx}}{\cos(x)^2}\\
&amp;=\frac{\cos(x)0-1(-\sin(x))}{\cos(x)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Leaving us with:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sec(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sec(x) = \sec(x) \tan(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Using the same procedure on cosecants:
:&lt;math&gt;\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

We get:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \csc(x) = -\csc(x) \cot(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Using the same procedure for the cotangent that we used for the tangent, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cot(x) = -\csc^2(x) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Exponential Function==

First, we determine the derivative of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; using the definition of the derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^{x+h} - e^{x}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

Then we apply some basic algebra with powers (specifically that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b'' + ''c''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;  ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^{x} e^{h} - e^{x}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; does not depend on ''h'', it is constant as ''h'' goes to 0.  Thus, we can use the limit rules to move it to the outside, leaving us with:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^{h} - 1}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the limit can be calculated by techniques we will learn later, for example [[Calculus/L'Hôpital's rule]], and we will see that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^h - 1}{h} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

so that we have proved the following rule:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;

&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the exponential function'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Now that we have derived a specific case, let us extend things to the general case.  Assuming that ''a'' is a positive real constant, we wish to calculate:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}a^x&lt;/math&gt;

One of the oldest tricks in mathematics is to break a problem down into a form that we already know we can handle.  Since we have already determined the derivative of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, we will attempt to rewrite ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; in that form.

Using that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;ln(''c'')&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c'' and that ln(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;) = b &amp;middot; ln(a), we find that:

:&lt;math&gt;a^x = e^{x \cdot \ln(a)} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we simply apply the chain rule:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}e^{x \cdot \ln(a)} = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\cdot \ln(a) \right] e^{x \cdot \ln(a)} = \ln(a) a^x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the exponential function'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}a^x = \ln\left(a\right)a^x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

== Logarithm Function ==

Closely related to the exponentiation is the logarithm.   Just as with exponents, we will derive the equation for a specific case first (the natural log, where the base is ''e''), and then work to generalize it for any logarithm.

First let us create a variable ''y'' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \ln\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that what we want to find is the derivative of ''y'' or &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;.

Next we will put both sides to the power of ''e'' in an attempt to remove the logarithm from the right hand side:

:&lt;math&gt;e^y = x&lt;/math&gt;

Now, applying the chain rule and the property of exponents we derived earlier, we take the derivative of both sides:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^y = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This leaves us with the derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}  = \frac{1}{e^y}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting back our original equation of ''x'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;, we find that:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the Natural Logarithm'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\ln\left(x\right) = \frac{1}{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

If we wanted, we could go through that same process again for a generalized base, but it is easier just to use properties of logs and realize that:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_b(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)} &lt;/math&gt;

Since 1 / ln(''b'') is a constant, we can just take it outside of the derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\log_b(x) = \frac{1}{\ln(b)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Which leaves us with the generalized form of:

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the Logarithm'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\log_b\left(x\right) = \frac{1}{x\ln\left(b\right)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

== Logarithmic Differentiation ==
We can use the properties of the logarithm, particularly the natural log, to differentiate more difficult functions, such a products with many terms, quotients of composed functions, or functions with variable or function exponents. We do this by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, re-arranging terms using the logarithm laws below, and then differentiating both sides implicitly, before multiplying through by y.

&lt;math&gt;\log(a^n) = n\log(a)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
{{col-break}}
&lt;math&gt;\log(a) + \log(b) = \log(ab)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}

See the examples below.

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
Suppose we wished to differentiate 
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{(6x^2+9)^2}{\sqrt{3x^3-2}}&lt;/math&gt;
We take the natural logarithm of both sides
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \ln(y) &amp; = \ln\Bigg(\frac{(6x^2+9)^2}{\sqrt{3x^3-2}}\Bigg) \\
            &amp; = \ln(6x^2+9)^2 - \ln(3x^3-2)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
            &amp; = 2\ln(6x^2+9) - \frac{1}{2}\ln(3x^3-2) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating implicitly, recalling the chain rule
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} &amp; = 2 \times \frac{12x}{6x^2+9} - \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{9x^2}{3x^3-2} \\
                                           &amp; = \frac{24x}{6x^2+9} - \frac{\frac{9}{2}x^2}{3x^3-2} \\
                                           &amp; = \frac{24x(3x^3-2) - \frac{9}{2}x^2(6x^2+9)}{(6x^2+9)(3x^3-2)} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by ''y'', the original function
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(6x^2+9)^2}{\sqrt{3x^3-2}} \times \frac{24x(3x^3-2) - \frac{9}{2}x^2(6x^2+9)}{(6x^2+9)(3x^3-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us differentiate a function 
:&lt;math&gt;y=x^x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the natural logarithm of left and right
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \ln y &amp; = \ln(x^x) \\
          &amp; = x\ln(x) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We then differentiate both sides, recalling the product and chain rules
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} &amp; = \ln(x) + x\frac{1}{x} \\
                                           &amp; = \ln(x) + 1 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by the original function ''y''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = x^x(\ln(x) + 1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

;Example 3

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
Take a function
:&lt;math&gt;y=x^{6\cos(x)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \ln y &amp; = \ln(x^{6\cos(x)})\,\! \\
          &amp; = 6\cos(x)\ln(x)\,\! \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We then differentiate
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = -6\sin(x)\ln(x)+\frac{6\cos(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
And finally multiply by ''y''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{dy}{dx} &amp; = y\Bigg(-6\sin(x)\ln(x)+\frac{6\cos(x)}{x}\Bigg)\\
               &amp; = x^{6\cos(x)}\Bigg(-6\sin(x)\ln(x)+\frac{6\cos(x)}{x}\Bigg)\\
                
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

[[File:Christian world map.png|thumb|right|300px|Countries shown in purple have 50% or more Christians; countries shown in pink have 10% to 50% Christians.]]
About two billion people follow some form of Christianity.

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==

Christianity is practiced all over the world.  It is the majority religion in much of the world, but a minority religion in large parts of Africa and Asia.

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

Christianity is a '''monotheistic''' religion: it teaches that there is one God.  It teaches that, about two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born in human form to a virgin mother, was killed by crucifixion, rose from the dead, and ascended back into Heaven.  His death is regarded as atoning for the sins of humanity, allowing humans to be saved.

Christianity says that those who are saved will enter the kingdom of Heaven with God.  Different forms of Christianity teach different things about who will be saved.  A very common teaching is that those who lead a good life will enter Heaven when they die.  Some other teachings are that everyone will be saved, that those who confess their sins before death will be saved, or that who will be saved has already been determined before we are born.

[[File:Meister des Reliquienkreuzes von Cosenza 002.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An ornate Christian cross.  The picture in the center is Christ, and the pictures at the four points of the cross are the authors of the '''Gospels''' in the New Testament.]]
Crucifixion is a form of execution that was practiced by the ancient Roman empire; the person to be killed is attached (often ''nailed'') to a cross and left to die.  A cross is a common symbol of Christianity.  The Cross may be shown as a simple shape, or may be shown with a likeness of Jesus Christ attached to it.  A Christian cross with a likeness of Jesus attached is called a ''crucifix''.
[[File:Small crucifix.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A small crucifix.]]

Most Christian sects consider Jesus himself to be God, holding that he is the second person of the '''Trinity''', which is the doctrine that God is three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost). These three are nonetheless considered to be one God.

The God of Christianity is considered to be the God of Abraham, just as with [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Judaism|Judaism]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Islam|Islam]].

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==

The holy books of Christianity are gathered in one large text called the Bible.

The Bible has two parts: the Old Testament and the New Testament.  The Old Testament comes from the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Judaism|Jewish]] tradition, and tells the story of God's love for the Jewish people.  The New Testament is originally Christian, and tells the story of Jesus Christ, and the spread of Christianity through Paul.  Four books of the New Testament, called '''Gospels''', each tell the story of Jesus Christ.  The authors of the four Gospels are traditionally Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

One of the major holidays of Christianity is Christmas, which celebrates the birth of Christ. It is on December 25, and is usually celebrated with presents and family gatherings.

Another major Christian holiday is Easter, a Sunday in March or April which commemorates the resurrection of Christ. &quot;Easter Eggs&quot; are often hunted for or decorated as part of the celebration.

== What is the history of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

This religion was founded when Jesus Christ began to preach of heaven at the age of 30. Three years later, Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead, which was when this religion truly began.

== Who are some famous people who have practiced {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Anthony the Great.   251&amp;ndash;356.      

Augustine of Hippo.  354&amp;ndash;430.

Francis of Assisi.  1181&amp;ndash;1226.

Thomas Aquinas.  1225&amp;ndash;1274.

Martin Luther.  1483&amp;ndash;1546.

Mother Teresa.  1910&amp;ndash;1997.

Martin Luther King, Jr.  1929&amp;ndash;1968.

Desmond Tutu.  Born 1931.

== What is a story from {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

One of the stories of this religion is the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. 

A woman named Mary was engaged to a man named Joseph, but they were not yet married. One day, the angel Gabriel came to earth to tell Mary that she was pregnant with the Son of God. When Joseph found out she was pregnant, he decided to not marry her, but he too was visited by an angel who changed his mind.  Just before Jesus was born, they had to travel to Bethlehem for a census.  Because so many people had also travelled to Bethlehem, the inns were full, and there was no place for Joseph and Mary to stay.  They ended up staying in a stable, and that is where Jesus was born.

Treap Example: enforce the invariants:

  Binary Heap : Priority Parent &gt; Priory Children
  Binary Tree : Left child &lt; node &lt; right child

Operation * : rotation ( left )

  for a Node to be left rotated ( marked * in example below)
caller code:
   ...
   Node = rotate_left(Node)
   ...

function rotate_left(Node):
    tmp = Node-&gt;right
    Node-&gt;right = tmp -&gt;left
    tmp -&gt; left = Node

Example:
Initially, this is a valid binary tree, but not a valid binary heap.

    
Insert Xenophon(Priority=56) into tree with root Sally(Priority=66)


        Sally | 66   
        /        \
    Harry| 33     Ted | 44      
      /               \
                    Victor | 33
                         \
                         William | 22 


----------------------------------
Step 1: do a usual binary tree insert into a empty leaf.


        Sally | 66   
        /        \
    Harry| 33     Ted | 44     
      /               \
                    Victor | 33
                          \
                         William | 22 
                             \
                             Xenophon | 56
                             (a)/


In-order traversal : visit left tree, visit node, visit right subtree

H S T V W X
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Now the heap invariant has to be established, starting with the recently
inserted node. 

If there is a pointer between child node to parent, then

&lt;pre&gt;
while parent priority &lt; node priority:
  if right child of parent, do  left rotate at parent
   else /* left child of parent */
       do right rotate at parent

&lt;/pre&gt;

Otherwise, a post insertion check is done
&lt;pre&gt;

treap_insert( node, current):
    if (current = null)
       return node
    if ( node.key &lt; current.key) 
        current.left = treap_insert( node, current.left)
    else 
        current.right = treap_insert( node, current.right)

    if current.left != null and current.left.priority &gt; current.priority 
                              and 
                                 ( current.right == null or
                                   current.right.priority &lt; current.left.priority ) then
            current = right_rotate(current)
      else if current.right != null and current.right.priority &gt; current.priority 
            current = left_rotate(current)
    return current

&lt;/pre&gt;

NB move by rotating  , instead of  exchanging parent and node, as in normal binary heap.

&lt;pre&gt;

         Sally | 66   
        /          \
    Harry| 33      Ted | 44     
      /               \
                    Victor | 33
                          \
                      Xenophon | 56
                     /
                   William | 22 
                           \ 
                            (a)

William is parent and is left rotated with Xenonphon.
Xenophon was Williams right child, now becomes parent
and William is left child, whereas Xenophon's left child (a) is
now William's right child (a).

In-order traversal
H S T V W X

&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
      Sally | 66   
       /        \
  Harry|33    Ted | 44     
     /              \
                    Xenophon | 56
                     /
               Victor | 33
                   \
                William | 22 
                     \ (a)

Victor is left rotated with Xenophon

In-order traversal is still
H S T V W X
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
            Sally | 66   
         /              \
    Harry| 33          Xenophon | 56
      /               /
                  Ted | 44   
                      \
                   Victor | 33
                        \
                     William | 22 

Ted is left rotated with Xenophon, Victor , X's left child becomes T's 
right child, which was formerly X, and T becomes X's new left child.

In-order traversal
H S T V W X

&lt;/pre&gt;
Xenophon does not have greater priority than parent (Sally)
so while loop exits.
                     

&lt;/pre&gt;

Although this example doesn't look perfectly balanced, when a treap is used to randomly rotate the tree at
each insertion, overall, the greater number of trees inserts will produce a well-balanced tree, as compared to
a normal binary tree produced from say a non-decreasing ordered sequence of key inserts ( which looks like a 
linked list ).

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Using the &lt;code&gt;projection()&lt;/code&gt; function, you can create 2d drawings from 3d models, and export them to the dxf format. It works by projecting a 3D model to the (x,y) plane, with z at 0. If &lt;code&gt;cut=true&lt;/code&gt;, only points with z=0 will be considered (effectively cutting the object), with &lt;code&gt;cut=false&lt;/code&gt;, points above and below the plane will be considered as well (creating a proper projection).

'''Example''': Consider example002.scad, that comes with OpenSCAD. 

[[File:Openscad projection example 2x.png]]

Then you can do a 'cut' projection, which gives you the 'slice' of the x-y plane with z=0. 

 projection(cut = true) example002();

[[File:Openscad projection example 3x.png]]

You can also do an 'ordinary' projection, which gives a sort of 'shadow' of the object onto the xy plane. 

 projection(cut = false) example002();

[[File:Openscad example projection 8x.png]]

'''Another Example'''

You can also use projection to get a 'side view' of an object. Let's take example002, and move it up, out of the X-Y plane, and rotate it:

 translate([0,0,25]) rotate([90,0,0]) example002();

[[File:Openscad projection example 4x.png]]

Now we can get a side view with projection()

 projection() translate([0,0,25]) rotate([90,0,0]) example002();

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. It's free and requires no personal information. Here are some advantages:

* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.

* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customise]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* You become a recognized member of the [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Wikibooks community]].

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing Gitosis ==

=== Checkout the Gitosis Repository ===

To install Gitosis, [[Git/Obtaining_Git|you first must have the Git client installed]]. Once installed, checkout a copy of Gitosis from its repository:

  git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git

Install:

  cd gitosis
  python setup.py install

=== Create a User to Manage the Repositories ===

Create a user to manage the repositories:

  sudo adduser \
    --system \
    --shell /bin/sh \
    --gecos 'git version control' \
    --group \
    --disabled-password \
    --home /home/git \
    git

If you don't already have a public RSA key, create one on your local computer:

  ssh-keygen -t rsa

=== Copying Your Public Key to the Gitosis Server ===

Copy this key to the Gitosis server. Assuming you are in your home directory:

  scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user@example.com:/tmp

== Setting up Gitosis ==

=== Initializing Gitosis ===

Initialize Gitosis:

  sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub

Upon success, you will see:

  Initialized empty Git repository in ./
  Initialized empty Git repository in ./

Ensure the Git post-update hook has the correct permissions:

  sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update


== Configuring Gitosis ==

=== Clone the Gitosis Repository ===

Gitosis creates its own Git repository. To configure Gitosis, you will clone this repository, set your configuration options, then push your configuration back to the Gitosis server.

Cloning the Gitosis repository:

  git clone git@example.com:gitosis-admin.git
  cd gitosis-admin

=== Creating a Repository ===

Edit &lt;code&gt;gitosis.conf&lt;/code&gt;

An example of a default gitosis.conf:

  [gitosis]                  

  [group gitosis-admin]
  writable = gitosis-admin
  members = jdoe 

=== Defining Groups, Members, Permissions, and Repositories ===

You can define groups of members and what permissions they will have to repositories like so:

  [group blue_team]
  members = john martin stephen
  writable = tea_timer coffee_maker

In this example, anyone in the group &lt;code&gt;blue_team&lt;/code&gt;, in this case john, martin, and stephen, will be able to write to the Git repositories &lt;code&gt;tea_timer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;coffee_maker&lt;/code&gt;

Save, commit, and push this file.

  git commit -am &quot;Give john, martin, and stephen access to the repositories tea_timer and coffee_maker.&quot;
  git push

=== Creating a Repository ===

Next, create one of the repositories. You'll want to change to the directory where you you want to store your local copy of the Git repository first.

Create the repository:

  mkdir tea_timer
  cd tea_timer
  git init
  git remote add origin git@example.com:tea_timer.git
  # Add some files and commit.
  git push origin master:refs/heads/master
  # The previous line links your local branch master to the remote branch master so you can automatically fetch and merge with git pull.

=== Adding Users to a Repository ===

Users are identified by their public RSA keys. Gitosis keeps these keys inside the directory &lt;code&gt;keydir&lt;/code&gt; within the gitosis-admin repository. Users are linked to their Git username by the name of the key file. For example, adding an RSA key to &lt;code&gt;keydir/john.pub&lt;/code&gt; will link the user john to the machine defined by the RSA within &lt;code&gt;john.pub&lt;/code&gt;. Keys ''must'' end in .pub!

Add a user:

  cd gitosis-admin
  cp /path/to/rsa/key/john.pub keydir/
  git add keydir/*
  git commit -am &quot;Adding the john account.&quot;
  git push

John can now clone the git repositories he has access to as defined by &lt;code&gt;gitosis.conf&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, he can both read and write to the repository as he has &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt; permissions.

== Communication Assistance ==

The iPod Touch can also be used as a communication device for students who need assistance communicating with others. There are several applications that are similar to assistive technology Voice Output Communication Aids (VOCAs) which have been used for years with individuals with autism and other communication needs.

[[Image:Proloquo2go homescreen.png|right|thumb|400px|Proloquo2Go Home Screen (Used with permission)]]

[http://www.proloquo2go.com/ Proloquo2Go] is a product from AssistiveWare that provides a full-featured communication solution for people who have difficulty speaking (Proloquo2Go, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;Proloquo2Go&quot;&gt;AssistiveWare. (2009). Proloquo2Go: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) for iPhone and iPod Touch. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.proloquo2go.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; This application uses natural sounding text-to-speech voices and symbols to assist users with communication needs. Proloquo2Go contains a default vocabulary of over 7000 items, as well as full expandability. Users can also add their own text using the keyboard function to speak items that are not contained in the vocabulary. Special educators and therapists have found this to be a cost-effective augmentative communication device that has opened up a new world for individuals with communication needs. 

Another product that can help students with communication needs is the application [http://www.adastrasoft.com/Expressionist.html Expressionist], which was created by AdastraSoft (AdastraSoft, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Expressionist&quot;&gt; Adastrasoft (2009). Expressionist. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.adastrasoft.com/Expressionist.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionist contains over 120 commonly used expressions and over 1000 nouns organized into categories. This application uses a picture approach, instead of a traditional sentence composition approach, to illustrate an expression or a concept. Expressionist uses a black and white character along with photographs to create composite images. This provides students with images that are less confusing than other devices that use secondary references (i.e. – using a turtle or snail to indicate slow). 

Students who benefit from the structure of schedules and visual prompts would benefit from [http://www.handholdadaptive.com/ iPrompts]. This application is a visual prompting tool that was designed especially for special educators, parents, and therapists to use with language impaired individuals (AppShopper, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;iPrompts&quot;&gt; App Shopper. (2008) App Shopper: iPrompts (Medical). Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://appshopper.com/medical/iprompts.&lt;/ref&gt; iPrompts was developed by the parents of a boy with autism and a speech-language pathologist. This application does not contain any audio prompts or voice output. There are four main components to iPrompts: picture schedules, visual countdown timer, choice prompts, and a visual library. iPrompts is an easy to use alternative to velcro cards and magnet boards that stores schedules and social stories in a portable device. Although this device would be primarily used by adult caregivers, it can provide students with an alternative way to receive visual reminders about their day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kamehameha I''' (c. 1758–May 8, 1819), united all the Hawaiian Islands together to form the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810.  

==Early Life==

No one is quite sure exactly what year Kamehameha was born. Hawaiians did not have a written language before the 1800s. Some say Kamehameha was born in 1758 because that is the year Halley’s comet was seen in Hawaii. According to a prophecy, a fiery light in the sky would come before the birth of a “killer of cheifs.” Alapa’i, the chief of the island of Hawai’i, heard about this prophecy and ordered the baby Kamehameha to be killed. Kamehameha’s parents, Chief Keōua and Chiefess Kekuʻiapoiwa, secretly gave him to a trusted friend Nae’ole to take care of him and keep him safe from Chief Alapa’i. Five years later, Chief Alapa’i decided that maybe Kamehameha would not kill him and invited him back to live with his family.

==Unifying the Islands==

When Kamehameha was 14, he overturned the Naha Stone. According to legend, only someone from the royal Naha family could move the stone. Whoever lifted the Naha Stone, would be the one to unite all of the Hawaiian Islands. Even though Kamehameha was not from the Naha family, he lifted and overturned the stone. Today, you can see the Naha Stone in front of the Hilo Public Library.
From 1782 until 1810, Kamehameha fought many battles to conquer each of the Hawaiian islands. First, he defeated his cousin Kiwala’o and Chief Keawemaʻuhili who ruled the island of Hawai’i. Next, he defeated Chief Kalanikupule who ruled Maui and ‘Oahu. Kamehameha tried several times to attack Chief Kaumualiʻi of Kauai but was unsuccessful. Chief Kaumuali’i seeing there was no way to stop Kamehameha’s powerful army, offered to surrender Kauai and Ni’ihau.

==Wives and Children==

	King Kamehameha had many wives. His favorite wife was Kaahumanu. Kaahumanu had no children of her own but she hanai adopted Kamehameha’s son Liholiho. Kaahumanu was a strong political figure and even when Liholiho became King Kamehameha II she became his regent. A regent is someone who rules for someone else who is too young to rule.
	Keōpūolani was Kamehameha’s highest ranking wife. She had at least three children. Liholiho and Kauikeaouli were her sons. They would become Kamehameha II and Kamehameha III. Nāhiʻenaʻena was her daughter. Her other children died when they were very young.

==Death==

	Kamehameha died on May 8, 1819. Following Hawaiian customs, his bones were hidden by two of his most trusted friends. Even today no one knows where his body was buried.

After Kamehameha died, Liholiho became King Kamehameha II.

      <comment>/* Mechanical Advantage */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Encyklopedia_0211.jpg|thumb|342px|tight|Drawing of simple mechanisms, from an encyclopedia published in 1728.]] 
A simple machine is a device that changes the direction or amount of a force. They are the building blocks used to build more complex machines. For example, wheels, levers, screws, and pulleys are all used in a bicycle.

The six simple machines are:

* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Inclined_Plane|Inclined Plane]]
* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Lever|Lever]]
* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Pulley|Pulley]]
* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Screw|Screw]]
* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Wedge|Wedge]]
* [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Wheel|Wheel and Axle]]

=Mechanical Advantage=
Simple machines are the most basic mechanisms that use mechanical advantage (also called leverage) to multiply force. How do they do that? It's actually because of a concept called work. You know that if you walk 2 miles to school, it's harder than if you had to walk 1 mile to school. How much effort does each step take? The effort is however much it takes to move your body. Scientists and engineers call how much effort you use over a distance 'work'.

A simple machine uses a force to do work on a load. If there was no friction, the amount of work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. Simple machines are often used to increase the amount of the output force. But there is a trade-off, the more force is increased, the less distance is covered. The ratio of the output to the input force is called the mechanical advantage.

=History=
The idea of a &quot;simple machine&quot; originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes. He studied the lever, pulley, and screw. He also discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. During the Renaissance the classic five simple machines (excluding the wedge) began to be studied as a group. The complete theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600. He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.

FIXME

=== ffmpeg2theora ===

run this once: 
 mkfifo stream.ogv

then to stream run these two lines:
 dvgrab - | ffmpeg2theora -f dv -x 352 -y 288 -v 7 -o stream.ogv - &amp;
 cat stream.ogv | oggfwd icecast.example.org 8000 password /stream.ogv

adjust size and quality (-v) down if encoding is slower than realtime and your cpu core is maxed out. go up with them if your cpu is not loaded above 50% and video is fluid but ugly. if the encoding cannot keep up with real time, you will have drops in the stream. watch the second timers in the shell - they should both be at almost the same values.

FIXME

=== FreeJ ===

You can stream online your video: [http://freej.org FreeJ] encodes using the [http://theora.org/ Ogg/Theora] codec and broadcasts to an [http://www.icecast.org Icecast] server.

When streaming also an audio channel, you need to run also a [http://jackaudio.org/ Jack] daemon and connect it to the FreeJ outputs.

While streaming, is also possible to save a local copy of the video, all realtime. Here below a script example:

&lt;code&gt;
// Audio input is taken via Jack from other applications running

//                    port name     buffer size  samlerate

audio = new AudioJack(&quot;alsaplayer&quot;, 2048,        44100);

// tweak the values below accordingly, see Jack documentation


// Create a Video Encoder object

//    values 1-100         video quality  video bitrate  audio quality  audio_bitrate

encoder = new VideoEncoder(10,             64000,        0,             24000);

// Add the audio channel in the video encoded

encoder.add_audio(audio);


// Configure the encoder to stream over an Icecast server

encoder.stream_host(&quot;giss.tv&quot;);

encoder.stream_port(8000);

encoder.stream_title(&quot;testing new freej&quot;);

encoder.stream_username(&quot;source&quot;);

encoder.stream_password(&quot;2t645&quot;);

encoder.stream_mountpoint(&quot;freej-test.ogg&quot;);

// Register the encoder on the running FreeJ engine

register_encoder(encoder);

// Start a network stream

encoder.start_stream();

// Record the stream into a local file

encoder.start_filesave('Video/freej-test.ogg');

&lt;/code&gt;

We can paste the above code into a script and run it with ''freej -j stream.js''

Besides tweaking this scripts for various accounts it is also possible to include
it as part of a bigger FreeJ script, to mix multiple sources with text and effects
and even control it from a MIDI, OSC or Joysticks...

{{mbox|type=warning|This template must only be used on '''User [[Help:Talk page|discussion]]''' pages.}} }} }}

Regarding your recent question in the general reading room, please note that Wikibooks has no general help desk.

|After the creation of 'GioveLUG Educational v.1.00' in 2006, which was Puppy Linux 2.11 based, the GioveLUG of Terracina created in 2007 &quot;Edupup 2.00 Beta” a 140 Mb distro based on Puppy 3.01. It should work with 128 Mb ram but it is better to have some swap. It should work also with 64 Mb ram and a big swap partition. Packages: - Firefox rather than Seamonkey; - MPlayer rather than Xine; - GSlapt package manager; - Puppy Software Installer By MU; - Petget Package manager. Packages for kids: - TuxPuck - Funny and simple hockey table game; - TuxMath 1.5.7 - Great game to learn math; - TuxType2 1.5.3 - Learning to type the keyboard; - TuxPaint 0.9.14 - Paint and fun Smile; - TuxPaint-Config 0.0.5; - TuxStamps-2004.10.3; - ChildsPlay 0.90 - A very good suite of learning games;
NB: This is a light version of Edupup without GCompris, Squeak, Exe Learning, Chess games etc...
This distro has no active development anymore, please see forum.

**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

== Introduction ==
Here we will introduce verbs and how to use them in Cajun French.  However, we first need to understand the subject pronouns.  In English these are the words I, you, he/she/it, we, and they.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:200px&quot; | '''French''' || style=&quot;width:200px&quot; | '''English''' || '''Pronunciation'''
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Singular
|-
| Je || I || ʒə [No English Equivalent]
|-
| Tu || You || Like '''two''' or more commonly '''tee'''
|-
| Vous || You (polite form) || Like '''Vooz''' if before a word that starts with a vowel&lt;br /&gt;Like '''Voo''' if before a word that starts with a consonant
|-
| Il/Y || He || Like the letter E
|-
| Elle/É || She || Like the letter L if before a word that starts with a vowel&lt;br /&gt;Like the letter A before a word that starts with a consonant
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Plural
|-
| On || We || ɔ̃ [No English Equivalent] if preceding a consonant&lt;br /&gt;Like English '''on''' if preceding a vowel
|-
| Vous-autres || You (y'all) || Sounds like '''Vooz-aught'''
|-
| Ils || They || Like the letter E if before a consonant&lt;br&gt;Like eez before a vowel
|-
| Ça / Eusse / Eux-autres || They ||| In order they're said '''sah''', '''us''', and '''uhz-aught'''
|}

These, generally, are the subject pronouns and how they are pronounced in Cajun.  There are some other ones that can be used, but for now let's stick to these.

===Être (To Be)===
Now we can learn our first verb!

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:400px; text-align:center;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot; | '''Être (To Be)'''
|-
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | Cajun || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | Cajun || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English
|-
| '''Je''' sus [j'sus] || I am || '''On''' est || We are
|-
| '''Tu''' es [t'es] || You are ||  '''Vous-autres''' est || You are (Y'all are)
|-
| '''Il/Elle/Ça/Eusse/Eux-autres''' est || He/she is, or They are || '''Ils''' sont || They are 
|-
| '''Vous''' êtes || You are (formal) || ||
|}

Je and Tu elide (combine) with the conjugation.  So ''Tu est'' is said ''T'es'' and ''Je sis'' is ''J'sus''.  Être corresponds to &quot;am/are&quot; in English.  Here are some sample sentences that are good practice.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:500px; text-align:center;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''Examples of Être.'''
|-
| Cajun || English
|-
| J'sus un étudiant à cette école. || I am a student at this school.
|-
| Il est un bon cuisinier. ||  He is a good cook.
|-
| Eusse est bien jolie. ||  They are very pretty.
|-
| Il est trois heures quinze. || It is 3:15.
|-
| Elle est la meilleure chanteuse.  || She is the best singer.
|}

Note that we tell time by using être.  Être is irregular.  This means that most verbs do not follow the pattern that être does.  However, it is very frequently used so it is taught first.

===Avoir (To Have)===
Another important verb is Avoir.  This means &quot;To Have&quot; in English.  Also, later you will see that it is used for talking about things that happened in the past.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:400px; text-align:center;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot; | '''Avoir (To Have)'''
|-
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | Cajun || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | Cajun || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English
|-
| '''Je''' ai [j'ai] || I have || '''On''' a || We have
|-
| '''Tu''' as [t'as] || You have ||  '''Vous-autre''' a || You have (Y'all have)
|-
| '''Il/Elle''' a || He/she has || '''Ils/Elles''' ont || They have
|-
| '''Vous''' avez || You have (formal) || ||
|}

'''Ils sont''' and '''Ils ont''' sound very similar.  However, it is very important to note their distinctions.  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:350px; text-align:center;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''Differences in pronunciation''' 
|-
| Ils sont (They are) || isɔ̃ (has an '''s''' sound, '''ee sohn''')
|-
| Ils ont (They have) || '''Either''' izɔ̃ (has a '''z''' sound, '''eez on''')
|}


===Aller (To Go)===

Aller is a very important verb in Louisiana French because as in English, the verb &quot;go&quot; is used extensively.  Also, aller is used in making the future tense of the verb for the vast majority of verbs in Louisiana French, in fact you will hear every verb used with aller in the future, its just that there are some verbs like être who have the future conjugation of '''sera''', but this will be discussed shortly.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#f7f7ff; border: solid 1px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:400px; text-align:center;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot; | '''Aller (To Go)'''
|-
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | French || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | French || style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | English
|-
| Je vas [j'vas] || I go || On va || We go
|-
| Tu vas || You go || Vous allez || You go (formal, and rare)
|-
| Il/Elle va || He/she goes || Ça/Eusse/Eux-autres va || They go
|-
| Ils vont || They go || ||
|}

      <comment>why I removed CV</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To start, we should go through and change all of the mis-spellings of the word &quot;résumé&quot;.
:I am changing it where I find it, for consistency.  But most dictionaries seem to accept resume as an equally valid spelling, as well as the less common variant resumé. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:49, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

== CV's ==
I have moved CV's from the section heading.  In my experience the type of information included, the layout and style, as well as formatting of CV's is quite different to resumes. The information here is quite resume specific. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:03, 4 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Objectives==
* Create a Template
* Create and define a new style
* Research to find synonyms
* Create multiple worksheets
* Create Cylinder Charts
* Create headers and footers
* Link data from multiple sheets to a summary page
==Vocabulary==
*'''Consolidate''' - Summarizing data from multiple worksheets on to one worksheet. 
*'''Dummy Data''' - Sample data used in place of actual data to verify formulas.  Usually you check simple numbers and numbers where you expect a change to occur. 
*'''Date Series''' - Excel will list dates in order for you - Jan, Feb, Mar, ...
*'''Auto Fill Series''' - Excel will create a set of the same number over and over again - 1, 1, 1, ...
*'''Linear Series''' - Excel will create a set of numbers in order - 1, 2, 3, ... or 2, 4, 6, ...
*'''Growth series''' - Excel can create a series that is multiplying by a number from one cell to the next - 2, 4, 8, 16, ....
*'''Round Function''' - you can set the number of decimal places by using the round function.  =ROUND(number, number of digits) Example: =round(2.34567, 3)  would give the value of 2.346
*'''Format Codes''' - a series of format symbols that defines how a cell entry assigned a format will appear. Example: [blue]#,##0.00;  will make the the number appear blue and will round to the closest hundred.  
**'# - digit placeholder Example: ###.## would give the format of any number of digits before the decimal, and only two digits after. 
**0 - functions like a #, except places a 0 in the ones place if the number is less than 1.  
** . - Make it certain that excel will place a decimal point.  Example: #0.00 forces two decimal places. 
** % - Displays numbers as a percent
** , - Displays a comma to separate the numbers into thousands, millions, ...
** ( ) - Places parenthesis around negative numbers
** $ - places a dollar sign in front of numbers making them currency
** '*' - Makes the dollar sign a fixed dollar sign &quot;$*&quot;
** [color] - changes the color of the text or numbers
** &quot;text&quot; - places text in with a number Example &quot;Week&quot; 1 would count as just 1 so you could use it in a formula
** _ - places a space after the character that follows the underscore. 
*'''Drilling an Entry''' - Enter a number once in the first worksheet and have it fill into all selected worksheets into the same cell. 
*'''3-D Range''' - A range of cells that spans multiple worksheets
*'''Sheet reference''' - The name of the sheet you are working with
*'''Annotate''' - Add text to define a part of the worksheet or chart, usually with a text box and arrow. 
*'''Comments''' - Text attached to a cell that describes the function of the cell, they are not printed and should include:
**worksheet title
**author's name
**Date created
**Date last modified
**Template used
**Description of the purpose of the worksheet or cell or formula

User-generated content is becoming accepted for curriculum materials in many schools and states. What Wikipedia started has grown into a system that produces not only encyclopedia articles, but also K-12 and higher education textbooks and primary reading curricula. In some ways, user-generated content is a reflection of both the changing nature of knowledge and expertise and  changing teaching practices and learning theory. This book will focus on user-generated content that can be used to support the curriculum in a bricks-and-mortar or online classroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cultural diversity''' ''is defined as the ethnic, gender, racial, and socioeconomic variety in situations, institutions, and groups.''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;   
[[File:Women.jpg|thumb|right|Appreciation of and Respect for Differences]]
Cultural diversity can be found everywhere we look, however this article focuses specifically on the impact of cultural diversity in the business world.  The business world is a treacherous interpersonal landscape to navigate when dealing with people of a similar culture to ourselves, but this pales in comparison to the complexity of dealing with other cultures. 

'''Why is cultural diversity such a challenge?'''  The problem we face when dealing with people of different cultures is that the false consensus effect confuses us.  The false consensus effect is the tendency to believe that others see the world more like us than they actually do.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; People of different cultures see the world even more differently from us than we are used to, yet the false consensus effects leads us to behave as though people of other cultures see things just like we do.  This creates confusion, misinterpretations, poor decisions, ineffectiveness, and is bad for business.  The solution is cultural intelligence, which is described later.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Cultural diversity is becoming more and more important.'''

•	White males occupy 5% fewer management jobs in 2006 than in 1998, and every other racial/gender group occupy more management jobs.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

•	The U.S. population of foreign born residents is 12.4%, an amount of international diversity that the U.S. has not seen since 1920.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

•	90% of leading executives from 68 countries named cross cultural leadership as the top management challenge of the next century.&lt;sup&gt;6,7&lt;/sup&gt;

•	The proportion of revenue coming from overseas markets is expected to jump by an average of 30 to 50 percent over the next 3 to 5 years.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Today’s corporations recognize the importance of cultural diversity.'''  Many companies value diversity so strongly that they devote large sections of their websites towards diversity.  Companies share their personnel statistics to illustrate their relatively progressive minority staffing for jobs in lower management, upper management, and their board of directors.  Such companies want to show that they are meritocracies where minorities will be treated equally, which leads to greater diversity.  Notably culturally diverse companies include Aetna, AT@T, Booz Allen Hamilton, General Mills, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lucent Technologies, Nissan, Price Waterhouse Coppers, Toyota,  and Waster Management. These companies have received many awards that recognize their pursuit of a more diverse workplace.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

== Advantages of Diversified Teams ==

'''What are the advantages of diversified teams?''' Many organizations fall into the trap of creating a team, based on a need – need of completing a project, hitting a deadline or filling a role.  They seldom base the project on the need for different perspectives or ensuring that the group brainstorm is effective.  Thus, there are many advantages to creating diversified teams that focus on a common goal and work towards a universal solution.  More and more companies and associations are realizing the importance of diversity in teams in this modern society.  There are many advantages to different cultural backgrounds, diverse experiences within team members and the benefits of individual brainstorming.  By creating diverse teams, with people of different backgrounds and cultures, the group can help prevent groupthink.  Diversity provides a greater variety of perspectives and ideas, which can lead to more creative solutions.  “Workplace diversity now focuses on inclusion and the impact on the bottom line. Leveraging workplace diversity is increasingly seen as a vital strategic resource for competitive advantage.”&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Defining diversity is problematic diversity refers to the ways that people in organizations differ. “That sounds simple, but defining it more specifically is a challenge because people in organizations differ in a great many ways - race, gender, ethnic group, age, personality, cognitive style, tenure, organizational function, and more. There is also the fact that diversity not only involves how people think of others and how this affects their interaction but how they conceive of themselves.” &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;  In When Teams Work Best, Cooke and Szumal “discovered that across a variety of problem-solving groups, constructive individual styles – as opposed to aggressive and passive styles – are associated with higher quality solutions.” &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; By creating a diverse team, an organization is empowering individuals to perform at a higher-level and to increase productivity.

'''There are still many people who view working in teams as an ineffective practice.'''  There is the old adage that two heads are better than one, but many do not see the relevance in meeting in teams to work on projects.  It may appear, especially to those that have had bad team experiences in the past, the more people on a team, the more confusion and wasted time in finding the end result.  But this is not the case – it only means that the team needs to be restructured.  “Seeing differences among people as the same, makes diversity a benign, almost meaningless, concept.” &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;  It is essential for organizations to design effective teams, including the team players that will manage and utilize this arena for success.  The “team process” has to be constantly managed and diversified if necessary.  

'''Teams provide a setting where politics can be worked out and diverse individuals can come together to share their cultures and backgrounds.'''  It is important to rely on other team members to delegate the workload and to learn from individual experiences.  This is the key element to any organization and needs to be the focus for any decision-making strategy.  In addition, it is important to understand that some teams do not work well together.  “Clearly, the attitudes, styles and interaction patterns of team members have a direct impact on performance outcomes.” &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Management must understand that it is not the formation of a team that is faulty, but the design of the team.

==Disadvantages of Diversified/International Teams==

'''SCOPE:''' 

The scope of the Disadvantages of Diversified Teams portion focuses on challenges within the international team related to language, culture, stereotypes, preconceptions, and   differing value systems.  These challenges make it difficult for a team to develop team cohesiveness and foster collaboration, which then leads to mistrust, miscommunication and misunderstanding.  Included are ways to overcome these difficulties when working in an international team.
Some of the disadvantages of international teams are:

'''Language-'''

One of the first disadvantages of working in an international team can be the impact of language.  Even though we use might use the same words does not mean that we use the same language.  This is especially evident when we compare American English and British English.  Two people might be using the same words, but understand one another on a completely different level.  Multi-International teams have individuals who will not be able to converse in their native tongue.  Undoubtedly, this will lead to some form of misunderstanding when working together for at least one member of the group. “When people speak with their team in a language other than their native one, it often affects their ability to interact with the group.  It potentially affects spontaneity, clarity of expression (vocabulary and pronunciation), and willingness to express ideas.  This is more challenging if your culture is indirect or your personal style is more introverted.” &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Specific areas of miscommunication can be found in the form of vocabulary, language style, non verbal communication, and the unwillingness to express ideas.   

•	'''Vocabulary-''' The vocabulary that we and others use can sometimes be confusing to others who do not speak the same native language, let alone to those who do.   Many miscommunications can arise if we are not aware of the speech and vocabulary we use and how it is interpreted by the receiving party.  

•	'''Language Style-''' Varying nationalities communicate differently.  When working in teams some individuals may be very direct and blunt, while others may be indirect and vague in their communication.  Each person may interpret these language styles differently. It is important to recognize the differing language styles and the common misunderstandings that can come from it. Accents, pronunciation, slang and the use of idioms can also cause fundamental misunderstandings. 

•	'''Non Verbal Communication-''' A majority of communication is done through non verbal communication.  Non verbal communication has an enormous impact on intercultural communication because of the way in which it can be misinterpreted from one culture to the next.  Non verbal communication can give off mixed signals if you are not aware of the communication style of the person with whom you are working.

•	'''Unwillingness to express ideas-''' The inferiority complex where team members feel they cannot express themselves in the language that is being used, so they do not express their ideas. 

'''Culture-'''

''Culture is everything we see around us.''  It is how we act, what we think, and what we believe.  It is the words we use, the food we eat, and the clothes we wear.  However, beyond these things mentioned underlies invisible values and beliefs that make up behaviors that are unique to each society.  We may be able to see the obvious outward signs that make up ones culture, but oftentimes we fail to understand the invisible culture.  “The only way to deal successfully with people from a different country is to be aware of what’s going on beneath the surface and use that knowledge to shape your own behavior and expectations.  If you don’t understand that what’s below the surface is far more powerful and potentially dangerous than what you can see, you run the risk of hitting the invisible part of the iceberg.” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;   Because there are so many cultures and each one has its unique set of beliefs, below are listed a couple of cultural pitfalls to take into consideration.

•	'''Attitudes toward time-'''The difficulty in dealing with international teams is that each culture has a different attitude toward time.  This can cause problems when prioritizing tasks and completing tasks within certain deadlines.

•	'''Different Value Systems-''' “Peoples’ values are expressed through what they say and what they do.  Therefore people working together from different cultural backgrounds may find that they approach and execute tasks differently because of differences in their cultural values.  Understanding differences in value systems helps us to understand how and why individuals may behave differently to ourselves.  This can help us work more effectively together and make the most of the benefits that those differences offer.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 

'''Preconceptions &amp; Stereotypes-'''

Stereotypes are the tendency we have to simplify the world by putting people into a category, and then fitting the individual into the stereotype of that category.  If you interact with a team member from a particular country, you may have the tendency to put another a future team member in the same category as the first team member with whom you interacted.

== Ways to overcome difficulties when working in an international team ==

'''Language-''' 

Open and effective communication is paramount in any team, international or not.  Therefore, any miscommunications that can be mitigated beforehand will only accentuate the success of the team.  “Establish conversational rules from the beginning.  Acknowledge differences in accents and encourage team members to be mindful of them.  Remind team members to refrain from using words with multiple meanings, idioms, or slang.” &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Non verbal communication-'''

•	“Even if you don’t speak the language, it’s a good idea to become versed in a culture’s nonverbal expressions, such as touching or bowing, personal gestures, and the display of emotions.” &lt;sup&gt;20 &lt;/sup&gt; 

•	Keep in mind that “There exists no body movement, no facial expression, no gesture which could arouse the same reaction all over the world.  A smile expresses friendliness in one society, in another embarrassment, in yet another it can include an enemy’s warning that attack is imminent if tension is not released.” &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Limit hand gestures and maintain a moderate body posture.” &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Silence can mean agreement, disagreement, or contemplation.  Be careful not to make assumptions and express the overt message whenever possible.” &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Do not interpret the absence of disagreement as agreement” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Nonverbal communication is powerful.  Learn about the ways in which members express negative concepts.  Silence is often one way to do this, but it also may show respect and allow contemplation of another person’s comment.” &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Culture-'''

In order to overcome some of the difficulties of working in international teams, the book Managing Across Cultures suggests that we have a global mindset.  A global mindset is “the ability to recognize and adapt to cultural signals so that you intuitively see global opportunities and are effective in dealing with people from different backgrounds around the world.”  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; 

The book also suggests three ways to mitigate any cultural problems before they become a problem.  They are:

•	“Increase each individual team member’s knowledge of his or her own cultural values.  This can be accomplished through suggested readings and online resources.” &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Increase the team’s collective knowledge of the range of cultural differences in the group.  It is important for people to review details of the cultures present in their team and think about where they might face challenges.” &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;

•	“Encourage people to assess their own personal cultural styles and how those styles may affect the group” &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;

Other suggestions are:

•	Do not assume things about a particular group or individual.  

•	Take time to get to know others.  

•	Learn about others’ cultures and customs in order to build and sustain relationships within your international team.  

•	Be sure to treat everyone in the group equally, regardless of their nationality.  

•	Learn about each other’s strengths and weaknesses.  

•	Do not put your own culture and way of doing things above others.  

•	“Try to see tasks from the other person’s point of view before you judge their contribution or performance.” &lt;sup&gt;30 &lt;/sup&gt; 
    
'''Stereotypes &amp; Preconceptions-'''

Do not give into preconceptions and stereotypes. Know that they exist and realize there are ways to prevent them.  Encourage face-to-face interactions so team members can diminish any stereotypes that may exist.  “Trust often develops when members establish credibility by demonstrating their abilities and competence.  Give team members the opportunity early on to engage in tasks that demonstrate their skills or introduce team members to each other by highlighting their past experiences and current expertise with the matters at hand.”

==Cultural Intelligence (CQ)==

''“Cultural Intelligence is the outsider’s ability to interpret someone’s unfamiliar and ambiguous gestures the way that person’s compatriots would “ ''

''First there was IQ, then came EQ, and now there is CQ''

We are culturally groomed to think and behave in a certain ways from the time we were babies.Every country and company has different cultural programming that result in varied sets of strengths and weaknesses.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Every company and department has culture, some more distinct than others. Every country or region exhibits some cultural differences that distinguish them from one another and are fully understood only by the people from within.  There are people that have the ability to seemingly fit-in and mingle within virtually any environment or group and there are others that find the cultural boundaries impossible to cross. What if these differences and boundaries are present and around daily in the team someone is a part of for eight to ten hours a day? How do people with huge mentality and understanding gaps fit in and become an effective team? International and highly diversified teams are becoming more and more common as the world becomes more flat, but people still carry their learned behaviors and mentality. These differences may present a communication wall and prevent team from functioning.

The bad news is that very few people are gifted with high cultural intelligence, but the good news is that people can change that. Cultural Intelligence is related to Emotional Intelligence (EI) and one thing that they share in common is the “propensity to suspend judgment and think before acting”.  Take as an example international team that consists of people from US and India. It is very difficult to determine what features are natural and could be attributed to the individual and what are related to the place of birth. If people on the team have low CQ they much more likely to label the team-members from the other country, become less interested in the individuals and thus hinder the team’s cohesiveness. Increasing team members CQ could help in overcoming some of the disadvantages of working on international/distributed teams by removing cultural boundaries and increasing personal trust and connection. 
[[File:Artificial.intelligence.jpg|thumb|right|Intelligence?]]

Most managers fit within one of six established profiles. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

•	'''The provincial:''' Effective when working with people of similar background, but lacks the ability to work with people from other cultures

•	'''The analyst:''' Tries to methodically analyzes other cultures and tries to apply learned strategies

•	'''The natural:''' Relies entirely on his own natural intuition and avoids learning more or improving based on established techniques

•	'''The ambassador:''' Likes differences and welcomes them, does not know much about the culture, but he is confident he can handle it. 

•	'''The mimic:''' Has a high degree of confidence in his actions. Easily communicates and fits in. 

•	'''The chameleon:''' Possesses high degree of CQ and could be even mistaken for native in certain situations.

CQ is a relatively new notion and term but some countries are already establishing structures to advance this skill in the general population. Singapore has created a center devoted to CQ at a major university, which offers training, consulting, and other resources for this subject.http://www.cci.ntu.edu.sg/

Companies also benefit from increased CQ. Besides increased revenues, companies that worked to enhance their leaders' CQs expanded internationally faster and became more successful at attracting and retaining top talent. 

There are many different tests that could help people get a better understanding of their personal strengths and weaknesses and frameworks that could help build up CI. It takes commitment, learning and patience acquiring the necessary skills and thus increasing the Cultural Intelligence level, however this skill could prove to be invaluable in a world that is growing closer together each day.

A good start to improving CI level is testing it: http://www.cq-portal.com/

== Conclusion ==

'''Improving CQ, verbal and non-verbal communication will improve teams and managers.'''
Once people understand and improve their CQ, they will be better equipped to work within and lead diverse workgroups. Managers of tomorrow will need to unite team members from various backgrounds and cultures; more importantly, the different cultures and norms of the team members will need to be deciphered and used for the greater good of the team.  Similar to the collaborative multinational peace efforts carried out by the United Nations, or the global manufacture and sales practices of Honda, companies can achieve more if team members and management understand and build off of each other’s strengths, culture, and norms.  Diverse teams will only succeed if dissimilar team members work together and CQ is the solution.

Please add pages that require cleanup and state what is needed here.

==Suggestions==
* Get rid of all the table of content (TOC) templates.
* The book needs to have dedicated sections. Your [[Talk:Java Programming/Todo|suggestions]] are welcome.
** I would certainly think it a good idea adding the sections beginner, intermediate and advance.
*** Why can't we have a table of contents and index that tie together the entire book as a reference, and then three extra pages as road-maps for &quot;Begginer&quot;, &quot;Intermediate&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot; ?
***:Skill order (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) is a good idea but it is better to follow this order implicitly rather than explicitly. Cutting the book into three parts that doesn't follow the topics makes no sense. The topics will naturally be listed from the basics to the advanced concept. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 21:49, 5 November 2012 (UTC)
*** I don't see what purpose this would serve other than to confuse beginners. If this book is dedicated towards newbies then it should be structured in a way suited to them. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattylaws|contribs]]) 13:36, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
*I suggest adding in some information about the Grrenfoot program.  It is a slightly easier way for newcomers to Java to learn how to program games.

==New Layout==
I'm going to have a crack at suggesting a possible outline for the book.
* '''Introduction/Preface''' - Contains introduction material to the book, including mentions of contributors and styles and conventions used throughout.
* '''Setup''' - Start preparing the users' computer, installing JDK and explaining the technology that is Java, I'd like to see some mentions of other operating systems such as Unix and Unix Like systems seeing as Java is designed to be a cross platform language.
* '''Beginner''' - basic program flow, get the user used to the syntax of Java, maybe treat this chapter as an introduction to programming in general, giving an introduction to object orientated programming.
* '''Intermediate''' - this could be a good starting point for people who have programmed before, but switching to Java, talking about various core aspects and features of the API.
* '''Advance''' - Revisiting some topics mentioned before, but in greater depth. Talking about things like RMI, Corba.
* '''Index'''
* '''Appendix''' - Keywords, references, bibliography and other stuff worth mentioning
*:Skill order (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) is a good idea but it is better to follow this order implicitly rather than explicitly. Cutting the book into three parts that doesn't follow the topics makes no sense. The topics will naturally be listed from the basics to the advanced concept. So the ''Beginner'', ''Intermediate'' and ''Advanced'' topics should be replaced by ''Language fundamentals'', ''Classes and objects'', ''Collections'', ''Exceptions'', ''Concurrent Programming'', ''Javadoc &amp; Annotations'', ''Byte Code''.

==Steady Progression==
This book is more of a reference than a learning book. It needs to be easier for newbies starting out how to program. Then have dedicated more advance topics later.--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattylaws|contribs]]) 12:37, 19 August 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Subject:UNIX|Unix]] is an operating system designed for use on any kind of computer or computing device. Current versions of Unix are running on everything from supercomputers to mobile phones.  It is a multi-tasking, multi-user system.  This means that a person using a Unix system can run more than one job, that is do more than one task at once, and that more than one user can share the resources of a single Unix system.  Multi-tasking is common on personal computers now, but it was not always and most desktop personal computers probably still run as single user systems.  

Some Unix systems have a graphical user interface (GUI) or graphical desktop environment similar to [[Subject:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] or [[Subject:Mac OS|Mac OS]].  Nonetheless, to take best advantage of Unix it is worth knowing  something about how to use the system without the GUI.

Many Unix systems are released under one or other of the ‘free’ software licences, such as the GPL.  Because of this they provide a cheap way to get a powerful operating system.

Unix is also part of the underlying technology of the Internet.  Although no operating systems has any exclusive claim to the Internet, many of the standard technologies, protocols and applications that make up the Internet were first developed on Unix systems.  Unix is also an attractive tool for internetworking because it was designed to be a mult-user system from the outset.  Many of the web servers that serve up the World Wide Web for example run a program called [[Apache]] under Unix.

==The difference between Unix and Unix-Like==

==Types of Unix==
There are many different flavours of Unix but they all have much in common and many of them have a standard core of functionality that is identical. Some popular flavours of Unix are 
*  [[Subject:Linux|Linux]] Distributions 
*  [[Subject:Mac OS|Mac OS]] 
*  [[BSD]] 
** [[FreeBSD]]
** [[NetBSD]]
** [[OpenBSD]]
*  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29 Solaris]

The unity in diversity of Unix systems means that it is easy to develop applications which can run on many different hardware platforms.  Although the different Unixes are not identical, programs can usually be easily adapted or simply cross compiled to run on systems other than that for which they were originally developed.

==A note on example material==

When this book is used in the classroom a single text file - referred to as ''science.txt'' in this book - is required.  This text file was created by Jim Tyson from the Wikipedia article ''[[Science]]'' by simply removing all non-textual elements and all formatting.

== Book Hierarchy ==

Hi Jimbotyson,

Thanks for your work on [[A Quick Introduction to Unix]].  As someone who knows Unix enough to dare write a book about it, I'm sure you are one to appreciate structure and organization.  At Wikibooks we have a policy of organizing the chapters in a book hierarchically.  However, your new book is not yet organized that way.  Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] to see what I mean.  Basically, each chapter or page in your new book appears &quot;in the root directory&quot; so to speak, so they each look like a book in their own right.  If you need help fixing this, please do not hesitate to ask. Thanks again for your work here! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:44, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

Hi Jomegat,

I confess, I'm having more trouble than I anticipated organising this thing!  Maybe you can help?  I seem to be missing the point of the help files.

I have a training manual, written by me, that we use.  I would like to add it to wikibooks (which will mean editing out some of our site specific content).  I want to do this both to add to wikibooks but also because we can leverage the wikibook technology to make for easy content management of our Unix courseware!  I wanted to have it organised as Book -&gt; chaptpers -&gt; sections.  I *thought* that the way to do that would be to create each section as a page (the lowest level module so to speak); link pages sequentially for on-line use; use book creator to organise pages into chapters into a book.  But I'm wrong aren't I?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Jim

:Happy to pitch in. You do need to create each chapter as its own page, but the name of the page you create needs to have the book's title at the beginning, followed by a slash, followed by the chapter name.  For sections, it should be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book/chapter/section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It's just like a directory structure in Unix.  So if bar is a chapter in foo, you'd create it as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo/bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of creating a page as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  To fix what you've done so far, we'll need to move some pages, but that's not hard to do.  It's just ''work!''  There are shorthand ways of referencing pages as well.  If you're in the top level of the book (i.e., in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), you can link to ''bar'' by putting &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/bar/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The leading slash tells the software that this is a subpage of the current page.  The trailing slash tells it to only display the name of the current page.  You could also write that as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/bar|bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (the pipe says, &quot;I know it's named foo/bar, but I want you to display it as just ''bar'').  To create a link to a chapter ''baz'' from within chapter ''bar'', you'd write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../baz/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I would jump in and make some moves for you, but I'm not sure of your intended hierarchy. But the way to approach it is to do the move first, then edit the link in the referencing page.  The move will leave a redirect behind (sort of an &quot;ln -s&quot; thing, but not quite). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:20, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
::Ha.  And all the while I'm writing to you to explain how to do it, [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] has been out there patching things up for you.

==Sandbox Pages==

Hi, please don't create test pages in the &quot;main space&quot;. You can create test pages as sub pages of your user page. The one you created has been moved here: [[User:Jimbotyson/My sandbox page]]. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:40, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== Matlab Primer ==

Hello [[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]], I have noticed you are the creator of the following pages:

*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Programming]]
*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Variables]]
*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Desktop]]
*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Solving Equations]]
*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Curve Fitting]]
*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab as Calculator]]

*[[Matlab Primer/Matlab Scripts and Function Files]]

As [[Matlab Primer]] was already deleted, I am curious to know if you have abandoned the pages above. If you have, I will be recommending the deletion of the mentioned pages due to their lack of meaningful content. In the future, please try to only create pages with content, or at least a clear structure for future content (ie. headings and brief descriptions of planned content). Doing so will allow for others to develop the book further in the future. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 02:46, 27 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Formal classification:''' It would be helpful to give examples of principles of classification so one would know exactly what they are 
'''Informal classification:''' example is rather long, I would recommend cutting some sections out.. 

For example, Calvin needed to organize &lt;s&gt;his&lt;/s&gt; an analysis,&lt;s&gt; requested by his employer, of advertisements in three trade journals for the heavy equipment industry.&lt;/s&gt; Calvin could have created a formal classification by grouping the ads according to an objective characteristic, such as their size or number of words used in them. Instead, he classified them according to the type of advertising appeal they made. &quot;Type of advertising appeal&quot; is not an objective characteristic. Defining an ad's appeal requires subjective interpretation and judgment. Calvin used this informal classification because it best matched his readers' goal, which was to plan the advertising strategies he would use later in the year when he began placing ads in the three journals.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=General Design Concepts=
== &lt;u&gt;'''Designing Reader-Centered Pages and Documents'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

You build your communications out of ''visual'' elements: the dark marks of your words, sentences, and paragraphs against the light background of the page, as well as your drawings and graphs and tables. Your readers ''see'' the visual design of these elements before they read and understand your message. And what they see has a powerful effect on the success of your communications, on its usability and persuasiveness.

Here are ways that good design enhances usability.

• Good design helps readers understand your information.

• Good page design helps readers locate information quickly. 

• Good design helps readers notice highly important content.


Here are some ways good design affects readers' attitudes, thereby increasing a communication's persuasiveness.

• Good design encourages readers to feel good about the communication itself.

• Good design encourages readers to feel good about the communication's subject matter.


=== A Reader-Centered Approach to Design ===

Because page design can have such a significant impact on your communication's usability and persuasiveness, you should approach design in the same reader-centered manner that you use when drafting text and graphics. Think continuously about your readers, including who they are, what they want from your communication, and the context in which they will be reading.

=== Design Elements of a Communication ===

It is helpful to think about the building blocks of a page design in the way that professional graphic designers do. When they look at a page, they see six basic elements.

• '''Text.''' Paragraphs and sentences.

• '''Headings and titles.''' Labels for sections of your communication.

• '''Graphics.''' Drawings, tables, photographs, and so on -- including their captions.

• '''White space.''' Blank areas.

• '''Headers and footers.''' The items, such as page numbers, that occur at the top or bottom of each page in a multipage document.

• '''Physical features.''' These include paper, which may take many shapes and sizes, and bindings, which come in many forms.

== &lt;u&gt;'''CREATING GRAPHICS'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
 
&lt;u&gt;
'''Planning'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Identify places where graphics will increase your communication’s usability.
#Identify places where graphics will increase your communication’s persuasiveness.
Note: Make sure not to add graphics to areas that will alter the flow of the document/communication. Add graphics in places in between paragraphs or other logical breaks in the document. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Selecting&lt;/u&gt;'''
#Select the types of graphics that will best support your readers’ tasks.
#Select the types of graphics that will effectively influence your readers’ attitudes.
#Select the types of graphics that will best support your case.


&lt;u&gt;'''Designing'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Design graphics that are easy to understand and use.
#Design them to support your readers’ tasks.
#Design graphics that your readers will find persuasive.
#Keep your graphics simple enough for easy use.
#Label content clearly.
#Provide your graphics with informative titles.
#Address the graphics with a sort summary of results or caption about the graphic.


&lt;u&gt;'''Using Color'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Use colors to support your message.
#Use color for emphasis, not decoration or too distracting from the body text.
#Choose a color scheme, not just individual colors.
#Provide high contrast between text and background.
#Select colors with appropriate associations.
#Limit the number of colors.
#Use color to unify the overall communication.


&lt;u&gt;'''Integrating with the Text'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Introduce each graphic in the text first.
#Tell your readers the conclusions you want them to draw from the graphic.
#Provide all explanations your readers will need in order to understand and use each graphic.
#Locate each graphic near its references.

&lt;u&gt;
'''Addressing an International Audience'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Check your graphics with persons from other nations for clarity when possible.
#Check your graphics with technology for problems when intra-converted between computer systems.


&lt;u&gt;'''Using Graphics Ethically'''&lt;/u&gt;
#Avoid elements that might mislead your readers.
#Obtain permission from the copyright owner of each image that is not in the public domain.
#Give credit to all involved in the development or research of the graphic.
#Be sure the graphic will benefit the document overall and will not just add unnecessary clutter.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;	From Paul V. Anderson’s Technical Communication: A Reader-Centered Approach

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Thyroid Lymphoma'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Background==
Lymphomas make up only 2% of all thyroid gland malignancies. Thryoid gland lymphomas make up only 2% of extranodal lymphomas.
Associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis

==Pathology==
Nearly all thyroid lymphomas are B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thyroid and T cell lymphomas have been reported but are very rare.

60-80% are DLBCL; 30% are extranodal marginal zone lymphoma; &lt;10% follicular lymphoma. 
Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MALT type) is most commonly associated with Hashimoto's.

==Staging==
50% - Stage IE (limited to thyroid gland)
45% - Stage IIE (limited to thyroid gland and regional nodes)
5% - Stage III/IV

==Treatment results==

'''''Case Series:'''''
*'''Royal Marsden Hospital; 2005''' (1936-96) PMID 15845932 -- &quot;Management of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thyroid: the Royal Marsden Hospital experience.&quot; (Harrington KJ, Br J Radiol. 2005 May;78(929):405-10.)
**91 pts, retrospective. Stage I-II in 91% (38%/53%). Path = not reviewed or reclassified. 91% were intermediate or high grade. 
**Treatment: 89 pts received RT. 27 pts received chemotherapy (13 planned, either prior to or following RT; 14 for relapse after RT; 2 chemo alone). RT was EFRT (modified mantle) in 64, IFRT (thyroid + neck) in 25. Dose: median 40 Gy. 
**5-yr OS 48%, median RFS 34 mo. Multivariate analysis for OS: Stage, Debulking Surgery, EFRT (HR=0.45) vs IFRT. Dose was not significant for OS but was sig. for LC. 52% of pts with IFRT had LRF (20% local alone, 32% L+D) vs 26% for EFRT (9% local alone, 17% L+D). 
**Conclusion: IFRT should be abandoned in favor of EFRT. Suggest dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions. EFRT alone is effective for Stage I but not Stage II. For Stage II or higher, chemotherapy followed by EFRT is recommended. 

*'''MDACC; 2001''' (1959-94) PMID 11241227 -- &quot;Localized non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the thyroid gland.&quot; (Ha CS, Cancer.  2001 Feb 15;91(4):629-35.)
**51 pts, retrospective. Stage I-II (41%/59%). Path = Working Formulation: DLCL in 60%; 96% were intermediate or high grade. A subset(n=13) of pts were retroactively classified by immunophenotype and 28 were reclassified according to the WHO classification.
**Treatment: 24 chemo+RT, 18 pts surgery+RT, 5 chemo alone, 4 surgery alone. RT was modified mantle in 34, involved field in 8. Dose: median 42 Gy in 21 fractions.
**Median f/u 10 yrs (23 yrs for RT alone, 8 yrs for CMT). OS 5 yrs 64%, 10 yrs 49% (Stage I 80%@5y,55%@10y; Stage II 53%/45%); CSS 75%/75%; FFS 76%/76% (Stage I 88%/88%; Stage II 68%/68%). FFS at 5 and 10y was 91% for CMT, 76% for RT alone, and 50% for chemo alone (NS). 
**Conclusion: excellent prognosis for Stage I/II pts treated with CMT. Distant recurrence is common. IPI was a significant prognostic factor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Faculty and students preparing for a dissertation proposal may want to consider the following questions: 
# Between the comprehensive exams and proposal hearing, how have the research interests and questions changed, and how have they remained consistent? How aware are committee members of these shifts in substance?  
# How can each of us express our confidence in the professional choice of this study as the beginning of a research agenda?   
# How confident are participants (including committee members and the doctoral candidate) that the candidate is working with researchable questions? 
# How confident are participants that the candidate is ready to collect the right kind of data  that will help answer the research questions? 
# How can we help the candidate move smoothly toward data collection and analysis?  
# How do committee members see their roles in consulting with the candidate when the proposal is accepted? 
# How would committee members like to push on the candidate at the hearing to make revisions in chapters 1-3 between an accepted proposal and the dissertation defense, revisions that would increase the quality and professional significance of the study?

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is intended to be a manual for Haxorware which is a custom cable modem firmware. This is a legal firmware change. This book is NOT intended to demonstrate or condone any illegal practices. DO NOT add information to this book regarding ANY theft of service!

==Overview==
'''Current Revision:''' 1.1 R39&lt;br /&gt;
'''Compatibility:''' All BCM3349 chipset based modems (Including SB5101/E/i, SB5102/E/i, Webstar DPC2100R2, RCA DCM425, Ambit 250/255/256)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Versions:''' DIAG &amp; LITE. 

DIAG
*Might not perform optimally on a 8MB ram modem (16/32mb upgrade recommended).
*Based on sb5101u/n firmware (which includes diagnostic output, console and SPI support) 
*Much more Verbose to troubleshoot issues.
*Standby button does not work
*Memory leak on SPI modems fixed in Rev39

LITE 
*Based on sb5101e firmware
*Does not support SPI flash based modems.
*Crippled shell &amp; much less diagnostic output in telnet/serial. 
*Static IP option is missing because there is no ipconfig command in the shell anymore (and the entire /ip page is missing too).
*The standby button on a 5101 works in LITE

Once logged into the Haxorware modem At the top of every page you will see the Haxorware title, the version, and the Revision number. You will also see:
:'''Uptime:''' Lists how long the modem has been online 
:'''Memory:''' Current free memory/In use memory (Percent Free memory)
:'''Status:''' Whether the modem is online and operational or other current status 
:'''DS:''' Downstream signal strength in dBmV / Downstream Signal to Noise Ratio indB '''US:''' upstream signal strength in dBmV

      <text xml:space="preserve">Installation varies based on your available method.  Some methods require different hardware modifications such as a Jtag or serial connector (outside the scope of this wiki)
ALWAYS backup current firmware. If you flash a 2mb dump over the existing firmware you will lose the modems original certificates forever.

==JtagUtility Instructions:==

If your modem is currently running infinite firmware it is recommended to restore it to stock, like it was out of the box.
To do this you restore your 2MB backup that i hope you made before flashing infinite.
The commands are as follows:
  detect
  ldram 9fc00000
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find your 2MB backup file and click open)
  program 9fc00000 200000

It is recommended you make a backup before flashing haxorware (or any other hacked firmware) onto your modem.
To create a 2MB backup with JtagUtility, enter the following commands:
  detect
  getram 9fc00000 200000
  save 9fc00000 200000
  (A save as dialog will appear, choose where to save your 2MB backup)

To program haxorware to your modem using JtagUtility, issue the following commands:
  detect
  ldram 9fc10000
  A File Open dialog will appear, find the haxorware firmware file you want (haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin) and click open
  program 9fc10000 130000

After the flashing is complete, reboot your modem and enjoy Haxorware


==Flashing over serial:==

Diagnostic cable instructions (requires noisy bootloader):

  Set your computers ip to 192.168.100.10
  Set up a TFTP server with haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin in its root
  Connect to modem with hyperterminal or putty (with changed CR/LF to LF)
  While modem is turning on press p (you should get a prompt)
  If you do not get a prompt for pressing p, your modem does not have a noisy bootloader, and you will have to use JTAG
  Set the Modem IP to 192.168.100.1
  Leave everything else at their defaults (just press enter)
  When you get at the bootloader menu press d
  Enter 192.168.100.10 as TFTP IP
  Enter haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin as filename
  It should download (the dots indicate progress)
  When asked what image to save to, answer 1
  Answer y to the &quot;Store uncompressed image&quot; prompt
  press b once you are back at the menu to boot the modem


==USBJTAG Instructions:==

If your modem is currently running infinite firmware it is recommended to restore it to stock, like it was out of the box.
To do this you restore your 2MB backup that i hope you made before flashing infinite.
The commands are as follows:
  detect
  ldram 9fc00000
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find your 2MB backup file and click open)
  program 9fc00000 200000

It is recommended you make a backup before flashing haxorware (or any other hacked firmware) onto your modem.
To create a 2MB backup with usbjtag enter the following commands:
  detect
  getram 9fc00000 200000
  save 9fc00000 200000
  (A save as dialog will appear, choose where to save your 2MB backup)

To program haxorware to your modem using USBJTAG, please overwrite your usbjtag.def with the one from this archive.
After that, start USBJTAG and choose the SB5101 profile (Tools-&gt;Config will open the profile selection dialog)
Then issue the following commands:
  detect
  ldram Firmware
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin and click open)
  program Firmware

After the flashing is complete, reboot your modem and enjoy Haxorware

==USBJTAGNT Instructions:==

If your modem is currently running infinite firmware it is recommended to restore it to stock, like it was out of the box.
To do this you restore your 2MB backup that i hope you made before flashing infinite.
The commands are as follows:
  detect
  ldram 9fc00000
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find your 2MB backup file and click open)
 

It is recommended you make a backup before flashing haxorware (or any other hacked firmware) onto your modem.
To create a 2MB backup with usbjtag enter the following commands:
  detect
  getram 9fc00000 200000
  save 9fc00000 200000
  (A save as dialog will appear, choose where to save your 2MB backup)

To program haxorware to your modem using USBJTAGNT
Start USBJTAGNT and choose the SB5101Mod profile (Tools-&gt;Config will open the profile selection dialog)
Then issue the following commands:
  detect
  ldram Firmware
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin and click open)
  program Firmware

After the flashing is complete, reboot your modem and enjoy Haxorware

USBJTAG NT is just Li Shao's way to get more money out of users by planned hardware obsolescence
(otherwise the USBJTAG NT software would support the regular USBJTAG as well).

==Upgrading from previous shelled firmware (infinite) or Haxorware 1.0==

  Set your computers ip to 192.168.100.10
  Set up a TFTP server with haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin in its root
  Make sure the haxorware webgui isn't currently open
  Connect to modem with hyperterminal or telnet to the IP 192.168.100.1
  Enter your username and password
  cd /ip
  ipconfig 1 release
  y
  dload -i 1 -l -f 192.168.100.10 haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin
  y
  cd /
  reset

Haxorware 1.1 should now boot

==Upgrading from Haxorware 1.1==
  Make sure the modem's cpu usage is low, so if it's currently scanning for downstream make it stop by going to the web shell and doing
  cd /docsis
  scan_stop
  The safest time to do the Firmware Upgrade is when the modem is fully operational and online.
  Then use the Firmware Upgrade page on the WebGUI, find haxorware11revXX-XXXX.bin and upload it to the modem in the Firmware section
  Reboot the modem using the WebGUI or otherwise, and the new version of Haxorware should now boot

'''Factory Mode''' This forces the modem to behave as if it was supplied by the ISP and bypasses customs settings.&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Disable Firmware Upgrades''' This option will force Haxorware to ignore new modem firmware pushes from the ISP. Unchecking this could compromise your Haxorware install.&lt;br /&gt;	
'''Force Network Access ''' No information available at the moment. &lt;br /&gt;		
'''Tftp Enforce Bypass''' If your ISP enforces Tftp config file this option will tell the modem to download the supplied config file at the right point - even if you are using another one. &lt;br /&gt;	 	
'''Disable IP Filters on startup''' IP filters are used by some ISP's to block traffic of certain types on certain ports (such as if your ISP blocks port 80 to prevent you from hosting a web server). This option bypasses them entirely.&lt;br /&gt;

==Timeouts==
'''Ignore T1 (No valid UCDs) ''' &lt;br /&gt;	 	
'''Ignore T2 (Ranging Opportunity)''' &lt;br /&gt;	 	
'''Ignore T3 (Ranging Response)''' &lt;br /&gt;	 	
'''Ignore T4 (Station Maintenance)''' &lt;br /&gt;

==Administration==
'''Control Panel IP Address''' Set a different IP than standard here if necessary&lt;br /&gt;	 
'''DHCP Server''' Check this to assign the IP to WAN on router or to PC. Uncheck this ONLY if you have it set manually.&lt;br /&gt;	 
==WebGUI==
'''Password protection''' enable or disable Password protecting the GUI from tampering.
==Telnet Server==
'''Current state''' 	Whether Telnet services are running&lt;br /&gt;	 
'''Run on startup''' Whether Telnet should start when the modem is booted, or only when manually enabled.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
PyGTK is a module for the Python programming language which allows access to the GTK+ Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit.  From their [http://www.gtk.org/ website]:

:''&quot;GTK+ is a highly usable, feature rich toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces which boasts cross platform compatibility and an easy to use API.&quot;''

With the PyGTK binding you can create advanced graphical layouts so that your users are able to interact easily with the application, and the API itself is simple and easy to learn. 

This Wikibook aims to guide existing Python programmers who are new to PyGTK and the GTK+ toolkit in using its functions and classes to build windows and 'widgets' - the term for items inside the window (for example a push button or a text input box) - and linking functions to signals.  At the end of the book we discuss how the creation of GUIs can be made simpler with the Glade XML library and the GTK Designer.

The reader is expected to have knowledge of the Python programming language.  The following books are recommended for beginners:
* [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6]]
* [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]
* [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html The Python Tutorial]
* [http://www.diveintopython.org/ Dive Into Python]

This book is not a complete reference to the GTK API - that can be found on the [http://library.gnome.org/devel/pygtk/stable/ Gnome website] - nor does it discuss building advanced applications.  Beginners to the subject should feel right at home, but if you are already familiar with PyGTK, take a look at the chapters on Glade and Threading, as they may suppliment your knowledge.

== What is a GUI? ==

The way in which users interact with programmes has been revolutionized with windowed desktops in modern operating systems, creating greater accessibility and ease of use by the simple 'point-and-click' approach.   A GUI is a collection of input boxes, check buttons, radio selections, tabs, text and buttons placed inside a window, and sends signals the the programme every time the user does something with it.  The Python programming language includes a module for creating basic GUIs in its standard library: this is called Tkinter, although it's neither very elegant in its appearance or feature-rich, so the GTK+ graphical library is a useful alternative.  Weather you intend to write a script to allow the user to perform simple tasks such a backing up a few files, or you want to create an advanced RSS reader, creating a GUI is often essential - especially if your intended users may not be familiar with the command line.

GTK+ is the dominant GUI library on the Gnome desktop, so if you are looking to develop applications for the Gnome platform with Python, then knowledge of the PyGTK API is almost certainly necessary. 

== Installing PyGTK ==

We assume you already have the Python 2.6 interpreter installed - if not see the tutorials above.

=== Linux ===

'''Ubuntu Users''' - you already have GTK and PyGTk installed!

'''Other linux distros''' - first test if you have PyGTK installed by opening a Python interpreter and typing `import gtk` , if there is an ImportError, then you need to install the module, otherwise it is already installed.

'''Installing PyGTK'''

[[File:Screenshot-pygtk-packagemanager.png|right|thumb|400px|Installing PyGTK from the Synaptic Package Manager.]]

The easiest way to install PyGTK is to use your system's package manager to download and install `python-gtk2` (see screenshot).  This should automatically sort out all GTK dependencies.  Once completed, test that it has been installed properly by typing `import gtk` in a Python interpreter - if there are no errors then you're good to go.

An alternative way to install PyGTK on linux is to build it from source.  Download `pygtk-2.14.1.tar.gz` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygtk/2.14/ ftp.gnome.org], extract the archive and read the `INSTALL` file for instructions on building.  You must also make sure you compile any dependencies, for example GTK, before compiling PyGTK.

=== Windows ===

The best way to install PyGTK on windows is to download the GTK and PyGTK binaries.  First, download `gtk+-bundle_2.18.7-20100213_win32.zip` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.18/ ftp.gnome.org], extract and copy to a suitable folder in your system.  You will then need to add the `bin` subfolder to the system path.

Then download `pygtk-2.16.0+glade.win32-py2.6.exe` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/ ftp.gnome.org], and run the installer wizard.  Once completed, test that it has been installed properly by typing `import gtk` in a Python interpreter - if there are no errors then you're good to go.</text>

      <comment>/* Types of Gears */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Gears are machine elements used for the transmission of rotary motion between two shafts. They can also be used to alter the speed and direction of motion. It is also usual that the transmitted motion be ''uniform'', ''i.e.'' a constant motion of the driving gear produces constant motion of the driven gear It is this property which eventually determines much of the mathematics of the gear's profile.

HELICAL GEARS: it is the gear in which the teeth are inclined to the axis of rotation. the angle of inclination is called helix angle. the tooth surface generated in helical gear is called involute helicoid. this surface is generated when every point on the angular edge of the paper is cut in the shape of parallelogram wrapped around a base cylinder and unwound generate an involute curve.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Quantitative Research and Data Analysis'''==
After a researcher had conducted experiments and/or surveys, the information he/she is left with is known as quantitative data. This type of information is measurable and focuses on numerical values, unlike qualitative data which is more descriptive. Once the quantitative data is collected, the researcher performs an analysis of the findings. 
; Quantitative analysis: The numerical representation and manipulation of observations for the purpose of describing and explaining the phenomena that those observations reflect

==Quantification of Data==
Researchers use the process of '''coding''' to analyze their findings. When conducting a survey some of the data is numerical while other data must be converted from qualitative to quantitative.

==='''Developing Code Categories'''=== 
;Coding: the process in which raw data is transformed into a standardized form suitable for machine processing and analysis 
Coding is the act of assigning numerical values to a set of data in order to make analysis simpler and can be used to quantify both manifest and latent content. The difference between manifest content and latent content is very important when it comes to survey research. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Manifest content''' is the tangible or concrete surface content (data), as distinguished from '''latent content,''' the underlying meaning behind this information.&lt;br/&gt;
Advantages with manifest content are ease of testing and reliability and a disadvantage is its validity. Latent content is the underlying meaning of communications, as distinguished from manifest content. An advantage with latent content is that it is designed perfect for tapping the underlying meaning of communication and its disadvantages are its reliability and specificity.

==='''Codebook Construction'''===
To make the coded data understandable and manageable a '''codebook''' is created. This books explains the coding process and acts as a guide for locating variables in the data set.  Codebooks also describe the meanings for each code used. There are two purposes for these codebooks, first they are a guide in the coding process. Secondly, codebooks act as guides in locating variables within a study.

==='''Data Entry'''===
Examples of quantitative coding:
*a survey that ranks responses on a 1-9 scale and has the respondent choose one of the nine listed. 
*Other variables, such as gender or political affiliation, must be assigned a numerical value in order to conduct quantitative analysis
**i.e.: male= 1; female=2 OR Democrat=1; Republican=2; Independent=3
*Since ages are already represented numerically, the researcher may choose not to develop a coding system for this data.  
{{BookCat}}

Coding is necessary in analyzing data because one must be able to transform raw data into meaningful information.

==Univariate Analysis==
Once data is properly coded it is then ready to be analyzed. One type of analysis is '''univariate data analysis''', in which one variable (such as gender, race, or socioeconomic status) is singled out for analysis  to allow for better description.&lt;br/&gt;
There are many different ways this data can be analyzed including:&lt;br/&gt;
*'''Frequency Distribution''': Counting the number of times data was collected for the sample. &lt;br/&gt;
*'''Average''': A term expressing a general trend of data. &lt;br/&gt;
**'''Mean''': The sum of total data divided by the number of data points. &lt;br/&gt;
**'''Median''': The &quot;middle number&quot; in the data if it is arranged numerically in descending or ascending order. &lt;br/&gt;
**'''Mode''' : The most frequently occurring data point. &lt;br/&gt;
*'''Dispersion or variance''': measures the range of data around a central value, such as the mean 
*'''Standard deviation''': measures the dispersion around the mean as well; however in a way that 68% of the sample will lie within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean.

''Technologically advanced programs, such as Microsoft Excel, have the ability to calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation from a set of data. This is a very convenient and easy way to analyze a set of data.''
====Understanding Distributions and Dispersion====
:A ''normal distribution graph'' is usually used as diagram to display standard deviation and variance.
If a high proportion of values are tightly clustered around the mean, this represents a low standard deviation; whereas if values are widely spread out among the range of possibilities, this corresponds to a high standard deviation. In simple terms, a low dispersion and standard deviation indicate that the values are rather close to each other with a relatively small amount of variation. &lt;br/&gt;
====Continuous and Discrete Variables====
*'''Continuous variable''' a variable whose attributes form a steady progression. 
*'''Discrete variable''' a variable whose attributes are separate from one another. &lt;br/&gt;
Therefore, a continuous variable (such as height) can have an infinite number of possible values, while a discrete variable (such as year) can only have certain values (2010 or 2011 but not 2010.5).  Microsoft Excel can also compute these two values easily.&lt;br/&gt;

Univariate analysis can be described pictorially with a chart or graph. It is best to maintain simplicity when constructing a chart of graph for better comprehension. &lt;br/&gt;

==Bivariate Analysis==

;Bivariate Analysis: the analysis of two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them. &lt;br/&gt;
Bivariate analysis focuses on relationships between variables rather than on comparisons of groups. Bivariate analysis explores the statistical association between the independent variable and dependent variable. Its purpose is usually explanatory rather than merely descriptive.
===Constructing Contingency Tables===
The results of bivariate analyses often are presented in the form of '''contingency tables''', which are constructed to reveal the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable.
;Contingency Table: a format for presenting the relationships among variables as percentage distributions
'''How to construct and read a bivariate table:'''
#Divide cases into groups according to attributes of the independent variable
#Describe subgroups in terms of attributes of the dependent variable
#Read the table by comparing the independent variable subgroups with another in terms of a given attribute of the dependent variable

==Introduction to Multivariate Analysis==


;Multivariate Analysis: the analysis of the simultaneous relationships among several variables. It examines and explains variance in the dependent variable using independent, intervening, and antecedent variables.&lt;br/&gt;
*''Intervening variables'' come between the independent variables and the dependent variable in a time order or as a causal mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;
*''Antecedent variables'' precede the independent variable. &lt;br/&gt;


Multivariate tables can be be created on the basis of a the more sophisticated subgroup descriptions following a similar outline to bivariate tables. This is due to the usage of more than one independent variable and having the dependent variable rely on these independent variables to show the any relationship. &lt;br/&gt;
:An example would be attendance at a bingo competition. Assuming prior that older people usually attend this game, we could divide up the participants according to age. Age differences would be our independent variables when broken into various subgroups and will show a relationship to the dependable variable, attendance at bingo. 
==Dissemination of Information &amp; Other Issues==
To display the data, it is usually beneficial to use tables opposed to bar graphs and such due to the complications of portraying more than one independent variable. These tables are also very useful to rule out opinions and find true facts and data. &lt;br/&gt;
An issue with quantitative data analysis is the possibility of bias. It is common for researchers to favor one finding over another. To help eliminate this, a detailed hypothesis prior to the research is useful. By recording conclusions that may not prove your hypothesis correct, it is beneficial to other researches (who are working on similar topics) to know your results so it can aid them in their studies.
Data can be collected and displayed without any bias when researching controversial topics if the research is conducted correctly and portrayed appropriately in the table.&lt;br/&gt;

==Research Tips==
Some useful research tips to keep in mind when carrying out quantitative analysis:
*It is a good idea to use percentages to make comparisons, and to create these percentages for each category of your dependent variable
*Variables should be recoded in order to make the comparisons you want to make, and this recoding can be done in different ways. 
*Choose an independent variable that has enough explanatory power to make sense.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Loglan, the logical language ==

=== Introduction ===

{{Print version}}

The name '''Loglan''', in this context, refers to the logical language that James Cooke Brown first started to develop in the 1950s. Loglan forms an example of a ''logical language'' because the developers based the language on predicate logic which forms a way of defining logical relationships. However, for practical purposes, you could view the language as an example of a ''fill the blanks'' language as each of the main type of words used in Loglan effectively form an incomplete sentence where you fill in the blanks to complete the meaning. For example, the Loglan word meaning ''to see'', ''vizka'', has three blanks and forms the sentence ''x sees y against background z'' as in ''mi vizka tu'' meaning ''I see you'' (you don't have to use all the blanks in loglan).

Loglan could form a future auxiliary language as it has a number of advantages over natural languages and languages such as Esperanto. 

* Loglan has a set of consistent rules - no exceptions
* Consistent spelling (the base words come in either CVCCV or CCVCV form (where C stands for &quot;consonant&quot; and V for &quot;vowel&quot;)). 
* Simpler rule set. Loglan has about 200 rules, far less than a natural language.
* A defined way to grow so any additions follow a set of rules as the language grows and develops. So, once you know Loglan, your knowledge doesn't get out dated as the language changes.
* Simpler grammar. No nouns, adverbs, imperfect forms, etc to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Retrieving Data Using the SQL SELECT Statement==
===List the capabilities of SQL SELECT statements===
Selection, projection, join

===Execute a basic SELECT statement===
* Select All Columns:
  &lt;br /&gt;
  Select * from table_name;
* Select Specific Columns: 
  Select column1, column2 from tables_name;
* Use Column Heading Defaults 
* Use Arithmetic Operators:  
  Select 12 salary+100 from emp --sell value is 2.
  Result: 12 * cell's value + 100   --i.e. 12 * 2 + 100= 124
* Understand Operator Precedence
* Learn the DESCRIBE command to display the table structure
  Type- DESCRIBE table_name;  
  *NOTE: Your Oracle user and/or schema must have permissions/privaliages or be within the schema to describe the table.
   You can use the data_dictionary views to get the table info.

==Restricting and Sorting Data==
===Limit the rows that are retrieved by a query===
# Write queries that contain a WHERE clause to limit the output retrieved
# List the comparison operators and logical operators that are used in a WHERE clause
# Describe the rules of precedence for comparison and logical operators
# Use character string literals in the WHERE clause

===Sort the rows that are retrieved by a query===
# Write queries that contain an ORDER BY clause sort the output of a SELECT statement
# Sort output in descending and ascending order

===Use ampersand substitution to restrict and sort output at runtime===
the ampersand operator is used to take the input at runtime( ex:-&amp;employeename) and if ampersand is used twice i.e &amp;&amp;
then it will take the input of single ampersand operator and is used to provide data to the query at runtime.

==Using Single-Row Functions to Customize Output==
===Describe various types of functions available in SQL===
    * Describe the differences between single row and multiple row functions

===Use character, number, and date functions in SELECT statements===
    * Manipulate strings with character function in the SELECT and WHERE clauses
    * Manipulate numbers with the ROUND, TRUNC and MOD functions
    * Perform arithmetic with date data
    * Manipulate dates with the date functions

==Using Conversion Functions and Conditional Expressions==
===Describe various types of conversion functions that are available in SQL===
Implicit data type conversion

Implicit conversion occurs when Oracle attempts to convert the values, that do not match the defined parameters of functions, into the required data types.

Explicit data type conversion
Explicit conversion occurs when a function like TO_CHAR is invoked to
change the data type of a value.

===Use the TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER, and TO_DATE conversion functions===
    * Nest multiple functions
    * Apply the NVL, NULLIF, and COALESCE functions to data

===Apply conditional expressions in a SELECT statement===
    * Use conditional IF THEN ELSE logic in a SELECT statement

==Reporting Aggregated Data Using the Group Functions==
===Identify the available Group Functions===

===Describe the use of group functions===
===Group data by using the GROUP BY clause===
===Include or exclude grouped rows by using the HAVING clause===

==Displaying Data from Multiple Tables==
===Write SELECT statements to access data from more than one table using equijoins and nonequijoins===
===Join a table to itself by using a self-join===
===View data that generally does not meet a join condition by using outer joins===
# Join a table by using a self join
===Generate a Cartesian product of all rows from two or more tables===

==Using Subqueries to Solve Queries==
===Define subqueries===
===Describe the types of problems that the subqueries can solve===
===List the types of subqueries===
===Write single-row and multiple-row subqueries===

==Using the Set Operators==
===Describe set operators===
===Use a set operator to combine multiple queries into a single query===
===Control the order of rows returned===

==Manipulating Data==
===Describe each data manipulation language (DML) statement===
===Insert rows into a table===

Inserting data in database is done through &quot;insert&quot; command in oracle.

Syntax:-insert into employee values(1,'Rahul','Manager');

By the above query the employee table gets populated by empid:-1 , empname:-'Rahul' and empdesignation:-'Manager'.

===Update rows in a table===
===Delete rows from a table===
===Control transactions===
# Save and discard changes with the COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements
# Explain read consistency

==Using DDL Statements to Create and Manage Tables==
===Categorize the main database objects===
===Review the table structure===
===List the data types that are available for columns===
===Create a simple table===
&quot;Create table&quot; comand is used to create table in database.

Syntax:- create table employee(empid number,empname varchar2(20),empdesignation(varchar2(20)));

The above Query will create a table named employee with which contain columns empid , empname , empdesignation followed by 
their datatypes/

===Explain how constraints are created at the time of table creation===
Concept
In essence, constraints safeguard and validate the data.

Primary Key and Unique constraints both ensure the data is not duplicated. Primary Key also ensure the data is not null. Oracle will automatically generate index for Primary Key and Unique constraints. A table can only have one Primary Key, but it can have multiple unique constraints.

Foreign Key ensure the data exists in the column of the parent table it refer to. Each parent record can have multiple child records, but each child can relate to ONLY one parent record. A column with Foreign Key may not necessary to have an index.


Foreign Key can only refer to column with Primary Key or Unique Constraint

    create table tblA (colX number, colY char);
    create table tblB (colX number);

    alter table tblB add (constraint colX_FK foreign key (colX) references tblA(colX));
    -- ORA-02270: no matching unique or primary key for this column-list

    alter table tblA add (constraint colX_PK primary key (colX));
    alter table tblB add (constraint colX_FK foreign key (colX) references tblA(colX));
    -- alter table success.


A table can ONLY have one Primary Key, but it can have multiple UNIQUE key.
if the child table(s) require to referencing column other than primary key, the column on the parent table must have UNIQUE constraint.

    alter table tblA add (constraint colY_PK primary key (colY));
    -- ORA-02260: table can have only one primary key

Cannot create PK or Unique on a column contains duplicate data

    insert into tblA values(1,'A');
    insert into tblA values(2,'A');
    alter table tblA add (constraint colY_UK unique (colY));
    -- ORA-02299: cannot validate (HR.COLY_UK) - duplicate keys found


    delete from tblA where colx = 2;
    alter table tblA add (constraint colY_UK unique (colY));
    -- alter table success.

    create table tblC (colY char);
    alter table tblC add (constraint colY_FK foreign key (colY) references tblA(colY));
    -- alter table success.


Insert data into a column with FK, the value must already exist in the column that the FK reference to.

    insert into tblC values ('B');
    -- ORA-02291: integrity constraint (HR.COLY_FK) violated - parent key not found

    insert into tblC values ('A');
    -- 1 rows inserted


As long as a foreign key exist, the parent table can truncate/delete the data or disable the PK or Unique constraint

    truncate table tblA;
    -- ORA-02266: unique/primary keys in table referenced by enabled foreign keys


Find out the constraint information in Oracle

    desc all_constraints;

    select
      a.owner, a.table_name, a.constraint_name,
      a.constraint_type, a.status, a.r_owner, a.r_constraint_name,
      b.table_name as r_table_name, b.status as r_status
    from all_constraints a
      left join all_constraints b on a.owner = b.owner and a.r_constraint_name = b.constraint_name
    where a.table_name like 'TBL%';

    select *
    from all_cons_columns
    where table_name like 'TBL%';

Disable constraint that have foreign key refer to is not allowed, in order to do this, you have to disable the foreign key first.

    alter table tblA disable constraint colX_PK;
    -- ORA-02297: cannot disable constraint (HR.COLX_PK) - dependencies exist
    alter table tblA disable constraint colY_UK;
    -- ORA-02297: cannot disable constraint (HR.COLY_UK) - dependencies exist

    alter table tblC disable constraint colY_FK;
    alter table tblB disable constraint colX_FK;

    alter table tblA disable constraint colX_PK;
    alter table tblA disable constraint colY_UK;
    truncate table tblA;

If the data in parent table is deleted, re-enable the foreign key that contain data reference to the missing data is not allowed.

    select * from tblC;
    alter table tblA enable constraint colY_UK;
    alter table tblC enable constraint colY_FK;
    -- ORA-02298: cannot validate (HR.COLY_FK) - parent keys not found

Generate a sql statements to disable all the Foreign Key on a specified table
    select
      'alter table '||a.owner||'.'||a.table_name||
      ' disable constraint '||a.constraint_name||';' as STMT
    from all_constraints a, all_constraints b
    where a.constraint_type = 'R'
      and a.r_constraint_name = b.constraint_name
      and a.r_owner = b.owner
      and b.table_name = 'TBLA';

===Create private and public synonyms===

==Controlling User Access==

      <text xml:space="preserve">You use predicates to form the main subject of a sentence. If fact, you can view a predicate words as an incomplete sentence. Just fill in the blanks to say what you want to say. Each predicate word has from one to five blanks to fill in. 

Predicates come in three main forms.

* Base words
* Compound words
* Loan words


== Base Words ==

These form the main set of words used in Loglan. They have a constant spelling; either CVCCV form or CCVCV form. They all end in a vowel and they all have only one meaning each.

=== Examples ===

NB. The letters x, y and z represent the blanks.

CVCCV form

* vizka - x sees y against background z
* hasfa - x is the house of y
* tarci - x is a star of galaxy y
* fundi - x likes y more than z
* takna - x talks to y about z


CCVCV form

* cnida - x needs y for z
* clika - x is similar to x in feature z
* tcaro - x is a motorised vehicle
* jmite - x meets y
* zvoto - x is outside of y

== Compound Words ==

The base words in Loglan number about 1 500. To say more you can use two or more base words to make a metaphor. If you think others can use the metaphor you can combine the words to make a new word. Each base word has a combining form which you can use to construct more complex words.

=== Examples===

* fagctu - ash. Constructed from ''fagro'' (fire) and ''ctuda'' (excrement); fagro ctuda. The word ''fagro'' has the combining form ''fag'' and ''ctuda'' the combining form of ''ctu'' so the metaphor ''fagro ctuda'' becomes the word ''fagctu''.
* bamfoa - sphere. Constructed from ''balma'' (ball) and ''forma'' (form / shape); balma forma. The word ''balma'' has the combining form ''bam'' and ''forma'' the combining form of ''foa'' so the metaphor ''balma forma'' becomes the word ''bamfoa''.
* trigru - forest / wood. Constructed from ''tricu'' (tree) and ''grupa'' (group); tricu grupa. The word ''tricu'' has the combining form ''tri'' and ''grupa'' the combining form of ''gru'' so the metaphor ''tricu grupa'' becomes the word ''trigru''.

== Loan Words ==

When using Loglan you try to use Loglan word to construct a metaphor for a new idea of concept. However, you might not have the opportunity to do that at all time such as when an idea or concept has a close relationship to one group of people. In such cases, Loglan allows borrowing but with certain rules.

=== Examples ===

* proteini - x is a protein of type y
* cerkopithekui - x is a cercopithecus (a primate) of that genus

      <text xml:space="preserve">These form a set of words that you use to fill in the blanks of the predicates. They form the objects or agents that you talk about. Arguments come in three forms:

* Names
* [[../Predicates/]] as arguments
* [[../Little words/]] as arguments

We use a little word to tell the difference between a name and a normal predicate word used as an argument; either ''le'' or ''la''. The little word ''le'' means ''the one I call'' and the the little word ''la'' means ''the one that actually is''. The word 'le' then forms a prefix for a description and the little word ''la'' forms a prefix for a name. 

== Names ==

Names in Loglan come in two types:

* Proper Names
* Predicate Names

All proper names end in a consonant and can have any number of letters. We can use predicates as names if we use the little word ''la'' first. As predicates together form a metaphor we use the little word ''gu'' to show where the name ends and the main predicate of the sentence starts. 

=== Examples ===

Proper names:

* Frans - France
* Sol - Sun
* Romas - Rome

Predicate Names

* la farfu - father / dad
* la ratcu - Rat

== Predicates as arguments ==

You can use predicates words as arguments to the main predicate of a sentence to form the object or agent of a predicate. To do so, you need to add the little word ''le'' to show that the you mean ''the one I call'' and then use the little word ''gu'' to show when the argument predicate comes to an end and the main sentence predicate begins. 

=== Examples ===

* ''le nirli'' gu tcatro - the girl is driving (a vehicle)
* ''le farfu'' gu kamla - the father comes
* ''le hasfa'' gu redro - the house is red
* ''le prano mrenu'' gu goztsefui - the running man is late

== Little words as arguments ==

Loglan has a number of little words that you can use for common occurring actors or objects.

=== Examples ===

* tu - you
* ti - this
* toi - that ( the last mentioned remark)
* da - he / she / it

      <text xml:space="preserve">Little words form a type of control word for sentences. You can use them to ''form brackets'', add time and place or add additional information to a sentence. You can also use some little words for common words you might use such as ''me'', ''it'' or numbers. 

== Examples ==

* mi - me / I / myself
* gu - a separator between predicates / a right boundary marker
* to - the number two
* rau - ... because of reason ...
* e - and

      <text xml:space="preserve">You build a proper sentence in Loglan around a predicate word. You then fill what blanks you need and then add any additional information using little words.

==Simple sentences==

(vizka = x sees y against background z)

* mi ''vizka'' tu - I see you (main predicate = vizka)
* tu ''vizka'' mi - You see me (main predicate = vizka)
* mi ''ridle'' ba le bukcu - I read something from a book (main predicate = ridle with arguments = ba and le bukcu)


==More complex sentences ==

* mi nu ''vizka'' tu - I am seen by you (you see me) (main predicate = vizka and using the place converter nu to swap arguments)
* mi ''vizka'' tu, ui - I see you (which I am happy about) (main predicate = vizka and using the emotional indicator ui)

(soisni = x is sleepier than y)
(cioru  = many / too much) 
(muspli = x exercises muscles y)

* la maris ''soisni'' rau lepo da cioru muspli - Mary feels sleepy because she has exercised too much (main predicate = soisni with rau  to give a physical cause)

(tcatro = x drives vehicle y from z to a via b)
(livhao = x is the home of y)
(turka = x work on y for purpose z)
(sitfa = x is the place of b in reference frame z)

* le mrenu gu ''tcatro'' le tcaro le livhao le turka sitfa pa - the man drove the car from home to the work place (main predicate = tcatro and using the little word pa to put the event in the past)
* le mrenu gu ''tcatro'' le tcaro le livhao le turka sitfa fa - the man will drive the car from home to the work place (main predicate = tcatro and using the little word fa to put the event in the future)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Much of the expressive power of Loglan lies in the little words. A basic sentence in Loglan just defines a relationship between actors and objects but says nothing about the whys, whens or wheres. For example, ''mi vizka tu'' defines a relationship between me and you of the type seeing; &quot;I see you&quot; but says nothing about where or when or why. We can use the little words to add those additional informations.

Little words come in different types:

[[/Logical Operators and Connections/]] - joining things together

[[/Time and Space/]] -the wheres and whens

[[/Modifiers/]] - the whys

[[/Numbers and Letters/]]

[[/He, she and it/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Loglan has five basic logical operators for joining things together and one way to separate sentences. Loglan also has an operator for ''please indicate which'' :
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Logical Operators and Connections/OR operator| a]] - the ''or'' operator
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Logical Operators and Connections/AND operator |e]] - the ''and'' operator
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Logical Operators and Connections/IF and only IF |o]] - the ''if and only if'' operator
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Logical Operators and Connections/Whether or not operator |u]] - the ''whether or not'' operator
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Logical Operators and Connections/no |no]] - the inverse operator
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/Start of a Sentence |i]] - the start of a sentence
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/mixing |ze]] - mixing things together
* [[Loglan/The Power of Little Words/how connected |ha]] - How connected 
Loglan then extends these basic operator for connecting words or sentences in different ways

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The ''OR'' Operator ==

=== a ===

In Loglan, we define the ''Or'' operator as true if one item it links together has a value of true. The little word ''a'' connects predicates together.

==== Examples ====

* mi tcatro ''a'' maifle - I am a driver or a pilot (or both) 
* le tetri gu solflo ''a'' kleda - the weather is sunny or cold (or both)
* le bakso gu redro ''a'' dirlu ''a'' groda - the box is red or lost or large (or any combination)

=== ca, ka, anoi and ica ===

The little word ''a'' forms the foundations for a set of &quot;OR&quot; words. 

* ca - forms an ''OR'' operation with predicates as arguments
* ka - forms an ''OR'' operation as ''a'' but as a forethought connection. It works with the little word ''ki''
* anoi - represents an ''if'' relationship and results from ''NOT OR'' 
* ica - connects two sentences together with an ''OR'' operation

==== Examples ====

ca

* le mrenu ''ca'' fumna gu godzi - the man or woman goes
* le katmu gu fundi le cutri ''ca'' ficlu - the cat likes water or fish

ka

* le ''ka'' mrenu ki fumna gu godzi - the man or woman goes
* le katmu gu fundi le ''ka'' cutri ki ficlu - the cat likes water or fish

anoi

* mi fundi le bukcu ''anoi'' le sinma - I like the book if I like the film

ica

* mi fundi le bukcu ''ica'' le sinma - I like the book or I like the film

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is where you enter basic information for your modems behavior when the ISP SNMP scans your modem or you request a DHCP lease. The modem can tell the ISP it is anything you want and these are the fields you would enter this in. Many times ISP's check for specific information when querying a modem to determine whether it gets allowed online, a firmware update, etc. Many ISP's will not allow your modem online if it believes you are running an outdated firmware so be sure to enter the most current information on this page.

==Modem Identifiers==
'''Vendor''' Enter the manufacturer you want to emulate or tell the ISP you are running (such as &quot;Motorola&quot;, etc.)&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Model''' This is where you enter the Model number information you want to supply&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Software Version''' This is where you enter the firmware version you want to supply&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Override Hardware Version''' Check this to supply a different hardware version to the vendor other than what it is. &lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Hardware Version''' Enter the hardware version you want to supply here&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Override Bootloader Revision''' Check this to override the default bootloader revision sent to your ISP &lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Bootloader Revision''' Enter revision information here &lt;br /&gt; 	
==SNMP Agent==
'''Server Port''' Port number for snmp scans&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Disable SNMP Agent after registration''' Check this to disable snmp probe requests from your isp after initial registration when the modem goes online (recommended) &lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Redirect SNMP Traps''' When SNMP requests are sent redirect them to another device and port (such as another modem on the network)&lt;br /&gt; 	
'''IP''' IP address to redirect to &lt;br /&gt; 	
'''Port''' Destination port at redirected IP &lt;br /&gt;

==Bootloader upgrade==
'''Bootloader Image''' Update the bootloader only (such as if you need to load the noisy bootloader to diagnose issues)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Science fictions generally to have flowered as a literary genre in the twentieth century. Authors composed works in the genre before 1900, of course, but these works are generally not considered pure science fiction. They usually contain an admixture from other genres. Mary Shelly's ''Frankenstein'', for instance, is also considered literary fiction and contains elements of gothic horror. A useful label for all pre-twentieth century science fiction is the Gutenberg library's designation &quot;Precursors of Science Fiction&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The AND Operator ==

The AND operator links together a group of items so that for the whole group to have the value true all the items have to have the value true.  If one or more items have the value false then the whole group has the value false. 

=== e ===

The little word ''e'' links together predicates.

==== Examples ====

* la djan gu herkeu e larmao - John is a hairdresser and an artist
* da tcaro e plebekti - that is a car and a toy

=== ce, ke and enoi ===

The other AND operators in Loglan follow on from ''e''.

The little word ''ce'' joins together arguments and so does ''ke'' but we use ''ke'' in a forethought way and it works together with ''ki''. We can use the little word ''enoi'' to mean ''... but not ...''.

==== Examples ====

ce

* da lemi hasfa ''ce'' livhao - this is my house and home
* le tetri gu cetlo ''ce'' briflo - the weather is wet and windy 
* tu ponsu le grobou ''ce'' botsu - you own the ship and the boat

ke

* da lemi ''ke'' hasfa ki livhao - this is my house and home
* mi clika lemi ''ke'' matma ki farfu - I am like my mother and father

enoi

* mi madzo le hasfa enoi le livhao - I make a house but not a home

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck! 

PS: I noticed you have continued the [[Science Fiction Literature]] project, great work by the way I'm a huge fan of SiFi (keeping [[User:Panic2k4/Books Read|my reading list here]]). Anyway what I wanted to say is that you should probably indicate in your previous account (if you are the same user) the new login and talk to an admin as to fix the issue (it affects your edit log on the project for instance). Nevertheless Welcome back :)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:14, 25 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The IF and only IF operator ==

=== o ===

The little word ''o'' means ''if and only if''. We can use it to link predicates together. 

==== Examples ====

* mi godzi o dzoru - I go if and only if I walk
* mi clivi o  brute - I am alive if and only if I breath

=== co, ko, onoi and ico ===

We can extend the basic little word ''o'' for connecting arguments ans sentences. 

* ''co'' - links arguments together
* ''ko'' - the forethought equivalent and works with ''ki''
* ''onoi'' - the exclusive OR (XOR) operator that means ''a XOR b but not both''
* ''ico'' - links sentences

==== Examples ====

co

* mi hapci ''co'' crano pernu - I am a happy (if and only if smiling) person
* da nakso le bakso ''co'' kuvbao - Someone fix the box if and only chest

ko

* mi ''ko'' hapci ki crano gu pernu - I am a happy (if and only if smiling) person

onoi

* le crina onoi le solflo gu tetri - the weather is either raining or sunny but not both
* mi kamla le fusto ''onoi'' le livhao - I come to the office or the home but not both

ico

* mi klama le fusto ''ico'' klama le livhao - I come to the office or I come to the home but not both

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book has the purpose of presenting a number of alternative socioeconomics systems to our current money based system. The alternative economic systems present have a root in science applied to society and propose a moneyless system. We could find a number of reasons why we might wish to look at alternative system but this book aim begins with presenting physical reason for considering alternatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our current socioeconomic system looks as if it has all the attributes of a well running machine.  Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe we can argue that the capitalist system has triumphed over its alternatives and has gone from strength to strength. Of cause, we still have problems such as poverty, exploitation and environmental damage but, we could argue that they arise because of imperfections in the free market model such as government interference. If only the market was truly free then we will solve these problems. 

This book disagrees and present an argument that says our current system has some deep rooted faults. That the poverty and environmental destruction result from the current system and things will only get worse as we head toward the self destruction of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Nature of Exponential Growth==

The feature of exponential growth forms an essential part of our socioeconomic system. We quote the current growth rate of the economy in percentages such as ''We expect the economy to experience growth of 3% this year''. If the economy doesn't grow then we have a recession which has the potential to create economic hardship for many people.  Governments carry out economic policies to maintained economic growth.  

Exponential growth has a number of interesting features. 

=== Doubling Time ===

Firstly, it has constant doubling period; it doubles in the same time period and then double again in the next time period. We often use percentages to specify a growth rate. We can find the approximate doubling period if we divide the growth rate into 70.  For example a growth rate of 3% means a doubling time of about 23 time periods (70 / 3 = 23.333). A growth rate of 1% gives a doubling of 70 time periods and a growth rate of 7% gives a doubling of 10 time periods. So, an economy that grows at about 2-3% doubles every 23 - 35 years. Doubling means twice as much resources and twice as much strain on the environment at each doubling. 

=== Explosive Growth ===

When compared to other forms of growth such a liner growth or growth to the power of three, exponential growth appears slow to start with. However, after some time it starts to take off and then it reaches a period of very rapid growth when compared to other forms of growth. 

Humans often predict the future based on the past. We look to our past experiences to assess future possibilities. However, with exponential growth our past experiences can let us down. Things that growth exponential appear to grow well for some time and then suddenly fail as if a bolt from the blue suddenly hit the system.

=== Impossibility to Maintain ===

Take a piece of paper and fold it half, fold it again and again. How many times can you fold it? Most people manage 7 or 8 folds. What happened? Why can't you fold any more.

The Emperor of China, so the story goes, was so pleased with the inventor of the game of chess that he promised the inventor anything he wanted. The inventor asked for a grain of rice on the first square, double the amount on the second square, double again on the third and so on till the end. How much rice would you have at the end?

Both of the above form examples of exponential growth. They also illustrate another characteristic of real, physical, exponential growth; it comes to an end. All natural, real, physical systems cannot grow exponentially indefinitely. You run into problems folding the paper as the thickness doubles each time as the area halves. Keep doubling the amount of rice from one square to the next and you will eventually have more rice then exists. 

Our economic system exemplifies another form of a physical system; a resource allocation system. An economic system effectively allocates raw materials to production which produces goods that we demand.  Each stage forms an example of a physical system. The raw material, the rocks in the ground or the crops in the field all form examples of physical resources. So do the factories and transport systems we use and they all require energy to run. 

Yet, we try to grow this physical resource based system exponentially; a system that has nothing about it that separates it from other physical systems and therefore, we cannot maintain exponential economic growth. Sooner of later, the system will fail.

== Bacteria in a Bottle - A thought Experiment ==

Imagine, if you will, a bottle. In that bottle we will grow some bacteria exponentially. Lets have a doubling time every minute and let's start our thought experiment at 11:00. Let's say it takes an hour to fill the bottle so the bacteria will fill the bottle up at 12:00. 

We should now ask ourselves at what time will the bottle become half full?

== Switching to New Resources ==

For 59 minutes our growing of bacteria will work nicely. At 59 minutes we would have used half of the bottle. One minute later and the bacteria fills the whole bottle. 

However, human beings differ from bacteria; we have the attribute of intelligence. If we have problems with one resource we can apply our intelligence to acquire a new resource. In our economic system, if we start to run out of resources the price of that resource will increase. The increase in costs will motive people to seek an alternative; as in the past (so in the future). Alternatively, we could come up with more efficient ways to use the resource we have so it lasts longer. Either, we can model both increased efficiency and the acquisition of new resources as the same; an increase in resources.

Let's imagine we have some intelligent bacterial who realise when the bottle reach quarter full (quarter full means two minutes to dooms day) they will soon run into trouble. So, our clever bacteria initiate a programme to acquire more resources and they add three more bottles.  Now, it takes the bacterial from 11:00 to 12:00 to fill one bottle, how long before they fill all four?

It will take them another minute to fill a second bottle and a minute to fill the next two bottle. All they did was delay dooms day and added a couple more minutes.

If we should maintain exponential growth we would also need to acquire new resources at an exponential increasing rate.  

== Summary ==

Our socioeconomic system is an example of a type of physical resource allocation system that operates with the real world. No physical systems can sustain exponential growth. Therefore, we cannot sustain the rate of our socioeconomic. 

We could, however, cut back and then grow again like a rose bush. To do that we would need to kill of large number of people and destroy infrastructure and buildings. Wars, disease, famine and natural disasters would help to achieve that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter aims to familiarize the reader with the basic classes and functions of the PyGTK module, and how to link them together.  To start off, open an interactive Python shell (i.e. IDLE or type `python` on the command line), and enter the following:

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

window = gtk.Window()
label = gtk.Label(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

window.add(label)

window.show_all()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

{{technote|A bug in some versions of PyGTK cause IDLE to crash when using the `gtk` module.  You may have to use Python on a sytem shell/terminal instead.}}

This snippet of code creates a window with the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; inside (see screenshot).
[[File:Screenshot-pygtkbasic.png|center]]

* Line 1: This imports the gtk library so we can access the classes and functions required to build the GUI.
* Line 3: A new Window object is created and assigned to the variable '''window'''.  Note that by default this does not show the window on the screen - this is conventionally done when the all widgets have been added to the window.
* Line 4: A new '''gtk.Label''' widget is created.  The first argument is the string to display in the label.
* Line 6: The add() method of the Window is one way of attaching the widget to it.
* Line 8: The show_all() method of the Window calls the show() method on all its child widgets (the widgets that have been placed in the window) and then on the window itself.

== GTK Objects and Containers ==

[[File:Pygtk objects.svg|right]]
In the example code above, the '''gtk.Window()''' object self-evidently represents the GUI window, and the widget '''gtk.Label''' is added to the object with the '''add()''' method.  The add method, however, only allows a single object to be added to the window, so to put multiple widgets in the window some sort of container object, such as '''gtk.VBox''', needs to be added instead .  The '''gtk.VBox''' object can contain and organize multiple widgets into a vertical column.  To create more sophisticated layouts you can nest container objects, i.e. have a '''gtk.HBox''' inside a '''gtk.VBox'''.

The use of these objects is demonstrated in the illustration on the right.  The '''gtk.WindowGroup''' object is optional, but allows your application to display more than one gtk.Window.  The chapter 'Multiple Windows' explains how to use this, but for now we will stick to a single window.

Here is an example of a simple PyGTK programme which utilizes the '''gtk.VBox''' and '''gtk.HBox''' objects to put multiple widgets on the screen - try typing this into an interactive Python interpreter:

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

window = gtk.Window()
entry = gtk.Entry()
button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
button_cancel = gtk.Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;)

vbox = gtk.VBox()
vbox.pack_start(entry)
hbox = gtk.HBox()
hbox.pack_start(button_ok)
hbox.pack_start(button_cancel)
vbox.pack_start(hbox)

window.add(vbox)
window.show_all()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The result of the code above should be a window with an input box and two buttons:

[[File:Pygtk usingcontainers.png|center]]

* Line 3: A new '''gtk.Window''' object is created.
* Line 4: A new '''gtk.Entry''' object is created (the input box).
* Line 5 &amp; 6: Two new '''gtk.Button''' objects are created, with the text as the first argument.
* Line 8: A new '''gtk.VBox''' object is created.  This will later be added to the window, and will contain all the widgets in the window.
* Line 9: The '''.pack_start()''' method on a container adds the widget passed as its first parameter to the beginning of the container (at the top).  Unlike the window's '''.add()''' method, this allows multiple widgets when called more than once.  The '''.pack_end()''' method does the same thing, but start putting objects at the end of the container (at the bottom), so subsequent calls place the widget on top of the previous one.
* Line 10: Another container object is created.
* Line 11 &amp; 12: The button widgets are added to this new hbox container with the '''.pack_start()''' method.
* Line 13: The hbox container is nested inside the vbox container by calling the '''.pack_start()''' method on the vbox container.
* Line 15: The vbox container is added to the window with the window's '''.add()''' method.
* Line 16: All the objects are shown, so you can now see the window on the screen.

== Signals and Callbacks ==

In order to get your application to react to the GUI, you can tap into '''events'''' which occur on widgets and tell PyGTK to run a function (known as a '''callback function''') when that event happens.  For example, when the user clicks on a button, the &quot;clicked&quot; event for that specific widget is emitted, and if you have connected it to a callback function that function is run.

To connect an event with a function, call the '''.connect()''' method on the widget that will emit the event.  The syntax of this method is:

 handler_id = widget.connect(event_name, callback_function[, function_data])

The return value to '''.connect()''' can be captured so the connection can be revoked.
* The ''event_name'' argument should be a string representing the name of the event to connect with.  This varies between widgets; i.e. the gtk.Button widget emits a &quot;clicked&quot; event when, erm, clicked on.
* The ''callback_function'' should be a reference to the callback function you want PyGTK to run when ''event_name'' is emitted.  Do not put the brackets () at the end of the name, and it doesn't need to be enclosed as a string.
* The optional ''function_data'' parameter may contain additional arguments to pass to the callback function.

The callback function should be in the form:

 def callback_function(widget, callback_data=None)

The name of the function and its arguments can be called anything.
* The first argument, ''widget'', is a reference to the widget object that emitted the signal.
* The second argument, ''callback_data'', contains the ''callback_data'' specified as the last argument to the widget's connect() method, if supplied.

Finally, to make sure your events are dealt with, add the following code to the end of the application:

 gtk.main()

The '''gtk.main()''' function listens for events and runs any callback functions that have been connected to them.  This function stays running until the window is closed by the operating system's window manager, or '''gtk.main_quit()''' is run.

Below is a modified version of the sample code above, with a some callback functions defined and connected to button events.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

# Define the callback functions first:
def exit(widget, callback_data=None):
  window.hide_all()
  gtk.main_quit()

window = gtk.Window()
entry = gtk.Entry()
button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
button_cancel = gtk.Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;)

# Connect events to callback functions:
button_cancel.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, exit)

vbox = gtk.VBox()
vbox.pack_start(entry)
hbox = gtk.HBox()
hbox.pack_start(button_ok)
hbox.pack_start(button_cancel)
vbox.pack_start(hbox)

window.add(vbox)
window.show_all()
# Put gtk.main() last so our callback functions are used.
gtk.main()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

* Lines 4-6: This a callback function which closes the window with the '''.hide()''' method and stops the '''gtk.main()''' loop.  Although the ''callback_data argument'' is not used, it is often helpful to include it in all the callback functions in case it is needed at some point.
* Line 14: The '''.connect()''' method captures the &quot;clicked&quot; event from the '''button_cancel''' widget and sends it to our '''exit()''' callback function we defined earlier.
* Line 26: The '''gtk.main()''' function starts the '''main loop''' which sends events/signals to the right callback functions.

== Putting It All Together ==

The following code uses all of the methods discussed above to create a very simple GTK application that asks for your name and prints it to the console.  Copy and save the following text in a file and run '''python example.py''' on the command line (replacing example.py with the name of the file you just created).

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import pygtk
pygtk.require('2.0')

import gtk


class Application():
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = gtk.Window()
        self.window.set_title(&quot;Example GTK Application&quot;)
        
        self.create_widgets()
        self.connect_signals()
        
        self.window.show_all()
        gtk.main()
    
    
    def create_widgets(self):
        self.vbox = gtk.VBox(spacing=10)
        
        self.hbox_1 = gtk.HBox(spacing=10)
        self.label = gtk.Label(&quot;Your Name:&quot;)
        self.hbox_1.pack_start(self.label)
        self.entry = gtk.Entry()
        self.hbox_1.pack_start(self.entry)
        
        self.hbox_2 = gtk.HBox(spacing=10)
        self.button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
        self.hbox_2.pack_start(self.button_ok)
        self.button_exit = gtk.Button(&quot;Exit&quot;)
        self.hbox_2.pack_start(self.button_exit)
        
        self.vbox.pack_start(self.hbox_1)
        self.vbox.pack_start(self.hbox_2)
        
        self.window.add(self.vbox)
    
    
    def connect_signals(self):
        self.button_ok.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.callback_ok)
        self.button_exit.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.callback_exit)
    
    
    def callback_ok(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        name = self.entry.get_text()
        print name
    
    
    def callback_exit(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()
    

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    app = Application()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This application is structured inside a single class, '''Application'''.  This approach allows the names of the GTK widgets and other objects to reside in their own namespace, and also makes it possible to import the file in other scripts and let the programmer decide when to create and display the GUI.

* Lines 4 &amp; 5:  These two lines are required above the '''import gtk''' statement.  They deal with all the initialization and version checking that the GTK+ toolkit needs to do before creating your GUI.  Although we have omitted this in our earlier examples, you should still use it in your own programmes to avoid potential redrawing problems.
* Line 12:  The '''__init__()''' method, which is called upon class construction, does the following to setup the application:
** Lines 13 &amp; 14:  Create a '''gtk.Window''' object and use its '''.set_title()''' method to tell GTK what string to display in the window's title bar.
** Line 16:  Run the '''create_widgets()''' method which creates all of the containers and widgets, and packs the widgets inside the right containers.
** Line 17:  Run the '''connect_signals()''' method which connects the &quot;clicked&quot; events on the buttons to a few callback methods.
** Lines 19 &amp; 20:  Recursively shows all the widgets inside the window, then runs the '''gtk.main()''' loop to respond to events.
* Line 49:  This callback method, which is connected to the &quot;clicked&quot; event on our OK button, gets the text from out '''gtk.Entry''' widget with its '''get_text()''' method, and prints it to the console.  Note that the difference between a '''callback function''' and a '''callback method''' (used here) is that the callback method has an additional argument at the beginning, '''self''', because it is defined within a class and is therefore passed the properties and methods of that class by the python interpreter.
* Line 55:  This callback method quits the application by stopping the '''gtk.main()''' loop.  Note that it does not have to run the '''.hide_all()''' method on the window object because the window is destroyed as the application stops running.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">How does rotate_extrude decide which axis to rotate about by default?

The example seems to show in rotating about Z, but when I try it it seems
to rotate about y.  This works well for me since my profile drawing is 
in x and y.  Does OpenSCAD decide what to do based on the profile itself,
or what?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the manual indicates that rotate_extrude() cannot be used to draw screw threads, 
it is possible to do so with linear_extrude() and parameter &quot;twist&quot;.  The trick is
to get the thread profile in the plane normal to the axis of the screw (typical thread
profiles are drawn in a plane of the axis).  See http://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Right off the bat I point out that the recaptcha instructions say &quot;words&quot; for what are clearly two words butted together.  The inventor of the recaptcha system uses one of the words to solve OCR problems for things like major newspaper files from long ago. Naturally I took this to mean that the two words were crammed together to fool bots and not humans, and separated them through several attempts to log in. I have been doing this for years in more than one language and am wearily familiar with the details of well-designed recaptchas.  This isn't one. A challenge like 17-5=__ would work, or even a normal recaptcha such as every serious user opts for would be an improvement.

== The CK-12 Foundation == 
CK-12 Foundation, launched in 2006, is a not for profit organization with the goal of decreasing textbook materials costs for the K-12 education market in the United States and around the world.  CK-12 hopes to be a pioneer in generating and distributing high quality educational content through the use of a web-based open content material, termed the &quot;FlexBook.”  The Flexbook is a digital textbook that allows individuals to adapt the content as they see fit.  This allows educators to customize their texts to their students’ learning styles, locations, languages, or ability levels.  Updating text is also just a click away.  Not only is it adaptable, but it is also affordable.  CK-12 allows individuals to create, edit, and print textbooks for free.  No longer do school districts have to rely on book companies whose products are often expensive and out of date (CK-12 Foundation, 2010). &lt;ref&gt; Ck-12 Foundation. (2010). Retrieved from http://about.ck12.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  CK-12 flexbooks conform to national and state curriculum guidelines and standards, are available to everyone, and is currently the only free service like this of its kind.  Funding is provided by the Amar Foundation and by Vinod and Neeru Khosla.  CK-12 focuses specifically on K-12 education.  Currently the focus is on middle and high school flexbooks, but the goal is to eventually add K-5 materials as well. &lt;ref&gt;CK-12.  (February 12, 2011).

== Founders of CK-12 ==
'''Neeru Khosla''' - Co-founder and Chair of CK-12
Khosla holds a Bachelor's degree from Delhi University/San Jose State, a Master's degree in Molecular Biology from San Jose State, and a Master's in Education from Stanford University.
Evidence of Khosla's passion for education is demonstrated by her role in serving on the National Advisory Board for DonorsChoose, an organization dedicated to addressing the scarcity and inequitable distribution of learning materials in United States public schools.  Khosla has been a member of the board at the internationally recognized Nueva School (a school for the gifted/talented) in Hillsborough, California since 1997.  She is also on the advisory board of the American India Foundation whose goal is to accelerate social and economic change in India. Khosla has also worked on other open source projects including the Pacific Vascular Research Foundation and Connexions sponsored by Rice University and is one of the founding members of the K-12 Initiative of the D-School (Hasso Plattner Institute of Design) at Stanford University (CK-12 Foundation, 2010). &lt;ref&gt;Ck-12 Foundation. (2010). Retrieved from http://about.ck12.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a TED presentation, Khosla talks about how textbooks are rigid, outdated, and expensive. The mission of her foundation is to move away from traditional textbooks and present the information in a familiar format that will hold students' attention. She feels the future is in creating &quot;living books&quot; that can be kept current and meet the needs of diverse learners. &lt;ref&gt; TEDxNYED - Neeru Khosla 03/06/10.

== California Initiative ==

[[File:BushCAGovs3.jpg‎|right|CA Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger]]

In May of 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger launched a first-in-the-nation free digital textbook initiative for the state of California. (&quot;Gov. Schwarzenegger releases,&quot; 2009) &lt;ref&gt;Gov. Schwarzenegger releases free digital textbook initiative phase 1 report. (2009, August 11). Retrieved from http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12996/ &lt;/ref&gt;   California has long been faced with economic problems as well as controversy surrounding textbooks used in public school.  Before launching the initiative, California schools spent over $400 million annually on textbooks and, those numbers were expected to rise with the increase in enrollment expected in public schools throughout the state.

Retrieved from http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Schwarzenegger’s initiative attempted to address the high cost of textbooks in the ever increasing economic crisis that California is experiencing.   The initiative began the process of creating and adapting open source content textbook to be used in the classroom as well as making the textbooks available though innovative licensing tools provided though such organizations as Creative Commons.[[Image:CC-logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=Creative Commons Logo''[[Creative Commons]]''Creative Commons Logo.]] (COSTP, 2002) &lt;ref&gt;COSTP. (2002). California open source textbook project. Retrieved from http://www.opensourcetext.org/&lt;/ref&gt;   California Open Source Textbook Project (COSTP) was created to address the movement toward free, high quality, digital textbooks that align to California standards and make them available in schools across the state.

Retrieved from http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;   Textbooks are being created using various nonprofit organizations such as CK-12 foundation which uses an online system for “collaborative, custom-collated, self publishable educational content that can be adapted for individualized needs in a digital-age textbook known as a FlexBook.” (CK-12 Foundation, 2010) &lt;ref&gt;Ck-12 Foundation. (2010). Retrieved from http://about.ck12.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  These open source textbooks created through CK-12 or similar organizations lead to a more technologically savvy educational approach in the classroom as they are downloadable and not only viewable via a computer screen or printed for student use but would also they are able to be projected onto a screen for use in a classroom.

Retrieved from http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12996/ &lt;/ref&gt;  The advantages of COSTP are expected to be four fold.  One, COSTP hopes to eliminate the $400 million spent on K-12 textbooks across California each year.  Second, COSTP hopes to increase the range of content included in the textbooks used K-12 in California   Third, COSTP hopes to end current textbook shortages in California.  And finally, COSTP hopes to create a portable content holding database that is adaptable with new technologies as they become available. (COSTP, 2002) &lt;ref&gt;COSTP. (2002). California open source textbook project. Retrieved from http://www.opensourcetext.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  In a statement given regarding the free digital textbook initiative, Governor Schwarzeneggar said, &quot;As California's budget crisis continues we must find such innovative ways to save money and improve services. California was built on innovation and I'm proud of our state's continued leadership in developing education technology. This first-in-the-nation initiative will reduce education costs, help encourage collaboration among school districts and help ensure every California student has access to a world-class education.&quot; (Paul, 2009) &lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ryan.

Retrieved from http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12996/&lt;/ref&gt;
One critical step in the COSTP is ensuring the open source textbooks are meeting the state standards.  To ensure the quality of open source textbooks, California Learning Resource Network (CLRN) reviewed open source textbooks to help school districts when dealing with the decision of which textbook to adopt.

== Initiative Phase I ==
Phase 1 of the initiative looked at the adaptation of high school math and science textbooks in California classrooms.  CLRN released their review of 16 free digital textbooks and how they measured up against California state standards in August of 2009. [10]  10 of those 16 were found to meet at least 90% of California standards and 4 of those met 100% of California’s standards.  Of those four textbooks to meet 100% of California’s standards, three were CK-12 Flexbooks: CK-12 Single Variable Calculus, CK-12 Trigonometry, and CK-12 Chemistry.

Regarding the success of the program to this point, Governor Schwarzenegger states, &quot;I launched the nation's first digital textbook initiative to provide California's students and teachers with free, high quality open educational resources.  We now have more than 30 free digital textbooks available for use in the classroom that can provide a more interactive experience for students and cost districts less- a win win that can allow educators to engage a new generation of tech savvy students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Education.

== Initiative Future ==

Eventually, California hopes to be able to offer textbooks and other curriculum materials to other outside educational organizations.  This would in turn save those other educational organizations money as well as begin to generate revenue for California as they would become available at a small price to those interested organizations.

Retrieved (2010, March 6) from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Open_Source_Textbook&lt;/ref&gt;.  There are many who feel printed textbooks are becoming obsolete in education due to rapidly changing information and the time and cost affiliated with textbook revisions.  Due to this fact and increased access to available technology and technology tools, many believe flexbooks will become the textbooks of the future.  Currently the browsers that work best with flexbooks are Firefox 3.0 and above, Internet Explorer 7.x and 8.x, and Safari 3.x and 4.x.

This book will be created and used by secondary school students.  The book will include information on different organisms studied in life science and students in biology courses are invited to participate.  &lt;ref&gt;CK-12 Foundation Newsletter.

One example of the Flexbooks program being used successfully is at Annoka-Hennepin School District in Minnesota.  The teachers used the CK-12 Foundations Probability and Statistics Flexbook to create their own custom textbook.  Once the book was complete, students were able to access it online, in the library, or purchase it for $5.  Both students and teachers were pleased with the results.  By using Flexbooks, the district was able to save money.  Creating a Flexbook costs the district $25,000; whereas, purchasing a textbook would have cost $200,000. &lt;ref&gt;CK-12 Foundation Case Studies.

== '''YouTube and Teacher Tube in Education''' ==

[[File:Logo_YouTube.svg|none|200px|border|YouTube Logo]]

==History==

In 2005, three employees of PayPal, Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen, founded the website [YouTube] so that people could upload and share videos. In November 2005, Sequoia Capital gave 3.5 million dollars in funding to YouTube and from there it was officially launched. In April 2006, Sequoia and Artis Captial contributed an additional 8 million dollars to the rapidly growing company.  &lt;ref&gt;http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.  Within one year of the funding, YouTube was purchased by Google Inc. for 1.65 billion dollars. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube accessed March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  At the completion of the sale, Sequoia Capital’s Google shares were estimated at more than $442 million, Chad Hurley’s were estimated at $345 million, Steve Chen’s at more than $326 million, Artis Capital's shares were at more than $83 million, and Jawed Karim’s at more than $64 million. &lt;ref&gt;http://logicbank.com/2007/02/09/google-sec-filing-reveals-youtube-investors-win-big/ accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Headquarters in San Mateo'''


A lawsuit was brought up against YouTube and Google in March 2007 by Viacom, who claimed that “we must turn to the courts to prevent Google and YouTube from continuing to steal value from artists and to obtain compensation for the significant damage they have caused.” After this event, more than 100,000 videos had to be removed. However, YouTube continued to grow and released versions in many different languages, including Spanish, French, and Japanese. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube accessed March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.



On March 6, 2007, TeacherTube was officially launched with the purpose of sharing instructional videos to the online community. Jason Smith was a 14-year veteran teacher, coach, and administrator who came up with the idea for this site. It provides the opportunity for teachers to teach students, as well as other teachers, concepts or skills. &lt;ref&gt;http://teachertube.com/staticPage.php?pg=about accessed March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most importantly, TeacherTube community members are a major part of the evolution of the site. Members are encouraged to not only upload educationally relevant videos, but also to make constructive comments and use the rating system to show appreciation for videos of value to one as an educator or learner. &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.teachertube.com/staticPage.php?pg=about accessed March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy==

Copyright means that when a person creates an original work of authorship, it is protected by law. Original work can be anything that can be read, heard, and/or seen. A person’s work is protected as soon as it is “created and fixed in a tangible form.” Original work can be either published or not published and still be protected by law.[http://www.copyright.gov/] 


Creative Commons (CC) is a website that promotes collaboration among the general public and creators.  This site allows the general public access to work created by others.  People are given the right to use or modify the works of originial authors.   There are six CC licenses. These licenses will let authors decide what others can do with their original work.&lt;ref&gt;http://http://creativecommons.org/accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

[http://creativecommons.org/] [[File:Creative_commons.jpg‎|middle right|150px]]

YouTube takes copyright very seriously. They have established a new technology for copyright holders.  It is called Content ID.  This is a set of tools that helps people who upload videos to YouTube be able to find their content and allows them to decide what they want to do when they find it.  These users may block it, leave it up, or make money from it. If a user believes that a video posted on YouTube is violating their copyright, they may flag the video and select &quot;infringes my copyright&quot; from the list of options provided.  This information will then be reviewed by the YouTube board.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/t/faq accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Benefits ==
There are many benefits of using YouTube and TeacherTube. Here is a list of some of those benefits:

1. It is Free to use

2. It is user friendly

3. View any video tutorial on any subject

4. Share videos globally

5. Express one’s creativity

6. One can become famous

7. Hidden talents are found

8. Videos are a powerful teaching tool

9. Stay current on any subject

10. Don’t need expensive equipment

== Educational Impact ==

Both YouTube and TeacherTube provide educational lectures and instructional videos that teaches new information to the learner or reinforces material that has already been learned. Both sites contain numerous student projects, experiments, and professional development clips even for the teachers. Several colleges, such as the University of California Berkeley and Vanderbilt, have partnered with YouTube to provide the schools with channels for lectures and interactive web-sites. The video-clips allow students to explore the topic beyond the assignment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.convergemag.com/edtech/Is-Education-Ready-For-YouTube.html accessed March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Being able to share so much information with others who are so far away can change the role of teachers and students in the future. With this valuable tool, students are able to explore, problem-solve, foster debates, and think critically.

Teacher Tube contains a teaching resources page.  Individuals can upload video, documents, audio, and photos.  The Teacher Vision section contains lesson pland, printables and more.  These resources are organized by subject, grade, and theme. &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.teachertube.com/teachervision.php accessed March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Some YouTube users are breaking the copyright law. It seems that users are uploading videos that they did not make and claiming as their own. Others are posting videos that may be offensive and not socially correct. There are also mature videos and videos with violence in them that are not suitable for young children. Kids also have free rein to watch any video of their choice.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_YouTube]

Users have the ability to preserve the integrity of the site by flagging inappropriate videos. TeacherTube staff review flagged sites and will remove any inappropriate posts. With more collegial commentary and discussion through messaging and responses, the quality of this resource will only increase.  [http://www1.teachertube.com/staticPage.php?pg=about]

==Tosh.O==
YouTube has been a hot topic in the news since its creation.  However, on June 4, 2009 YouTube made its debut on Comedy Central in a show called Tosh.O.  In its first season it recorded a startling one million viewers per episode.  It was noted that by 2010, this show has had up to 2.7 million viewers per episode.  This hit-TV show focused on the viral videos that are watched on YouTube.  The host, Daniel Tosh, then uses comical language and discusses the videos on the spot to his viewers.  There is also a section of each episode known as &quot;Web Redemption&quot; where they invite a person (from a viral video) onto the TV show to defend or explain their actions that were captured on the YouTube video.  Daniel Tosh realized the popularity and opportunities that YouTube possessed, created this TV show, and is now extremely successful and profitable.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosh.0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- need to do: add motivation on why the concept of connectedness is important --&gt;

Intuitively, the concept of '''connectedness''' is a way to describe whether sets are &quot;all in one piece&quot; or composed of &quot;separate pieces&quot;. For motivation of the definition, any interval in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; should be connected, but a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; consisting of two disjoint closed intervals &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[c,d]&lt;/math&gt; should not be connected.

:'''Definition''' A set in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is '''connected''' if it is not a subset of the disjoint union of two open sets.
:'''Alternative Definition''' A set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is called '''disconnected''' if there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt; f: X \to \{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt;, such a function is called a '''disconnection'''. If no such function exists then we say &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''connected'''.

:'''Examples''' The set &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt; cannot be covered by two open, disjoint intervals; for example, the open sets &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1,2)&lt;/math&gt; do not cover &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt; because the point &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; is not in their union. Thus &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt; is connected.
:However, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,2\}&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by the union of &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1,3)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\{0,2\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' connected.

==Path-Connected==
A similar concept is path-connectedness. 

:'''Definition''' A set is '''path-connected''' if any two points can be connected with a path without exiting the set. 

A useful example is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt;. Any two points a and b can be connected by simply drawing a path that goes around the origin instead of right through it; thus this set is path-connected. However, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' path-connected, because for &lt;math&gt;a=-3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=3&lt;/math&gt;, there is no path to connect a and b without going through &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

As should be obvious at this point, in the real line regular connectedness and path-connectedness are equivalent; however, this does not hold true for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. When this does not hold, path-connectivity implies connectivity; that is, every path-connected set is connected.

==Simply Connected==
Another important topic related to connectedness is that of a simply connected set. This is an even stronger condition that path-connected.

:'''Definition''' A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''simply-connected''' if any loop completely contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be shrunk down to a point without leaving &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of a Simply-Connected set is any open ball in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. However, the previous path-connected set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' simply connected, because for any loop p around the origin, if we shrink p down to a single point we have to leave the set at &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">hey, i was wondering if we should keep scenery, props, and special effects info on their respective pages. do you guys want to combine all those pieces of the pages? let me know what you think

I tried to find some pics of the thymele, but I couldn't find any good ones. I linked all of the pics that we did find into the upper paragraph, and I used the pic of the entire theatre for the orchestra. There are still a lit of terms that we have defined and found pics for, but we have not used in the actual paragraphs.


INFORMATION BELOW IS TO BE EDITED INTO A COHESIVE PAGE:

A major part of the staging of Greek plays was the Machina. It was a large crane that was used to lift actors into the air to fly as they portrayed the Gods or major heroes. It was also used to parody tragedy in a comic play (We need to find out how and why?)

-'''Orchestra''': &quot;The Dancing Place&quot; Flat circular space at the bottom of the koilon, where the chorus usually resided. The actors never used this area.

-'''Thymele''': An altar to Dionysus, place where the chorus leader would stand.

-'''[http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/images/hesterbond/2004/10/21/theatre_of_dionysis.jpg Skene]''': &quot;Tent&quot; House-like structure behind the orchestra, provided a place for actors to enter and exit. Also was used for setting backdrops and scenery. Was also used for the onstage changing of costumes and masks while onstage. Wooden construction with a flat roof. Actors changes while the chorus sang. 

-'''[http://www.holidaycheck.de/data/urlaubsbilder/mittel/7/1156250310.jpg Paradoi]''': One or more (Usually two) entrances for actors between the skene and the seats and is where the chorus entered. Located on either side of the Skene (Or orchestra? Not sure) 
The '''Paradoi''' served as entrances and exits for the actors. Usually two gangplanks off either side of the orchestra that the chorus or actors would used for entrances. 

-'''Kilmakes''': Stairways in the Theatron

-'''Kerkis''': Wedge shaped pieces of the Theatron

-'''Paraskenion''': Side additions to the Skene. One to two story wings off the Proskenion that could be ornamented with pillars or could support a frieze. 

-'''[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Bosra-Theater-053.jpg Logeion Proskenion]''': &quot;something set up before the skene&quot; Raised platform in front of the skene.

-'''[http://www.rpginc.com/products/triffusor/trif_img/triffus-patent.jpg Periaktoi]''': Triangle pieces of scenery that allowed scene changes. Each side was a piece of the scenery and could be turned in order to make a new backdrop. 

-'''[http://www.whitman.edu/theatre/theatretour/glossary/glossary%20images/pinakes.jpg Pinakes]''': Big flats that attached to the Skene. 

-'''[http://www.aug.edu/~nprinsky/Humn2001/ekkylema108.GIF Ekkyklema]''': &quot;Roll out Platform&quot; A device for tableaus: Most likely used for showing the bodies from characters killed off stage. Platform rolled from the central doorway of the skene. Was used in comedies for enhancing the tragic effect in plays such as 

-'''[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dqBMePf7cQk/SLlmQql22EI/AAAAAAAAAt4/0HJQQ8vnUAY/s320/deus+ex+machina.gif Deus Ex Machina]''': Crane, overused (especially by Euripides), to represent Gods and described any contrived ending. 

-'''[http://www.timboucher.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/deus%20ex%20machina.JPG Machina]''': Crane. Also used to parody tragedy in comedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several properties of continuity on sets of real numbers can be extended by examining continuity from a Topological standpoint. In topology, an alternate definition (i.e. other than the standard &quot;epsilon-delta&quot; real analysis definition) is usually used. This definition applies to any function between sets, not just to metric spaces.

:'''Definition''' Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, let &lt;math&gt;f:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; iff for every open subset &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

It must be mentioned here that the term &quot;Open Set&quot; can be defined in much more general settings than the set of reals or even metric spaces; however, for use in Real Analysis, the definition of ''Open Set'' that you are already familiar with will definitely suffice.

===Theorem===
For any continuous function f:A-&gt;B, U compact =&gt; f(U) compact.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Stages of Group Development ==

One of the greatest challenges for team leaders or the team members themselves is progressing through the stages of team development. There are many different models and theories on team development and the stages of team formation. For the time being, most of this part of the chapter will focus on Bruce Tuckman’s model of Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing established in the 1960’s and 70’s.

== Forming ==

In this first stage the team members do not have defined roles and most likely it is not clear what they are supposed to do. The mission of the team may be nonexistent or in the early stages of development, thus individuals may not feel any sort of commitment or ownership toward the team and/or its mission. The individual team members probably don’t know and/or haven’t worked with other members on the team. Obviously there is no team history, and the norms of the team are not yet established. There is a high degree of learning in this phase as members learn about each other, the mission, and their place within the team. Because there is a high degree of unfamiliarity among team members there is high uncertainty and low conflict. Team members are generally on their best behavior, and tend to behave independently. 

The forming phase of team building can be a bit stressful for the team members, but is very important in laying a strong foundation for future teamwork. Teams in the Forming stage must be careful to avoid cliques, or subgroups from forming within the team. Subgroups may or may not have a negative impact on the team’s performance. It is best for the team leader/manager to carefully observe the subgroups behavior to ensure it is acting in the best interests of the team. 

This stage of team development is crucial and it is suggested that teams in the forming stage participate in team-building activities (as discussed later in this chapter). The below list is a non-exhaustive list of behaviors and outcomes that characterize this phase and which high performing team’s generally complete.

#Define roles of team members
#Set the goal(s) of the team
#Establish a mission
#Determine directive leadership (this step may have been completed through an organization’s structure)
#Occasionally meet to work on common tasks
#Team members decide to be on the team
#Figure out how to build trust within the team
#Establish expectations for the team and it’s members
#Form relationships, make contact, and bond
#Create and agree to a team charter

== Storming ==

The storming stage of team development is a time for team members’ ideas are considered and in competition. Individuals will try new ideas and push for power and position in the team. Agendas are quickly displayed. People may want to modify the team’s mission. There can often be little team spirit and lots of personal attacks. Roles are expressed and refined. Those team members who are conflict avoidance will often participate little in this phase due to its inherent nature. Conversely, those that are not conflict avoiding will often participate more during this stage than others.

If this phase is not carefully managed it can get out of control and be destructive to the effectiveness of the team. It is especially important for team members to manage this phase with patience and tolerance. The diversity and differences of the team members should be emphasized as well as a common goal. There are some teams that never move from this stage to the next because it can be de-motivating. Often cliques, subgroups, and splinter groups will form. 

For teams to move from the storming stage the norming stage they typically do the following tasks.

#Recognize and publicize team wins
#Display active listening skills among members
#Make time to spend with the team
#Build trust by honoring commitments
#Provide and accept honest open feedback
#Create and maintain a positive supporting atmosphere
#Team leader asks for and expects results
#Team leader constantly reinforces proper team behavior
#Team leader facilitates the group for wins
#Buy into goals, actions, and activities
#Have a “We can succeed” mindset

== Norming ==

Only some teams reach the norming stage. Member agree about the roles and processes required to solve problems. Members of the team adjust their work habits and behavior in order to accommodate other team members and make the work on the team more smooth and natural. Team members work through this phase by agreeing on rules, values, professional behavior, and methods. As team members learn more about each other their perspectives about each other change (for the better or for the worse).

In this stage success occurs and the team has all the resources to meet their objectives. Within the team, members will develop an appreciation for each other as well as build trust. The team’s purpose is accepted by the members. The team leader will support and reinforce correct team behavior. The team is creative, has more motivation, and commitment from all members. If there are any hidden agendas, they will typically be exposed as team members solidify team norms. Decisions are made through consensus building and negotiation.

There are some common pitfalls that must be avoided in this phase. Creativity may be stifled if norming behaviors become too strong, or the group may begin to foster and display groupthink. Team members often fail to challenge each other, or issues that may prevent the team from performing to their optimal ability. Some team members can feel threatened by the large amount of responsibility they are given – causing them resist and revert back to storming stage. To prevent this from happening team members must be aware of the common pitfalls that may occur during this stage and take appropriate steps to ensure they don’t.

Teams that want to enter the performing stage should take the following action steps during the norming stage.

Maintain traditions
Distribute responsibility evenly
Communicate at all times
Perform self-evaluations 
Express praise for other members commitment and work
Share leadership based on unique skill sets
Responsibility sharing
Commit time to the team
Set new higher goals to keep the team excelling
Actively delegate responsibilities
Share rewards and successes

== Performing ==

During the performing stage teams become high performing teams. Teams collectively work to solve problems and get the job done without the need for outside supervision or unnecessary conflict. The team is focused, effective, and achieves extraordinary results. There is a collaborative environment in which team members use their resources most efficiently. Team members are autonomous, competent decision makers. Team leaders focus more on strategy as well as communicating successes and areas of opportunity because the team takes on the responsibility of decision making.

Teams in this stage have the ability to recognize weaknesses and strengthen them. Team members will experience tremendous personal growth. Members care about each other, thus creating a unique team identity. Any arguments, disagreements, disputes, and the like will be channeled toward making the team stronger. Finally, performing teams utilize their established communication protocols and action plans.

== Adjourning ==

Teams cannot exist indefinitely if there is overarching goal to achieve. If the team has met its objective, it is usually disbanded. Tuckman added the adjourning stage as a final stage to his four (now five) stage process. High performing teams typically have positive team experiences. Therefore, this stage is sometimes referred to as the mourning stage by teams that must break up.

== Conclusion ==

There are four main stages of team development – forming, storming, norming, and performing. Each stage has its own set of characteristics, but there may also be overlap among the phases. Teams that make it to the norming and performing stages have done so because the team members were willing to trust other members and care for them. Performing teams also are able to assess the team’s effectiveness and make decisions on how improve in the future – all autonomously. This is the most desirable state for a team to reach.

The certainty of change in a team (whether it be objectives, members, or other) will almost inevitably cause the team to revert back to earlier steps. Long standing teams will periodically go through these cycles as changing circumstances require.

== Introduction ==

AHI is a system that is supposed to utilize the hardware for playing prepared sound.


Open Source Drivers - M Blom and G Steger (SBLive), M Schulz (ac97), D Wentzler (HDAudio, Envy24HT and CMI8738) and R Vumbaca (SB128) 


A typical device driver is usually in one of three conditions...

* inactive - needs to be installed, power startup or enable 
* busy     - uninstall, power down or disable, release a device
* finished - read or write requests, lock a device 


AHI reads a “modefile” that describes the basic features of the sound driver like mono, stereo, 7.1 surround, etc. The driver is opened and goes looking for a matching sound card. 

In case of audio drivers yes - pci are probed. But only the init routine defined by resident structure is called in most cases. If the driver cannot find suitable hardware it quits init and gets unloaded. In AHI config you will never see drivers which do not work.

AHI never talks straight to audio chipsets but it does communicate through buffers which contain details like how many channels are needed, how many bits per sample, and how the samples arrive. It builds up one buffer for talking to the sound chip and another that gets the chips' reply. 

The typical way to feed continuously is called double-buffering. While the audio chips are playing the first buffer, AHI will be filling the next sounds into the second buffer. Once the playback routine moves onto the second buffer, the first one will be filled with new stuff, and so on. Obviously, it helps if the audio chipset also supports two buffers. 

8, 16, or 32 bit in mono or stereo, or 32 bit 7.1 channels to be played by HW. Mixing multiple channels from apps is done by AHI. 
A less known detail: ALL modes labeled &quot;HiFi&quot; are using 32 bit samples between AHI and the driver, regardless of the resolution of the samples going in to AHI. 

All variable quantities exposed to the user (or driver) are of type Fixed, which is a signed 32 bit fixed point value, with the &quot;fixed point&quot; between the upper16 bits and the lower 16. A value of 1 would be stored as 0x00010000, a value of 0.5 would be 0x00008000, 0.25 would be 0x00004000 etc.. 

This makes for much faster calculations than a floating point variable would offer.



The sound card is expected to create a hard interrupt as it completes each buffer of audio. Assuming two (or more) buffers are in use, this triggers the re-loading of the just completed buffer so that the sound card can run freely back and forth between two buffers and never run out of new sound. (double-buffering). 

Drivers are written to conform with whatever AHI expects, and not the other way around. AHI has served us very well, and it has become the standard audio device for all Amiga inspired platforms, but as we grow into more modern hardware, we may be limited by the constraints of AHI design. 

USB audio devices have had some trouble structuring an AHI driver that works with DeviceIO commands instead of being driven by hard interrupts. 
Some of the techniques that AHI used to make accessing the sound card &quot;easy&quot; are now making it more difficult than it should be. 
USB audio device works on like any other device would. It processes a queue of write requests, each carrying some amount of data to the sound hardware. There are no interrupts involved, just the same DeviceIO techniques that Exec has been doing since Workbench 1.0.
changing over to USB would be almost as simple as changing the OpenDevice() call.. but we are not so lucky.
AHI will have a USB driver but the &quot;old way&quot; can make things more difficult than was originally expected. 



AHI provides each program with volume controls. 



sounds is interpreted by the ear in a logirithmic fashion so 10db is percieved as aproximately twice as loud, note that's not the same as twice as powerful which is 6db ofcourse. 

But sound istelf is just a pressure wave and is neither logorithmic nor linear, it just is. 

Samples are typically store as LPCM (linear Pulse Code Modulation) and so can definitely be added together with simple addition. 

As to AHI reducing the volume when mixing multiple samples, I believe there are several different modes, safe, safe dynamic, full volume, and -3 -6 

Say you have 24 channels to mix. Given no other knowledge of the sample values in order to prevent clipping (which is very bad, for speakers or your ears if you have earphones in) you have to reduce the volume of each sample to 1/24, this is (I think) analogous to the safe mode.

This throws away alot of quality by reducing the sample resolution. There may not be any overflow or very little but it still modifies the output volume. Of course, even in the real world, a lot of sounds together will cause saturation. The trick is to combine them together and compensate for this but still retaining the original sample volumes. Naturally louder sounds will drain out softer sounds so perhaps this can be used to an advantage. But I have seen A+B-(AB) a lot just now.  

So if you have a variable number of samples you can reduce the volume by only the current number of used channels. So only 6 channels in use reduce to 1/6 much less loss in clarity but the unreal effect of more sounds reducing the apparent volume of each sub sound, (safe , dynamic)

Or you can take the computer out of the loop and assume the human (or software the human is running like a game doing it's own mixing, or AudioEvolution etc) make sane judgements, no attenuation, no loss of quality, but get it wrong and you blow your ears out. (Ful Volume mode). Since 90% of the time I'm only playing a single stereo stream I always use this option. 

The -3 and -6 db modes just add bit of head room into the full volume equation.




== Quick Building ==

simple way to only recompile the HDAudio driver?  running 'make AHI-quick' or 'make workbench-devs-AHI-quick' in AROS directory should to the trick. 'make AHI' will also rebuild dependencies of AHI 

only says &quot;MMAKE: Nothing to do for xxxx&quot;, despite changes being made 
The AHI build is done by using calling configure and calling make (%build_with_configure mmake macro). Because of that mmake does not see the dependencies; it just uses some stamp files. You can delete bin/__ARCH__-__CPU__/gen/workbench/devs/AHI and then call 'make AHI-quick'. I hope that should do the trick. 

rebuilding AHI drivers is tricky. I use a command like this:

rm bin/pc-i386/gen/workbench/devs/AHI/.installed ; make workbench-devs-AHI-quick &amp;&amp; cp bin/pc-i386/AROS/Devs/AHI/hdaudio.audio ...




== Overview of an AHI driver ==

The AHI source drivers are contained in the main source.bz2 and not contrib. 

 each drivers sources has its own drawer in workbench/devs/AHI/Drivers and usually contains 

playback just does a straight copy to the buffer, and recording does nothing at all with the buffer.
The buffer size is set by AHI based on sample rate and size, so that the interrupt rate will be 50 Hz. Typically they are around 8KB if I recall correctly for 44100/16bit. The size should not be changed. 

If the hardware does not support 32 bit samples, you should re-enable HiFi in the AUDIOMODE so that AHI mixes at &quot;HiFi&quot; quality. The driver already takes care of skipping the upper part when a HiFi mode is used.

== Structure of OpenSound OSS driver ==

The OSS API is designed to use the traditional Unix framework of open(), read(), write(), and ioctl(), via [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sound special devices]. For instance, the default device for sound input and output is /dev/dsp. 

[http://www.opensound.com/pguide/oss.pdf. PDF] and [http://manuals.opensound.com/sources/myossdev.c.html Manual Page] and [http://manuals.opensound.com/sources/drivers.html sources]. 

[http://developer.opensound.com/ Home Page] and [http://www.4front-tech.com/developer/sources/stable/bsd/ OSS BSD Source] which is sometimes down.


AC97 Codec/Mixer support in /drv/ sources 

via AC97 has Mixer, Read, Write, Interrupts, Audio Set Rate, Audio Set Channels, Audio IOctl, Audio Reset, Audio Reset Input and Output, Audio Open, Audio Close, Audio Start Input, Audio Trigger, Audio Prepare Input, Audio Prepare Output, Alloc Buffers, Get Buffer Pointer, SGD buffers, Control. 

SBpci has SRC init, SRC Reg Read, SRC Reg Write, SRC Get Rate, SRC Set Rate, Writemem, Readmem, Interrupt, Audio Set Rate, Audio Set Channels, Audio Set Format, Audio IOctl, Audio Reset, Audio Reset Input and Output, Audio Open, Audio Close, Audio Output Block, Audio Start Input, Audio Trigger, Audio Prepare Input, Audio Prepare Output, Get Buffer Pointer, Control, Mix Init, SBPCI Attach, SBPCI Detach. 

cmpci has Defines, Set SPDIF Rate, Setup AC3, Set Mixer, Get Mixer, Change Bits, Mixer Set, Outsw, Mixer IOCtl, Set Recmask, Outsw, Mix Init, Mixer Reset, Interrupts, Audio Set Rate, Audio Set Channels, Audio Set Format, Audio IOctl, Audio Reset, Audio Reset Input and Output, Audio Open, Audio Close, Audio Output Block, Audio Start Input, Audio Trigger, Set DAC Rate, Set DAC Fmt, Set ADC Rate, Set ADC Fmt, Setup Record, Audio Prepare Input, Setup Play, Audio Prepare Output, Get Buffer Pointer, Control, Mix Init, cmpci Attach, cmpci Detach. 




== Interrupts ==

Interrupts can be triggered by the CPU (limited number) or through an additional chip which will have many more. 

* asynchronously - resets or power failures
* synchronously  - system calls, illegal instructions 






== How to adapt an OSS driver to an AHI driver ==






== Reference ==

INTB_TIMERTICK hack was removed, do not use it any more At what rate does VERTB interrupt happen now?

How it used to be:

VERTB: always 50 Hz
TIMERTICK: 100 Hz (default, could be changed with &quot;-t&quot; argument when starting AROS)

Some things like that AHI driver do not work well if it only happens at a rate of 50Hz.
Also a general timer precision of 50 Hz is bad. That's what the TIMERTICK hack fixed.

It was caused by the fact that sound chip did not have correctly set interrupt number. I managed to get correct IRQ by fiddling with BIOS settings.

If you look with PCITool your sound chips information and if it says something that IRQ is 255 or 0 then it is not correctly set.

I have posted about this IRQ thing before, at the moment PCI.hidd just takes the IRQ number from pci config space and does not check it's integrity. Bios may or may have not set the irq number, it all depends of your Bios settings.

the generic AC97 code seperated out into an OO class which AHI drivers may utilise to provide the necessary functionality. (fwiw - an es137x driver for vmware/real hardware would also need AC97 &quot;support&quot;)

/* SIS7012 handles the pcm data in bytes, others are in samples *

Ac97 driver supports 48KHz audio only (this one is default to the ac97 codecs). Mixing does work (tried to run 3 copies of madahi at once with different mp3's). The driver's task works with priority 30 in order to override the input.device (well, sound should be played nicely when user moves/resizes the window, shouldn't it?) and fully utilizes interrupt :) 


everybody likes to use the device interface to stream audio? In that case can you cache the sound until you have enough to send to the sound card on a hard interrupt?

Even with the low level library interface, which is made for module playing really, the driver caches the audio stream for each module interrupt (soft interrupt if you will), which is then sent to the sound card on the hardware interrupt.

Of course, this breaks if the module data plays faster than the card can handle, such as the OS4 EMU10K driver. Which was set to a 80Hz hardware interrupt because the A1 had a problem IIRC with the normal value of 1000Hz which worked on all other Amiga related drivers incluidng the real thing. A module with a sound interrupt going over 80Hz breaks and messed up the audio causing looping.

Being SANA II compatible means it will support all the major network protocols available for AROS.




Multicast: (least-significant bit of the first byte - low-order bits in a byte transmitted first) 
Broadcast: 


'''Sana2IOReq'''
*6 bytes of destination address (Ethernet addresses consist of 47 bits of address information and a 1 bit multicast flag) 
*6 bytes of source address
*2 bytes of type,
*64 to 1500 bytes of data (packet)

==How to convert GPL-linux driver to SANA2 AROS driver==






==ArosTCP==

Does anyone know why our network stack have the following limitations:

* each task needs to open it's own library base
* socket created by task A cannot be used by task B without doing some &quot;sharing magic&quot; 

This limitation is a bug hurdle when porting multi threaded networking software from linux world as there, there is not such limitation.

Because  some things are based on signals, and signals belong to some task. Also, there's no other way to have thread-safe errno and DNS lookups. This comes from original AmiTCP design, Miami is the same. Only  Roadshow  (OS4  stack)  provides shared SocketBase. This can be
queried by querying a SocketBaseTag, i don't remember details. In  AROSTCP  the  same  can be implemented by separating task context
from  SocketBase  and  using AVL tree for associating context with the task. This is true about the Exec Signalling setup - All Tasks Allocate their own signals (this is true from original exec). Or wait till the relbase patches are commited and use that mechanism.
It will then be done for you. 

Does AROS need the TCP stack re-written to have a single common library with a shared library base and per-caller specialist data provided as well? with the *option* of setting per-task private data? per-task data would still need to have an associative lookup mechanism.

This is a holdover from the AmiTCP network stack and Miami Classic Amiga Network stack implementations of creating the bsdsocket.library itself when the network Application (AmiTCP or Miami or MiamiDX) was launched. 

There is also the holdover from the task/process model of Classic Exec allowing each opener of a library to have a custom library base.

&quot;It is a common knowledge that each process that uses bsdsocket.library has to open the library only for its very own purposes - database of the library is connected with the process and can not be shared between other processes.&quot;
(source: http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/networksnooper)

Most major UAE versions have memory-only bsdsocket.library (including all other &quot;virtual&quot; devices like uaehf.device, uaescsi.device etc..)
I think some port does (did have?) &quot;real&quot; library but it most likely only contained m68k&lt;&gt;host C-routine jump table magic. 

AmiTCP/IP [http://aminet.net/package/comm/net/AmiTCP-pdfA-20 documentation] to Aminet. 



I am dreaming of a full TCP/IP based on the amiga message passing system. Thus with for example ip.device, tcp.device, udp.device etc.

==Retargetable Audio Devices==


For other sound cards, a system called AHI was developed to support other sound cards other than using Paula (Amiga(TM)). AHI uses the ahi.device and extra drivers to support different sound cards which is set in the AHI preferences (in Prefs drawer). You can program it in a similar way as the old Amiga audio.device. More information is included with the AHI Developer files which you can download from the [http://arp2.berlios.de/ahi/#support AHI homepage] or Aminet.

Units 0 - 3 can be shared by as many programs as you define channels for them. Music Unit blocks the hardware which it is set to exclusively, so that no other program can play sound at the same time through this hardware. That's what &lt;ahi-device&gt;.audio was invented, it is a virtual hardware for which sends its sound data to the unit you set it up. This way, although music unit pull-down option blocks &lt;ahi-device&gt;.audio exclusively, other programs can still send sound to unit 0 - 3. Normally all programs use unit 0. Only very few programs use the music unit. 


It works on two models, as a device driver (High-level) or library (Low-level). Although this confused me at first, having programmed the device model it is because this is simple just allowing you to send sound streams and the library model deals with samples for use with trackers which are preloaded.






===Library Approach===

The library (Low-level) approach use AHI functions like AHI_SetSound(), AHI_SetVol() and so on. 
In reality, this  way  has one big problem: if you work with this method, you will not have any mixing functions - your program will lock ahi.device and while your program is running, all other ahi programs will not work. The  only  advantage  of low-level coding as mentioned in the documentation is  &quot;low overhead and much more advanced control over the playing sounds&quot;. 

Here you get exclusive access to the audio hardware, and can do almost whatever you want, including monitoring. 

Disadvantage is obviously, that the audio hardware is blocked for all other programs. Most of the drivers don't care about this situation, and if a program tries to access the hardware it mostly trashes everything and you need to restart your program, or re-allocate the audio hardware. 

From AHI6 on, there is a nonblocking AHI mode called &quot;device mode&quot;, but it doesn't allow recording. Playback only and has bad timing. Good enough for Playback something, but too bad for realtime response. 

To use two samples, you need to use the library model, you would open the ahi.device and extract the library base from the AHI device structure. 






===Device Approach===

In this way you just use ahi.device as standard amiga device, and use CMD_WRITE for sending raw data to the AHI. With hi-level ahi coding you are allowed to mix sound, there are no 'locks' of ahi.device anymore and so  on. For example, for mp3 playing, or for mod players, you just depack the data needed by the CPU and use this unpacked raw data with CMD_WRITE.

The device interface is much easier to program, and is suitable for system niose or mp3 players. It has a fix latency of 20ms, which is ok in most (non-musical) situations. It is non-blocking the hardware, so it is the first choise when it comes to quick play some audio. 


It also supports the CMD_READ message but 

* As soon as you read, it blocks AHI exclusively. 
* it can sometimes gives the odd click while recording via device interfaces 

All you do is use the CMD_WRITE command with the sample info set in the AHI IORequest structure, for more samples you will need to copy the IORequest and use that for the other samples, and so on. Essentially the structure is sent as a message to the AHI daemon, which is standard for Exec devices, so that is why it needs a copy. Otherwise it would try to link a message in the list which is already in there, of the same address, then crash! 


I would start with the device API, not least because it's very simple. When you have loaded/generated sample data, opened the AHI device and allocated IORequest(s), you can use the Exec library functions (DoIO, SendIO, BeginIO...) to play the samples. However, there may be a limited amount of AHI channels, so IIRC in that case lower priority sounds will be queued and played later. You could create your own mixer routine which basically &quot;streams&quot; data using double-buffered IO requests (there is an example in the AHI SDK about double buffering). 

Do I really need to record via ahi.device?
If it is just the monitor feature, you can use ahi's internal monitor functionality (which has the lowest possible latency and might use the hardware possibility to monitor) or you can read, manipulate and copy to the outbuffer your data using the lib interface. The latency will be usually 20ms, depending on the driver, the application has no control over this. 

You could also use datatypes.library to play samples but cannot say if it's very accurate timing wisely, but it's at least very simple to use. 

&lt;pre&gt;
CreateMsgPort
CreateIORequest
OpenDevice (ahi.device)

loop
    {
    depack some music data
    fill AHIdatas
    SendIO((struct IORequest *) AHIdatas);
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then, when i need , i just do for sound (which will be played on second channel (it's only solution to make it works at the same time by ahi):

&lt;pre&gt;
CreateMsgPort
CreateIORequest
OpenDevice (ahi.device)

fill AHIdatas

DoIO/sendio
&lt;/pre&gt;

Find the default audio ID such as for unit 0 or the default unit. Then call AHI_AllocAudioA() and pass it the ID, or AHI_DEFALUT_ID, and a AHIA_Channels tag with the minimum channels you need. Then check if it allocated the channels. If so you should know it has enough channels and you can then AHI_FreeAudio(). If not that should mean it doesn't have enough provided you have passed all the required tags.

AHI device interface plays streams, not samples. AHI mixes as many streams together as you have channels set in the prefs. If you try to play more streams than channels are available, the additional streams are muted.

If you need to synchronise two samples (perhaps for stereo) then you can issue a CMD_STOP, do your CMD_WRITEs, then issue a CMD_START to start play. What you have gotta watch is that is affects all AHI applications and not just your own.

This brings me to another point. Are your sounds mono or stereo? As you would have read the proper way for stereo is to tell AHI to centre the pan and to give it a stereo sample. I don't know if it returns an error if it can't do it, possibly will accept the write but with a muted channel as it looks like you found out.

Another thing about multiple CMD_WRITEs from different AHI Requests. AHI will treat each instance separately and will mix the sound together on the same track. Providing the hardware supports it, the high level API can only offer panning and not let specify a direct track AFAIK. 

http://utilitybase.com/forum/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=201&amp;topic=1565&amp;page=-1

If you want to play multiple samples with only one channel through the device API, you have to create one stream from the samples yourself. 


The AHI API uses OpenDevice to do CMD_READ, CMD_WRITE, CMD_START, CMD_STOP. 

[http://utilitybase.com/forum/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=6&amp;topic=666 see here thread]





===Setting up===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
if (AHImp=CreateMsgPort()) {
  if (AHIio=(struct AHIRequest *)CreateIORequest(AHImp,sizeof(struct AHIRequest))) {
     AHIio-&gt;ahir_Version = 6;
     AHIDevice=OpenDevice(AHINAME,0,(struct IORequest *)AHIio,NULL);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This will create a new message port, the create some IORequest structures and finally open the AHI device for which to write. 




===Playing a Sound===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Play buffer
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Message.mn_Node.ln_Pri = pri;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Command = CMD_WRITE;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Data = p1;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Length = length;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Offset = 0;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Frequency = FREQUENCY;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Type = TYPE;
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Volume = 0x10000; // Full volume
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Position = 0x8000; // Centered
AHIio-&gt;ahir_Link = link;
SendIO((struct IORequest *) AHIio);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// fill

  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Message.mn_Node.ln_Pri = 127;
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Command  = CMD_WRITE;
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Data     = raw_data;
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Length   = size_of_buffer;
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Offset   = 0;
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Frequency       = 48000;     // freq
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Type            = AHIST_S16S;// 16b
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Volume          = 0x10000;   // vol.
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Position        = 0x8000;   
  AHIios[0]-&gt;ahir_Link            = NULL;

// send

SendIO((struct IORequest *) AHIios[0]);
&lt;/source&gt;

The AHI_IORequest structure is similar to audio device structures. p1 points to the actual raw sound data, length is the size of the data buffer, Frequency is the amount to reply at e.g. 8000 Hertz, Type is type of music data e.g. AHIST_M8S, then the Volume and Position of speakers. SendIO will start playing the sound and you may use WaitIO to wait until the buffer is played before starting on next block of data.



===Freeing Audio===

* i call AHI_ControlAudio()n with play to false so that i make sure nothing is being played
* i unload the sounds using AHI_UnloadSound() to make sure sounds get unloaded
* then i call AHI_FreeAudio()




===Closing down===

Once you have finished with the AHI device, you need to close down the device. e.g.
* Does a CloseDevice()
* then DeletIORequest()
* and last DeleteMsgPort()

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
if (!AHIDevice)
   CloseDevice((struct IORequest *)AHIio);
   DeleteIORequest((struct IORequest *)AHIio);
   DeleteIORequest((struct IORequest *)AHIio2);
   DeleteMsgPort(AHImp);
&lt;/source&gt;





===Updating Sound often ===

Take a look at the simpleplay example.

If you want to 'update' your sound on a regular base then there is already functionality available.

In AllocAudio() you can provide a playerfunction using the AHIA_PlayerFunc field.

AHIA_PlayerFunc   
If you are going to play a musical score, you should use this &quot;interrupt&quot; source instead of VBLANK or CIA timers in order to get the best result with all audio drivers. If you cannot use this, you must not use any &quot;non-realtime&quot; modes (see AHI_GetAudioAttrsA() in the autodocs, the AHIDB_Realtime tag).

AHIA_PlayerFreq    
If non-zero, it enables timing and specifies how many times per second PlayerFunc will be called. This must be specified if AHIA_PlayerFunc is! It is suggested that you keep the frequency below 100-200 Hz. Since the frequency is a fixpoint number AHIA_PlayerFreq should be less than 13107200 (that's 200 Hz).

That way it is for example possible to write some kind of replayer that decides which sounds needs to be stopped, or for example be slided, volume turned up/down etc.

Just make the mainloop waits for the player to be 'done'.

You could do that by messaging, but for example also by using a signal. In order to stop the player you could use a boolean (that you set by pressing a button or whatever you want) that the player checks and then signals the mainloop to quit.

Please take a look at the PlaySineEverywhere.c example in the AHI developer archive.




===Misc===

There are a number of things that are called &quot;latency.&quot; The thing that concerns me most is the time between when audio (like a microphone) hits the input and when it comes out the monitor output. You can measure this by putting something with a short rise time (a cross stick sound is good) into one channel, and connect the output of that
channel to the input of another channel. Record a few seconds on both channels. Stop the recording, zoom in on the waveform of the two channels, and measure the time difference between them. That's the input/output latency.

Latency when playing samples is trickier because it depends on the program that's supporting the VST instrument. If you have a MIDI keyboard with sounds you could choose a similar sound on the keyboard and from the VST library, connect the analog output of the sample playback channel to one input, connect the synth output to another input, play your sound, record it to two tracks, and look at the time difference between the tracks. That's not totally accurate but it will get you a ballpark measurement. 


If you do the following literally (in your code):

&lt;pre&gt;
filebuffer = Open(&quot;e.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length1 = Read(filebuffer,p1,BUFFERSIZE);


filebuffer = Open(&quot;a.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length2 = Read(filebuffer,p2,BUFFERSIZE);

filebuffer = Open(&quot;d.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length3 = Read(filebuffer,p3,BUFFERSIZE);

filebuffer = Open(&quot;g.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length4 = Read(filebuffer,p4,BUFFERSIZE);

filebuffer = Open(&quot;b.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length5 = Read(filebuffer,p5,BUFFERSIZE);

filebuffer = Open(&quot;ec.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL) printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;);
else length6 = Read(filebuffer,p6,BUFFERSIZE);

Then your variable &quot;filebuffer&quot; (which is a special pointer to the handle of the file) gets overwritten before the handle is closed.

red:
So i kind of expected something like:
filebuffer = Open(&quot;b.raw&quot;,MODE_OLDFILE);
if (filebuffer==NULL)
{
  printf(&quot;nfilebuffer NULL&quot;)
}
else
{
  length5 = Read(filebuffer,p5,BUFFERSIZE);
  if close(filebuffer)
  {
    printf(&quot;nfile b.raw closed succesfully&quot;)
  }
  else
  {
    printf(&quot;nfile b.raw did not close properly, but we cannot use the filehandle anymore because it is not valid anymore&quot;)
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

you have to unload/free every used or not used but allocated channels/sounds.

For example something like this will loop around until last allocated channel.

For(chan_no=0;chan_no&lt;num_of_channels;chan_no++)
{
If(channel[chan_no]) free(channel[chan_no]);
}

Maybe If(channel[chan_no]!=NULL)

And just to makesure you can NULL every sound bank before exit.

High level ahi for sound playback - The idea is to create several iorequests and then when you want to play a sound you pick one that is free and then simply start CMD_WRITE to it with BeginIO() and then mark the iorequest as in use (ch-&gt;busy field in above code). What the SoundIO() function does is check for replies from ahi.device that some iorequest has finished and then simply marks them as not in use any more. If no iorequest is free the PlaySnd function simply interrupts the one that has been playing for longest with AbortIO()/WaitIO() and then reuses that one.

Low level for music playback 

&lt;pre&gt;
These steps will allow you to use low-level AHI functions:
- Create message port and AHIRequest with appropriate functions from exec.library.
- Open the device with OpenDevice() giving AHI_NO_UNIT as a unit.
- Get interface to the library with GetInterface() giving as the first parameter io_Device field of IORequest.

struct AHIIFace *IAHI;
struct Library *AHIBase;
struct AHIRequest *ahi_request;
struct MsgPort *mp;

if (mp = IExec-&gt;CreateMsgPort())
{   if (ahi_request = (struct AHIRequest *)IExec-&gt;CreateIORequest(mp, sizeof(struct AHIRequest)))
   {
      ahi_request-&gt;ahir_Version = 4;
      if (IExec-&gt;OpenDevice(&quot;ahi.device&quot;, AHI_NO_UNIT, (struct IORequest *)ahi_request, 0) == 0)
      {
         AHIBase = (struct Library *)ahi_request-&gt;ahir_Std.io_Device;
         if (IAHI = (struct AHIIFace *)IExec-&gt;GetInterface(AHIBase, &quot;main&quot;, 1, NULL))
         {
            // Interface got, we can now use AHI functions
            // ...
            // Once we are done we have to drop interface and free resources
            IExec-&gt;DropInterface((struct Interface *)IAHI);
         }
         IExec-&gt;CloseDevice((struct IORequest *)ahi_request);
      }
      IExec-&gt;DeleteIORequest((struct IORequest *)ahi_request);
   }
   IExec-&gt;DeleteMsgPort(mp);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
Once you get the AHI interface you can use its functions. To start playing sounds you need to allocate audio (optionally you can ask user for Audio mode and frequency). Then you need to Load samples to use with AHI. You do it with AHI_AllocAudio(), AHI_ControlAudio() and AHI_LoadSound().

struct AHIAudioCtrl *ahi_ctrl;

Master volume utility
	
Anyone can make such a relative simple utility. It's a matter of calling AHI_SetEffect() with a master volume struct. You can make a window with a slider and call said function easily.




You write to AHI device, and AHI will write to a sound card, the native hardware, or even to a file. These options are user-configurable. AHI also performs the software mixing duties so that more than one sound can be played simultaneously.

AHI provides four 'units' for audio. This makes it possible to have a program play on the native hardware, and another play on a sound card by attaching the appropriate AHI driver to a unit number. For the software developer, AHI provides two ways to play audio. One is the AUDIO: DOS device. AHI can create a volume called AUDIO: that works like an AmigaDOS volume. You can read and write data directly to it and it plays through the speakers. This is the easiest way to write PCM, but it's not the best. 

First of all, if a user takes the AUDIO: entry out of the mountlist, your program won't work and you get bombarded with stupid support questions like 'I've got AHI, why doesn't it work?'. The better option is to send IORequests to AHI. This allows you to control volume and balance settings while the program runs (with AUDIO: you set these when you open the file and you can't change them without closing and re-opening AUDIO:) and you can use a neat trick called double-buffering to improve efficiency. Double-buffering allows you to fill one audio buffer while another one is playing. This kind of asynchronous operation can prevent 'choppy' audio on slower systems.

We initialize AHI and then prepare and send AHI request to the ahi.device.

It's very important to calculate the number of bytes you want AHI to read from the buffer. You can cause a nasty crash indeed if it's incorrect! To do this, multiply the PCM count by the number of channels by the number of AHI buffers. 

A quick note about volume and position: AHI uses a fairly arcane datatype called Fixed. A Fixed number consists of 32 bits: a sign bit, a 15-bit integer part, and a 16-bit fractional part. When I construct the AHI request, I multiply this number by 0x00010000 to convert it to the fixed value. If I use this code as part of a DOS background process, I can change the volume and balance on the fly so the next sample that's queued will be played louder or quieter. It's also possible to interrupt AHI so the change takes effect immediately, but I won't go into that.

Once the request is sent, we put the requisite bits in to check for CTRL-C and any AHI interrupt messages. Then it's time to swap buffers around.

===Hooks===

Old idea which is best avoided if possible. The hook function should be used to play/control the sample(s). It is called at the frequency you initialized it with (in your case 100).

So in your 'normal' code you would flip a switch somewhere, telling the hookfunction to start playing a sample (or do with it whatever you want).

In the hookfunction you then start playing the sample and/or apply effects with the ahi ctrl function (and others).

One such example could be for instance be that module (as in well now .mod fileformat) data is being processed for each channel and apply effect etc.

In your case it would be a bit simpler as a mod player. you want to start playing a note and stop it at your will. For instance when a couonter reached a certain value.

The (probable) reason your number it not printing is because that routine is called _a lot_ every second 

The gist is that you have to find a mechanism (that suits your purpose the best) that uses your mouseclicks (or keyclicks) to 'feed' the player (hookfunct) and find something that 'tells' the player to do something else with the played sample (stopping it, applying an effect etc).

You can use the data property of the hookfunc to 'give' / push a structure to your 'replay' routine so that you can for example tell the player that a certain sample started being played. The player can then decide (if counter reached a value for example) to actually stop the sample from playing and setting/changing the status in that structure so that the main program knows the sample can be 'played'/triggered again.

[http://amigan.1emu.net/releases/AmiArcadia.lha AmiArcadia] also uses AHI and has c src and ScummVM AGA from AmiNet....all the source code is there. To create the AHI callback hook you'll also need to include the [http://sditools.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sditools/sditools/headers/ SDI header files]. 





==Reference==

Still to be edited and possibly redone...

You may need to supply AHI_MinPlayerFreq &amp; AHI_MaxPlayerFreq? 

AHIA_PlayerFreq (Fixed) - If non-zero, enables timing and specifies how many times per second PlayerFunc will be called. This must be specified if AHIA_PlayerFunc is! Do not use any extreme frequencies. The result of MixFreq/PlayerFreq must fit an UWORD, i.e. it must be less or equal to 65535. It is also suggested that you keep the result over 80. For normal use this should not be a problem. Note that the data type is Fixed, not integer. 50 Hz  is 50 16. 

Default is a reasonable value. Don't depend on it. 

AHIA_MinPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The minimum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq) you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's interrupt feature! 

AHIA_MaxPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The maximum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq) you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's interrupt feature!

I don't see anything in the documentation limiting the high-end frequency, just keep in mind that AHI has to be able to finish the callback function completely in time to be able to make it to the next callback. How big is your callback function?

AHI_GetAudioAttrs() should have TAG_DONE 

What is AHIR_DoMixFreq? 
remove AHIR_DoMixFreq tag from AHI_AllocAudio() call, I don't think it should be there. 

decode audio to a sample buffer and feed buffer to AHI using normal double buffering method from a subprocess. 
can AHI buffer the sound in a music interrupt, to play it later? How would I do what you suggest? 
never used library API, sorry. I always use CMD_WRITE to play the sound.
It does not work. Sooner than later io requests go out of sync due to task switching.

==Introduction==

Extending the AmigaGFX HIDD class so that I would only have to add the screen-modes that are not there already.  This brings up a few questions:  Is it practical or even possible to inherit from an existing HIDD that is already a child class of the Graphics.hidd class?  It's  possible,  however  perhaps not practical. No-one has ever tried this. AROS is a Research OS, so feel free to try. :) 

Would it be better or easier to write a new driver based on the AmigaGFX driver code? It would be better just to add support for new modes to existing Amiga  driver.  I  see  NatAMI  chipset to be a superset of AGA. Will more than one HIDD load in at once and still share resources? Is it true? Load  -  yes.  Share  resources  - yes if they are designed to do so. However it can be problematic. 
The reason I wanted to superclass the AmigaGFX driver was to avoid problems and make the driver more maintainable.  If it's problematic to extend one driver to implement another, I'll just have to modify the AmigaGFX HIDD. Sub-classing of bitmap HIDDs is already done in some cases. The VESA bitmap subclasses a generic chunky bitmap, and AFAIK the AmigaGFX bitmap subclasses the planar bitmap class. 

What does isCyberModeID() look for?  Does it mark the absence of a Copper or the presence of chunky pixels? Chunky pixelformat. How is it used? AROS itself doesn't use it. 

As I think about this, adding chunky support to the Indivision ECS or GraffitiGraphics/Indivision AGA 2.0 support would require a similar approach and will need the answers for those questions also.  I've already skimmed the documentation on WikiBooks and it looks like it might be possible but I'm still not sure.

There are no little-endian modes in the NatAmi so I know I can ditch those modes.  The R8G8B8 mode is stored as 3 byte-planes rather than a pure chunky 3-byte pixel width so I'm not quite sure what to do with that other than adding a HYBRID mode to the modes enum.  Most importantly, I need to know how to tell AROS what modes are supported by the hardware.  (I see a SUPPORTMASK value in natamirtg.h but don't know if that just communicates with the rest of the HIDD or if it is used to communicate more globally to CGFX.library.

I guess my main questions are these two:  Is there a better template for me to follow? 
UAEGFX may not be the best choice because it has ugly modeid remapping, mode list comes from UAE and all mode setup and blit functions call UAE native code. It is probably easier to examine simple driver like vga or vesa first which have &quot;normal&quot; mode generation code and does not have any &quot;hidden&quot; code. 

Mode id remapping can be always added later if you need AOS-like modeid range for compatibility with original AOS programs. 

Most importantly, I need to know how to tell AROS what modes are supported by the hardware. 

In the New method of your gfx class, you need to build a taglist of &quot;pix formats&quot; and &quot;syncs&quot; and then pass it to parent class. See AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveauclass.c, line 355

==Information==

one bitmap is a memory bitmap and another one is display driver's bitmap.

Currently drivers call DoSuperMethod in such case. I can imagine it could be optimized a little bit more (similar to the PutImage methods in ATI driver), where DMA engine is used if target bitmap is maintained by the driver.

Just  to  note:  in  this  case  a  memory  bitmap  might  have  some restrictions  on its layout (like alignment requirements). For example in  my  Windows  GDI  driver BlitColorExpansion() perfectly works with
real  planar  bitmaps  of  planarbm  class,  however in this case this bitmap  has  to  be  created using NewBitMap() method of display HIDD. This means that it has to be actually a friend of display bitmap (or a
friend of a friend of display bitmap...).

This  makes  us  to revisit meaning of bitmap friendship. Currently a bitmap inherits all characteristics (internal layout, pixelformat, and class)  of  the  friend  bitmap.  If  it  gets  another class (because
pixelformat  was  specified  explicitly),  the  friendship is actually broken.  In a new situation this would not mean that the friendship is totally  broken,  because NewBitMap() still may apply some adjustments
to the bitmap. They would just be some more distant friends...

However,  if the bitmap was created without friend specification, and it was created without explicit display mode specification, it will be a  pure  RAM-based bitmap. Gfx drivers will unlikely be able to handle
it in accelerated way (because alignment is wrong). So the question is -  how  safe  is  to implement such a mechanism? Wouldn't we end up in slow  graphics which is impossible to accelerate by design, because
half  of bitmaps will be created without any friendship specification.

What  are  chances  that a gfx driver will be able to accelerate blits from ARBITRARY formatted bitmap (without any forced alignment etc.)? 

In such case DoSuperMethod call is slow, but safe, since it will use GetPixel/PutPixel methods for the two drivers in order to transfer the bitmap in a safe way. Of course, this case could be also optimized a little bit more. 

So, cards actually can transfer data between each other by DMA?


Could fakegfxhidd (software mouse cursor) support ShowViewPorts() too? No need for composition/multiple ViewPorts, only need to get View information. 

Check  PrepareViewPorts. It's called always. BTW, it gets struct View* directly. You  can  remember  the information you gather in the first bitmap in viewports chain. This is what will be passed to Show. 
Implementing ShowViewPorts in fakegfx seems to be problematic because it badly coexists with framebuffer.
BTW,   you   can   also   implement  ShowViewPorts  which  does  some preparations and returns FALSE. 


What is the difference between a framebuffer driver and a mirrored driver? 
In  framebuffer  driver  there's  actually  only one on-screen bitmap which is constantly displayed, and Show  is  actually  emulated  by copying contents and replacing bitmap object. Mirroring  is  in  fact  avoidance of slow VRAM read. Mirrored driver does  not use VRAM for bitmap object, it uses a mirror buffer instead, updating VRAM when it is needed. 
Since  mirroring  driver  has a full copy of the displayed bitmap, it doesn't  need  Show  emulation.  Instead  it  just  attaches different mirrors to the VRAM. So the VESA and VGA drivers don't need to be marked as framebuffer drivers, since they use mirroring? Yes, they don't. Mirroring  drivers handle VRAM on their own, and they don't need Show emulation. Opening a framebuffer is just a waste of RAM for them. BTW,
my drivers return NULL in response on doing so. These   drivers   indicate   this  by  returning  TRUE  as  value  of aHidd_Gfx_NoFrameBuffer attribute. 

Trying to make the compositing class sharable between drivers too. There's  one  pro  in  this  approach. It's faster with mirrored    drivers,    because    you    can  compose  bitmaps  right into VRAM. 
So in the long term we might end up with a base compositing class and a series of subclasses to suit different driver types. BTW  perhaps  the same can be done with software sprite emulation. It would  be faster and less flickery to put its image directly into VRAM instead of backed copying by fakegfx. 
The VESA driver will now superimpose the cursor on a cursor-sized scratch bitmap with the right bit of background copied to it beforehand. I experimented with alpha blitting the cursor directly into VRAM, but it was too much hassle to support all colour depths that way because PutAlphaImage couldn't be used on the VRAM. 

Also, as GMA does it, driver can detect in ShowViewPorts if only topmost screen is visible, and deactivate mirroring, so that every blit is not duplicated. Unfortunately, no. Mirroring  is not just a way to do composition. Its primary aim is to avoid slow VRAM reading. If you get around it and just place the bitmap  in VRAM (framebuffer approach), it will work very slowly. This is why mirroring is done in VGA and VESA. 




==Overlays==

CreateVLayerHandleTagList() and DeleteVLayerHandle() are two  methods  are  added to graphics driver class and some attributes developed  for  an  overlay  class.  Currently there's no overlay base class since i don't see what to put there.

It is really necessary for Intuitions to have knowledge of physical displays. In  future  when  i  implement  the  whole  class  it will be able to maintain  information  about  their relative placement in the physical space.   This  is  needed  in  order  to  handle  multi-display  input correctly.

The  rest  is  a  reimplementation  of  MorphOS API. I decided not to reinvent  a  wheel  once more, and use already existing API instead. I want to maintain compatibility between extensions.

So far we had clean layers: Intuition works on top of Graphics, Graphics works on top of Graphics HIDD. Now, we introduce a wiring between Intuition and Graphics HIDD for Monitor class to read HIDD information.
Intuition already uses direct HIDD access - in pointerclass, where it attaches palette to a sprite bitmap. 
Yes,  and  what  is  really bad in it? Even a common application may query HIDD information if it wants to.

Monitorclass is a part of BOOPSI and BOOPSI is a part of Intuition itself.
The  code itself could be moved to graphics.library, however it would still need Intuition in order to call MakeClass(). 

Some  people here are against adding more and more private functions. Our  graphics.library already has 7
private  functions  for  CGX  operation,  and  one  more AROS-specific AddDisplayDriverA(). It's already enough i believe. In fact i do exactly what was suggested - to move AROS-specific functionality  to some new AROS-specific module. In this case this module already exists - it's a graphics.hidd. Components running on top of it may directly talk to it when needed.

To  tell  the  truth  i  dislike  only  one  fact  -  that i declared AddDisplayDriverA()   public   at   all.  I  should  have  implemented monitorclass  from  the  beginning,  and  Intuition would call private
AddDisplayDriverA()  upon  monitorclass object creation. Well, done is done. I won't rewrite the whole stuff. AddDisplayDriverA()   will  create  monitorclass  objects  now,  upon successful driver installation.
But isn't AddDisplayDriverA a graphics.library functions? This means that a module that provides functionality (graphics.library) will now be dependant on module that consumes functionality (intuition.library). It's like having browser dependant on network stack and at the same time network stack dependant on browser. After this change will it even be possible to have graphics.library running without intuition? Again I think this is an argument for considering separating the monitor class into another module. MorphOS might have put it in Intuition but we don't have to - we might preserve the interface but have it implemented in more suitable form.

Yes, in one point. However i would not call this strict dependancy. AddDisplayDriverA() may do the following at its end:
&lt;pre&gt;
if (!IntuitionBase)
     IntuitionBase = OpenLibrary(&quot;intuition.library&quot;, 50);
if (!IntuitionBase)
     return ret;

mon = NewObjectA(NULL, &quot;monitorclass&quot;, tags);
&lt;/pre&gt;
graphics.library   this   way  consumes  no  functionality  from  the intuition.library.  It  just  provides some information for it (tells about new displays).

A  similar  code  is  already  present in sync class of graphics.hidd where   it   manually   opens  graphics.library,  creates  MonitorSpec structure and adds it to MonitorList.

graphics.hidd  does  not  have RastPort structure, this means that it doesn't work with Layers. This means - no windows and screens. In theory it's possible to use HIDDs for drawing ONLY on some kind of
simple  embedded  system which  doesn't run multiple applications and doesn't  need windowing. It would be similar to manual construction of ViewPort  and View on AmigaOS (which would also work on AROS).

Not sure if you want to include this in your tectbook, but it is worth mentioning.&quot;

The &quot;money&quot; in the system you propose looks like labour credits rather than &quot;money&quot; as we know it today. Thus, I would say that Participatory Economics counts as a moneyless system so, please, add something to the book :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Whether or Not Operator ==

=== u ===

The little word ''u'' means ''x whether or not y'' and links together predicates.

==== Examples ====

* mi godzi u brecea - I go, whether or not I am ready
* da bakso u redro - it is a box, whether or not it is red
* ti bukcu u ponsu ti - it is a book, whether or not I own it

=== cu, ku and icu===

We can use the little word ''cu'' to link together arguments and so does ''ku''. However, ''ku'' works as a forethought operator and works with ''ki''. The little word ''icu'' links sentences. 

==== Examples ====

cu

* mi godzi le hasfa ''cu'' vemsia - I go to the house, whether or not I go to the shop
* le katmu ''cu'' kangu gu fundi le ficlu - The cat, whether or not the dog, likes the fish

ku

* mi godzi le ku hasfa ki vemsia - I go to the house, whether or not I go to the shop
* tu fleti la Romas cu Pari's - you fly to Rome, whether or not you fly to Paris

icu

* tu vrelaa icu mi vrecoa - you are tall, whether or not I am short

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Aldrin A. Mirambel, an Information Technology student of [http://www/cit.edu.ph[Cebu Institute of Technology]]. I am fun of programming using different languages such as Php, Java, CSS, VB and other related Programming languages. With my degree, I am very much sure that I can design a software that can run without multiple errors.

What I am fun of is much on [http://philsexamresult.blogspot.com/p/webthesurfi-rugs-webdesign.html[web designing]]. This is really what I am fun of and for me this work is much interesting than to design a stand alone software. Because for me, being stand alone is not visible to everyone who is surfing the web so meaning your project or your software will just be in your place and not worldwide. I hope you get my point and understand what I am trying to say.

There are many tutorials in [http://philsexamresult.blogspot.com/p/webthesurfi-rugs-webdesign.html[web designing]] and one of my favorite site is the [http://www.w3schools.com[www.w3schools.com]], where you can find all the tutorials of the different languages.

I have made my own site for another approach of web designing and I hope that this would really help you in creating webpages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Listing files and directories==
'''ls''' (list)

When you login you are in your home directory. This directory is associated with your userid, for example, ccaajim, and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are stored.

To find out what is in a directory you can type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls&lt;/pre&gt;

The ''ls'' command lists the contents of your current working directory.  &lt;!-- On WTS this is the same as your R drive.

You should find the file science.txt in your home directory.  Use the ls command to locate it.--&gt;

[[Image:socratesls1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A file listing in a Socrates shell at UCL]]


There may be no files visible in your home directory, in which case you will return to the Unix prompt but some files will usually have been created by the System Administrator when your account was created.

''ls'' does not list quite all the files in your home directory but only those ones whose name does not begin with a dot (.) Files beginning with a dot are hidden files and usually contain important program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change them unless you are very familiar with Unix.
{{clear}}
To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin with a dot, type&lt;pre&gt;% ls -a&lt;/pre&gt;


[[Image:socratesls2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A listing from ls-l in a Socrates shell at UCL.]]


As you can see, ''ls -a'' lists files that are normally hidden.

ls can take options, for example ''-a'' is an example of an option. Options change the behaviour of commands.  Test the output of ''ls -l'' and of ''ls -la''.

Another very useful option is ''-t'' which displays the directory contents newest first by timestamp.

=='''mkdir''' (make directory)==

You can make a subdirectory of your home directory for your own data files. To make a subdirectory called mytraining in your current working directory type

 &lt;pre&gt;% mkdir mytraining &lt;/pre&gt;

To see the directory you have just created, type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also make a hidden directory if you want to.  Use a dot as the first character of the directory name for it to be hidden.

===Creating down a path===
Surprisingly often you want to create a directory but not directly at your &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; position in the directory tree.  Suppose I am in my home directory and I want to create directories to hold some files for two courses but in

&lt;pre&gt;~/documents/2010/IT/training/Unix/&lt;/pre&gt;

The first course is an introduction to Linux, second an introduction to Solaris.  I can create these directories like this:

 &lt;pre&gt;% mkdir ~/documents/2010/IT/training/Unix/Linux&lt;/pre&gt;

and

&lt;pre&gt;% mkdir ~/documents/2010/IT/training/Unix/Solaris&lt;/pre&gt;

Naturally, you don't have to specify the complete path from ~, but I have done so here for clarity.

===Creating a whole path===
'''mkdir -p'''

Perhaps less often you want to create not a single directory but rather a directory subtree - that is a directory and directories beneath it.  Suppose I am in my home directory and I want to create directories to hold some files for two courses: &lt;em&gt;Redhat for Beginners&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Advanced Redhat&lt;/em&gt;.  We can do this with the '''-p''' option on the '''mkdir''' command.

Here is the command to create the first directory:

&lt;pre&gt;% mkdir -p ~/documents/2010/IT/training/Unix/Linux/Redhat/beginners/&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates the two directories we require in one go.  We can then issue the command

&lt;pre&gt;% mkdir ~/documents/2010/IT/training/Unix/Linux/Redhat/advanced&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice the difference between these two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Changing to different directories=
=='''cd''' (change directory)==

The command ''cd somedirectory'' means change the current working directory to somedirectory. The current working directory is the directory that you are currently working in and you can check where it is with ''pwd''.  Having changed directory and checked where you are you can also of course list its contents with ''ls''.

Type the following series checking after each one with the command pwd to find out where you are:
&lt;pre&gt;
% cd mytraining
% mkdir archive
% cd ~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reflect for a moment and see if you can explain what you just did.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The abbreviated directories . and ..==
The directories named . and .. are '''relative''' names.  They are interpreted by the shell '''in the current context'''.  While this takes a moment or two longer to grasp than ordinary ''absolute'' directory names, it is a very useful thing about Unix.
In any directory you can type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls -a&lt;/pre&gt;

As you will see, there are two  directories listed called (.) and (..).  These appear in all Unix directories.

===Current directory (.)===

In Unix .  means the current directory, so typing

&lt;pre&gt;% cd .&lt;/pre&gt;

means that you ''stay where you are''.

This may not seem very useful at first, but you will often find it very useful – remember that it is a ''relative'' directory name.

===Parent directory (..)===

.. means the parent of the current directory, so typing

&lt;pre&gt;% cd ..&lt;/pre&gt;

will take you up one directory.
===Home directory (~)===
Typing ''cd'' alone or ''cd ~'' always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system.   Typing ''cd /'' takes you to the root.

What do you think

&lt;pre&gt;% ls ~/..&lt;/pre&gt;

would list?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Pathnames=
==''pwd'' (print working directory)==

Pathnames tell you where you are in the whole file-system. So, to find out the pathname to your home-directory, type cd ~ to get back to your home and then

&lt;pre&gt;% pwd&lt;/pre&gt;

The full pathname looks something like this -

/home/nfs/fs-i/UM0098/ccaajim

which means that ccaajim (your home directory) is in the sub-directory UM0098 (the group directory),which in turn is located in the fs-i sub-directory, which is in the nfs sub-directory, which is in the top-level root directory, called / (pronounced root)  .

==Home directories and pathnames==
===Understanding pathnames===

In some Unix systems (including socrates on WTS) you will find it necessary to prefix pathnames with ~ if you want to ensure that they start from your home directory rather than the current directory or the root.

First use cd to get back to your home-directory, then type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls mytraining&lt;/pre&gt;

to list the contents of your mytraining directory.

Now type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls archive&lt;/pre&gt;

You will get a message like this -

archive: No such file or directory

The reason is that archive is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) that is not in the current working directory, you must either cd to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your archive directory you must type

&lt;pre&gt;% ls mytraining/archive&lt;/pre&gt;

Since here the path is quite straightforward and relatively easy to type, using the full pathname will work reasonably well.  It might be however, that the path is not so straightforward and then you will find the ~ abbreviation useful.

===~ (your home directory)===

Your home directory can also be referred to by the tilde ~ character. It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing

&lt;pre&gt;% ls ~/mytraining&lt;/pre&gt;

will list the contents of your mytraining directory, no matter where you currently are in the file system.

What do you think

&lt;pre&gt;% ls ~&lt;/pre&gt;

would list?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;SRS alone comparable to WBRT + SRS, in active extracranial disease. Unclear if WBRT needed in controlled extracranial disease; retrospective evidence suggests worse outcome without it&quot;

First sentence in error?  My correction would be &quot;WBRT alone comparable to WBRT + SRS, in active extracranial disease (or poor performance status)&quot; or SRS alone comparable to WBRT + SRS in controlled disease (with good performance status)&quot; but I believe the second part of the sentence addresses this latter point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to transform an XML document with XQuery using an ant task.

== Method ==
We will use the Saxon library to demonstrate this.

Steps:
# Download the Saxon library from [http://saxon.sourceforge.net Sourceforge]
# Download a sample XQuery from the samples (for example tour.xq from the samples area)
# Copy the Saxon jar file into your project.  In the example below just a single jar file is copied into the location '''saxonhe9-2-0-6j/saxon9he.jar'''

=== Sample Ant Target ===

This sample uses the java task to run an XQuery program using the Saxon Java library. In the example below
the XQuery tour.xq is executed and the output is copied into the file output.html.

Note that the starting point is set by passing the arg as a parameter to the XQuery.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;run-saxon-xquery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;java classname=&quot;net.sf.saxon.Query&quot; output=&quot;output.html&quot;&gt;
             &lt;arg value=&quot;tour.xq&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;classpath&gt;
                &lt;pathelement location=&quot;saxonhe9-2-0-6j/saxon9he.jar&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/classpath&gt;
             &lt;arg value=&quot;start=e5&quot;/&gt; 	
     &lt;/java&gt;
    &lt;!-- On Windows, this will open FireFox after the Transform is done --&gt;
    &lt;exec command=&quot;C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
    	C:\ws\Saxon-Test\output.html&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create high-quality documentation of your XQuery functions and modules.

== Method ==
[http://xqdoc.org/ xqDoc] is a standard for formatting comments in XQuery modules. The eXist system comes with a XQuery module which parses XQuery modules containing comments in this format and generates XML in the xqDoc [http://xqdoc.org/xqdoc-1.0.xsd XML format]. This XML can then be transformed into other formats such as HTML, PDF, DocBook or ePub.

== Generating the XML ==
You can automatically generate an XML file from an XQuery module using the following syntax:

  let $my-doc := xqdm:scan(xs:anyURI('xmldb:exist:///db/my-modules/my-module.xqm'))

Note that the string must be converted to a data type of anyURI.

== Sample Output ==

=== Sample XQuery script ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

== Known Problems ==
The parser for the XQuery doc is slightly different than the standard XQuery parser for eXist.  In some cases an XQuery that works with eXist will fail under the XQDocs parser.

* old-style variable declarations are still supported in eXist but not by the xqDoc parser
For example the following variable declaration:

   declare variable $foo:bar { 'Hello World' };

is valid in eXist XQuery but this syntax is not valid in xqDoc which only supports the XQuery standard declaration e.g. 

  declare variable $foo:bar := 'Hello World';
* comments must be valid XML text.  This is more restrictive than in XQuery.  For example &lt; and &amp; must be expressed as &amp;amp;lt; and &amp;amp;amp;

==Introduction==

&lt;nowiki&gt;
      Many students find mathematics to be difficult, but can you imagine having the additional stress of not having the ability to hear, see, or experience the material as everyone else does. There are many assistive technologies available to students today to make learning easier. The following types of technologies include a variety of accommodations to help service special needs students in a mathematics classroom. Many of the activities that take place in a mathematics classroom include computing mathematical problems, reading and interpreting word problems, and sharing what is learned while interacting in the classroom.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=Computation in Mathematics=

'''Calculators:'''
Low vision calculators have been designed that enable individuals suffering from vision problems the luxury of these useful tools. For individuals with very poor eyesight or even blindness, talking calculators make computing fun and achievable. There are basic, scientific and graphing calculators available. MAC OSX has the ability to turn on the talking calculator and also print calculations. This can then be used as the student “showing their work” for a specific problem.

'''Electronic Worksheets:'''
Students with visual impairments are at a disadvantage when most of the work completed in a secondary mathematics setting involves practice problems from the textbook or worksheets. Electronic math worksheets are software programs that can help a user organize, align, and work through math problems on a computer screen. Numbers that appear onscreen can also be read aloud via a speech synthesizer. This may be helpful to people who have trouble aligning math problems with pencil and paper.&lt;ref&gt;Stanberry, K. &amp; Raskind, M. (2009).Great Schools. Assistive technology tools: Math. Retrieved March 2, 2010. http://www.greatschools.org/LD/assistive-technology/math-tools.gs?content=949&lt;/ref&gt;

''MathPad (IntelliTools)''
MathPad enables students to do arithmetic directly on the computer. The program is ideal for students who need help organizing or navigating through math problems or who have difficulty doing math with pencil or paper. This program is designed to be a &quot;word processor for math.&quot; In addition to providing an accessible writing structure, this program incorporates speech output and adjustable font size. (Mac &amp; Windows) &lt;ref&gt;ATTO: Assistive Technology Training Online Project (2005). Students with low vision: Math and computers. Retrieved March 4, 2010. http://atto.buffalo.edu/registered/ATBasics/Populations/LowVision/math.php&lt;/ref&gt;
MathPad is beneficial to students who have difficulty working with paper and pencil due to poor fine motor skills, who need speech output, who have difficulty setting up problems, who require immediate feedback or who are motivated and engaged in academic tasks when using the computer(Dell, Newton &amp; Petroff, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J. (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom. 1st ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Math Pad Plus (IntelliTools)''
Students can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using fractions and decimals. Teachers can enter problems from worksheets or textbooks so students with learning disabilities can work on the same problems as their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Cambrium Learning Group: Intellitools. (2005). MathPad and MathPad Plus. Retrieved March 6, 2010. http://store.cambiumlearning.com/ProgramPage.aspx?parentId=074003433&amp;functionID=009000008&amp;pID=&amp;site=itc&lt;/ref&gt;
Students have the option of viewing problems represented as pie charts, fraction bars, or decimal grids; these representations can increase the students’ understanding, especially those who are visual learners (Dell, Newton &amp; Petroff, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt;

=Writing in Mathematics=
Today, an extensive amount of writing takes place in a mathematics classroom. Students are expected to work out a problem and explain how they arrived at the answer. Math dictionaries and graphic organizers can help students to organize their thoughts to help share how they arrived at an answer. Note-taking is also an expectation in secondary courses. Paper-based computer pens can help with this requirement.

'''Math Dictionaries'''
These dictionaries can be downloaded with content specific material such as Algebra, Geometry and measurement. Other dictionaries are available to support other curricular areas as well.

'''Graphic Organizers'''
Graphic Organizers can help students organize their thoughts and ideas before starting to write. Programs such as Inspiration and Kidspiration are just two examples that students can use to help with the writing process. 

'''Paper-Based Computer Pen''' 
Students can use paper-based computer pens to record the teacher and the notes taken during class. A student can refer back to any point in the lesson and match the text with the recording. Students can also slow down and speed up recordings to review material.

'''Virtual Pencil Arithmetic (Henter Math)'''
This is a software tool for students who are unable to operate a pencil effectively. The software does the job of the pencil. It moves to the right spot on the &quot;paper&quot;, guided by the user, and inputs the answers that the user selects. It can edit numbers and variables, insert fractions or square roots or other structures, and copy whole equations or expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Henter Math. (2005).Virtual Pencil: Making math accessible. Retrieved March 2, 2010. http://www.virtualpencil.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
The extensive speech feedback reads problems and provides enough information so students who cannot see the problems can understand the position of digits and can navigate to where they need to be (Dell, Newton &amp; Petroff, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt; Virtual Pencil Algebra is also available to help solve algebraic expressions.

=Interacting with Mathematics=

'''Handheld/Virtual manipulatives'''
Special education students are usually visual learners. Manipulatives are, therefore, an excellent tool for them. When students work with manipulatives, they are using their visual and tactile skills to enhance their learning experience. They not only make learning easier, but can also make learning enjoyable. 

'''Interactive White Boards'''
Interactive whiteboards are designed to engage a wide variety of students in the learning process. They provide teachers with multiple ways to represent information using interactive text, images, sound and video files, and while engaging a broad range of learners. Students can use the same features of the product to demonstrate their understanding of a topic.&lt;ref&gt;SMART Technologies. (2009). Creating Classrooms for Everyone. Retrieved online March 1, 2010. http://www2.smarttech.com/NR/rdonlyres/BAEE09C6-0871-46BE-AE23-70A787F184E0/0/InteractivewhiteboardsanduniversaldesignforlearningJan20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of interactive white boards in the classroom are Smart Boards and Promethean Boards.

The Activ tools by Promethean that can be used to accommodate students with special needs include:
======-Handwriting recognition tool (changes handwriting to text)======
======- Flipchart Recorder (records lesson to provides students with playback)======
======-Highlighter tool (helps students to focus on key points)======
======-On-screen calculator and Zoom Feature======
======-Reusable Math manipulatives (includes protractor, ruler, compass, graph paper and number lines) &lt;ref&gt;Promethean. (2009). The Activclassroom as an assistive technology device. Retrieved March 2, 2010. http://www.prometheanworld.com/upload/pdf/Acommodations_Tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;======

Activwand is a 21-inch wand that helps young students, students in wheelchairs, and students with poor coordination reach the Activboard.The Activwand complements Promethean's Activpen as another means to interact with the Promethean Activboard. Since the 21&amp;nbsp;inch Activwand makes it easier for special needs students and primary learners to reach and touch the Activboard interactive whiteboard, it enhances pupil engagement with the lesson and develops motor skills.&lt;ref&gt;PR Newswire. (2006). Promethean releases assistive technology-pointing device. Retrieved March 5, 2010. http://www.sys-con.com/node/243841&lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=

There are many assistive technologies available for students who may have special needs in the classroom. Teachers and parents need to be aware aware of what is available. Training for staff and students may be necessary, but all students can be successful in a mathematics classroom.

== [[YouTube &amp; TeacherTube]] ==

Is this a book or a module in one (such as [[‎Assistive Technology in Education]])? Furthermore, please keep in mind that encyclopaedic content belongs at Wikipedia and is outside [[WB:WIW|the scope]] of English Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:06, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

: This is a graduate project. It is a book in one (User-generated video content)--[[User:KCurry11|KCurry11]] ([[User talk:KCurry11|talk]])

:: Could you please explain that a bit better? Will this content be hosted on YouTube and TeacherTube? Then what is the purpose of the wikibook? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:07, 28 February 2010 (UTC)


:Sure, here are our requirements and the purpose for our project. This will not be hosted on YouTube or Teachertube. 

How to build a Wikibook page

There are six tasks involved in developing your Wikibook page in roughly the following order:

   1. Research your topic, including citations, APA references, possible quotations, and external Web links.
   2. Write your content in a neutral, encyclopedia-like tone for an audience of teachers, parents, education students, and other interested adults. It should have neither a formal academic tone, nor an informal, first-person perspective.
   3. Format your content with appropriate main headings, subheadings, tables, and reference list. You’ll use Wikibook markup tags for most of your formatting. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education for directions and examples of how to format your page. (Speed bump alert! If you haven’t done this before, expect a short, but steep, learning curve. Use the example site above as a model to learn what you need.)
   4. Link your references and external links using appropriate formatting and markup tags. We’ll modify the normal APA citation and reference guidelines to take advantage of both APA style and Wikibook active links. The wikitext formatting page above gives good examples. The following page has excellent examples of how to handle a variety of references (you only need a few references and/or external links): http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Assistive_Technology_in_Education/Life_Skills.
   5. Locate supporting images (one-to-three images) that may be freely used according to the Wikibook licensing requirement: Creative Commons Attribution, Share-Alike 3.0. You may want to select images from Wikipedia because they have already passed the approval process. Or select images from the nearly five million free-to-use images at http://everystockphoto.com.
   6. Upload your image(s) to Wikibooks, enter licensing information, and format the display of your image(s) within your page. The upload file link appears toward the bottom of the left sidebar only when you are logged in.

There are two more tasks to complete this assignment. You’ll enter two kinds of information on the Discussion page (also called the Talk page):

   1. You and your partner will enter a sentence or two detailing each of your specific contributions on your own Discussion page (also called the Talk page). This allows the instructor to properly assign individual credit for the project. You may identify yourselves by initials or first names if you prefer not to use your full name.
   2. You will read and comment briefly on two other pages in our class Wikibook. Again, make sure you identify yourself to your colleagues (name or initials). --[[User:KCurry11|KCurry11]] ([[User talk:KCurry11|talk]]) 07:06, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:: Thanks for your reply. I'm still not sure as to ''what'' this book is supposed to be about. It still reads a bit like an encyclopaedia article on these two resources. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:20, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

: Hey Swift, Sorry for the mistake. My professor helped me out now and I deleted my page. --[[User:KCurry11|KCurry11]] ([[User talk:KCurry11|talk]])

:: No, only administrators can delete pages. The page (and all previous revisions) still exist. See the welcome message above for instructions on how to request to have a page deleted.
:: The module currently exists in two versions and I've put merge tags on these. You need to merge them and then have their edit histories merged. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:32, 2 March 2010 (UTC)


: My contributions to this page include the History of YouTube/Teachertube, Features, and Educational Value. I've requested that the previous page be deleted. --[[User:KCurry11|KCurry11]] ([[User talk:KCurry11|talk]])

==[[YouTube &amp; TeacherTube]]==
{{mbox|type=notice|msg=
Thank you for your interest in Wikibooks, but [[YouTube &amp; TeacherTube|this page]] appears as though it may have been created in error (such as due to a test or a misplaced edit). Should it be a legitimate [[WB:WIW|legitimate Wikibooks module]], please use [[{{TALKPAGENAME:YouTube &amp; TeacherTube}}|the discussion page]] to explain its scope. If these concerns are not responded to, the page will automatically be considered a candidate for [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] in 7 days. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:09, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

= Overview =
In the context of application development, Unicode with UTF-8 encoding is the best 
way to support multiple languages in your application.  Multiple languages can even be supported on the same web page.

Unicode (usually in UTF-8 form) is replacing ASCII and the use of 8-bit &quot;code pages&quot; such as ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252.

See also [http://www.perl.com/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-standard-preamble.html Perl Unicode Cookbook] - 44 recipes for working with Unicode in Perl 5.

== Unicode ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode] is a standard that specifies all 
of the characters for most of the world's writing systems.  Each character is
assigned a unique ''codepoint'', such as U+0030.
The first 256 code points are the same as
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859 ISO-8859-1]
to make it trivial to convert existing Western/Latin-1 text.

To view [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_characters#Character_properties properties] for a particular codepoint:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
use Unicode::UCD 'charinfo';
use Data::Dumper;
print Dumper(charinfo(0x263a));  # U+263a
&lt;/source&gt;

If you view the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Unicode/Character_reference/0000-0FFF Unicode character reference], you will notice that not every codepoint has an assigned character.  Also, because of backward compatibility with legacy encodings, some characters have multiple codepoints.

== UTF-8 ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 UTF-8] is a specific ''encoding'' of Unicode — the 
most popular encoding. Other encodings include UTF-7, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.
You will probably want to use UTF-8, if you decide to use Unicode.

An encoding defines how each Unicode codepoint maps to bits and bytes.  In UTF-8 encoding, the first 128 Unicode codepoints use one byte.  These byte values are the same as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII US-ASCII], making UTF-8 encoding and ASCII encoding interchangeable if only ASCII characters are used.  The next 1,920 codepoints use 2-byte encoding in UTF-8.  Three or four bytes are needed to encode the remaining codepoints.

Note that although Unicode codepoints 128-255 are the same as ISO-8859-1, UTF-8 encodes each of these codepoints differently.  UTF-8 uses two bytes to encode each of these codepoints, whereas ISO-8859-1 only uses one byte for each character in that range.  Therefore, ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 are not interchangeable.  (If only ASCII characters are used, then they are all interchangeable, since ASCII, ISO-8859-1, and UTF-8 all share the same encoding for the first 128 Unicode codepoints.)

So, to reiterate, with UTF-8, not all characters are encoded into a single byte (unlike ASCII and ISO-8859-1).
Think about that for a moment: how might that affect editors (like vim or emacs), web pages and forms, 
databases, Perl itself, Perl IO, your Perl source code (if you want to include a
character with a multi-byte encoding)?  How might that affect passing strings around, if the strings contain characters with multi-byte encodings?  Do regular expressions still work?

{| border=1
  |+ '''Character Encoding Comparison'''
|-
  ! Character Encoding !! # characters !! 128 US-ASCII characters !! Next 128 characters !! Remaining Characters
|-
  | US-ASCII || 128|| 1 byte || N/A || N/A
|-
  | ISO-8859-1 || 256 || 1 byte || '''1 byte''' || N/A
|-
  | UTF-8 || &gt; 100,000 || 1 byte || '''2 bytes''' || 2 - 4 bytes
|}

As you can see from the table above, codepoints 128-255 (0x80-0xff) are where you need to be careful.  
[[#ISO-8859-1_vs_Windows-1252 | Later]], you will find out that codepoints 128-159 (0x80-0x9F) are even trickier, due to the fact that the popular Windows-1252 character set (another one-byte-per-character encoding) is incompatible with ISO-8859-1 in this range.

= How much does UTF-8 &quot;cost&quot;? =
* some functions are [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlunicode#Speed slower] with UTF-8 encoded strings in Perl
* you have to write some additional Perl code to ensure that data coming into Perl is decoded properly, and that data going out of Perl is encoded properly — but you have to do this anytime you use a character set other than the native 8-bit character set of the platform (which we'll now refer to as ''N8CS''{{ref|N8CS}}), which is often ISO-8859-1/Latin-1
* you have to interact with your database appropriately -- is it using UTF-8?
* you have to ensure your web pages specify that pages are encoded in UTF-8
* you may need to make a web server adjustment (if it is configured to always serve some particular character set, which is not UTF-8)

= How do I use UTF-8? =
The &quot;best practice&quot; approach is to use UTF-8 everywhere, if possible.  This includes web pages and hence web forms, databases, HTML templates, and strings stored internally in Perl.
One exception might be your Perl source code itself.  If N8CS is sufficient (i.e., if you don't need any UTF-8 characters or strings in your source code), your source code does not have to be encoded as UTF-8.  (Okay, another exception might be your HTML templates.  If your templates only require/contain N8CS, they do not have to be encoded as UTF-8 either.)

To properly use UTF-8 in a Perl web application, here is a summary of what must be done:
* All text (non-binary) data/octets coming into Perl (hence form data, database data, file reading, HTML templates, etc.)  must be properly decoded.  If the incoming text/octets are UTF-8 encoded, they must be UTF-8 decoded.  If they are N8CS (usually ISO-8859-1) encoded, they should be N8CS decoded.  If they are encoded with some other character set, they must be decoded with that character set.
* All text data going out of Perl (hence to the browser, database, files, etc.) must be properly encoded (into an octet stream).  STDOUT (which goes to the browser) must be UTF-8 encoded.
* the browser needs to be told that web pages are UTF-8 encoded via an HTTP header and a &lt;meta&gt; tag

Do not use Perl versions prior to 5.8.1.  Although support for UTF-8 began with v5.6.0, regular expressions do not work even in the next release, v5.6.1.  v5.8.1 added some [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlunicode#Speed speed improvements].
By Perl 5.14, Unicode support is for the most part clean and smooth.

Before we start getting into the finer details about how to use UTF-8, we need to first define some terms, and then talk a bit about Perl's dual personality when it comes internally storing text.

== Terminology ==
A ''character'' is a logical entity.  Characters must be encoded (using a character set) in order to be used, stored, written, exchanged between programs, etc.   Encoding turns a logic character into something we can use in a program.  Depending on which character set is used for encoding,  a single character may be require one or more bytes to represent it.

We'll use the term ''octets'' when referring to data passing into or out of a Perl program.  An octet is a byte, 8 bits.  Encoded characters make up an octet ''stream''.  When an octet stream comes into Perl, the bytes should be decoded (using the correct character set -- the character set they were encoded with) so that Perl can determine which logical characters are contained in the encoded octet stream.  Perl can then store these as ''strings'' -- a sequence of characters.

Binary data also comes in as an octet stream.  It should not be decoded using a character set, because it likely either doesn't contain any characters, or it contains information in addition to characters, and hence cannot be decoded with a character set.

== Perl strings/text ==
Internally, Perl stores each string in one of the following encodings: 
* native encoding — byte encoding.  It uses N8CS{{ref|N8CS}}.  This is a one-byte-per-character encoding, and hence a maximum of only 255 characters can be encoded.  This is the default encoding for all incoming text/octets if Perl is not instructed to decode (bad idea).  Strings using this encoding are called ''byte strings'' or ''binary strings''.  Unless you tell it otherwise, Perl will consider these bytes to be in ISO-8859-1, ''not'' in your platform encoding. This is a common bug.
* UTF-8 encoding — character encoding.  It uses (obviously) UTF-8.  Strings using this encoding are called ''character strings'' or ''text strings'' or ''Unicode strings''.

When creating your own strings, Perl uses N8CS when possible (for backwards compatibility and efficiency reasons).  However, if a character can not be represented in N8CS, UTF-8 is used.  In other words, if all code points in a string are are &lt;= 0xFF, N8CS is used, otherwise UTF-8 is used.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
$native_string = &quot;\xf1&quot;;
$native_string = &quot;\x{00f1}&quot;;    # still N8CS, since &lt;= 0xff
$native_string = chr(0xf1);     # still N8CS, since &lt;= 0xff
$utf8_string = &quot;\x{0100}&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can convert an N8CS string to a UTF-8 string using &lt;tt&gt;utf8::upgrade()&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
$my_string = &quot;\xf1&quot;;          # N8CS byte string (one byte is used internally to encode)
utf8::upgrade($my_string);    # UTF-8 character string now (two bytes are used internally to encode)
&lt;/source&gt;

Your program can have a mix of strings in both of Perl's internal formats.  Perl uses a &quot;UTF8 flag&quot; to keep track of which encoding a string is internally using.  Thankfully, the format/flag follows the string.  Perl keeps a string in N8CS as long as possible.  However, when a N8CS/native string is used together with a UTF-8 string, the native string is silently implicitly decoded using N8CS, and ''upgraded'' (encoded) to UTF-8.  In other words, the native byte string gets decoded with the native character set, and then it gets internally encoded into UTF-8.  The resulting character string will have the UTF8 flag set.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
$my_string = 'a';          # N8CS byte string
$my_string .= &quot;\x{0100}&quot;;  # UTF-8 character string now
&lt;/source&gt;

Normally, you should not need to know about how Perl is internally storing/encoding text.  An exception to this rule is if you have a natively encoded string with bytes in the 0x80-0xFF range — in other words, a natively encoded string with non-ASCII characters.  In this case, some string operations may not work as expected — see [[#Perl_5_.22Unicode_Bug.22|Perl 5 &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;]].  Normally, you should upgrade these N8CS byte strings to UTF-8 character strings using &lt;tt&gt;utf8::upgrade()&lt;/tt&gt;.  String operations will then work as expected, although sometimes slower.  Starting with the 5.14 release, you can completely banish the Unicode bug by saying &lt;tt&gt;use 5.012&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

== UTF-8 Flow ==
Any Perl IO needs to correctly handle decoding and encoding of strings/text.  Since there are multiple character encodings in use in the world, Perl can't correctly guess which character encoding was used to encode some particular incoming text/octets, nor can it know which character encoding you want to use for outgoing text/octets.  An incoming stream of UTF-8 octets is not the same as, say,  an incoming stream of Windows-1252 octets.  For example, Unicode character U+201c (left double quotation mark) is encoded in one byte in Windows-1252 (0x93), but UTF-8 encodes it using three octets (0xE2 0x80 0x9C). If you want Perl to interpret your incoming text/octets correctly, you must tell Perl which character set was used to encode them, so they can be decoded properly.

The typical flow of UTF-8 text/octets in to and out of a Perl program is as follows:
# Receive an external UTF-8 encoded text/octet stream and correctly decode it — i.e., tell Perl which character set the octets are encoded in (in this case, the encoding is UTF-8).  Perl may check for malformed data (bad encoding) while decoding, depending on which decoding method you select.  Perl stores the string internally as N8CS or UTF-8, depending on which decoding method you select, and what characters are found to be in the octet stream.  (Normally, the string will be internally stored as UTF-8.)
# Process the string as you normally would.
# Encode the string into a UTF-8 encoded octet stream and output it.

=== 1. Decoding Text Input ===
External input includes submitted HTML form data, database data (''e.g.'', from SQL SELECT statements), HTML templates, text files, sockets, other programs, etc.  If any of these might contain UTF-8 encoded data/text, you must decode it.  UTF-8 decoding in Perl involves two steps:
# Decoding the text according to UTF-8 format rules.  This may generate decoding errors, depending on which decoding method you select.  Using &lt;tt&gt;decode()&lt;/tt&gt; always results in the string being internally stored as UTF-8, with the UTF8 flag set (despite what the documentation for Encode says).  Using &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; may result in N8CS or UTF-8 internal encoding.  If the incoming text only contains ASCII characters, N8CS is used, otherwise UTF-8 is used.
# Encoding the text (this might be a no-op) and storing it internally as N8CS or UTF-8.  If it is stored as UTF-8, the UTF8 flag is set.

If you are certain that the incoming data/octets only contains N8CS (which Perl will interpret as ISO-8859-1) text, you do not need to explicitly decode it (because Perl's default internal encoding is N8CS, which is a one-byte-per-character encoding). However, &quot;best practice&quot; suggests that all incoming  data/octets should be explicitly decoded — you can explicitly decode ISO-8859-1, ASCII, and a number of other character encodings.

If you don't decode, Perl assumes input text/octets are N8CS encoded, hence each octet is treated as a separate character — clearly, this is not what you want if you have a multi-byte UTF-8 encoded octet stream/text coming in.  Improper decoding can lead to [[#Double_Encoding | double encoding]], and it this be difficult to locate due to implicit decoding (discussed above).

Another important point to make here:  you need to know which encoding was used for each input text.  Do not guess, do not assume.

==== Input - Files, File Handles ====
Perl can automatically decode data as it comes into Perl using PerlIO layers:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
open (my $in_fh, &quot;&lt;:encoding(utf8)&quot;, $filename) || die;  # auto UTF-8 decoding on read
&lt;/source&gt;

If you already have an open filehandle:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
binmode $in2_fh, ':encoding(utf8)';
&lt;/source&gt;

Do '''not''' use &lt;tt&gt;:utf8&lt;/tt&gt; since it does not check that your incoming text is valid UTF-8, it simply marks it as UTF-8 —
see [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=626470 Perlmonks].

If your text file contains a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark Byte Order Mark], see [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=599720 Perlmonks].

==== Input - HTML Templates ====
If you are using a CGI framework or template engine to pull in UTF-8 encoded HTML template files, you may need to inform it about the UTF-8 encoding, so that it can &quot;UTF-8 decode&quot; the template files as they are read in.  Basically, the framework or template engine needs to do what we talked about in the previous section.

For [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/lib/Template/FAQ.pod#Why_do_I_get_rubbish_for_my_utf-8_templates? Template::Toolkit], if you use an appropriate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark Byte Order Mark (BOM)] in your template files to indicate the encoding, the toolkit will decode them appropriately, automatically.  If the templates do not use BOMs, use the ENCODING option:

&lt;tt&gt;my $template = Template-&gt;new({ ENCODING =&gt; 'utf8' });&lt;/tt&gt;

[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Template HTML::Template] currently does not support decoding of UTF-8 encoded HTML template files.  This is a [https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30586 known limitation/bug].  There are a few workarounds:
* A [https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30586 patch] is available.
* You can [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4607245C.8030702%40netratings.com.au&amp;forum_name=html-template-users use TMPL_VARs to insert UTF-8 content] into an N8CS (or even ASCII) encoded template file.  UTF-8 decode your parameters/content before inserting them into an HTML template using TMPL_VARs, and implicit decoding should upgrade the resulting text (''i.e.'', the template and the filled-in variables) to UTF-8 internally.  For many applications, this is often sufficient.

==== Input - Web Forms ====
By default, [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CGI CGI.pm] does not decode your form parameters.  You can use the &lt;tt&gt;-utf8&lt;/tt&gt; pragma, which will treat (and decode) all parameters as UTF-8 strings, but this will fail if you have any binary file upload fields.  A better solution involves overriding the param method:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
package CGI::as_utf8;
BEGIN {
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use CGI 3.47;  # earlier versions have a UTF-8 double-decoding bug
    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        my $param_org = \&amp;CGI::param;
        my $might_decode = sub {
            my $p = shift;
            # make sure upload() filehandles are not modified
            return $p if !$p || ( ref $p &amp;&amp; fileno($p) );
            utf8::decode($p);  # may fail, but only logs an error
            $p
        };
        *CGI::param = sub {
            # setting a param goes through the original interface
            goto &amp;$param_org if scalar @_ != 2;
            my ($q, $p) = @_;    # assume object calls always
            return wantarray
                ? map { $might_decode-&gt;($_) } $q-&gt;$param_org($p)
                : $might_decode-&gt;( $q-&gt;$param_org($p) );
        }
    }
}

---
use CGI::as_utf8;  # put this line in your app, e.g., in your CGI::Application module(s)
&lt;/source&gt;
The above is [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=651574 rhesa's solution] with a slight modification — &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; is used instead of [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Encode Encode's] &lt;tt&gt;decode_utf8()&lt;/tt&gt;, as it is more efficient when only ASCII characters are involved (since the UTF8 flag is not set).  Note that the module assumes that web pages and forms are always UTF-8 encoded, and that the OO interface of CGI.pm is always used.

Note, browsers should encode form data in the same character encoding that was used to display the form.  So, if you are sending UTF-8 forms, you should get UTF-8 encoded data back for text fields. You should not have to use &lt;tt&gt;accept-charset&lt;/tt&gt; in your HTML markup.

==== Input - STDIN ====
When a web form is POSTed, form data comes into Perl via STDIN.  If you are using CGI.pm, text form data is available via CGI.pm's param() method, and the previous section describes how to properly handle UTF-8 encoded text form data.

If you don't have any file uploads (i.e., all of your data is text), then instead of the CGI::as_utf8 module, you could add the following line of code to the beginning of your script to cause all data received on STDIN (i.e., all POSTed form data) to be automatically decoded as UTF-8:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
binmode STDIN, &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Do '''not''' use 
&lt;s&gt;&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
binmode STDIN, &quot;:utf8&quot;;  # do NOT use this!
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
since it does not check that your incoming text is valid UTF-8, it simply marks it as UTF-8 —
see [http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?the_utf8_perlio_layer Perl 5 Wiki].

The approach in the previous section is preferred, since it will &quot;do the right thing&quot; if there is any binary form data (file uploads).

If you are writing some other (non-CGI) program that receives data on STDIN, decode appropriately:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
my $utf8_text    = decode('UTF-8',      readline STDIN);
my $iso8859_text = decode('ISO-8859-1', readline STDIN);
my $binary_data  = read(...);  # don't decode
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &lt;tt&gt;decode()&lt;/tt&gt; always sets Perl's internal UTF8 flag.

==== Input - Database ====
In the &quot;use UTF-8 everywhere&quot; model, configure your database to store values in UTF-8.

When reading data from a UTF-8 database, ensure incoming UTF-8 encoded string field data is UTF-8 decoded, but do not decode incoming binary field data.

===== Input - MySQL =====
With MySQL, UTF-8 decoding (and encoding) of string field data is automatic if you use the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::mysql#DATABASE_HANDLES &lt;tt&gt;mysql_enable_utf8&lt;/tt&gt; database handle attribute]:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
use DBI();
my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:mysql:test_db', $username, $password, 
                       {mysql_enable_utf8 =&gt; 1}
);
&lt;/source&gt;

This means you should not call &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; (or any other UTF-8 decode function) on incoming string field data — the driver will do that for you.  If the incoming data for a field only contains ASCII octets, the UTF8 flag is not set for that field (so it appears to be using &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt;). The driver is also smart enough to not decode binary data.

Version 4.004 or higher of DBD::mysql is required.  UTF-8 was first available in MySQL v4.1.  As of v5.0, it is the system default.

===== Input - PostgreSQL =====
With PostgreSQL, UTF-8 decoding (and encoding) of string field data is automatic if you use the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::Pg#pg_enable_utf8_(boolean) &lt;tt&gt;pg_enable_utf8&lt;/tt&gt; database handle attribute]:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
use DBI();
my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:mysql:test_db', $username, $password, 
                       {pg_enable_utf8 =&gt; 1}
);
&lt;/source&gt;

This means you should not call &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt;  (or any other UTF-8 decode function) on incoming string field data — the DBD::Pg driver will do that for you. The driver is also smart enough to not decode binary data.

You may (TBD: when?) also need to tell PostgreSQL to use UTF-8 when sending data out of the database:

&lt;tt&gt;SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'UTF8';&lt;/tt&gt;

or

&lt;tt&gt;SET NAMES 'UTF8';&lt;/tt&gt;

For example, with Rose::DB:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
__PACKAGE__-&gt;register_db(
   domain           =&gt; 'development',
...
   connect_options  =&gt; {
       pg_server_prepare =&gt; 0,
       pg_enable_utf8    =&gt; 1,
   },
   post_connect_sql =&gt; &quot;SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'UTF8';&quot;,
);
&lt;/source&gt;

See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/multibyte.html#AEN29751 Automatic Character Set Conversion Between Server and Client]

=== 2. Processing strings ===
Once all incoming strings have been decoded into UTF-8 internally, you can process your text as normal.  Regular expressions will work (if using Perl v5.8 or higher).

If you create any strings in your source code that contain non-ASCII characters (characters above 0x7f), ensure you upgrade them to internal UTF-8 encoding:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
my $text = &quot;\xE0&quot;;  # 0xE0 = à in ISO-8859-1
utf8::upgrade($text);

my $unicode_char = &quot;\x{00f1}&quot;;  # U+00F1 = ñ
utf8::upgrade($unicode_char);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Perl 5 &quot;Unicode Bug&quot; ====
Without a locale specified, if you have native/N8CS strings with characters in the 0x80-0xFF (128-255) range, then &lt;tt&gt;\d, \s, \w, \D, \S, \W&lt;/tt&gt; (hence regular expressions), and &lt;tt&gt;uc(), lc()&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. may not work as expected, since the non-ASCII part (0x80-0xFF) of the character set is ignored for those operations.  (This is another reason to try and use UTF-8 everywhere.)  Without a locale, Perl can't properly interpret characters in this range, since different encodings use different characters in this range, so it ignores them -- this is called ''ASCII semantics''.

There are three ways to avoid this &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;.  The best is to upgrade to Perl 5.14 and put a 
&lt;tt&gt;use 5.012&lt;/tt&gt; at the top of your file. 
The other two involve getting the natively encoded string to switch to UTF-8 encoding — because when the internal encoding is UTF-8, ''Unicode semantics'' are used, which always work as expected.

1. Follow &quot;best practice&quot; and always properly decode all external input text/octets.  During decoding, any text/octets found to contain non-ASCII characters will be converted to UTF-8 internal encoding.  For example 
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
use Encode;
# suppose $windows1252_octets contains text from an external input, and it contains the character 
# &quot;\xE0&quot;  (0xE0 = à).  String $windows1252_octets will exhibit the Unicode bug -- it won't match /\w/
my $utf8_string = decode('cp1252',$windows1252_octets);  # no Unicode bug, $utf8_string matches /\w/
&lt;/source&gt;
2. Use &lt;tt&gt;utf8::upgrade($native_string)&lt;/tt&gt; to force $native_string to switch to UTF-8 internal encoding.  (Even if the string only contains ASCII characters, it is still &quot;upgraded&quot; to UTF-8.)
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
my $text = &quot;\xE0&quot;;     # will exhibit Unicode bug, won't match /\w/
utf8::upgrade($text);  # no Unicode bug, matches /\w/
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that with internal UTF-8 encoding, &lt;tt&gt;\w&lt;/tt&gt; represents a much, much larger set of characters, so regex operations will be slower (vs. native encoding).  
TBD: what is the actual performance degradation?  What is the character set for \w with ''Unicode semantics''?

See also [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Unicode::Semantics Unicode::Semantics]. This issue should be fixed in Perl v5.12.

2011-05-03: v5.14 is now available, finally banishing the Unicode Bug.

4/19/10 update: v5.12 is now available, and the &quot;case changing component&quot; has been fixed: &quot;Perl 5.12 now bundles Unicode 5.2.  The “feature” pragma now supports the new “unicode_strings” feature:
  use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;;
This will turn on Unicode semantics for all case changing operations on strings, regardless of how they are currently encoded internally.&quot;  Read [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlunicode.html#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22 more].

=== 3. Encoding and output ===
Output from a web program includes STDOUT (which is sent to your browser for a CGI program), stderr (which usually goes to the web server's error log), database writes, log file output, etc.

If outgoing text is not encoded, the text will be sent using the bytes in Perl's internal format, which could be a mixture of native/N8CS and UTF-8.  This may work, but don't take a chance — &quot;best practice&quot; calls for explicitly encoding all output appropriately.

Perl will warn you if you print a string with a character that has an ordinal value greater than 255:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
$ perl -e 'print &quot;\x{0100}\n&quot;'
Wide character in print at -e line 1.
Ä
&lt;/source&gt;

To avoid this warning, explicitly encode output (as described below).

==== Output - STDOUT ====
To ensure all output going back to the web browser (i.e., STDOUT) is UTF8-encoded, add the following near the top of your Perl script:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
binmode STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot;; 
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to be a little more efficient (but not follow &quot;best practice&quot;), you can opt to only encode the outgoing page if it is flagged as UTF-8:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
if(utf8::is_utf8($page)) {
   utf8::encode($page);
} 
# else, $page is natively encoded, so skip encoding for output
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a [http://www.mail-archive.com/cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net/msg08043.html snippet] that can be used with the [http://cgi-app.org/index.cgi CGI::Application] framework:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
__PACKAGE__-&gt;add_callback('postrun', sub {
   my $self = shift;
   # Make sure the output is utf8 encoded if it needs it
   if($_[0] &amp;&amp; ${$_[0]} &amp;&amp; utf8::is_utf8(${$_[0]}) ){
       utf8::encode( ${$_[0]} );
       # ${$_[0]} .= 'utf8::encode() called';  # useful for debugging
   }
});
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code should be put into CGI::Application base class(es).  Optionally, the code can be added to cgiapp_postrun().

Note that all of the above encoding techniques will only work properly if all of the input UTF-8 octets were properly decoded.

==== Output - Database ====
As mentioned above, in the &quot;use UTF-8 everywhere&quot; model, configure your database to store values in UTF-8.

When writing data to a UTF-8 database (INSERT, UPDATE, etc.), ensure your UTF-8 strings get UTF-8 encoded before being written to the database.  Do not encode binary field data.

===== Output - MySQL =====
As mentioned above, UTF-8 encoding (and decoding) of string field data is automatic if you use the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::mysql#DATABASE_HANDLES &lt;tt&gt;mysql_enable_utf8&lt;/tt&gt; database handle attribute].  This means you should not call &lt;tt&gt;utf8::encode()&lt;/tt&gt;  (or any other UTF-8 encode function) on your strings when using this attribute — the driver will do that for you.  The driver is also smart enough to not encode binary data.

Version 4.004 or higher of DBD::mysql is required.  UTF-8 was first available in MySQL v4.1. As of v5.0, it is the system default.

===== Output - PostgreSQL =====
As mentioned above, UTF-8 encoding (and decoding) of string field data is automatic if you use the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::Pg#pg_enable_utf8_(boolean) &lt;tt&gt;pg_enable_utf8&lt;/tt&gt; database handle attribute].  This means you should not call &lt;tt&gt;utf8::encode()&lt;/tt&gt;  (or any other UTF-8 encode function) on your strings when using this attribute — the DBD::Pg driver will do that for you. The driver is also smart enough to not encode binary data.

You may (TBD: when?) also need to tell PostgreSQL to expect UTF-8 coming into the database:

&lt;tt&gt;SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'UTF8';&lt;/tt&gt;

or

&lt;tt&gt;SET NAMES 'UTF8';&lt;/tt&gt;

See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/multibyte.html#AEN29751 Automatic Character Set Conversion Between Server and Client]

==== Output - Files, File Handles ====
If you need to write to files, Perl can automatically encode data as it is written using PerlIO layers:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
open my $out_fh, &quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;, $filename  or die;  # auto UTF-8 encoding on write
&lt;/source&gt;

If you already have an open filehandle:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
binmode $out2_fh, ':utf8';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Tell the Browser to use UTF-8 ==
To serve a UTF-8 encoded page to a browser, &quot;best practice&quot; is to specify the UTF-8 charset in an HTTP Content-Type header and inside the HTML file in a content-type &lt;meta&gt; tag.  CGI.pm defaults to sending the following Content-Type header:

&lt;tt&gt;Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&lt;/tt&gt;

Add the following to cause UTF-8 to be used instead of ISO-8859-1, where $q is your CGI object:

&lt;tt&gt;$q-&gt;charset('UTF-8');&lt;/tt&gt;

If you are using the CGI::Application framework, put the above line in cgiapp_init().

If you are not using CGI.pm to generate your HTML markup, put the following
meta tag as the first meta tag in the &lt;header&gt; section of your HTML markup:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

== Perl source code ==
If you only need to embed a few Unicode characters in a few strings in your source code, you do not need to save your source code/file in UTF-8.  Instead, use \x{...} or chr() in your code\&gt;:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
  my $smiley = &quot;\x{263a}&quot;;
  or
  my $smiley = chr(0x263a);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have a lot of Unicode characters, or you prefer to save your source code in UTF-8, then you need to tell Perl that your source code is UTF-8 encoded.  Do this by adding the following line to your source code:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 use utf8;  # this script is in UTF-8
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the ''only'' reason your program should ever have the above line -- see [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?utf8 utf8].

If your source code is UTF-8 encoded, make sure your editor supports reading, editing, and writing in UTF-8!

= Gotchas =
Often you may not notice Unicode issues until characters with codepoints above 128 are used.  This is because ASCII, ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and UTF-8 are all encoded with the same one-byte values for the first 128 Unicode codepoints.  To give your application a good Unicode test, try a character in the 0x80 - 0x9F (128-159) range, and a character above 0xFF (255).

== Wide character in print at ... ==
Perl will [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perldiag#Wide_character_in_%s warn you] if you print a string that has a character with an ordinal value greater than 255 (hence it is a &quot;wide&quot; character that requires more than one byte of storage):

&lt;tt&gt;Wide character in print at ... line ...&lt;/tt&gt;

Explicitly [[#3._Encoding_and_output|encode your output]] to avoid this warning.

== Cannot decode string with wide characters at ... ==
If you receive this error, your code is probably trying to decode the same string a second time, which will fail.

== Web Server Always Sends an ISO-8859-1 Header ==
If you followed the steps above, but your pages are not being displayed properly, 
it could be that your web server is configured to always send a particular
character encoding in a header, such as ISO-8859-1.  
To determine if a Content-Type header is being sent by the web server:

&lt;tt&gt;$ lwp-request -de www.bing.com | grep Content&lt;/tt&gt;

Apache may be configured with the following:

&lt;tt&gt;AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-1&lt;/tt&gt;

If you can, remove that line, or change it to

&lt;tt&gt;AddDefaultCharset UTF-8&lt;/tt&gt;

if all of the pages served by the server use UTF-8.  See also [http://www.personal.psu.edu/ejp10/blogs/gotunicode/2009/02/when-apache-and-utf-8-fight.html When Apache and UTF-8 Fight].

== ISO-8859-1 vs Windows-1252 ==
Since you are learning about character encodings, you need to be aware of the difference between the international ISO-8859-1 and the Microsoft proprietary Windows-1252.  From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 Windows-1252]: 
&quot;The Windows-1252 encoding is a superset of ISO-8859-1, but differs from ISO-8859-1 
by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 0x80 to 
0x9F (128 - 159) range. It ... also contains all the 
printable characters that are in ISO-8859-15 (though some are mapped to 
different code points). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text
data with the charset label ISO-8859-1. Many web browsers and e-mail clients
treat the MIME charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 characters in order to
accommodate such mislabeling... the draft HTML 5 specification requires that 
documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 
encoding&quot; since it is a superset of ISO-8859-1.

Here's a fun program to try:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
my @undefined_chars_in_windows_1252 = (0x81, 0x8d, 0x8f, 0x90, 0x9d);
my %h = map { $_ =&gt; undef } @undefined_chars_in_windows_1252;
foreach my $i (0x80 .. 0x9f) {
	next if exists $h{$i};
	printf &quot;%02x:%c &quot;, $i,$i;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
What do you see?  Do you see the Windows-1252 characters, no characters, square boxes? If you are using PuTTY, Change Settings... Window, Translation and try selecting ISO-8859-1 or Windows-1252 and run the program again.

=== Microsoft &quot;Smart&quot; Quotes ===
MS-Word (TBD: only older versions?) uses those nice left and right fancy/smart quotes.  If you copy-paste those characters into a web form that was served with a Windows-1252 charset (or possibly even an ISO-8859-1 charset), the characters may be submitted to the web server using the nebulous 0x80-0x9F (128-159) range.  (Recall that Unicode defines control characters in this range — not printable characters like smart quotes.)  If your Perl script does not decode the submitted form properly (i.e., according the same character encoding that the web form used), you will get gibberish.

Decode and encode correctly and you will not have any problems with Microsoft smart quotes or any of the other characters in the nebulous range.  Better yet, if you serve all web pages as UTF-8, submitted forms should never contain these nebulous values, since the &quot;paste&quot; operation should automagically convert these characters to valid Unicode characters.  Your Perl script will then only receive valid UTF-8 encoded characters.

== Strange Characters in my Browser ==
'''Strange character''': &lt;tt&gt;�&lt;/tt&gt;

This is Unicode's &quot;replacement character&quot; (codepoint U+FFFD), which is used to indicate when a Unicode parser (such as a browser) was not able to decode a stream of Unicode encoded data. The problem is likely an encode/decode problem somewhere in the chain.  (U+FFFD encodes to EF BF BD in UTF-8.  If you save the web page and then open it in bvi, you may see EF BF BD.)  IE displays the replacement character as the empty square box.  Firefox uses the black diamond with the question mark.

Usually, these replacement characters appear because the HTML data is Windows-1252 encoded, but the browser was instructed to use UTF-8 encoding.  In your browser, select ''View-&gt;Character Encoding'' and see if it is set to UTF-8.  If so, try selecting ''Windows-1252'' or ''Western European (Windows)'' and see if that resolves the problem.  If if does, then you know that the web server is serving up the wrong character encoding — there is a mismatch between what is being sent (i.e., how the data is encoded), and what character set the browser is being told to use (i.e., HTTP header and/or meta tag).  If it doesn't resolve the problem, it might be that you don't have a Unicode font installed on your computer, or the Unicode font does not have a glyph for that particular character.

'''Strange characters''': &lt;tt&gt;â€˜ â€™ â€œ â€ â€¢ â€“ â€”&lt;/tt&gt;

These are the individual characters that correspond to the multi-byte UTF-8 encodings for the following Windows-1252 characters: 

&lt;tt&gt;‘ ’ “ ” • – —&lt;/tt&gt;

which are in the nebulous 0x80-0x9F (128-159) range.  Usually, these characters appear because the HTML data is UTF-8 encoded, but the browser was instructed to use ISO-8859-1 or Windows-1252.  In your browser, try changing the encoding to ''UTF-8'' and see if that resolves the problem.  If that doesn't resolve the problem, or if the encoding is already set to UTF-8, there may be a double encoding problem somewhere.

'''Strange characters''': &lt;tt&gt;â â â â â¢ â â&lt;/tt&gt;

These also correspond to some of the characters in the nebulous 0x80-0x9F (128-159) range.  If you see the above sequences, it is likely that you forgot to decode incoming UTF-8 data (such as form data submitted from an UTF-8 encoded HTML form) in your Perl program and then you UTF-8 encoded it for output — a natively encoded string was UTF-8 encoded (not good).  Fix the problem by calling &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; on the incoming UTF-8 encoded data.

== Strange Characters in my Editor ==
* ensure your editor supports reading, editing, and writing in UTF-8
* ensure you set your editor to use a Unicode font
* ensure you have a Unicode font installed

=== Install a Unicode Font on Windows ===
If you have one of the Microsoft products listed on [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1081 this page], you should have the &lt;tt&gt;Arial Unicode MS&lt;/tt&gt; font.  If it is not installed, follow these steps to install it: 
Add/Remove Programs, select MS-Office, Add or Remove Features, click &quot;Choose advanced&quot;, Office Shared Features, International Support, Universal Font.  Apply the changes and restart your web browser.

== I asked for UTF-8 but I Got Something Else!? ==
If you specifically asked for UTF-8 text, but the octet stream you receive is not valid UTF-8 encoding, in many cases you can probably assume that the incoming text/octets are ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 or Windows-1252.  Decode with Windows-1252, since it is a superset of ISO-8859-1.

== Double Encoding ==
If you don't decode UTF-8 text/octets, Perl will assume they are encoded with N8CS (often ISO-8859-1/Latin-1).  This means that the individual octets of a multi-byte UTF-8 character are seen as separate characters (not good).  If these separate characters are later encoded to UTF-8 for output, a &quot;double encoding&quot; results.  This is similar to HTML double encoding — e.g., &amp;amp;amp;gt; instead of &amp;amp;gt;.

== Automatic Font Substitution ==
Most modern browsers and word processors perform [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_substitution font substitution], which means that if a character is not in the current font, the application will search through all of your fonts until it finds one containing that character and it will then display that character using the glyph in that font.

Sometimes IE7 and IE8 do not seem to perform font substitution correctly.  One workaround is to specify a Unicode font as the first font in the CSS &lt;tt&gt;font-family&lt;/tt&gt; property. IE6 is not considered a modern browser, and it does not perform font substitution.

= Misc =
== Create Unicode characters ==
On Windows, you can always use the ''Character Map'' application to select, copy, and (switch to your application then) paste a Unicode character.  Ensure the &quot;Character set&quot; drop-down box is set to &quot;Unicode&quot;.  You can also use the application to view fonts, characters, and Unicode codepoint values for each character.

=== In Perl ===
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
  my $utf8_char  =  &quot;\x{263a}&quot;;    # for codepoints above 0xFF
  $utf8_char     =~ /\x{263a}/;    # same syntax for regex
  my $cloud_char =  chr(0x2601);   # run-time, ord() does the reverse
&lt;/source&gt;

If your Perl source code file is in UTF-8 format, you can enter the Unicode characters directly:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
  use utf8;                # tells Perl this file is UTF-8 encoded
  my $utf8_char  =  &quot;☺&quot;;   # U+263a, &quot;White Smiling Face&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== In Web Forms ===
On Windows:
* To insert a character from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 Windows-1252 codepage]: set the Num Lock key on, hold down Alt, then using the numeric keypad, type 0 followed by the ''decimal'' value of the character you want.
* To insert a character from the current DOS code page (usually [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 CP-437]): follow the same steps as above, but without the initial 0.

But wait, we wanted to insert a Unicode character, not a Windows-1252 or CP-437 character!  Well, Windows will convert those characters to Unicode/UTF-8 for us if the application expects UTF-8.

In a web form (textbox or textarea) type Alt-0147 to generate one of those pesky smart quotes from the Windows-1252 character set.  If the web page's character encoding is set for UTF-8, Windows should translate the 147 character into the corresponding UTF-8 encoding.  (Internally, Windows probably translates the 0147 to UTF-16, which is then translated into the character set in use by the application.  In this scenario, the character set is Unicode, and Windows-1252 character 147 is translated to its Unicode codepoint equivalent, U+201C.)  When the form is submitted, the character should be sent to the web server UTF-8 encoded as three octets: E2 80 9C — this is what U+201C looks like when encoded with UTF-8.  

If the web page's character encoding is instead set to Windows-1252, the character should be sent as a single octet: 0x93 (which is 147 decimal).  If the web page's character encoding is instead set to ISO-8859-1, the character will also be sent as a single octet, but the value may be either 0x93 or 0x22 (0x22 is the ASCII and ISO-8859-1 quote character).  If the browser uses the superset Windows-1252 encoding when ISO-8859-1 is specified, 0x93 is sent.  Otherwise, the character will be translated to the only quote character officially defined in ISO-8859-1, 0x22.

Hopefully you see why it is imperative to know which encoding was used for the incoming form/text, so that it can be decoded properly (as UTF-8 or Windows-1252) in your Perl program.

== UTF-8 vs utf8 ==
As of Perl 5.8.7, ''UTF-8'' is the strict, official UTF-8.  The Encode module will complain if you try to encode or decode invalid UTF-8, e.g., 

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
encode(&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;\x{FFFF_FFFF}&quot;, 1);   # croaks
&lt;/source&gt;

In contrast, ''utf8'' is the liberal, lax, version, allowing just about any 4-byte values:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
encode(&quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;\x{FFFF_FFFF}&quot;, 1);   # okay
encode_utf8(&quot;\x{FFFF_FFFF}&quot;, 1);      # okay
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Encode#UTF-8_vs._utf8_vs._UTF8 Encode] as of version 2.10 knows the difference.

&lt;tt&gt;utf8::encode()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; use official UTF-8.

== Encode Module vs Built-in/Core utf8:: ==
To decode and encode UTF-8, you can use the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Encode Encode] module or the functions defined in the [http://perldoc.perl.org/utf8.html &lt;tt&gt;utf8::&lt;/tt&gt;] package by the Perl core. The Encode module is more flexible, allowing different ways of handling malformed data.  However, the utf8:: package can do some different tricks.

You should be aware of [https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34259 a bug] in the Encode module:  whenever text is decoded using the Encode module, the UTF8 flag is always turned on.  The documentation would lead you to believe that the UTF8 flag is off if the text only contains ASCII characters and you are decoding UTF-8.  This is not what happens — the flag is always turned on, as the table below depicts. 

There are performance gains to be had if the UTF8 flag can be kept off after decoding (and this is fine if the text only contains ASCII octets).  Use &lt;tt&gt;utf8::decode()&lt;/tt&gt; to obtain this efficiency, since it does not turn the flag on if the octet sequence only contains ASCII octets.  (This is the decode function I normally use.)

Below, see [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Encode Encode's documentation] for CHECK options, which relate to how the module handles malformed data.

== Perl Character encodings ==
To determine which character encodings your Perl supports:

&lt;tt&gt;perl -MEncode -le &quot;print for Encode-&gt;encodings(':all')&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

It is important to remember that Perl only uses two character encodings internally: native/byte and UTF-8/character.  Any characters encoded with something other than N8CS, the platform's native 8-bit character set (often ISO-8859-1/Latin-1), must be decoded as it enters Perl.

== What does Website &quot;x&quot; Use? ==
View a page, then in your browser, ''View-&gt;Character Encoding'' to see which encoding was selected.  Also look at the HTML source and see if the meta tag is present:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset='''UTF-8'''&quot; /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

You can also see what Content-Type header is being returned using:

&lt;tt&gt; $ lwp-request -de www.bing.com | grep Content &lt;/tt&gt;

This wiki uses UTF-8.

== HTML Character Entities ==
In your UTF-8 travels, you may come across HTML Character Entities.
Starting with HTML 4.0, 252 [http://www.alanwood.net/demos/ent4_frame.html character entities] are supported.  Each of these has a Unicode codepoint and an entity name.  Either can be used in HTML markup.  For example, the registered sign can be represented in HTML as either &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#174;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;reg&lt;/code&gt;;

Many fonts support this set of characters, and if the set is sufficient for your application, UTF-8 may not be required, but your application will need to use the HTML encoding where ever a special character is needed.

== Operating Systems and Unicode ==
It is interesting to note which Unicode encoding popular Operating Systems use.  From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Operating_systems Wikipedia]: &quot;Windows NT (and its descendants, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7), uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The Java and .NET bytecode environments, Mac OS X, and KDE also use it for internal representation. UTF-8 has become the main storage encoding on most Unix-like operating systems (though others are also used by some libraries) because it is a relatively easy replacement for traditional extended ASCII character sets.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reef spaghetti, or spaghetti allo scoglio, is the classic seafood pasta made with all sorts of crustaceans and shellfish. It's very popular, especially in festive occasions. Exactly what goes into it depends upon what's available at the fishmonger's, but here's a suggestion. 
Prep Time: 35 minutes
Cook Time: 25 minutes

Ingredients:
*1 1/4 pounds (500 g) fresh live clams 
*1 1/4 pounds (500 g) fresh mussels 
*12 ounces (300 g) shelled shrimp tails (you can also use other crustaceans, or a mixture of crustaceans) 
*2-3 ripe plum tomatoes 
*A bunch parsley 
*Basil 
*1 clove garlic 
*Olive Oil 
*A shredded hot pepper (optional) 
*Salt &amp; pepper 
*3/4 pound (350 g) spaghetti 

Preparation:
Scrub the shells of the clams and mussels. Shell the shrimp tails. Salt a pot of water for the spaghetti and set it to boil. In the meantime, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a broad skillet, with a crushed clove of garlic. When the garlic has browned, remove it and discard it, then add the clams and mussels. Cover and cook over a brisk flame, shaking the pan every now and then, until the shellfish have opened. Turn off the flame and let them cool slightly, then remove and discard the shells of some of them (but not all -- NOTE: do not try to open any that failed to open when heated. Discard them; they were already dead and eating them could make you quite sick.).

While doing this make sure the clam broth remains in the skillet. Next, finely mince a second clove of garlic and sauté it in 3 tablespoons of oil, in a broad skillet. When it has turned light gold, slice the tomatoes directly into the pan. Shred six basil leaves into the pan too, a touch of salt, the hot pepper if you're using it, and simmer the sauce for ten minutes. 

In the meantime strain the clam juices through a fine cloth. Once ten minutes is up, stir in all the shellfish and a half cup of the strained clam juice, and simmer for five minutes more. 

While the sauce is simmering, add the remaining clam juice to the pasta water, which should be boiling by now, and cook the spaghetti. Transfer the cooked spaghetti to a bowl, dribble a couple of tablespoons of oil over them, add a turn of freshly ground pepper, about 20 parsley leaves (either whole or shredded) and toss. Stir in the sauce and serve at once, with a crisp white wine.</text>

This chapter is designed to give you a brief introduction to the types of funding available and in particular whether your business might be able to attract outside investment. It also explains how you will have to modify or expand your Business Plan to attract such funding.

The chapter covers these topics:
* What sources of funds are available?
* Are you ready to share control of your business?
* Do you have the right kind of business?
* How committed are you and your team?
* Funding by agreed goals or outcomes
* The need for an exit strategy
* Preparing your presentation

If after reading this broad overview you want to pursue any of these topics in more detail, we recommend that you:
* Visit the website www.escalator.co.nz or phone 0800 822 748 and ask for the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Escalator Service Introductory Pack. This pack includes the Investment Ready Guide booklet which covers in more detail all the subjects mentioned in this chapter.
* Seek professional advice as early as you can, specifically from your lawyer and accountant. At the very least inform them of your plans, as they may have contacts that could help you.
* Apply directly for the Escalator deal-preparation service online at www.escalator.co.nz or call 0800 822 748.

==What sources of funds are available?==
The most common types of funding available for business development and growth can be summarised as follows:

;Personal equity, friends and family
Most businesses are funded by the owner’s own equity (capital). The most common sources of small business equity are the owner’s savings and/or a loan or mortgage raised against the owner’s home. Further financing is often raised from friends and family. Personal equity can also include the cashflow or savings you have built up in your business.

;Bank and private institution finance
The second most common source of funding for business development is the private banks and financial institutions. These funds, whether in the form of short or long-term financing are typically for specific purposes, such as an overdraft to provide short-term working capital or a term loan to purchase buildings, machinery or other assets. Leasing and hire purchase arrangements also fall into this category. Note that such funding involves little risk for the lender (the funding is characteristically secured against collateral, personal guarantees or a good trading record), and the funding is for specific purposes. The banks or other lending institutions are not interested in taking up any ownership stake in your business.

;Government assistance
Some businesses qualify for government funding or assistance. This is more likely to be forthcoming if your business concept involves a new or advanced technology concept with the potential to provide significant employment and/or generate significant foreign exchange (export dollars) for the New Zealand economy. You can browse www.nzte.govt.nz to find out if your business qualifies for any kind of
government aid. If you have an advanced technology business or business concept, visit the Technology New Zealand site at www.frst.govt.nz or contact their nearest regional office for details of possible support or funding programmes.

;Angel investors
Simply put, an angel investor is the name given to a person who is prepared to invest in a promising business venture, often at a relatively early stage. 

For example, a typical angel investor might be an experienced business person with spare investment funds who is looking around for a more exciting investment opportunity than parking spare funds in a bank account or term investment. Investing in high-growth companies allows angel investors to trade off the risk against the
excitement and the opportunity to back a potential winner. They are interested in good returns, but are also attracted to the energy of a young company—sometimes backing people they like as much as the idea itself. 

Angel investors will rarely go into an industry they know little about since this poses a danger for them. Most prefer to enter an industry they know and have contacts in, so that they can reduce their risk and add value to the business by offering expertise, capability and advice. 

The value of angel investors is that they will often back and finance promising small businesses at an earlier, developmental stage where venture capitalists refuse to tread. This is often the stage before the business has any sales or marketing track record, but needs funds to build prototypes or research feasibility. They also fill an important gap by operating in smaller investments (in New Zealand typically up to $1,000,000, but normally less than this), where venture capitalists would not get enough of a return to be interested. 

Angel investors do expect a decent return on their money (a minimum is usually 30 percent), and often want some equity (ownership) position in your business to compensate them for the risk.

;Venture capitalists
Venture capitalists are investment companies or fund managers that provide cash in return for part-ownership of your business. 

Venture capitalists are a different class of investors to angel investors. Their core business is investing in other businesses (unlike angel investors, who may still be in business) so they are typically far tougher in their requirements. Because of the time and cost of due diligence (checking out your business), venture capitalists are not interested in looking at small investments. In return for risking their funds, they tend to favour only high-growth companies that are likely to provide them with at least a 30 percent to 50 percent return on their money.

Venture capitalists will typically want to play an active role in your business. This may range from actually placing a manager inside your company (if they feel the business lacks certain skills), to helping you with strategic alliances and contacts with other companies. At the very least they will require representation on your board of directors to oversee the running of the company.

Venture capitalists also add value through their experience of taking products or services to commercialisation, and through their international networks.

;Corporate investors
If your company does very well, then one option at a later stage is that a corporate (a larger company which is usually a multinational) will start to take an interest.

These corporate investors are not primarily interested in high rates of return on any funds invested in your business, nor on taking a percentage of the company. Instead, they will want to buy you out. The most common exit for most venture capital funded companies is a buy-out by another company (known as a ‘trade sale’).

The venture capitalists are happy as they are able to exit at this stage. They can take their profits and invest in another business. As owner you will be happy as you will also get lots of money (for your percentage of the company). Typically you will secure a contract to continue working in the company on a salary plus stock options to keep you keen (as the corporate will usually still want your input).

Why does the corporate buy you out? Their key reason is for strategic synergies. They want your business as you do something they don’t (or do it better than they do). For example you may have a superior technology, a unique product or service, exceptional staff, or a long-term
contract guaranteeing sales, etc.

Another difference between venture capitalists and corporate investors is that corporate buyers don’t want to exit. They will buy your business for the long haul, as part of their
overall corporate development strategy.

==Are you ready to share control of your business?==
Both angel investors and venture capitalists may require a share of control in your business. Venture capitalists will typically require more control and closer scrutiny of your operations.

If you are not prepared to surrender some control of your business there is no point in approaching them. You will be wasting your time and theirs. This is the major stumbling block for many New Zealand business owners, but the reality is that owning 40 percent of a business worth $5,000,000 is clearly preferable to 100 percent control of a business worth $250,000.

Bear in mind that business wealth is most commonly achieved by sharing control of your business. In other words, using outside funding as leverage to accelerate the growth and
development of the business.

==Do you have the right kind of business?==
It’s a mistake to believe that only advanced technology businesses attract investment funds or the attention of investment capitalists. But your business must have some special distinguishing features before you can hope to attract investment funds. Here are some questions to think about:

;Does your business have the ‘WOW !’ factor?
Does your concept break new ground? Are people really impressed by what you’ve developed? Is this feeling shared by a wide range of business people, not just close friends? How much market research have you undertaken? What is the level of interest?

;Barriers to competition
Most important, does your business have a sustainable competitive advantage? What would make your business even more attractive to investors is a high barrier to competition.

For example, if your idea would be very hard to copy because you possess ground-breaking advanced technology that others could not easily copy, this is a strong competitive advantage. Do you own patents or protected intellectual property? How long will you be able to sustain your market lead? Have you thought ahead in your strategy plan to second-generation products and services to keep ahead of the field?

;Is your potential market big enough?
Venture capitalists will only invest in businesses that have a high growth potential. You might attract some angel investment for a product or service likely to prove a hit on the local market, but venture capitalists are unlikely to be interested unless you can demonstrate a global 
demand for your product or service. The New Zealand market is just too small to be of interest to them.

;At what stage is your business?
All businesses go through a life cycle from development to decline. Is your business in the development stage, the start-up or introductory stage, the growth stage or maturity stage?

As mentioned, during the development or start-up stage you’re unlikely to attract funding from venture capitalists. They will want more concrete evidence that the business idea is viable than just enthusiasm and your conviction that it will change the world. Your likeliest sources of funding for these earlier stages are your own equity, plus what you can raise from friends and family and perhaps funding from angel investors.

The growth stage offers you the best opportunities for attracting investment funds from venture capitalists. This is the stage where you have got the product or service off the ground and the business is generating cashflow. Note that if they invest at this stage, they will want to exit your business before the maturity stage, and certainly well before the decline stage.

==How committed are you and your team?==
You are very unlikely to attract investment funds unless you can demonstrate total commitment to your business. It’s a mistake to assume that you can tap into other people’s money without risking any of your own equity or assets.

Investors will want to be convinced that you are passionate about your business, that you are risking most of what you have on the business, and that you have exhausted all sources
of funding first. After all, why should they risk their money unless you’re prepared to commit yours?

Of course there’s also what’s known as ‘sweat equity’. A person may have spent years of their life developing a certain product or service, and this certainly counts in the investor’s mind. Years of commitment and labour can sometimes mean even more than money.

;An excellent team
One of the features that venture capitalists will scrutinise very closely is your business experience and skills. Do you have the skills and experience necessary to build your business? What about your energy, dedication and commitment? What is your leadership track record? 

They will also be interested in your business track record, that is, have you been involved with previous business successes?

They will apply the same scrutiny to your key staff team members, so your Business Plan should explain in some detail their skills and experience and how you intend to keep them motivated and dedicated to the task of building a great business.

Excellent business ideas are far more common than excellent business teams that are capable of developing the potential of these ideas. For this reason venture capitalists will take a keen interest in your team and may propose additional people to fill skills gaps. For example, if you
lack a marketing specialist, they might suggest a suitable person for this role.

;An advisory board
In your Business Plan you should also provide details of your advisory board and how often this meets. Every business looking for investment funding should have such a board, which might typically consist of your lawyer, accountant, industry experts and others that you might co-opt,
such as experienced business people. More experienced business people might also be assisting you in a mentor role.

==Funding by agreed goals or outcomes==
It is worth emphasising that you are unlikely to get all your funds at once. For example, if you secure venture capital funding of $1,000,000 dollars to develop your business, you are highly unlikely to receive a cheque for that amount. Instead the funding is likely to be fed into the business in negotiated amounts as you achieve agreed goals or outcomes or meet agreed timelines.

The good news is that when venture capitalists commit to your business they will usually agree to continue to invest in you as the years go by and introduce new investors if the need arises since they have a vested interest in the success of your enterprise.

Venture capitalists can also help your business in many other ways. Because they have had experience of many business management teams they will be able to help you develop your
team, provide ideas for increasing staff commitment and provide or suggest managers to oversee critical areas in which your present team may lack skills.

In addition, they are well placed to help you with strategic alliances, networking and contacts with other companies, both here and overseas. These advantages can significantly improve
your chances of success and speed up the growth of your business.

==The need for an exit strategy==
It may sound strange, but venture capitalists will need you to spell out your vision of their exit strategy as part of your strategic plan before they consider investing in your business. This is because venture capitalists are typically not long-term investors. Their aim instead is to invest funds in a business, help build the business up to its maximum strength, and then exit the business to repeat the process. Their investment timeframe is typically three to five years or less. 

Your business plan should therefore spell out when this is likely to occur. The exit strategy can take several forms, such as the venture capitalists selling their shares back to you and/or your management team, or selling their shares to another investor, or facilitating the sale of the company to a larger company, or helping to list your company on the stock exchange.

Obviously the more successful your business becomes, the easier it will be to facilitate one or more of these options. What is important is that the venture capitalists can see a clear and convincing exit path for themselves.

==Intellectual property you own==
The intellectual property of your business may be the most valuable asset you have. Make sure it is yours and that your employees don’t think they own it. Many companies have been
shocked to find that when a key employee leaves, so do all the files. And if the employee completed work at home (for you) they may argue that work is theirs. Regardless of who
is right or wrong, an investor does not want to see employees running off with the goods.

At best it can cause huge delays as the issue is resolved, even if finally it is in your favour. Insert clear instructions in your terms of employment that all intellectual property developed by the employee is owned by the company. If this is too late, then get declarations from your employees that all the intellectual property is yours. See your lawyer immediately to make sure this is watertight.

Any investors will also need evidence that any brands, patents, trademarks or existing copyrights are actually owned by the company with no claims or liability issues likely to emerge.

Try to separate out the intellectual property issues from trading activities.

==Confidentiality agreement==
In the course of seeking investment funds you will have to tell many people about your idea to arouse interest in backing you. But there comes a time, particularly when you need to reveal intellectual property, trading or financial details when you have to start asking people to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

This agreement has two purposes:

# It lets potential investors know that you have thought about confidentiality issues.
# It helps prevent people telling the wrong people.

Anything discussed therefore has to be kept confidential by the person you talk to.

==Structuring the deal==
Before you approach an investor, you’ll need to think carefully about how you will structure the ‘deal’. Make sure you get plenty of advice from experienced advisers as you don’t want to gain an interview with an investor before you fully understand what you’re doing.

For example, you need to know what type of funding you’re after. Is it all equity, where you exchange part ownership of your company for the cash? Or is it going to be all debt, as you think you’ll be able to repay the money without giving up ownership?

Possibly you may require a mix of some equity and some debt. Are you going to lease or buy essential equipment? The critical aspects of any deal are: what type of deal (equity, debt, etc.) does it involve? What will the capital be used for? What is the exit strategy?

;Attend the free Escalator Service workshops
You should not approach an investor before you understand how the investment industry works. Your next step is to attend a free Escalator workshop: this will give you an opportunity
to increase your understanding of possible deal structures and enhance your chances of receiving investment capital. You can also apply directly for Escalator deal-preparation
assistance. For more information visit www.escalator.co.nz or phone the Escalator help desk on freephone 0800 822 748.

==Preparing your presentation==
If you’re seeking outside capital, you will more than likely have to present your idea at some stage to a group of investors. Your presentation should be as professional as possible because there is unlikely to be a second chance.
A suitable consultant can advise on how to shape an effective presentation, but it is important that you do not delegate the whole task out, since the presentation must reflect your own commitment and hard work.

At the core of your presentation will be your Business Plan, which should include these key elements:

* A clear strategic plan and your vision for the business.
* The history of your business and its achievements to date.
* The competitive advantages of your business concept and its ‘wow’ factor.
* The potential market size (local and international) and your marketing plan.
* The barriers to entry for potential competitors, such as advanced technology, 
* patents, intellectual property protection, etc.
* The growth potential, supported by evidence of market research.
* Your management team: their leadership skills and experience.
* An impressive advisory board.
* Any environmental, legal, regulatory or development constraints that need to be overcome.
* Realistic financials including documentation of existing loans and liabilities and plans for their reduction.
* Your funding requirements and how funding will be applied to grow the business.
* An exit strategy.

==Four final pieces of advice==
;1. Market research
One of the key missing ingredients in any business plan written to attract investment capital is thorough and robust market research. You need to demonstrate that you have a clear understanding of your market, your competitors and your industry.

Plus, make sure you conduct research internationally! Never make the mistake of researching just New Zealand companies who might assist or compete. Market research needs
to be global. Find out about potential international competitors, especially what they do, how much they charge, their distribution strategy and if they have expansion plans. The last thing you want is to develop your business and then have the ‘18 tonne gorilla’ in the form of a large overseas business squash you.

;2. Channel partners
Think carefully about how you will distribute your product or service. You do not always have to go direct to the end user. For example, if you had developed some unique software for
small business owners, then you could:

* Package the software in a box and sell direct to small businesses.
* Package the software in a box and sell the product to computer stores (who would then resell to the small businesses).
* Look for a channel partner (such as Mind Your Own Business, or Microsoft), who might add your software to theirs (in effect you lose your branding, but then you do not need any boxes).

Many successful smaller businesses seek an alliance with larger companies so that they can use the distribution and channel power of the larger companies to sell their products
or services.

;3. Good systems add value
Good systems are often what create value in a business. For example, successful franchises rely on clearly written operating system to train new staff and franchisees.
Show investors that you have excellent business systems. The more you have systemised the better. What do you do that makes the business a success? Document the processes
step by step.

Effective systems help to deliver consistency in:

* Revenue streams and profits
* Quality and service
* Customer satisfaction, retention and referral business
* Growth

Investors may be reluctant to invest if the business relies too much on you, so show them you have systems in place that allow the business to function without you.

;4. Five-year forecasts
If you are serious about attracting investment into your business, then you need forecasts that project further than three years. The reasons are:

* Software and computer technologies typically have a useful lifespan of three years, but certainly need updating at five years. A five-year forecast will build in these looming potential costs.
* A five-year forecast forces you to go beyond your comfort zone (most people can guess what might happen in three years, but not in five years).
* It makes you think ‘what would happen if this business does really well’? Are you prepared for the cost (such as time spent at work and away from family, traveling overseas, etc.)?
* Many investment people and companies want to exit after five to seven years, and therefore will want to see your projection of what the business will look like after this time.

Make sure you extend your forecasts.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merge with [[Calculus/Definite integral]] ==

This is not an integration &quot;technique&quot;.  These are basic rules that any one who does calculus should know.  And, it is already in the book under [[Calculus/Definite integral]], which is its proper place.  So, I think this section should be merged into that one. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 04:03, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

Suggested Change 2/16/11:

If this section doesn't get merged or superseded, under &quot;Proof of the substitution rule I would change &quot;Let F be an anti derivative of f so F'(x) = f(x)&quot; to Let F be an antiderivative of so F'(u) = f(u), where u = u(x).  The reason being on the third line of the proof the term in the chain rule after the equal sign F'(u(x)) gets substituted for with f(u(x)).  These derivatives are with respect to u not x.

:I cleaned up the proof of the substitution rule.  I didn't implement the suggestions above because, for the first suggestion, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a dummy variable, so it doesn't matter what you call it; and for the second, because derivatives are being taken with respect to both &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  I changed to Leibniz notation to make the application of the chain rule clearer.  I hope this addresses the issues raised, but if not, please feel free to make another comment.  I'm by no means an expert.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:48, 11 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

Innovation is imperative if you want to establish and maintain a competitive advantage.

To maintain this advantage requires a continuous commitment to innovation, not only from you as the owner, but from everyone in your business.

According to recent research, companies that make a large commitment to innovation, where it penetrates through the organisation, are exceptional performers in their respective industries.

The precursor to innovation is creativity, so infusing a creative environment where people are allowed to break the rules and push the limits is vital.

Strategies capable of producing innovation require resources and energy; it is therefore necessary to discuss in your business plan the organisational structures and practises you
will put in place to encourage and support innovation. Each of the following topics needs elaboration in your business plan.

==Creating a culture of innovation==
To find the few good ideas that will create value for your organisation you need to generate possibly hundreds of ideas. It should be the responsibility of every individual in the organisation to come up with ideas, not just the founder or key staff. Here are some suggestions to encourage the flow of ideas:
;Encourage creativity
Encouraging creativity helps keep staff happy; if they think something is important and has the potential to have financial pay-offs for the company, let them follow their heart. People perform best when they are driven by inspiration and encouraged to extend the boundaries.

;Encourage everyone to participate
Teamwork enhances people’s greatest strengths and lessens their individual weaknesses.

Effective teamwork also promotes the awareness that it’s in everyone’s best interests that the business keeps improving and growing.

;Provide recognition and rewards
One of the most powerful tools to get people to be creative and to innovate is recognition.

People want to be recognised and rewarded for their ideas and initiative, which can have tremendous pay-offs for the organisation. Sometimes the recognition required may be as simple as mentioning a person’s effort in a newsletter.

;Accept mistakes as part of the process
Being receptive to new business ideas means being receptive to the idea that mistakes are a necessary part of the process. Management guru Tom Peters insists, “Mistakes are not to be tolerated. They are to be encouraged.”

It was while a Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M) researcher was looking for ways to improve the adhesives used in 3M tapes that he discovered an adhesive that formed itself into tiny spheres. At first it seemed as if his work was a failure. However the new adhesive was later used on Post-it notes—a great innovation and business success for the company.

;Keep an open mind and think laterally
Innovative possibilities exist all the time. To realise them, everyone in the business needs to keep an open mind and the capacity to look at things with fresh eyes.

The classic example of a company completely transforming itself as a result of some lateral thinking is the Finnish company Nokia, whose original core business was wood pulp and logging.

When the collapse of communism opened the Russian market to the west, Nokia’s core business was seriously threatened by cheaper imports from Russia’s seemingly limitless forests. In the deep recession of the early 1990s, Nokia management concluded that the only real competitive advantage they retained was a very efficient communications system developed since the 1970s that helped them keep in touch with their remote logging operations.

That realisation transformed the company into one of the world’s most successful vendors of communications equipment.

;Innovation through serendipity
If you implement many of the above initiatives, it’s likely that some successful innovations will result from serendipity, that is, chance discovery.

For example, one day a Swiss amateur mountaineer and inventor, George de Mestral, went for a walk with his dog, and both came back covered in burrs. Curious about how tenaciously the burrs stuck to his woollen pants, de Mestral inspected a burr under his microscope. What he discovered was that the burr had small hooks that enabled it to cling to the tiny loops in the fabric of his pants. This led de Mestral to design a fastener which had one side with stiff hooks like the burrs and the other side with soft loops. That invention was Velcro.

Ultimately, in developing a culture of innovation you want employees to feel comfortable in experimenting and offering suggestions, without fear of criticism or punishment for mistakes.

==Encouraging employee innovation==
You may have an innovative culture in your organisation, but you also need to familiarise staff with some of the hallmarks of continuing innovation.

For example, you could try educating employees at fortnightly training sessions on topics such as creativity, entrepreneurship and teamwork. Each session might conclude with the assignment of an exercise to be performed any time over the next few working weeks, which builds on
lessons learnt.

Your aim here is to give employees a taste for innovation so they will embrace the process. In addition, incentives can generate great ideas.

;Recognise the efforts of employees
If a staff member comes up with a really creative idea, even if can’t be implemented immediately, mention their efforts in a company newsletter or on a news board.

;Give a profit share or offer bonuses
Some people are motivated by money and the thought of a profit share or bonus (perhaps linked to the value that the idea adds to the business) can be a powerful driver. However, it is often recognition that is more important than anything else.

Remember too that many excellent ideas can lead to genuine improvements in the business, but are very difficult to quantify in terms of dollars. For example, an administrative person may come up with a simplification that eliminates some unnecessary paperwork and significantly speeds up a business process.

;Days off
For providing solutions to what has been an expensive problem facing the organisation, try rewarding the innovator with a few additional days off, perhaps a long weekend.

;Trips away
Try advertising a problem facing the company that needs a solution. As a prize for the best solution, offer a weekend away, all expenses paid.

;A fair evaluation process
It’s important that all employees, whether key staff or otherwise, know that their suggestions will be fairly evaluated on their merits, not on the person’s status in the company.

For this reason it’s sound policy to form a team of people from all parts of the business to assess suggestions. This leads to more informed decisions about the merits of suggestions. The input from those who might be involved in implementing a suggestion will also help to avoid possible
problems.

==Building innovation into your business practices==
Your aim in developing an innovation culture in your business is to make it as inclusive as possible. Consider inserting an innovation clause into employment agreements so that all
your employees are aware from the start that they share a common responsibility for improving the business.

Make it clear to your staff that everyone is capable of generating innovative ideas. The process of innovation is not just confined to those with technical knowledge and skill, or limited to the alteration or invention of new products or services. Innovation is equally valuable for streamlining and speeding up daily business processes.

For example, many businesses have achieved substantial cost savings through streamlining operational processes to reduce waste and the use of resources. Other businesses have achieved significant cost advantages by using the internet to sell their goods and speed up business processes such as communications.

Encourage employees to take advantage of coffee breaks, lunch breaks, and taxi rides. Often great ideas which can lead to growth, happen outside the places where we expect them to
happen, in what Dr. Seuss has called the ‘waiting place’.

If it’s hard to get staff together for common informal breaks, consider taking them out for an informal meal where you can encourage creative discussion about work. Also be sure to include a good dose of laughter at meetings because laughter is an effective measure of how comfortable people feel about expressing themselves.

Experience shows that innovation is more likely to occur in a low debt business. With debt hanging over a business, it is more likely to stick to proven methods that result in cash flow, as opposed to less conservative methods that might be capable equally of failing or of producing tremendous success. So effective financial management also helps you to sustain creative direction.

==Innovation and staff skills==
If you want to succeed as an innovator in an increasingly competitive business environment then you should assist all the staff in your business to acquire basic skills in creativity,
entrepreneurship and teamwork.

Brainstorming sessions can be a useful tool in coaxing ideas to come to the surface. But all employees need to learn how to brainstorm most effectively. Such meetings often work best in
the morning, with three to ten participants and plenty of biscuits or muffins to sustain the brain work. Some suggestions:

Start with a clear, predefined statement of the problem. Statements that focus on the customers’ needs are usually better than ones that focus on internal issues. For example, if the problem is that the manufacture of product takes too long, restate the problem as the customers having to wait too long for a product.

* Preparation is vital for effective brainstorming. All participants need a bit of background knowledge on the industry or greater environment in which the problem exists.
* Background research might also include possibly visiting competitors, or collecting samples, brochures and ideas for a brainstorming session.
* Make up some creative rules to keep the session and participants focused. For example, only one person is to speak at a time, points should be demonstrated if possible with pictures as well as words and criticism should be delayed because every idea is allowed at this stage.
* Try and cover a range of issues that affect your business, as your staff will also have a range of interests. These could include potential environmental and social initiatives such as product improvement, manufacturing changes, energy saving, waste reduction and community sponsorship activities.
* Keep a record of ideas. Numbering them allows people to refer back to them and can also be a measure of how much work or ‘idea generation’ took place in a brainstorming session.
* Learn how to manage staff, particularly in the midst of brainstorming sessions. Often these meetings start off slowly, rapidly gather pace and then enthusiasm wanes. The best managers are able to encourage participation and the flow of ideas at the start, then step back when the pace quickens, and bring the meeting to a close before the quality of ideas diminishes.

Research has shown that less innovative business owners had fewer skills in managing projects and managing people than innovative business owners.

To ensure you and your staff acquire these skills,  investigate the free, nationwide Enterprise Training workshops programme before investigating other sources of training. The skills you acquire may well make the difference between whether an idea or concept is developed or not.

==Innovation and your customers, clients and suppliers==
Make sure you include your customers, clients and suppliers in the innovative process.

Encouraging all your employees to listen carefully to customer or client feedback can lead to some very productive developments of products and services, or changes to
your business procedures.

Trusted suppliers can also often offer very constructive advice on ways to make your relationship more profitable for both sides through innovative changes or efficiencies. Often they just need to be asked, or to be made aware that their contributions to your on-going innovative process will be valued.

Think of ways in which you can encourage this in a more systematic manner so that the flow of ideas is steady rather than spasmodic. For example:

* Create a ‘brains trust’, made up of selected customers or clients. By meeting regularly with this panel you can get feedback on your present products and services and also their
reaction to proposed new products and services.
* Explain to your sales staff that market research is an on-going process. Train them always to ask for feedback from customers or clients. The feedback should cover the whole business relationship you have, not just their reaction to your products and services.

It makes good business sense to thank all contributors since this simple form of recognition encourages further contributions.

==Researching innovation elsewhere==
Business is becoming increasingly fast paced. To keep up you need to know what the competition is doing. Here are some ideas:

;On the web
Competitors’ websites should be one of your first stops. Home pages often show companies in an overly optimistic light, but can help you understand the company culture and their market
focus. Are there any ideas you can borrow or improve upon? What do you like about the site, and what could you do better?

If you find a particularly keen or proficient internet surfer among your staff, encourage that person to continue surfing at home by subsidising an ‘unlimited hours’ internet access plan for his or her home computer. Encourage that staff member to research innovative ideas from the huge resources of the internet.

;In print
Subscribe to key magazines, newsletters and industry journals and circulate these around the office. The more knowledgeable your staff become, the bigger the contribution they are likely to make.

;The people factor
Supplement what you learn from the internet or conventional print sources by widening your business contacts. You can find out a lot of accurate information by talking and listening to people. In addition:
* Try going to industry conferences; most companies send their best people to speak at conferences and they will often share useful information and insights.
* Keep an eye on employment vacancies; they are a great source of business intelligence in identifying the future direction or interest of a competitor.
* Ask your customers what they think are the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. Why do they prefer doing business with you? In what ways could you improve?
* Join your local Chamber of Commerce and industry group to meet more people and gain some ideas about innovations in your industry or in business in general. For example, find people at these meetings who are making successful use of the internet or other technology. You might gain ideas from them on how you can apply their successful strategies in your business

==Implementing innovative ideas==
The best ideas should be worked on as soon as possible—not just by the idea generator, but also by others who have a different viewpoint. It is imperative that refinement of an idea starts very quickly following a brainstorming session, while ideas are still fresh and enthusiasm is high.

For example, if the innovation involves a new product, encourage the construction of a crude model, made from polystyrene, foam or cardboard.

;Project selection and management
Project selection is critical; this is essentially the skill of aligning innovation with your business strategy. It’s often necessary to select between competing projects at an early stage of development so the most promising receive funding and the potential failures are killed off.

Project selection needs to be driven by customer needs and wants, plus anticipated or emerging environmental and social market trends. Establish a team of representatives from each part of your business to implement innovative ideas in your business.

Armed with their knowledge of the company’s business strategy, their own unique fields of expertise and customer or client feedback, informed decisions are more likely to be made.

Once a project is chosen the team needs to meet regularly throughout the project duration, co-opting the assistance of other staff as the need arises. Each innovative idea needs a project manager who is responsible for drawing an overall plan for the project, showing stages, a timeframe for each stage, who is responsible for the various parts of the project, the resources needed, and how much it will all cost.

==Monitoring the level and success of internal innovation==
As with all business systems, you must monitor the progress to ensure that the innovation is producing results and improving the business’s competitive advantage.

Try also to keep track of the number of ideas generated from each division of the business, the number that are produced and implemented as a result of brainstorming session, and those useful ideas generated by customers, clients and suppliers.

Some interesting trends may arise that need to be addressed. For example, some parts of the business may not be contributing ideas because the workers might feel like they won’t be taken seriously, or they haven’t been sufficiently trained in the need for innovation.

It is also important that employees feel able to comment on the good and bad of the innovation culture and process in the business, as well as make suggestions on how to encourage more innovation.

==Protecting your intellectual property (IP)==
There is little point in innovating or developing a new product or service only to have your idea stolen or copied by competitors taking advantage of your success. If the IP is crucial to your competitive advantage then take steps to protect it.

Think broadly about your intellectual property (IP). It can include a wider variety than you may at first imagine.

For example:

* Your business name, logo and branding. Many business owners forget • to get trademark protection for a company name or logo. Visit the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand’s website at www.iponz.govt.nz for details.
* Your inventions and innovations.
* Articles, books or software coding and programs. These are automatically protected by international copyright convention, but it is important to assert your ownership rights in the form of copyright notices.
* Sound recordings, films and broadcasts, and a new service concept (this might need both copyright and trademark protection).
* The combined knowledge base of yourself and your staff which can be extensive. Make sure staff clearly understand who owns the intellectual property developed in the course
of your business.
* If you are in business, or going into business with a partner, then clarify the ownership of any IP , since it could have considerable commercial value. The same applies to joint ventures and strategic alliances. If IP is created as a result of the venture or alliance, who owns it? Clarify this before you commit to the venture.

;Patent protection
Only a small minority of businesses will ever need patent protection. Get specialist advice on:
* How much the protection will cost in New Zealand and elsewhere and how effective it is likely to be. Can you realistically defend it?
* What value and competitive advantage will be added to your business. Will patent protection increase the value of your business in the eyes of lenders or buyers?

;Design protection
You can also register the design of an article but this protects only the appearance of something (for example, an ornament or book cover), not the materials used to make the object.

==New futures==
Part of innovating is being aware of new trends and developments that will affect the way we live, work and do business. Here are some glimpses:

;Web 2.0
Web 2.0 is not a new version of the internet, but instead describes a different way of thinking that is transforming the way the internet is used. Examples include websites where customers collaborate to create their own solutions or product. Two very successful websites illustrate
this process.

* TradeMe basically provided the engine and vehicle for the public to actually do the business amongst themselves, with the website charging for entries and taking a commission on sales.
* Under the banner ‘Broadcast yourself’, YouTube allows people to place their own videos online – YouTube sells the advertising traffic.

Of course the secret is to work out what Web 3.0 and 4.0 will bring!

;New business models
Some of the growing business models include:
* Selling information, products and services online. For example, buying software or e-books online rather than in packaged or printed form.
* Finding ways to support businesses that are growing very fast.
* Selling traffic, such as website traffic. If you can attract ‘eyes’ to your website you are in a strong bargaining position to sell links to other businesses.
* Thinking up new and more creative alliances with other businesses.

;Some thoughts to ponder:
* Traditional advertising will continue to fall; online advertising will increase.
* Young people are all connected – they will get jobs and have disposable income so the means to reach them may well be through their connectivity: the internet (relevant Web 2.0
websites like YouTube), cell phones, PDA s and Pocket PCs through technology such as RSS syndication.
* Innovation doesn’t have to be product. It could be the way it is delivered, packaged or presented. For example, people are still making money out of bottled water.
* The information explosion is intensifying: you can spend all day searching online, and never get all of it. People don’t want endless information – just the most relevant, opening up new possibilities for how content is delivered.

==What can you do?==
* Diarise to search online regularly for any trends that might impact on your business or delegate this task to an employee who is particularly interested in new or disruptive
technology and ask for monthly reports on interesting information.
* Subscribe to future trends computing and technology publications.
* Hold ‘future’ meetings with your staff to discuss emerging trends and the impact
on your business.
* Attend technology conferences.

;Summary
* Innovation is the responsibility of everyone connected with the business. All employees should participate in the process and make suggestions.
* To encourage innovation, you must accept mistakes and a little deviance.
* Rewarding great ideas is important. Nothing motivates like recognition and benefits.
* Start organised brainstorming sessions to encourage innovative ideas.
* Encourage feedback and ideas from customers, clients and suppliers.
* Brainstorm a range of business relevant topics to make best use of the knowledge and interests of your staff, including business environmental and work safety and health performance, and community interaction.
* Research what your competitors are doing and how you can differentiate yourself from them through innovation.
* Monitor the whole process of innovation from idea to results, and then assess its success.
* Identify the factors that keep enthusiasm, drive and excitement levels high in your business and support these factors.</text>

      <comment>Section is too advanced.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A lot of this would be better suited inside the book, when the decisions are relevant. To a newbie (me) they mean little at this point, and I'll more likely than not have forgotten it when it becomes important. - Bree


Again, this is an example of a mis-placed section.  It is far, far, too advanced to be at the beginning of this book.  It should be moved or removed right away.

='''Wikipedia in Education'''=
[[Wikipedia]] is a free online encyclopedia where anyone can add or edit articles. [[Wikipedia]] is an example of what has been called social software. This type of software is used to enhance collaboration, connection and communication (THE Journal, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;THE Journal (2007). Online collaboration: curriculum unbound! Retrieved March 1, 2011, from http://thejournal.com/Articles/2007/03/01/Online-Collaboration--Curriculum-Unbound.aspx?sc_lang=en&amp;Page=2 &lt;/ref&gt;. Students can develop their skills as consumers of information, so that they may compete in the global marketplace (Curtis, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, P. (n.d.).

Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://newlitcollaborative.ning.com/profiles/blogs/tpack-vignette-using&lt;/ref&gt;states that &quot;by approaching Wikipedia as a context for developing critical skills and dispositions for using information, teachers are embracing conditions that are a real part of their teaching world and enabling students to be better prepared to use information in productive ways.&quot;  Cathy Davidson (2007)&lt;ref&gt;DAVIDSON, C. N. (2007, March 19). We can't ignore the influence of digital technologies. Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory. Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://www.hastac.org/node/694&lt;/ref&gt; offers this summary: &quot;Wikipedia is not just an encyclopedia. It is a knowledge community, uniting anonymous readers all over the world who edit and correct grammar, style, interpretations, and facts. It is a community devoted to a common good, the life of the intellect.&quot;  [[Image:Wikipedia_-_Art_Historian.jpg‎|thumb|alt=A man says I edit in Wikipedia while standing in front of an educational chalkboard.|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeeperez/2453225976/in/set-72157604803121347/ I edit Wikipedia]]]

== Pros and Cons of Wikipedia ==
 
Although the use of Wikipedia continues to grow, in certain areas caution needs to be exercised. In a recent study the researchers found. &quot;Based on the opinion of the medical experts, Wikipedia entries were reasonably concise and current but failed to cover key aspects of two of the topics and contained some factual errors. Each reviewer found Wikipedia unsuitable for medical students. Wikipedia was the most accessible resource and the easiest resource in which to find information because the relevant topics were retrieved immediately upon searching. The other resources required the searcher to select from lists of entries&quot;(Pender et al, 2008) &lt;ref&gt;Pender, M. P., Lasserre, K., Kruesi, L., Del Mar, C. and Anuradha, S. (2008). Putting Wikipedia to the Test: A Case Study.  Seattle, Washington, USA, (1-16). June 16, 2008. [http://units.sla.org/division/dbio/events/conf_past/Seattle08/pender08.pdf Putting Wikipedia to the Test: A Case Study]&lt;/ref&gt;.  A second study &quot;does support the claim that Wikipedia is less reliable than other reference resources&quot; (Emerald, 2008) &lt;ref&gt;Emerald, 2008. Comparison of Wikipedia and other encyclopedias for accuracy, breadth, and depth in historical articles.  Emerald. Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1674221&amp;show=abstract&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in other fields such as history many have found Wikipedia to be &quot; the most important application of the principles of the free and open-source software movement to the world of cultural, rather than software, production. Despite, or perhaps because of, this open-source mode of production and distribution, Wikipedia has become astonishingly widely read and cited. More than a million people a day visit the Wikipedia site. The Alexa traffic rankings put it at number 18, well above the New York Times (50), the Library of Congress (1,175), and the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica (2,952). In a few short years, it has become perhaps the largest work of online historical writing, the most widely read work of digital history, and the most important free historical resource on the World Wide Web&quot; &quot; (Rosenzweig, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, R. 2006. Can History Be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past. Journal of American History. Vol. 93 Issue 1, p117-146 &lt;/ref&gt;. Comparison studies of Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica have shown little difference in the number of errors between science related materials. “Experts in the specific fields found some factual errors, omissions or misleading statements. In the end, Wikipedia had 162 such problems, while Britannica had 123”(Terdiman,D., 2005)&lt;ref&gt; Terdiman, D., (2005). Study Wikipedia as Accurate as Britannica.  Retrieved March 1, 2011 from http://news.cnet.com/Study-Wikipedia-as-accurate-as-Britannica/2100-1038_3-5997332.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It appears that no matter what resource you are using, you may still encounter errors. The question is not if you should use Wikipedia, but how should you use it. “Students should never use information in Wikipedia (or any other online encyclopedia) for formal purposes (such as school essays) until they have verified and evaluated the information based on external sources” (Wikipedia, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia:FAQ/Schools. (n.d.). Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Schools.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
==== Advantages of Wikipedia ====
According to Doug Johnson, Mankato Public Schools Director of Media and Technology, there are good reasons to use Wikipedia over other encyclopedias. They include the following:&lt;br /&gt;

* It has a wider scope with far more articles than traditional encyclopedias.
* It has more up-to-date information on timely topics.
* It presents information in a manner familiar to its Web 2.0 generation user.
* Conventional and undocumented information is included but is noted as such (Johnson, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. (2006). 21st century information fluency. Retrieved March 1, 2011, from http://21cif.com/rkitp/curriculum/v1n5/dougjohnson_v1n5_wikipedia.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

== How to use Wikipedia in the Classroom ==

* Wikipedia, like any encyclopedia, is a great starting place for research but not always a great ending place (Wikipedia, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia:FAQ/Schools (n.d.). Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Schools&lt;/ref&gt;.
* A Wikipedia entry should not be “used as a source of truth but as a springboard to further inquiry” (Crovitz and Smoot, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Crovitz, D., &amp; Smoot, W. S. (2009). Wikipedia: Friend Not Foe. English Journal, 98.3, 91-97. Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/archival/EnglishJournalArticle2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 
** Students can search Wikipedia for information that interests them, look for gaps or missing information within a page, propose questions, find research, and finally make editing or addition contributions to the Wikipedia page.
** With this process, students will be actively engaged in material that is interesting to them, they will take a turn teaching the world, and they will increase research and writing skills.  
* When elementary and secondary students are researching history, Wikipedia is a decent place to start.

'''Core War''' is a programming game, based around a variation of assembly language known as Redcode.  In a standard game of Core War, two or more programs are placed in a circular region of memory with the objective of causing the other program to fail.  

The Redcode language was first described in a 1984 publication, ''Core War Guidelines'', and was since updated with new instructions in a draft released in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Core War programs are written in a programming language known as Redcode.  Redcode does not have access to direct input or output.

== Opcodes ==

Each opcode in Corewar contains three components: The instruction, register A, and register B.   In the core, each memory section contains exactly one opcode, and provides no independent numbers.  

The registers A and B are relative addresses, described in the Address modes below. 

{| 
!Opcode || Description
|-
|DAT A,B || Data; executing this instruction kills the task. 
|-
|MOV #A,B || If one is immediate, copied immediate number to B.  
|-
|MOV A,B || Moves instruction at A to B.  However, if A is immediate, copies the immediate number to B. 
|-
|ADD A,B || Adds A to B.  
|-
|SUB A,B || Subtracts A from B. 
|-
|MUL A,B || Multiplies A and B to produce the result.
|-
|DIV A,B || Divides B by A.  Division by zero kills the process.
|-
|MOD A,B || Modulus of B in A.  Division by zero kills the process.
|-
|JMP A,B ||  Jumpts to A.
|-
|JMZ A B ||  If *B is 0, jumps to A.
|-
|JMN A,B ||  If *B is not 0, jumps to A.
|-
|DJN A,B ||  Decreases *b.  If non zero, jumps to A. 
|-
|CMP A,B ||  If *a == *B (or if immediate, #A == *B), skips an instruction
|-
|SPL A,B ||  Creates a new task, which starts at B. Newer task starts first. 
|-
|SEQ A,B || Skips past the next instruction if A and B are equal. 
|-
|SNE A,B || Skips past the next instruction if A and B are not-equal. 
|-
|SLT A,B || Skips if *A &lt; *B.  (88 only)
|-
|XCH A,B  ||  At A,  swaps A and B.  (extended only)
|-
|PCT A,B ||  At A, Protects operands from changing, until an instruction is written to that address.
|-
|NOP A,B || Has no special effect (although operands are still evaluates.) 
|-
|STP A,B || Stores A into P-Space at location specified by B. 
|-
|LDP A,B || Retrieves data from P-Space at location specified by B into A.
|}

== Address modes ==
Each opcode listed above contains two registers.  These registers are composed of both a number and an address mode:
{|
| # || Immediate. The number is directly in the opcode.
|-
| $ (or none) || Direct.  The opcode points to a cell relative to the current cell. 
|-
| @ || Indirect. The opcode points to a cell relative to the current cell.  That cell's B value is added o the indirect pointer, to provide the target.
|-
| &lt; || Indirect, but the intermediate register is decreased before use.  
|-
| &gt; || Indirect, the intermediate register is increased after use.
|-
| * || A-field Indirect. The opcode points to a cell relative to the current cell.  That cell's A value is added to the indirect pointer, to provide the target.
|-
| { || A-field Indirect, but the intermediate register is decreased before use.  
|-
| } || A-field Indirect, the intermediate register is increased after use.
|}

== Special commands ==

{|
| END || Stops compilation, further lines are treated as comments.
|-
| ORG || Takes one parameter, which identifies the start location.
|-
| PIN || Specifies P-Space identifier.  If equal, the two programs share P-Space.  
|-
| &amp;lt;label&gt; EQU &amp;lt;A&gt; || Replaces all instances of &amp;lt;label&gt; with &amp;lt;A&gt;.  
|}

== Instruction modifiers ==
{|
| .A || A -&gt; A
|-
| .B || B -&gt; B
|-
| .AB || A -&gt; B
|-
| .BA || B -&gt; A
|-
| .F || A-&gt;A and B-&gt;B
|-
| .X || A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A
|-
| .I || Entire instruction. 
|}

== P-Space ==
P-Space is a private storage used by programs across multiple runs of a program, that cannot be directly accessed by the opponent.  However, attacks by programs can trick other programs into corrupting the P-Space region

In the opcode listing above, there are two instructions that can read and write to P-Space: STP and LDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generic Programming is a style of programming where algorithms and other programming bits use unspecified data and class types. This means that one could write a function such as Multiply&lt;T&gt;(T a, T b) and later pass on an integer as a and b, or a long integer, or any other type of variable. This is most useful in strongly-typed languages, as weakly-typed languages have no need for them.

Exporting is an exciting and potentially profitable activity for both exporter and customer; advances in technology have made the process much easier for all parties involved.

However, your decision to export should not be made lightly; it ought to be part of a long-term vision and the result of an informed appraisal of the domestic and international market. Sound advice for most businesses is that you should not consider exporting until your business has achieved success and been in the domestic market for some time, because it is only after those in overseas markets see your commitment to the product or service that they will add their efforts to your venture.

==An export plan is a must==
Once you’ve decided you would like to consider exporting, success is more likely if you thoroughly research and plan the process. You then need to put together an export plan as an extension of your business plan. Your first contact for help with planning and research should be New Zealand Trade and Enterprise which offers a wide range of resources to help you. To make contact phone the Enterprise Hotline on 0800 555 888 or visit the www.nzte.govt.nz website. You’ll find a fuller profile of this government organisation at the end of this chapter.

The planning process will help you identify your weaknesses and threats and devise strategies to minimise their effect. Testing the product or service, as well as various marketing and distribution strategies in your home market will help your exporting efforts. Exporting is expensive so a strong domestic market will help to finance your entry into overseas markets and to sustain the company until exporting generates a profit.

Your initial export plan may consist of an informal proposal of what you want to achieve and how you will make those goals a reality. A more formal export plan will probably be required by your bank, financial institution or possible business partner to allow them to understand what you are
trying to do and how their assistance will help achieve that vision.

If you are extending your existing business plan to include the export of your product or service, consider

* How you will deal with agents, distributors, staff and even customers at a considerable distance.
* What factors could lead to changes of your products or services (in form, function and/or distribution)?
* How you will cope with cultural and language factors when you deal with overseas intermediaries, customers or consumers.
* How you will assess the costs of pre-entry research, market entry, the cost of staying in the overseas market and growing that market.
* Are there any unique trade or product expectations in the target country? For example, product or packaging ‘take-back’.

You should plan for success, but also have a plan to deal with foreseeable hurdles.

==Which market should you target?==
Knowing where to export to can sometimes be the hardest decision. Based on your knowledge of your products or services, and trends in the industry, you are likely to have some indication of target markets, or you may have a gut feeling. Once you have an idea of where you could export, it becomes necessary to test your beliefs.

Some people prefer a very formal analysis to test their assumptions. They may rank countries on a number of variables (such as political stability, proximity to domestic market, culture, etc.) from information gathered from the internet, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and other professional organisations.

Others may conduct a more informal evaluation, which involves talking to business people and using market intelligence (information sourced from the world around them).

For many New Zealand exporters, Australia might seem the most logical first choice as an export market because of its similar business culture and the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement which makes New Zealand-made goods duty free.

However, Australia has proved a tougher market than expected for many exporters and it may well be that other markets are better suited to your product or service. It’s important to get expert help in identifying potential overseas markets and to be aware of the potential for diluting your focus by trying to penetrate too many markets at once.

Selecting markets may also include personal considerations, such as your preferences and knowledge of markets. Some exporters choose countries that they like to visit because frequent visits are necessary to develop an overseas market, not only to negotiate and finalise contracts, but also to swap knowledge and build relationships.

==Finding trade information==
An integral part of any export process is collecting and processing a lot of information. Use the internet first: you can gain much useful trade information from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s website www.nzte.govt.nz or from overseas government sites like the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s site www.dfat.gov.au where you’ll see how products and services are promoted offshore.

All overseas markets have regulations that you need to understand. Overseas regulations relevant to New Zealand exporters usually relate to:

* import duties
* sales and other taxes
* legal requirements
* sanitary, health and environmental requirements
* standards (such as ISO 9000 or ISO 140001 compliance) that relate to quality and product recycling requirements
* testing or other forms of certification
* labelling and packaging.

;Sources of help
To avoid shipment delays or expensive penalty and storage charges you need to comply with all local regulations. New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, international freight forwarders and the experiences of other exporters are the best sources of information on requirements for exporting goods into particular markets.

In addition to New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, New Zealand’s Chambers of Commerce help to facilitate international trade. They are an excellent source of help for export trade beginners as well as those well versed in exporting and/or importing.

The services are typically funded by membership levies, so it is well worth joining your local Chamber of Commerce. The services range from passing on trade enquiries, locating potential customers and identifying trade shows, right through to documentation enquiries, including the issuing of Certificates of Origin and advice on special documents and certification procedures.

Your local Chamber of Commerce can also help you with letters of introduction that can open doors in overseas markets. Such letters can form part of your market entry method and strategy.

==Market research==
A common cause of general business failure is lack of proper market research. If you intend to export, thorough market research is even more vital to your success. The two main reasons for market research are:

* to understand your market as fully as possible
* to minimise your risk, particularly important in the case of exporting, since you are dealing with a distant market.

;Primary and secondary research
Use both primary and secondary market research before you begin your export drive.

Primary research involves direct contact with your market in the form of visits from you or a key staff member to the target market. You can also enlist the help of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and possible agents or distributors (if you choose to make either of these part of your plan) to help investigate potential demand for your products and services.

Use the internet as much as possible for secondary market research (information about the target market, rather than direct contact with that market). Data is available from such
sources as:

Overseas government departments and publications (try to find the local equivalent to Statistics New Zealand (www.stats.govt.nz) for demographic and population data). Use
search engines to find their websites.

* Your local library which should have overseas trade directories, international publications and a range of other useful resources.
* The aim of both your primary and secondary market research is to answer these questions:

The aim of both your primary and secondary market research is to answer these questions:

* Is there a demand for our products and services in the target market?
* Is this demand sustainable?
* What competition will we face?
* What can we charge for our products and services?
* Is there potential profit?
* Where should we locate, or which areas of the target country should we concentrate on?

==Reaching the market==
Most New Zealand exporters will initially work through agents or distributors, eventually considering other options such as undertaking direct selling or promotion, or seeking alliances
and agreements.

The internet is another means of entering a market, but is usually part of a wider strategy of how you enter the market. These decisions will be greatly influenced by market size, the type of goods or services you are offering and the amount of control you wish to maintain over a targeted overseas market. Options include:

;Agents and distributors
You could choose a local representative, such as an agent or a distributor, to co-ordinate your export efforts. The difference between the two is that in the case of an agent you employ or contract the agent to work for you. The customers are yours but you must meet the agent’s costs. A distributor, however, buys your product from you and on-sells it, giving you less control over the whole process.

;Direct control of the market
Establishing an office overseas is the best idea to gain control and increase the efficiency of your overseas operations, but this is an expensive undertaking and one not recommended for inexperienced exporters.

Some control can be gained using e-business techniques such as email and the use of the internet for ordering and purchasing. The downside of these technological applications is that they do not allow for personal selling, which is only achieved by face-to-face contact—an approach particularly valued in some Asian societies.

E-business also means orders have to be sent directly from New Zealand; with a permanent base overseas, economies can be achieved by sending over a bulk product shipment and storing the excess.

;Distance selling
This method works best with specialised products. Some of the most common methods used for distance selling include selling goods from a catalogue, which are held in a centralised warehouse. Additionally, infomercials, financed by your company and screened on television can be used to display the features and benefits of your product.

;E-business
The internet offers you numerous benefits, including an efficient means to communicate and co-ordinate your operations. E-business through the internet has considerable
future potential.

Developing an export e-business means that your transactions and payments take place on line, supply and distribution are co-ordinated electronically, and the marketing function is
performed over the internet. All exporters can make some use of e-business, but it is more suited to some products and services than others.

For example, e-business is very suitable for exporting intellectual property products such as software, where the customer anywhere in the world can download your product off the internet and pay you by credit card.

;Other possibilities
Your export plan should include options beyond the conventional definition of exporting. That is, you should consider also the possibility of establishing contract manufacturing, selling franchises, participating in a joint venture, making licensing agreements, selling intellectual
property or forming strategic alliances.

;Contract manufacturing
This involves another firm making your product or part of your product under a contractual agreement. Essentially this is a customer – supplier relationship where you define and control the specifications. The job of selling the finished product still remains your responsibility. 

A key reason for undertaking contract manufacturing is to reduce the cost of manufacture and/or your distribution costs. Manufacturing in the country you wish to sell your final product may also overcome bureaucratic barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas.

;Franchising
This option should only be considered once you have a proven product or service concept with a good track record in New Zealand; it requires the sale of the product or service and the systems and training practises to make that product or service work.

A franchise allows you to expand your business at minimal capital cost because it is usually the franchisee that bears the majority of costs. However, there are development and on-going costs for such things as refining your business system so it can be duplicated and offering training
and support to your franchisees.

Some of these costs can be recouped from franchise fees, but many business people still underestimate the management skills, time and commitment needed to establish a successful
franchise chain.

;Joint ventures
A joint venture involves you combining with an overseas enterprise for mutual benefit. This strategy is common between New Zealand companies and businesses overseas as a means of overcoming trade barriers.

;Licensing
If your business owns inventions, technologies, software, manufacturing systems and artistic material, to name just a few examples, then licensing these products or services for production in other countries is a possibility.

;Royalties
Royalties typically involve selling your intellectual property to someone else who will use it to make the product or enhance existing products. Every time a sale is made, the seller of the intellectual property receives an agreed amount, or royalty.

;Strategic alliances
These are similar to joint ventures, but strategic alliances are usually entered on a less formal basis, for a shorter period of time and often focus on a niche part of the market. These alliances are particularly beneficial for small companies, who can align themselves with much larger companies with superior operations.

==The exporter’s market mix==

;Branding
Branding is vital in overseas markets; it encompasses your product or service, packaging, promotion, price and distribution. Some of these aspects may need substantial alteration to those used in New Zealand. A very good way to see what works in the overseas environment is to assess what your competitors are doing – a little market research will help you here immensely.

;Promotion
For many business people, promotion conjures up images of advertising, but this is often prohibitively expensive and does not reach the target market. Effective use of public
relations may be more useful, particularly if you can gain mention in professional or specialist trade magazines.

A website is also a great way of informing your market about your products and/or services. But you should only use a website if you are prepared to regularly up-date by adding new content and changing any outdated content. Ease of use and interactive features are also a good idea. Assign a staff member to keep the site current and deal with emails at least
once a day.

Some more traditional options include in-market promotion that allows customers to either see the product in use or try it out themselves. A consultant based in the targeted overseas market who understands the local culture and ways of doing business is the best person to advise you on effective promotion. Participation in trade shows is also a tried and tested method of promotion.

;Pricing
New Zealand Trade and Enterprise advises the use of value-based pricing, that is, price your product or service at the price the market will bear. Again, market research is essential for finding out what your competitors are charging for similar offerings; don’t underestimate this task because it is not easy to increase price in a market or under a particular contract.

When you do finally decide on a price, it is a good idea to consider costs at home and anticipate other costs you may incur; make sure these costs are covered by the price you
decide to charge. If your products or services have to be priced in the currency of the target overseas market, or in US dollars, make sure you consult your bank for protection against currency fluctuations, which can seriously erode the profitability of your exports.

;Place (Distribution)
Understanding freight and delivery options may save you and your business a lot of money. Your chosen delivery method will depend on the type and value of your product, the urgency of the order and the market developments. Most large shipments and bulk exports travel by sea, but more products are leaving our shores by air. The increasing popularity of fresh or chilled, value added and specialised products has influenced this trend, as has the demand for fast delivery, however with the growing awareness around climate change you may need to consider the potential impact of ‘carbon miles’ on your distribution costs.

Negotiating in a different environment While luck undoubtedly has a place in business, it is usually knowledge of the potential market and clients that gives you an edge over competition. Knowing the idiosyncrasies of a culture can make all the difference to your sales pitch. 

In different cultures, different people wield decision-making responsibility; your task is to identify exactly who these people are and how you can reach them. Often negotiations can
be unlike what you are used to: they may be drawn out over several days, could involve meeting the boss’s family, an exchange of gifts and/or entertainment.

It is important that you have some understanding of local values and customs if you intend negotiating deals in overseas markets. For example, some cultures will never say ‘no’ directly, they may use a variety of ways to convey their lack of agreement; it is also possible that a person could say ‘yes’ to a deal, but actually mean ‘no’.

It is not unheard of, particularly in Eastern culture, to agree to a contract, meaning that the utmost will be done to achieve the terms, but in reality the people agreeing are all aware that the contract will never be fulfilled. This is not necessarily bad faith; it could simply be the accepted way in that culture not to hurt your feelings through outright rejection.

Failure to understand these cultural nuances could obviously lead to a general deterioration in the relationship because the two parties involved—yourself and the overseas party—could end up believing you’ve agreed to very different things.

==Summary==
There is enormous potential to grow New Zealand’s presence in the global market, but to make the most of your opportunities it’s important that your products and services have
been well proven in the New Zealand domestic market.

You also need to undertake thorough research of the particular culture and industry which you have targeted since this will allow for the production of a better export plan.

Consider too the product or service itself and any possible adaptations that may need to be made to make it more appealing to the export market. Promotional methods abroad and even branding may have to be very different to those used at home.

You might need to alter your pricing not only to cover extra costs, but to pitch your goods at a level the market will bear. If such a price does not cover your costs then your target market may not in fact be the correct market to focus on.

Finally, the distribution method needs to be assessed, particularly in the case of products: how do you intend to get your products to market?

Plan for success, but consider also how you will overcome possible hurdles.

This section deals with how goods are to be produced. If you do not manufacture anything (for example, if you operate a pure service business) then you can skip this section. It is
therefore concerned with organising and controlling the production function. The aim is to ensure that goods are made in the right quantities, at the right quality, at the right time and at the right cost.

The operations section helps you to answer the following questions:
# What sort of product will you produce?
# What plant or machinery do you require?
# Where will you locate your business?
# How will you organise the production sequence of the product to maximise profitability?
# How will your staff impact on design and production?
# What stocks of raw materials are needed?
# How can you use resources more efficiently?
# How do you make sure that you are in control?

As you work through these questions you will realise that they are interrelated and that the answer to one question impacts on all the others. The questions concern the operations section that, more than any other area, has the potential to dictate the profitability of the business.

Operations is about throughput. This involves the transformation of inputs such as raw materials into outputs, that is, sales. Remember that business is about generating sales. Producing inventory doesn’t make a successful business; producing, selling and getting paid does.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Python is obviously a prerequisite for using PIL. The current version of PIL is 1.1.7, and this supports Python up to v.2.6. Support for Python 3 will be added soon.

PIL is available from PythonWare at [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ this page]. Source code can be built for any platform, and Windows binaries are available. 

==Installing PIL==

===Windows===

To install on Windows machines, go to the page given above and download the appropriate binary executable for the version of Python that you have. Run this executable and follow the instructions given by the installer.

===Linux===

On Linux, you can either compile the source yourself, or install using your package manager. For Debian-based systems, apt-get can be used:

 sudo apt-get install python-imaging

===Mac OS X===

To install on a Mac OS X system , visit http://pythonmac.org and download the relevant .dmg file and install as any other application.

==Using PIL==

Once install you need to import the PIL modules you want to use. Basic functions are found in the &lt;tt&gt;Image&lt;/tt&gt; module, so the following will work:

:&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import Image
&lt;/source&gt;

You can then access functions as usual, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;Image.load(filename)&lt;/tt&gt;. Uses of the other modules available are given in the [[../Overview|overview section]], and these are imported in exactly the same way.

This section deals with how goods are to be produced. If you do not manufacture anything (for example, if you operate a pure service business) then you can skip this section. It is
therefore concerned with organising and controlling the production function. The aim is to ensure that goods are made in the right quantities, at the right quality, at the right time and at the right cost.

The operations section helps you to answer the following questions:

# What sort of product will you produce?
# What plant or machinery do you require?
# Where will you locate your business?
# How will you organise the production sequence of the product to maximise profitability?
# How will your staff impact on design and production?
# What stocks of raw materials are needed?
# How can you use resources more efficiently?
# How do you make sure that you are in control?

As you work through these questions you will realise that they are interrelated and that the answer to one question impacts on all the others. The questions concern the operations section that, more than any other area, has the potential to dictate the profitability of the business.

Operations is about throughput. This involves the transformation of inputs such as raw materials into outputs, that is, sales. Remember that business is about generating sales. Producing inventory doesn’t make a successful business; producing, selling and getting paid does.

==The product==
From your marketing research you should know the type of product you want to sell.

;What are the product’s specifications?
Outline in detail what it is that you aim to produce or sell. This will help when it comes to buying equipment or if you wish to subcontract a part of the production process.

For example: Carbonated liquids must be bottled in the right type of bottle with the right cap so as not to lose fizz.

;Product design
There are many opportunities for manufacturing efficiency that are intrinsic to your product’s design. What you decide at the design stage can either limit or open up opportunities for manufacturing efficiency and end-of-life disposal. Examples include:
* Minimising the amount of material resources used in the product while retaining functionality (‘dematerialisation’).
* Designing a quality, durable product.
* Maximising the proportion of recyclable materials in the product. For example, this may mean avoiding composite materials where possible.
* Minimising the use of hazardous substances. There are in many cases acceptable non-hazardous alternatives that fulfil the same function.
* Designing recyclable product packaging.

For more information, search the internet for Design for the Environment (DfE).

;Should you make everything yourself?
It does not always make sense to try and manufacture the whole product yourself.

It often makes more sense to subcontract a part of the manufacturing process or buy in ready-made parts.

For example Imagine you are a soft-drink manufacturer. Should you subcontract the printing of the labels or should you purchase your own printing press to print the labels?
In this example the answer is obvious (subcontract the printing). However, this is not always the case.

To help decide which part of the process to subcontract, ask yourself these questions:

;Should you subcontract?
* Can the subcontractor manufacture to a competitive price and to your specifications?
* Is the subcontractor able to deliver at the times you require?
* Does the subcontractor have competitors who could carry out
the contract if required?
* This part of the process is not strategically important to your business (answer Yes if this statement is true).
* This part of the process is not your core competitive advantage (answer Yes if this statement is true).

For example, in the case of the soft-drink manufacturer it may be feasible to subcontract the bottling process because the distribution and marketing of soft drinks is the company’s core competency.

If you answered yes to all the above questions then subcontracting may be a real option. If you only answered yes to one of the questions you should probably manufacture it yourself.

==The plant==
This is important for all businesses. The design stage is your first and best opportunity to ensure that unnecessary product, materials and energy waste is minimised.

In the case of a restaurant, for instance, the design might detail the flow of how people will enter, where they will sit, what form of lighting is most efficient and should include the mapping of how meals will be assembled.
 
Obviously the type of business you plan will dictate the type of plant you require. A retail store will need items such as display racks and mirrors as well as cash registers. An office-based business will require chairs, desks, computers and printers. A manufacturing concern will require processing equipment and so on.

There are specific stages to this part of the section.

;a) Designing the process
This is important for all businesses. In the case of a restaurant, for instance, the design might detail the flow of how people will enter, where they will sit and should include the mapping of how meals will be assembled.

In the case of a bottling plant, the layout will need to take account of the most efficient flow of materials and operational processes.

For example

[[Image:Flow diagram.jpg|frame|This image is to be replaced with a new version by March 2010]]

Remember also to consider the broader issues of health and safety in your work environment when you’re considering your processes. It is a good idea to contact the Occupational Safety and Health (OS H) service of the Department of Labour for further health and safety details and guidance (see www.osh.dol.govt.nz for details of your nearest OS H Information Support Officer). Then incorporate their requirements and recommendations into your plan.

;b) Machinery required
Now detail at each stage of the process what plant and machinery is required. Write the specifications and the approximate cost of each item. Try to be as specific as possible and do not overlook any necessary piece of equipment, including health and safety equipment
such as dust extractors, guards on machines and safety signage. Consider also the ongoing maintenance and running costs of machinery. For example, energy efficient machines will have a lower running cost.

;c) Capacity of each stage
It is important to identify the capacity of each stage of the process. Note that you can only produce as fast as the slowest part of the process.

In the above flow diagram, the capping machine is the slowest machine in the process. If this machine operates at 1,000 bottles per hour, then this figure effectively sets the overall rate of production for the whole process.

;d) Establish the area required
Now it should be possible for you to gain an indication of how much space you will need. A simple way to do this is to make a scale drawing of how much area each piece of plant
and machinery requires. Then arrange the drawings into the sequence that you decided upon in the flow diagram. This should give you an idea of the overall production area you require.

Remember to allow space to receive shipments, store stock, greet customers, display goods, manufacture products, do office work, and so on.

For example:

[[Image:Flow diagram2.jpg|thumb|This image will be replaced by a new version by March 2010]]

;e) Special requirements and licenses

If you plan to produce a food product you will require premises capable of being licensed for food production. Your plant and machinery might also have to meet special requirements such as stainless steel fittings.

It is important that you contact your local council to ensure that you will be able to meet all the legal requirements to operate and obtain the necessary licences. Alternatively, if you are already in business, you should check that you are complying with all legal requirements.

==Locating the business==
The choice of location may very well be one of the factors most critical to the success of your business.

The factors that help determine your location are complex and require a great deal of thought.

Your market research should play an important part in determining the location. Then again, because most commercial properties have leases that are fixed at multiples of a year, you need to be sure you have chosen correctly because you might be stuck there for a considerable period of time.

Here are some of the questions you need to work through:

;1. Cost of location?
The cost of rental is an important factor. Having already decided on how much space you require, you can now work out the cost of that space in different locations. For example, choice of location is critical if you are a retailer as well as a manufacturer. You would need to confront issues such as:

* do you need extra parking for your customers, and
* do you locate in a mall or outside a mall?

;2. Where are the customers?
Do you locate as near as possible to your customer base or should you locate somewhere else? Should you freight your product to your customers or require them to travel to you?

Will they be prepared to do this?

;3. Availability and cost of labour?

If you require skilled labour to help operate your business is this labour available in the area you plan to locate in or can they easily travel to you?

;4. Availability of raw materials?
For most manufacturers raw material can easily be transported within New Zealand. It is the cost of transport that has to be considered. If your raw materials cannot sustain a high freight cost then it is probably best for you to locate as close as possible to the raw material supply.

This is especially important if your raw material is perishable. You may also need to think of the longer term availability and cost of raw materials. For example, petroleum based plastic resins will increase with the oil price.

;5. Availability of transport?
If your business were export focused or geared towards the overseas tourist market then it would make sense for you to be close to a port or international airport.

==Organising the sequence==
How will you organise the production sequence to maximise profitability? A manufacturing facility can be designed to produce one product or it can be designed to produce a range
of products.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''One product'''
|'''Multiple products'''
|-
| Large production runs
| Small batch production
|-
| Focused production process
| Flexible production facilities
|-
| Low number of inventory items
| Large number of inventory items
|}

There are advantages and disadvantages to both strategies. For example, if you are considering exporting, you may need large capacity. Many business people have developed export markets only to discover they cannot produce the orders requested.

Therefore, if you are considering exporting, you may have to dedicate the facility to produce reasonable volumes of a few products. The danger in this strategy is that if the market changes, your facility may lack the flexibility to produce other products.

==How staff impact on design==
We have seen that the availability of staff is a factor in influencing your choice of location.

You should also take staff into consideration when you design your process. Automating production processes is a method of reducing staff requirements, but this usually requires large amounts of capital.

When you design a manufacturing facility you should take into account the human needs of your staff. The facility should be spacious, well-lit and ventilated, feature good climate control and be free from fumes and excessive noise.

As mentioned before, you will need to meet specific health and safety requirements. However the design of the process should go beyond the minimum legal requirements to consider the ease of operation, that is, the relationship between the operator and the machine. Try imagining yourself doing the job, eight hours a day, five days a week, all year and for the pay you are prepared to offer. Would you be productive in the circumstances you have designed?

==What stocks of raw materials are needed?==
You should research potential suppliers well in advance of start up. Since New Zealand is a long way from the rest of the world, you should establish how long it would take for stock and inventory sourced overseas to arrive. If you are sourcing materials that might take months to arrive, you will have to hold enough raw materials on hand to ensure that you do not run out of stock. This can turn out to be an expensive exercise.

Even though local suppliers might be more expensive, they could save you the cost of investing in large inventories.

Large inventories soak up a lot of money. What some manufacturers do is maintain a minimum stock level and receive deliveries more frequently. This is called ‘just-in-time’ inventory management.

==Resource efficiency==
It is becoming more important to show your customers that you run an environmentally responsible business. So everything you can do to reduce waste and environmental damage will add to your credibility in the marketplace.

Also, resources cost you money to purchase so the more efficiently you can use them the lower your costs and the more efficiently your operational systems function. For instance, $10 saved in costs can be the equivalent of $100 earned in sales. The simple equation is: Materials Waste = Unnecessary Cost.

Some key resources where you can make savings are:

;Energy
Through simple actions businesses can easily save 10 percent of their energy costs.

Visit www.emprove.org.nz for more ideas and information.

;Water
There are simple things you can do to ensure you are not losing water or using too much. When purchasing machinery check the energy efficiency rating and other efficiency considerations such as use of water. More efficient machinery reduces your on-going running costs.

;Packaging
Minimising the amount of packaging you use on your products often brings additional benefits.

For example, you can reduce the original packaging cost and fit more product into a transport container. Other steps you can take include:

* increasing the recycling content in packaging
* ensuring that packaging can be recycled by the customer
* minimising the amount of packaging you get from a supplier.

If possible, try to get reusable containers from your suppliers as this saves you the cost of disposing of their packaging.

;Transportation
Significant cost savings can be achieved through careful travel planning to minimise distance and time spent travelling. Choosing energy efficient vehicles will also assist savings.

;Waste
Waste is an often unrecognised cost to your business, so use the waste hierarchy shown below throughout all your operations to reduce waste.

[[Image:The waste hierarchy.jpg|thumb|This image will be replaced by a new version by March 2010]]

As the hierarchy shows, prevention in the first place has the most effect, followed by reduction, reuse and recycling. Putting in place the first four steps significantly reduces the need for the final step, responsible disposal:

For any waste produced, ask how can you:

* Eliminate the waste entirely?
* Reduce the amount of waste?
* Re-use or rework the waste?
* Recycle the waste?
* Responsibly dispose of the waste?

;Develop performance indicators (for resource efficiency)
Resource efficiency can both save significant costs and enhance your brand, but appropriate measurement is a pre-requisite to effective identification of savings opportunities and their subsequent maintenance. Financial indicators alone are not enough to monitor a sustainable business.

Take the time to develop manufacturing and process related indicators that cover environmental and social aspects of your business, as well as cost related indicators. Market
perception and demands are increasingly looking for indicators of both environmental and social responsibility, and you need to manage all key factors within your control that affect your business. Setting targets and tracking progress for a selection of key performance indicators
will help improve your competitiveness. (See Chapter 11 for some suggested KPIs)

==How will the whole process be controlled?==
Quality control is a critical success factor. Quality can be defined as meeting the customer’s stated, unstated and future needs. To meet these needs and to maintain a consistent quality of production you need to identify what the critical quality issues are and design tests that can be used to ensure that quality is being maintained.

For example: A problem that can exist in bottling plants is that a variable amount of liquid is placed in the bottles. Therefore a system has be designed to ensure that samples of bottles are taken at regular intervals and measured to establish if the right quantity of fluid is being placed
in each bottle.

Putting quality checks in place is very important if you are to ensure that customers receive a standard quality product. If something does go wrong, you need to fix the process itself so that it does not happen again.

There are various quality assurance programmes available to you. Check, though, that the cost of a particular programme does not outweigh the benefits. Contact your local manufacturers’ association (www.ema.co.nz) for assistance in this area. You could also contact a quality consultant, but take care in choosing the most appropriate consultant for your needs.

==The impact of e-commerce==
Remember the impact of e-commerce on your operations. For example, have you considered the following:

* Linking your production, inventory and sales systems to improve efficiencies such as lowering the amount of raw materials you hold?
* Sourcing staff via employment websites as an alternative to conventional staff sourcing?

In addition:

* Trade hubs and electronic markets may be able to put you in touch with suppliers that you have never previously considered
* You may be able to contract out parts of your production via the internet 
* Some customers may demand that you integrate electronically with their production systems
* Some customers will not buy off you unless you can pay and generate an invoice electronically.

All of these issues will become more and more important in your business as e-commerce becomes another way of doing business (until eventually the ‘e’ will be dropped as these
procedures simply become standard business practice).

==Summary==
Manufacturing management is an important part of your business planning. If you are in business, inventory control and production planning are critical to ensure that you can meet customer demand, but do not over-invest in raw materials and inventory.

Developing and regularly monitoring a key set of performance indicators is critical to maintaining your manufacturing efficiency and your competitiveness. These indicators need to be resource as well as cost based, and should be related to your unit production (e.g. per widget).

Production planning needs to be carried out to ensure that your products are produced, and customers serviced, in the most efficient manner. If you have an existing plant or process, never assume that it is running at maximum efficiency. Periodically re-examining everything you do is a sound way of identifying what could be done to improve the efficiency of your business.</text>

Confirmed Na’vi words and affixes are listed here in alphabetical order. ''Ä'', ''ì'', ''rr'', ''ll'', ''ng'' (= ''g''), ''ts'' (= ''c''), ''kx'', ''px'', ''tx'' are ordered as distinct letters from ''a'', ''i'', ''r'', ''l'', ''n'', ''t'', ''k'', ''p'', ''t''. Frommer's preferred orthography, with ''g'' for ''ng'' and ''c'' for ''ts'', is included in parentheses to allow electronic searches. Stress is indicated in [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription: The stress mark {{IPA|‹&amp;nbsp;ˈ&amp;nbsp;›}} appears ''before'' the stressed syllable, and syllable breaks are marked with a dot. Prefixes and adpositions which cause {{navi|Glossary|lenition}} are marked with a plus sign, ''ay+, −ro+''. Infix positions of verbs are marked in italics by ''•raised dots•''. Many of these are assumed rather than attested. Stem-changing words (short plurals, verbal contractions, genitives) are included; many short plurals are assumed rather than attested. 

Underlying {{IPA|/n/}} is spelled 'm' before 'p' in compound words, as in ''txampay'' (''txan-pay'') &quot;sea&quot;. However, before 'k' it is spelled 'n', as in ''zenke'' (''zene-ke'') &quot;not need to&quot;, despite the fact that it is pronounced {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and that this sound is spelled 'ng' before 'k' within a root such as ''pängkxo'' &quot;chat&quot;. 

The vocabulary can be greatly expanded through productive use of Na’vi's word-building affixes, but such forms have not been included here unless they are attested in print or email from Paul Frommer.

==What business structure should you choose?==
In order to trade and open bank accounts for your business, you need to choose a business structure. This comparison of three most commonly used business structures in New Zealand will help you decide which structure best suits your business.

;1. Sole Trader
A sole trader operates a business on his or her own. The trader controls, manages and owns the business and is entitled to all profits but is also personally liable for all business taxes and debts.

Usually a sole trader can establish the business without following any formal or legal processes and can employ other people to help run the business.

Many New Zealand businesses start as sole traders and then progress to the company structure as the business grows. Others form companies right from the start to take advantage of the protection and other benefits offered by the company structure.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Advantages'''
| '''Disadvantages'''
|-
| Easy to start and to run
| Sole traders can lack credibility in the marketplace
|-
| No registration is required
| Can be harder to attract loans and investment or sell the business
|-
|
| Owners have unlimited liability for all business taxes and debts, putting their personal assets at risk
|-
|
| The business only lasts the lifetime of the sole trader
|}

;2. Partnership
Partnerships have been common among professional people and in the farming industry.

In a partnership two or more people run a business together. 
Each partner:

* Shares responsibility for running the business as well as in any profits or loss equally, unless the partnership agreement states otherwise
* Is liable for any debt within the partnership.

Many partnerships are established with a formal partnership agreement.

The partnership itself does not pay income tax. Instead it distributes the partnership income to the partners. The partners then pay tax on their own share. For more information on tax obligations visit the Inland Revenue’s website at www.ird.govt.nz.

Once the standard (and required) business structure of professional people (lawyers, doctors and accountants), partnerships are no longer as popular as in the past since the company structure is now open to professionals and arguably offers better protection.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Advantages'''
| '''Disadvantages'''
|-
| Can be an effective way to share business operation costs (e.g. several professional people operate out of a joint office)
| Partners may be liable for debts incurred by other partners, putting personal assets at risk
|-
| No registration is required to start a partnership
| Possible partnership conflicts or complications if a partner dies or wishes to leave the partnership
|}

;3. Limited Liability Company
A company exists as a formal and legal entity in its own right. It is separate from its shareholder(s) or owner(s) – the person or group of people who own shares in the company. Companies can be registered (incorporated) online through this website www.companies.govt.nz.

The limited liability company has proved to be the most popular and successful form of business structure. Companies help foster confidence in businesses by governing the
relationships between investors (shareholders), directors and creditors and by giving stakeholders a clearer picture of who and what they are dealing with.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Advantages'''
| '''Disadvantages'''
|-
| Limited liability advantages and greater chance of protecting personal assets since the shareholders’ liability for losses is limited to their share of ownership of the company.
| Limited liability advantages can be reduced by the need to provide personal guarantees to lenders or creditors. Protection can also be eroded if the company has been trading while insolvent or is considered to be ‘trading recklessly’.
|-
| As a separate legal entity, the company can endure beyond your ownership or lifetime.
| Directors need to clearly understand their responsibilities towards the company and its stakeholders.
|-
| Easier to sell the business or pass it on to others as it is a separate entity and investors can buy shares in the entity.
|
|-
| Can be easier to attract funds and investment (investors can become shareholders).
|
|-
| More credibility in the marketplace as the business structure can seem more ‘professional’.
|
|}

==Other Business Structures==
;Loss Attributing Qualifying Company (LAQC)
An LAQC is a variation of a company structure with a special tax status that allows you to offset any losses incurred in running your business against your personal income from other sources (such as investments).

;Trading Trust
Trading Trusts can offer benefits, but they are complicated and require expert advice. Discuss this option with your accountant and your lawyer to see if it is more appropriate for your needs than the business structures outlined above.

;Co-operative
A co-operative business is owned and democratically controlled by its shareholder/members (for example, a group of craftspeople). People (or entities) involved in a co-operative business choose to work together to achieve business goals that may not be possible or as easily
achieved through individual or separate effort.

The shareholders/members contribute the prime capital for the business and share in the profits of the business in proportion to their participation: the greater the participation, the larger the proportion of profits.

==Keeping on top of tax==
You will be doing both yourself and your business a great favour if you get on top of taxation issues right from the start. In the well-managed business there should never be an ‘unexpected’ tax shock because most taxation is predictable and therefore can be planned for, especially if you consult with your accountant and get free training.

;Benefits of keeping accurate records
There are good legal business reasons for keeping accurate records. Here are three:

;1. Better control of your business or organisation
Accurate records will help you determine whether your business is making enough money to meet its expenses. They’ll show you what you’re spending money on and where the money is coming from. This will help your budgeting and decision making.

;2. Increase your chances of getting finance or funding
Good record keeping shows you’re running the business in a professional manner. This makes it easier for others to know whether to invest in your business or project or loan you money.

Accurate records make it easier to put a good case together.

;3. Save time and money
The more up-to-date your records are, the quicker you’ll get through your tax returns and other paperwork. If you’re doing the day-to-day bookkeeping, your accountant won’t have to spend valuable time (that you’re paying for) getting your books in order. You can use the accountant’s services instead for more specialised tax and financial advice.

;Consider accounting software
Get help from your accountant in selecting and setting up a suitable accounting system for your business that will enable you to track tax and predict your obligations. You may wish to start with a simple manual system, but upgrading to accounting software can help you gain better financial control of your business. Here’s why:

* You can download your bank statement details from your bank’s website directly into your accounting program, eliminating the need to enter all the data manually. This is a great timesaver and can cut down on errors and make it much easier to reconcile bank statements with your cash book.
* If you need to make any changes to figures, totals will be automatically recalculated.
* Provided you keep your data entry up to date, you can generate instant reports, such as budgets, GST reports, profit and loss accounts, etc. These allow you to see at a glance your GST and other tax obligations.

;Tax in a nutshell
You have four basic tax obligations.
# Register for correct tax types depending on your situation (such as GST, PAYE, FBT.)
# File tax returns by the due date.
# Pay the amount required by the due date.
# Make sure what is stated on the returns is accurate.

;Getting help
Inland Revenue offers a free business tax information service to businesses.

Their advisors will tell you:

* which taxes you need to know about
* what records you need to keep
* how to complete your tax returns (for example, GST and employer returns)
* when to file returns and make payments.

To find out more about these services or to arrange an appointment, visit www.ird.govt.nz or freephone 0800 377 774.

;Paying income tax
The amount of tax you pay is based on your net profit. This is your business income (all the goods and services you have sold) less the expenses used in gaining your business income.
You need to submit a tax return every year.

;The balance date (tax year)
The standard financial (accounting) year for most businesses begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March, so this means you need to have your accounts up-to-date by 31 March, the balance date, so you can work out the profit you’ve made and the amount of tax you need to pay.

Your tax return is due by 7 July.

If you want a balance date other than 31 March, you must apply to Inland Revenue in writing, stating sound business reasons for the change. You can’t use another balance date until you have written approval from Inland Revenue.

;Your first year in business is not tax-free
A common misconception is that your first year in business is tax-free. If you make a profit at the end of your first year in business you will owe tax, but that tax can’t be accurately assessed until you or your tax agent has completed your annual tax return.

So, although you may not be actually making tax payments on your profit during your first year, that year is still taxed. You will have to pay this tax by 7 February in the following year, or, if you have a tax agent, by 7 April.

;Registering for GST
You must register for GST if your business turnover (sales and income) is likely to exceed $60,000 in your first year of trading. A good tip here is to keep an eye on your monthly turnover. If it’s $5,000 or more, you should register for GST.

If your turnover will be below $60,000 then you can still choose to register for GST . However, as soon as you register, you can claim 12.5 percent GST on all your business expenses and purchases. (Of course you will also be required to pay 12.5 percent GST on all your business income and capital sales).

;Three options
When you register you have a choice of three ways to account for GST.

# Payments basis
# Invoice basis
# Hybrid basis (combination of the first two).

Get advice from your accountant or tax agent on which of these three options best suits your business.

;GST Tax invoices
To claim for GST, remember to keep proper tax invoices of all good or service you supply as well as invoices for all the goods and services you buy for the business.

Invoices must clearly show the words ‘Tax invoice’, include the name (or trade name) and GST registration number of the supplier, the date, a description of the goods and services and a statement that GST is included.

==Employing staff==
If you decide to employ staff, you must register as an employer. You can complete the online employer registration at www.ird.govt.nz or ask for the First-time employer’s guide (IR 333), which has an Employer registration (IR 334) form in it.

Your main responsibilities as an employer are:

* You must deduct PAYE from your employees’ wages, and pay the deductions to Inland Revenue either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of PAYE deducted by the business.
* Get new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration (IR 330). This tells you the tax code to use.
* Complete an IR 345 or IR 346 and send it with your payment by the due date.
* Deduct child support from employees’ wages, if required.
* Deduct loan repayments from any student loan borrowers who work for you, if required.
* Complete an Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) with the details of each employee’s deductions.
* Pay fringe benefit tax on any fringe benefits (perks) you give to your employees.

;Fringe benefit tax (FBT)
As an employer, you’ll have to pay FBT on most benefits (perks) given to your employees or shareholder-employees (including yourself). For example, motor vehicles; free, subsidised or discounted goods and services; low-interest loans; employer contributions to superannuation schemes and specified insurance policies.

Get more advice from your accountant or Inland Revenue’s Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409).

;Is your worker an employee or a contractor?
The tax laws are different for employees and self-employed people, so it’s really important you know whether the people working for you are your employees or are self-employed contractors.

This is not as obvious at it might seem, so get advice to avoid possible penalties.

Inland Revenue’s guide, Self-employed or an employee? (IR 336) can help you determine whether your worker is an employee.

==Compliance issues==
In addition to tax obligations, there are other compliance issues you need to consider in your business. Here’s a brief overview.

;Health and safety
A safe work environment leads to happier and healthier staff, and the resulting word of mouth that your business is a pleasant place to work in, will make it easier to recruit quality staff.

This in turn is likely to lead to better productivity and a better impression on customers and suppliers alike, helping to build credibility and a responsible image.

A good risk assessment and management policy will save you and your management team from unnecessary stress and worry and distraction from the day-to-day task of running the business.

Before you can manage or eliminate risk, you must first identify it. A good start is to request the free Basic Steps to make your workplace safer pack from the Department of Labour. (Locate your nearest Department of Labour office at www.osh.dol.govt.nz or phone (04) 915 4444).

This pack will help you to identify the risks and hazards in your business. Browse this website too for many industry-specific articles on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) topics.

;Manage with the help of your staff
As an employer, you are responsible for providing employees with specific training information and printed instructions regarding the hazards they are exposed to and the machinery or equipment you require them to operate. This should include maintenance instructions to keep equipment in a safe condition.

Meet with your staff to draw up a list of possible workplace risks and decide what you want to do with them.

Your choices are to eliminate, isolate, minimise or manage the risk. For example:

* Replacing a slippery floor surface with a non-slip surface eliminates the risk
* Placing a guard around moving parts of a machine isolates the risk
* Making a dangerous goods shed off-limits to all but selected staff manages the risk
* Good safety practices and requiring everyone to wear hard hats on a building site minimises the risk.

;Resource Management Act
The Resource Management Act was designed to promote sustainability in managing New Zealand’s natural and physical resources. It brings together laws governing land, air and water resources and concentrates on the environmental effects of human activities. The RMA sets out how we manage our environment, including:

* Air, water and soil
* Biodiversity
* The coastal environment
* Noise and light
* Subdivision and land use planning in general.

The Ministry for the Environment is responsible for administering the RMA and ensuring that it is being implemented effectively. Visit the Ministry’s website www.mfe.govt.nz for more details on the Act.

Contacting the planning section of your local or regional council to see if your planned activities will require a resource consent, and the way to go about it.

;Accident insurance
ACC is the sole provider of work injury cover for employers in New Zealand. ACC covers all New Zealanders every hour of every day for personal injuries caused by accident.

As an employer you are responsible for providing workplace accident cover for your employees, and for shareholder-employees. The particular scheme that applies to employers is called ACC Workplace Cover and is paid for by means of a levy (formerly called a premium).

ACC levies are calculated according to your:

* industry classification
* liable earnings (based on your payroll records).

From historical records, ACC determines the risk levels of various industries, and sets the levy rate accordingly.

;Reducing levies
If you join an ACC Workplace Safety Management Practices programme you can reduce your levies by between 10 and 20 percent. You can also reduce levies by joining an ACC Partnership programme. For more details of what is involved, contact ACC for an information pack.

Note that ACC can also penalise workplaces with negligent or poor safety records by adjusting ACC levies upwards.

;Cover for the self-employed
If you’re self-employed, you pay a levy for ACC CoverPlus. This provides up to 80 percent cover of your last year’s earnings in the event of a work or non-work related accident that prevents you from working.

Levies are calculated in a similar fashion to WorkPlace Cover as already outlined. However, if you are earning substantially more in this current year than you did last year, you can apply for ACC CoverPlus Extra. For example, you might have earned only $10,000 last year (and this was an unusually low amount), but are likely to earn $50,000 this year out of your business.

In the event of an injury, 80 percent of $10,000 (what you earned last year) may not be enough to pay your bills. To prevent this possibility, you can negotiate with ACC to pay an extra levy to obtain the CoverPlus Extra service. There are conditions (including being able to prove your higher earnings this year), so speak to your accountant or contact ACC for the ‘ACC CoverPlus Extra’ information booklet.</text>

      <comment>/* Reference */ Documenting change made to [[Template:NaviHW/headword]] on 15 March 2010.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;This template is used for formatting headwords in [[Na'vi]].

== Reference ==
The following reference of template arguments likewise applies to {{tl|NaviHW}} and {{tl|NaviSE}}, used for headwords and subentries respectively. Each template renders the dictionary entry in a different way; also, {{tl|NaviSE}} does not, by default, include an anchor for {{tl|NaviSA}}.

The first positional template argument defines the word's lexical category (or part of speech); all remaining positional arguments are interpreted depending on this argument. The word category can also be left empty.

Thus, empty positional arguments are perfectly fine; for instance, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yomt||ìng&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; would mark first and second affix at the same word position, between ''t'' and ''ì''.

In addition to the positional template arguments, the following optional, named arguments exist. Each of these arguments can be left undefined, though some arguments may show different behavior when they are defined but deliberately left empty (for instance, “&lt;tt&gt;anchor&lt;/tt&gt;”).

:{| class=wikitable style=&quot;max-width:67%&quot;

|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;anchor&lt;/tt&gt;” || Name for anchor to be used with {{tl|NaviSA}}. If this argument is defined but left empty, no anchor is created. If it is “&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;”, the headword itself is used as anchor. For {{tl|NaviHW}}, the default is to use the headword as anchor; for {{tl|NaviSE}}, the default is to not create an anchor at all.
|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;ipa&lt;/tt&gt;” || IPA transcription for the headword. This should not include the slashes “/…/” as these are rendered automatically.
|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;sa&lt;/tt&gt;” || Shortcut for producing the headword with automatic inclusion of {{tl|NaviSA|''argument''}} as headword description. This can be used when the headword or subentry is only introduced to reference the real definition elsewhere.
|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;sn&lt;/tt&gt;” || Scientific notation per Frommer. This should be the scientific transcription of the headword only and will be added in parentheses.
|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;src&lt;/tt&gt;” || List of source abbreviations for this entry. Examples might be: “SG” for the ''Survival Guide,''&lt;ref&gt;''Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora'' by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. ISBN 978-0-06-189675-0.&lt;/ref&gt; “FE” for e-mails from Dr. Paul Frommer, “AG” for [[w:James Cameron's Avatar: The Game|Avatar (the game)]], “AF” for [[w:Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar (the film)]], etc.
|}

Additionally, when “&lt;tt&gt;sa&lt;/tt&gt;” is used, all named template arguments of {{tl|NaviSA}} are accepted as well.

== Examples ==

The following examples demonstrate the use of {{tl|NaviHW}}.

Each industry has its unique characteristics. This chapter will help you identify the critical success factors for your industry type. A better understanding of these influences will help you focus on what is most important to your success. Each section concludes with a summary and suggests some key performance indicators that will help you benchmark your performance and set improvement goals.

Industries covered in this chapter include, service, retail and manufacturing, tourism and specialist businesses.

==Service businesses==
Service businesses make up by far the largest category of businesses in New Zealand.

Here some are of the key success factors for service businesses.

;Credibility and risk reduction are critical
If you plan a service business, you need to do as much as possible to build up your credibility and reduce the customer’s perceived risk in doing business with you. This means building your reputation as quickly as possible through sound work practices, always acting with integrity and exceeding the customer’s expectations.

Steps you can take to enhance your credibility include keeping a record or ‘brag file’ of all the work you have completed and collecting customer feedback to display in your promotional material and your website.

You can also offer a guarantee and try to ‘become the expert’ in your line of work. This is also why a good website can be important for your service business. You can feature samples of your work, customer feedback and projects completed.

;Tangibility is critical
Unlike retail or manufacturing businesses, service businesses often have little tangible (touchable) evidence to show prospective customers until the job is done or the results are in.

They can’t come into your business and physically inspect one of your products as they can with a retailer.

Because tangibility is so important, it can be a mistake to choose cheap stationery and promotional material (including your website). Your brochure is the equivalent of customers handling a product in a shop, so make sure that all your promotional material is high quality and professionally designed so it builds confidence in your business.

People will judge you on it.

;Outstanding service is critical
Word of mouth referrals can be critical to start-up service businesses, and these are likely to come as a result of excellent service. Focus on:

* quality and reliability
* delivering on time and within budget
* keeping your promises
* communicating well with customers.

;Networking is critical
Combating isolation can be a challenge for start-up businesses, particularly those that start from a home office. Consider investing time in establishing effective business networks.

* Join your industry or professional association
* Locate and join local business networks (locate the nearest Economic Development Agency through www.edanz.org.nz for information)
* Consider community organisations as well such as Rotary, Lions, and Zonta

In addition to helping you combat isolation, these organisations can also be a source of business contacts and allow you to build your business networks.

;Connectivity can be critical
Because you are in a service business, customers or clients will expect you give good service.

This means being available to your customers as much as possible. Make sure that you have efficient communication lines.

* Speak to your communications provider to ensure you have sufficient phone and fax lines and good internet connectivity
* Ensure you can distance work efficiently if necessary (stay in touch with people via mobile phone or laptop)
* Ensure customers can find information (such as in a FAQ section) on your website.

;Time management is critical
All service business owners essentially sell their time, so the potential revenues of the business are theoretically limited by the chargeable number of hours each year. The way you manage your time is therefore critical because you need to maximise the number of hours you charge out.

The (realistic) number of chargeable hours in a year is a natural ceiling on the turnover of your business unless you can:

* increase prices by adding more value to your services
* employ others so you can leverage off their time
* franchise your business concept when it is a proven success.

It clearly makes sense to get someone in, or at least subcontract some of the work (such as the bookkeeping) to specialists and give yourself more time to market your business properly and earn what you’re really worth.

Environmental indicators may include:

* Transport fuel efficiency e.g. fleet, driver fuel efficiency, air miles/staff member
* Office related energy use (e.g. kWh/m2). 

Try to benchmark your performance against the industry average (your accountant or bank manager may be able to supply these) as well as against your previous performance.
Set improvement targets for the next period (month or quarter).

==Summary==
* A service business is built on customer satisfaction and your personality.
* Guard your reputation carefully and support it through customer feedback and testimonials. Keep a brag book of accomplishments (on your website too).
* Give high priority to establishing your credibility and reducing risk for your customer.

==Key Performance Indicators==
For each sector, sample indicators are provided. For more information on sustainability KPIs, see the Global Reporting Initiative (http://www.globalreporting.org)

==Service business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)==
Consult your accountant or financial advisor about the key performance indicators (KPI s) you need to monitor in your service business, including key resource related performance indicators.

The following KPIs can be important:

* chargeable hours (number of hours billed out each month)
* monthly sales per employee (including yourself)
* number of new customer contacts made each month
* referral rate (how many new customers you gain through word of mouth referrals is an excellent measure of customer satisfaction)
* conversion rate of enquiries into sales
* gross profit percentage (helps you monitor your profit margins)
* net profit percentage (helps you monitor office overheads (running costs).

Environmental indicators may include:

* Transport fuel efficiency e.g. fleet, driver fuel efficiency, air miles/staff member
* Office related energy use (e.g. kWh/m2).

Try to benchmark your performance against the industry average (your accountant or bank manager may be able to supply these) as well as against your previous performance.

Set improvement targets for the next period (month or quarter).

==Retail businesses==
;Location is critical
For most retailers, location is the single most important factor, so it can be worth spending the extra money to be in a good location. Do your homework thoroughly.

* Are you in a prime area for your particular target markets?
* Is your business dependent on passing trade (such as a coffee shop) or can you exist as a destination business (a specialist business that people will travel to)?
* How convenient is it for passing motorists to stop near your shop?

Check out the foot and vehicle traffic very carefully before you sign a lease for your premises. 

Ask other retailers in the area as well as two or three estate agents the following types of questions:

* Are you in an area with a growing population?
* Is your part of town going ahead and becoming trendy, or is it becoming unfashionable?
* What new roading or zoning proposals are there for the area?
* How will these affect the area? (Have you spoken to the local council or regional authority about area plans?)

;A lease can be critical
Be careful about committing yourself to a long-term lease before you fully understand the retail potential of your site. If you really can’t afford to be in a prime location (such as in a mall), then to attract people to your shop you’ll have to be a lot smarter in your marketing. Before you sign up for a location in a mall, speak to retailers to learn the pros and cons of mall trading.

Remember also to consult your lawyer and accountant before you sign any documents.

;Street appeal is critical
Street appeal is important in attracting customers. People prefer to shop in modern, well-lit premises because they feel good in attractive surroundings. If necessary call in specialist shop designers to give your shop and signage the image you want to project.

What image do you want your store to portray? How do you plan to match your store image to your target markets?

For example, a bank should be quiet, solid and peaceful; a nightclub should be buzzing, loud and vibrant. The whole point of image and atmosphere is to create an environment for the shopper where they feel comfortable parting with their money.

;Merchandising success factors
Merchandising is about attention to detail and making it easy and appealing for consumers to buy the goods you want to sell. Think what you expect to find or see when you walk into a particular type of store. What encourages you to buy? What discourages you from buying?

;Locating your products
Every store has a physical layout that makes moving around in it either easy or hard. Work towards a layout that combines ease of shopping with maximum exposure to all product lines.

If you find certain products are slow movers, consider changing the way they are presented, or change the position in the shop. Group complementary products beside one another.

;Staff training is critical
Your staff should:

* wear name badges, dress professionally and be welcoming
* be empowered to make decisions without having to consult you all the time
* be trained to cross sell and upsell and be knowledgeable about your products.

;Customer lifetime value is critical
Make sure staff understand customer lifetime value, which includes the referrals that customers can provide. Emphasise the importance of cultivating long-term relationships with customers to enhance lifetime value.

;Service is critical
Service is one of the few areas where the small business can out-compete the larger business.

Advertise your shopper conveniences such as free delivery, gift wrapping, guarantees, etc. Make sure customers see and understand these benefits. Unless you’re a discounter, focus on the value you offer, not the price.

What can you do for your customers that larger retailers can’t be bothered to do? For example, deliver, install, train and fix what you sell.

==Summary==
For many retailers location is the single most important factor.

* Do your homework thoroughly before choosing your location
* Get outside help on revamping your external street appeal: does it pull people in?
* Atmosphere, image and effective layout can greatly enhance your store appeal
* Attention to detail and customer circulation are important
* Make it as easy and pleasant as possible for the customer to do business with you
* Compete against the bigger retailers on your own terms, not theirs. They do have weaknesses, particularly in the area of service
* Make a list of all the things you can do better than large retailers and start implementing them.

==Retail business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)==
Consult your accountant or financial advisor about the key performance indicators (KPI s) you need to monitor in your retail business remembering to include some key resource related performance indicators. 

These KPIs can be important:

* Customer visits (foot traffic in store)
* Conversion rate of enquiries into sales
* Average sale value per employee (sales skills and efficient cross selling or upselling can lift the average sale value)
* Sales analysed by product lines
* Gross profit percentage (helps you monitor your profit margins)
* Net profit percentage (helps you monitor business running costs).

Environmental indicators may include:

* Shop related energy use (kWh/m2)
* Weight of waste disposed to landfill costs (weekly or monthly).

Try to benchmark your performance against the industry average (your accountant or bank manager may be able to supply these) as well as against your previous performance.
Set improvement targets for the next period (month or quarter).



&lt;big&gt;''''''==Manufacturing businesses==
;Distribution channels are critical

How will you get your products to market? Few manufacturers sell their products directly to the consumer. As a manufacturer, you usually have little contact with the final user—you are more likely to on-sell to a middle person who distributes or retails to the end user. So marketing your
business is very different from normal retail operations.

This means you need to spend time developing and nurturing your distribution channels.

For example, will you distribute through:

* agents or distributors
* wholesalers
* online sales on your website
* your own factory shop
* opening a branch office (perhaps overseas)?

Consider how much control each method will give you, and also how effective the distribution channel will be. For example, you usually have more control over the activities of an agent, and less over a distributor (who may also sell other products and prefer to focus on the higher margin products). Consult your business advisors about the best options for your business.

;Transport and logistics are critical
It is also important to consider how you will get the products to these distribution channels and consider the timing and costs of this process. If you intend to export your product then read again Chapter 8 – Exporting

;Production is critical
Efficient control of production is central to any manufacturing business. This includes your ability to negotiate well with suppliers of raw material and locate alternative or backup suppliers if necessary.

;Quality control is critical
Quality and reliability establish your credibility and reduce risk in the eyes of customers. You may also need a quality certification to gain business. For example, some city councils or overseas businesses might insist on ISO 9000 (or similar) certification before they will buy from you.

Show customers that you have some quality control and efficiency systems in place. This means (at minimum) having documented systems in place that record quality processes and standards. An added spin-off for your business is that these systems make it easier and faster to train new staff and help ensure quality is sustained at high levels.

;Personal selling ability is critical
Personal selling is vital in manufacturing businesses, or for anyone who does not deal with the final consumer. Most of your time will likely be spent in trying to find good distributors (both here and overseas) or effective retailers who will hold your product and on-sell it. These contacts can make or break your business, and it can take time to establish a good relationship.

;Advertising is less important
Advertising plays only a small part in the marketing of most manufacturing businesses. This is because you might only have 10 customers who buy off you in bulk so there’s little point in advertising to mass media such as newspapers and radio, unless you have the funds to support a brand-building exercise—and that excludes most small manufacturers.

The only time you would consider mass media advertising is if you wanted to make the end user aware of your product—but that is really up to the distributor or retailer to do for you (that’s why you sell to them at trade prices!).

To find new distributors you might advertise in the specialised trade or industry magazines and journals, but many manufacturers will be able to hunt down and identify potential new distributors through other means that cost very little (such as Yellow™ book or online or internet searches).
You can then direct mail these distributors or potential customers and then follow up the direct mailout with a phone call.

;Strategic alliances are critical
All manufacturers can benefit from strategic alliances and joint ventures, for example:

* With other manufacturers: allowing you to pool expensive resources and share development or R &amp; D costs on new products.
* With suppliers: to lock in your supply chain.
* To build your credibility with customers (‘Our strategic partners include...’).
* To allow you to pitch or tender for work you would be unlikely or less likely to secure on your own.

;Being visible is critical
It’s important to make yourself visible to others, and also to know how to find other businesses you can sell to.
* Can others find your website? Test how easily and quickly it can be found, and if the results are unsatisfactory, make improvements.
* Ensure you’re in the business directories where other businesses go looking for supplies, for example, the Yellow Pages (printed and online), plus other business directories such as UBD or any industry-specific directories.
* Get listed on regional and national business-to-business (B2B) databases and also international online B2B web search directories and databases (search Google to find them and also check the Resources section at the end of this book).
* Search all these databases to locate businesses you can sell to.
* Join the Manufacturers’ Association and/or your local Chamber of Commerce. These organisations often lead trade missions overseas, and also host overseas missions. Find out the latest calendar of events.
* When you travel overseas, search local directories and try to visit Chambers of Commerce.
''''''&lt;/big&gt;



&lt;big&gt;'''==Summary==
* Developing and nurturing an effective distribution chain is critical to success
* In marketing a manufacturing business, you rely on personal, relationship selling and sales promotions, so get some training if necessary
* Advertising typically plays a relatively small part unless you sell direct to the public 
* Keep on identifying, developing and grooming your distribution chain
* A good website is a great asset for a manufacturer. Make sure you can be found
* Concentrate on developing effective sales promotions and incentives
* All manufacturers can benefit from developing strategic alliances
* Get as much free publicity as you can and develop positive PR with your customers
* Quality control is an important part of establishing your credibility and reducing risk for the buyer.
'''&lt;/big&gt;



&lt;big&gt;''''''==Manufacturing business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)=='''

Consult your accountant or financial advisor about the key performance indicators (KPI s) you need to monitor in your manufacturing business, including some key resource related
performance indicators. 

These KPIs can be important:

* Productivity levels (identify and remove productivity constraints)
* Quality improvements (rework costs and reject or returns rate)
* Cost of raw materials
* Sales analysed by product lines
* Sales activity though each distribution channel distributor, retailer, online, etc.)
* Gross profit percentage (helps you monitor your profit margins)
* Net profit percentage (helps you monitor office overheads (running costs).

Environmental Indicators may include:

* Weight of waste disposed to landfill costs (weekly or monthly)
* Weight of waste recycled

Try to benchmark your performance against the industry average (your accountant or bank manager may be able to supply these) as well as against your previous performance.
Set improvement targets for the next period (month or quarter).
'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Tourism businesses==
All types of tourism businesses need to understand the key drivers behind the tourism sector.

This means understanding both the domestic and inbound (international visitor) markets and monitoring the growth of each.

;Understanding your target market is critical
Research how travellers arrive in your area.

* Do they come in tour groups or as independent travellers? Are they mainly local or international travellers?
* How long do they stay in your area and what do they choose to do?
* Who sells them their tourism packages and what or when are their decision points?

The answers to these questions will help you design your products and services to meet customer expectations.

;Understanding the distribution chain is critical
Make sure you understand how the industry works. Here’s an example of a typical tourism distribution chain:

[[Image:Tourism distrobution chain.jpg|thumb|A new version of this image will be updated March 2010]]

So the sequence is:

# The customer consults a retail travel agent about their holiday and gets a catalogue of products such as tours and accommodation packaged for travel agencies by an overseas tourism wholesaler.
# The customer arrives in New Zealand to follow a local itinerary organised by a local inbound tour operator on behalf of the overseas wholesaler.
# The inbound tour operator subcontracts buses, planes and trains to deliver the customer to you to experience the product you supply.

;The internet is more direct
Compare this to the increasingly popular option of internet booking:

[[Image:Internet distribution chain.jpg|thumb|a better version of this image will be loaded March 2010]]

The internet model cuts out all the intermediary stages (and commissions), providing a compelling reason for you to consider an attractive website with good rankings and links from key portal sites so you can be found easily and conveniently.

Once you understand the distribution channels, you can start making some plans to get included in travel catalogues and local activity brochures. Do some market research to find
out what reference guides tourists prefer who are looking for what you offer, for instance, New Zealand Bed &amp; Breakfast Book, AA Guide book or other guides such as Jasons, Lonely Planet, Let’s Go or the Rough Guide series.

;The influence of time is critical
It is important to identify and communicate regularly with the key travel wholesalers, inbound tour operators and travel agents who can influence tourists to buy your product. Aim to be featured in as many brochures, books or websites as possible, but bear in mind that few start-up tourism businesses can achieve this immediately.

Your new tourism businesses must build credibility and reduce risk in the eyes of the customer and also the other organisations in the distribution chain.

For example, if you’re starting an adventure tourism business such as kayaking, abseiling, or white water rafting, travel agents and other ‘connectors’ will be wary of recommending you to their customers until you’ve established a track record as a safe, experienced operator who offers value for money. This will not happen quickly!

;A quality brochure is critical
A brochure can be the single most effective means of selling your business, so don’t skimp on the cost of developing a really effective brochure. Go to a tourist information centre and look at how the brochures are displayed.

* How much of each brochure or flier can you see on the racks? If it’s only the top third then concentrate on this portion.
* Would yours stand out? How can you make it stand out?

==Summary==
The key success factors in the tourism industry are to understand where your customers come from, what they want and how they find you (the distribution chain).

* Be aware of commission structures when you set your prices and don’t undercut your distributors if tourists want to deal directly with you.
* Regard other people and organisations in the distribution chain as your sales force and treat them well. Make it easy for them to deal with you.
* Tourism is a networking industry: join your regional tourism organisation and develop relationships vigorously.
* There are many opportunities for joint ventures and strategic alliances. Look for ways to share costs, develop convenient packages for tourists and work cooperatively with others.
* Develop quality promotional material, including a website and feature feedback from satisfied customers.
* Be an excellent host and ensure your staff also deliver an outstanding experience.
* Look after all your markets: domestic as well as international. Look for innovative ways (such as attracting special interest groups) to combat seasonality.

==Tourism business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)==
Consult your accountant or financial advisor about the key performance indicators (KPIs) you need to monitor in your tourism business, including some key resource related performance indicators. 

These KPIs can be important:

* Bed occupancy rate (for accommodation type businesses)
* Enquiry and sales sources (internet, brochures, travel agents, etc.)
* Conversion rate of enquiries into sales
* Average sale value per employee (sales skills and efficient cross selling or upselling can lift the average sale value)
* Sales analysed by product lines
* Gross profit percentage (helps you monitor your profit margins)
* Net profit percentage (helps you monitor office overheads (running costs).
* Water use per customer (e.g. litres/bed-night etc)

Environmental Indicators may include:

* Energy use per building area (kWh/m2)
* Energy use per customer (e.g. kWh/bed-night)

Try to benchmark your performance against the industry average (your accountant or bank manager may be able to supply these) as well as against your previous performance.
Set improvement targets for the next period (month or quarter).

==Specialist industries==
In addition to these businesses there are numerous other specialist industries. This chapter concludes with a brief look at some of the critical success factors that influence these industries.

If your particular industry is not amongst them, based on what you have read in this chapter,

* identify and focus on the success factors for your business
* list the key performance indicators (KPI s) for your particular business. Get help from your accountant or financial advisor if necessary

These steps apply to most businesses:

* join relevant industry or professional associations
* subscribe to magazines both printed and online
* attend industry-related events and fairs to keep up to date and extend your networks
* take advantage of any government or local cluster groups. Belonging to a cluster group can be a stimulating way to extend your business contacts and grow your business. Contact New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (www.nzte.govt.nz) or the nearest Economic Development Agency (www.edanz.org.nz) for details.

;Critical factors for IT businesses
* A real point of difference (competitive advantage)
* Speed to market
* Joining cluster groups or forming strategic alliances to gain resources, skills and promote rapid development
* Intellectual property protection
* Ability to scale up the product to larger markets
* Awareness of competitive emerging technologies
* Better access to markets, particularly overseas markets
* Ability to attract investment capital and identify investors who have the right marketing expertise, connections and international networks (see Chapter 7)
* Latest technology and keeping up to date with IT developments.

;Critical factors for biotechnology businesses
* Long and complex development process to market-ready (product can become obsolete through competing technology)
* Investment capital for R &amp; D productivity and funding years of development
* High cash burn rates (can require up to four or five times more cash than other businesses)
* Intellectual property protection
* Overcoming approval processes and regulatory issues
* Social issues (for example, acceptance of controversial research areas such as stem cell research)
* Business acumen, not just scientific brilliance
* Strong entrepreneurial environment
* Ability to turn science into a commercial product
* Alliances are critical, as are clear agreements on funding, resources and skills, IP ownership and expected outcomes
* Location in/near cluster groups or close to leading research institutes or universities for access to ideas and cross-fertilisation.

;Critical factors for nutraceutical businesses
All the factors above, plus:

* Quality standards and scientific credibility
* Clear and compelling benefit for the product
* Unquestionable efficacy and safety
* Awareness of health trends, concerns and issues (such as eating patterns)

;Critical factors for agricultural or horticultural business
* Sustainability of operation, including environmental impact.
* Awareness of location, climate and soil (for example, ‘terroir’ for winemaking)
* Crop or cultivar selection
* Knowledge of markets and distribution channels
* Export requirements and logistics: packaging, refrigeration, logistics, marketing
* Benchmarking to industry KPIs, for example:
:* Dairy: kilograms of milk solids
:* Beef and sheep: number of stock units, pasture management

;Critical factors for marine farms
* Sustainability and environmental impact
* Resource management consent
* Location and climate (exposure to storms and high seas)
* Nutrient quality and water temperatures
* Knowledge of industry
* Growth cycles
* Biosecurity issues (contamination from sewer overflows, foreign invaders and marine biotoxins such as paralytic shellfish poisoning)

;Critical factors for forestry businesses
* Sustainability and environment impact
* Factors affecting crop growth (rainfall, soil and climate)
* Selection of tree species and planting stock
* Growth rate and quality of timber
* Accessibility to markets (truck and rail transport, distance to export harbour)
* Awareness and practise of latest forest management skills
* Financial projections over life of forest
* Discounted cash flow analysis for investors (key financial factors include the cost of the management regime, the revenue generated and the length of time between when expenditures are made and when the revenues are generated).</text>

[[Image:Booklet planning for the future.jpg|thumb|400px|]]

Most businesses need to carry out some longer-range planning (usually three to five years) in order to place shorter-term action plans into a broader strategic framework.

The direction for your longer-term action plans can be focused by such questions as “Where would I like the business to be in three (or five) years?” and “What do I want to be doing by then?”

The various business time horizons can be illustrated using a triangle:

[[Image:Future-planning.jpg|thumb|New version due March 2010]]

At the longer-term apex of the triangle you focus on broad concepts, strategies and direction. At the short-term broad base of the triangle, attention to day-to-day detail, especially with respect to cash movements, is the order of the day.

;Need for the longer view
Why should you look beyond one year out in your planning?

Probably the most important reasons are very practical ones:
* It is highly unlikely you can achieve everything you want from your business in 12 months
* Your investment, or at least part of it, will in many cases involve plant and equipment that has a payback period of two to three years, thus requiring you to think and plan beyond one year.

==The five stages==
How then does this longer-term planning process work?

It is easy if you see it as a five-stage process that is continuous. Progress needs to be reviewed and the planning direction adjusted as appropriate every year.

The five stages are as follows:

[[Image:5 stage plannnig.jpg|thumb|new version March 2010]]

==Day-to-day management of your business==
Many small business managers believe they prepare business plans, budgets and cashflow forecasts mainly to keep their bank manager happy. While there may be a requirement in this
area, the primary use of these important planning tools is to help you manage your business on a day-to-day basis.

Your projected income and expenditure and cashflow budgets are the tools that you use on a regular basis to measure if your business performance is meeting planned expectations. They will confirm for you on a regular basis that you are heading in the right direction. To run well, your business demands that you look and plan ahead and regularly monitor the important performance indicators.

What are the key indicators?

;1. Level of sales
Sales contribute a gross margin, which in turn pays for the fixed costs and hopefully leaves a profit. If sales levels fall then the overall margin to pay these costs is less.

;2. Gross margins
If you achieve lower than budgeted margins (perhaps because of offering discounts) you again have less to pay fixed costs.

;3. Monitoring fixed and variable costs
Make sure they do not creep upwards over time. Continually question if you need to spend money on that particular cost item. Regularly review key performance indicators.

;4. Debt collecting
Next to cash the money people owe to you is the most liquid asset you own. Make sure your cashflow forecast is not thrown out because you are slow to collect what is owed to you.

;5. Stock control
Your business will probably need to hold stock to maximise the level of sales. Make sure you do not hold too much.

==Potential problems and opportunities==
Regular availability and analysis of information relating to the key performance indicators of your business will allow you to identify potential problems and opportunities. In turn, this information will allow you to plan future direction better via developing positive management responses to these issues. Corrective or reinforcing action could take many forms depending on the nature of the problem or opportunity. 

Some examples are:

* Employing extra sales staff when a competitor’s failure creates a gap in the marketplace
* Changing suppliers when raw material quality decreases
* Refinancing to reduce interest costs when a loan falls due
* Negotiating a more flexible agreement with staff to achieve productivity gains
* Introducing a new stock control system to increase stock turns and improve delivery times.

The important point is that sensible management decisions cannot be made in any of the above examples if you, the manager, do not have access to information on the key areas of your business that is '''relevant''', '''timely''' and '''accurate'''.

Be warned, however. You will not be able to pre-empt all the problems that may beset your business. When the unexpected does occur, the secret is to be in a position to react quickly and positively with decisions based on factual information.

==Planning: present and future==
It goes without saying that unless you plan what your business is going to achieve it is difficult—if not impossible—to manage it effectively. It is therefore good practice to get into the habit of regularly thinking about the future of your business and to write down your key objectives and how you intend to make them happen.

This information can then form the basis for developing your performance indicators that become the benchmarks for measuring the daily, weekly and monthly health of your business.

==One final reminder==
Business planning has to be an on-going exercise if it is to reflect the dynamic, ever-changing nature of your business. So recognise that as your business grows and changes, you should return to the planning process at regular intervals.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">ROBOTICS

robotics- is the engineering science and technology of robots, and their design, manufacture, application, and structural disposition. Robotics is related to electronics, mechanics, and software.[1] The word robot was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term &quot;robotics&quot; was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction .

KINDS OF ROBOTS

humanoid-is a robot with its overall appearance, based on that of the human body, allowing interaction with made-for-human tools or environments. In general humanoid robots have a torso with a head, two arms and two legs, although some forms of humanoid robots may model only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots may also have a 'face', with 'eyes' and 'mouth'. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble a human.

Autonomous-robots which can perform desired tasks in unstructured environments without continuous human guidance. Many kinds of robots have some degree of autonomy. Different robots can be autonomous in different ways. A high degree of autonomy is particularly desirable in fields such as space exploration, cleaning floors, mowing lawns, and waste water treatment.

Some modern factory robots are &quot;autonomous&quot; within the strict confines of their direct environment. It may not be that every degree of freedom exists in their surrounding environment but the factory robot's workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. This can vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view).

One important area of robotics research is to enable the robot to cope with its environment whether this be on land, underwater, in the air, underground, or in space.

A fully autonomous robot has the ability to

    * Gain information about the environment.
    * Work for an extended period without human intervention.
    * Move either all or part of itself throughout its operating environment without human assistance.
    * Avoid situations that are harmful to people, property, or itself unless those are part of its design specifications.

An autonomous robot may also learn or gain new capabilities like adjusting strategies for accomplishing its task(s) or adapting to changing surroundings.

Autonomous robots still require regular maintenance, as do other machines.

Domain of Operation

Robots can be designed and built for any environment imaginable. One popular way of classifying robots is by what environments they're designed to operate in. Some typical examples include:STATIONARY-
    These robots are fixed in one place and cannot move. This category includes robotic arms, computerized machine tools, and most other Industrial Robots.
    Industrial Robots are robots used in mass production e.g. welding robots, CNC plate cutters or CNC drills. The large majority of these robots are stationary and tethered to a computer.

GROUND-
    These robots are designed to operate on the surface of the earth or other planet, and are usually sub categorized by their drive train:

        * Wheels
        * Tracks
        * Legs

UNDERWATER-
    Also known as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, these are designed to operate underwater, possibly at great depth.

AERIAL-
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are various kinds of robotic flying machines, including planes and helicopters.

MICROGRAVITY-
    Robots that have been designed to operate in low-gravity environments, such as earth orbit.

Degree of Autonomy

AUTONOMY-
is the quality of being self-controlled. One measure of autonomy is the amount of human control that is required for the robot's operation. An autonomous robot can operate properly without intervention indefinitely and can deal with unexpected problems gracefully. Teleoperated robots constantly require humans to send the robot control signals. These are only the endpoints; there is a continuum of possibilities between them.
A robot can also be classified by how self-contained it is. Power, logic circuitry, and other things may be located either on the main chassis or connected via a cable tether or wireless link from another location.

GOAL-
Robots are also routinely categorized by the goals they are designed to achieve. These include contests, personal enrichment, manufacturing, and entertainment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">.Yitro -  Jethro  Shemot/Exodus Chapters18-20
Isaiah 6:1-6, 9:5-6;  I Peter 2:9-10 &amp; I Peter 1:22

Jethro (Yitro), Moshe' father-in-law comes to meet with Moshe bringing his wife and sons to him.  Midian was a son of Abraham by his wife Keturah, whom he married after Sarah died and therefore he was a descendant of Abraham and he was a recognised priest of Midian.  Exodus 18:1-18

The Targum of Johnathan says,  &quot;I, thy father‑in‑law Jethro, have come to thee to be a proselyte; and if thou wilt not receive me on my own account, receive me for the sake of thy wife and of her two sons who are with her. And Mosheh came forth from under the cloud of glory to meet his father‑in‑law, and did obeisance, and kissed him and made him a proselyte; and they asked of each other's welfare, and came to the tabernacle, the house of instruction.&quot; (Section XV11)

Moshe then began to tell him all that Yahweh had done for them, of which he had heard some news in knowing of Moshe' return, and which had initially prompted him to come to him. The mighty power of Yahweh and His deliverance of His people had convinced Jethro   
&quot;And Jethro rejoiced over all the good which Yahweh had done unto Israel, and that He had given them manna, and the well, and that he had saved them from the hand of the Mizraee. (Egyptians)  And Jethro said, Blessed be the Name of Yahweh who hath saved you from the hand of the Mizraee, and from the hand of Pharaoh, and hath saved the people from under the tyranny of the Mizraee. Now have I known that Yahweh is stronger than all gods; for by the very thing by which the Mizraee wickedly would have punished Israel by (drowning them in) the sea, upon themselves came the punishment, in being punished in the sea. And Jethro took burnt offerings and holy sacrifices before Yahweh, and Aharon and all the elders of Israel. came to eat bread with the father‑in‑law of Mosheh before Yahweh; and Mosheh stood and ministered before them.  (Targum Johnathan Section XV11)

The Book of Jasher tells us that Yitro knew Yahweh from that day forward and that he stayed with them &quot;many days&quot;   (Book of Jasher 82: 5)

Although Parshat Yitro glosses over the intricacies of Moshe's parting with his father-in-law, the Torah details their dialogue in Beha'alotcha Numbers 10:29-32)  On his way to the land of Yisrael, Moshe confronts his father-in-lawYitro and implores him: &quot;...come with us, and we will be good to you, for Yahweh has spoken of bringing good on Yisrael.&quot;   Yitro declines. &quot;I will not go; but to my land and my family I will go -  &quot;

He has become a believer in the God of Yisrael. but not a partaker in the inheritance of the land.

The name Yitro is a title refering to a princely excellence and superiority and it can be used in the form &quot;His Excellency&quot;.  The name, itself, means he who conquers and reigns with Yahweh as a prince.  Yitro is said to be both a prince and priest of the land of Midian.  Moshe had the lead role in Yahweh’ plan to bring the Children of Israel into Canaan, but Yahweh placed men of wisdom around him; men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, and one of these was Yitro.  

It is said in Shemot 2:18, that the priest of Midian whose daughter Moshe married was Reuel.  Reuel and Yitro are one in the same.  Reuel means friend of Yahweh or Elohim.  It was used to describe the man.  The title Reuel was given as a description of what kind of man the father-in-law of Moshe was. Not many men in the bible were given the honor of being called a friend of God. 

In the book of Numbers, chapter 10 verse 29, he is referred to by the name of Hobab, which means beloved one, as in his designation as father-in-law to Moshe, and the name Raguel refers to Yitro’ title, which also means friend of God, see also Judges 4:11 for comparison.  So, we see a picture of this man that suggests he is a friend of God while yet at the same time is a beloved father-in-law to Moshe. His deep devotion and reverence to Yahweh leaps from the pages of the bible. The name Yitro means excellence, and it refers also to his character; Raguel and Reuel describe both his princely and priestly position in Midian and before Yahweh as a friend. 

As well as the name of Yitro referring to excellence, Yahweh also used him as a messenger. The elders that were appointed by Moshe would later become known as the San Hedrin. Yahweh spoke to Yitro to speak to Moshe regarding this matter.  It is of importance to note that the recommendations of Yitro became established as the Biblical model, and is the basis for divine leadership in the assemblies of God today. See the qualifications of an elder Titus 1:5-9; I Timothy 3:2; 3:4 &amp; 3:12; II Timothy 2:2; Acts 14:23; Ephesians 5:18.

Moshe had become work oriented.  As a committed, determined, hard worker, he gave himself completely to the people and it had become a 24/7 job.   He was a one man show, attempting to meet every need.  Moshe was overwhelmed with the work-load.   In addition to presenting himself before Yahweh to lead the flock, he had a wife and family.  Sometimes, we become so busy that we become ineffective in our own day-to-day lives.  We become so pre-occupied trying to work out the strategies and salvation of Yahweh’ people here on earth until we are of no Heavenly use.  When we think we're indispensable, and we try to do everything ourselves, we are unable to give quality time to all of our obligations and we expend ourselves. Whereas by delegating the workload there is a  spiritual multiplication which is the key to resolving a situation that no one else can fulfill.

The First Judges of Israel   Shemot 18:19-23

&quot;Now heed my voice, I shall advise you, and may Yahweh be with you. You be a representative to Yahweh, and you convey the matters to Yahweh.  You shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the path wherein they must walk, and the work they must do.  Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself and they shall bear the burden with you.  If you shall do this thing, and Yahweh commands you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.&quot;


At the Mount

This is the mount where Moses first had his encounter with Yahweh and his commission to lead the people out of Egypt.
These are the hills that he traversed during his time of exile from Egypt.      Exodus 3: 1
The scripture says that they came to Sinai on the same day that they left Egypt in the third month, having travelled exactly two months, that is on the first day of the third month..    (19:1-2)

The Targum Johnathan tells us that Moses went up the mountain on the second day to meet with Yahweh and brought back to them the terms of the covenant  and on the fourth day instructed them to prepare themselves for three days and sanctify themselves to meet with Him.  Exodus 19:3-9  -  cited in Targum of Johnathan in X1X
Now on the third month on the sixth day, the Book of Jasher tells us (to which the Targum of Johnathan agrees), Yahweh appears on the mount and gives them the covenant.  (82: 6)


You Shall be unto Me a Kingdom of Priests!

The Children of Israel could see a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Picture a cloud that extended vertically as a pillar and reaches up (like a tornado funnel) and touches down and makes landfall.  This incredible site was with the Children of Israel for forty years as a great funnel reaching from the heavens to the ground day and night. Imagine this demonstration of His power and glory of Yahweh moving before them on a daily basis. This was the redemptive power of Yahweh being displayed so that the world may know His name and His Eternal Sovereignty.

The problem was that they became familiar with His Presence with them, ceased to reverence Him and treated this awesome manifestation of His Presence as something common or ordinary. By so doing they became complacent in their spiritual walk and allowed their flesh to dominate their behaviour. They were called to be priests that were mediators between their God and the people of the world.  The ten commands were given to give them the blueprint to have His glory so manifest in their lives that the world would see the image of the Father.

&quot;Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine: And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a Holy nation. &quot;   Exodus 19:5-6
Notice that in Chapter 19:24, the 'priests' mentioned would be the firstborn of the tribal groups as Yahweh has not yet appointed the Levitical priesthood.    These functioned as priests in sacrificial duties until they were replaced by the Aaronic priests.  This is the original Adamic priesthood.  (The JPS Torah Commentary op. cit. p107)

&quot;For you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of Yahweh: which had not obtained mercy, but now have mercy.&quot;   I Peter 2:9-10

After the preparation time was complete, He manifested Himself with an awesome display of power.  Moshe brought &quot;the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the ‘nether’ part of the mount.&quot; 

The mountain was completely in smoke because Yahweh had descended upon it in fire, and the whole mountain quaked at His presence (19:18-20)  The people were afraid to hear more direct words from God so they asked Moshe to go up and speak with God and relay to them His covenant. Today, People are no different. They do not want to hear from God. If they did, they might have to do what He tells them.

Research done by Archaeologists in present-day Saudi Arabia at Jebel Musa  (Moses mountain - called so by the locals) has shown the whole top of the mountain to be burnt still today.   Those exploring the area have also found the markers which were placed by Moshe to keep the children of Israel from coming up the mount.     Not even the priests were allowed to come up on the mount.

In the Revelation at Sinai, Yahweh encounters the people of Israel in the arena of history, yet gives them the Torah, which is eternal and outside of history, for the principles given to us here are but an expression of how man created in His image and likeness should live. They are for all people of all time who would honour their creator.

Most people agree that the moral code of living embodied in these principles is relevant in all societies of mankind. Those without these standards for living in their inter-personal relationships deteriorate as a society. Yet, the first through to the  fourth commandment is put aside as unimportant in a humanistic world where man and his needs and purposes are foremost.

If we truly obey the first commandment to LOVE Him with ALL our heart, soul, mind and strength, then the other three will flow out from that.
If you truly love Yahweh, then you will have no other 'gods'  -  i.e. idols (things which you worship) in your life -- and, you will not speak the name of One you love carelessly or irreverently. Nor will it be difficult to set aside one day of a week to give to the One Who is your all in all.


The Image of God

When Yahweh said, &quot;You shall have no other gods before Me&quot;  (20:3), the issue was the priorities of their life and what they worshiped - what controlled their heart   -   i.e. not to allow anything else take hold of their heart that they should worship it. The principle behind this is that - not only is Yahweh the only God, but He does not want to be vying for our attention with any other gods we may be worshiping. In that era man's inclination was to worship tangible things.  Now the 'gods' we worship in the modern world are more subtle and sometimes intangible, such as gods of possessions, pleasure, relaxation, sports, entertainment or even education. What He saying is that He requires all our attention, all our efforts and He will not share us with anyone or anything. 
   
In revealing Himself to Israel, He was not concerned that they would not recognize Him as God but that they would just add Him to the already 1200 existing gods of Mitzrayim.  That is the danger for us also, of having God plus our work, God plus our pleasures, God plus our possessions whatever they are  -  etc., etc.. 

In the next command He says &quot;You shall not make yourself a carved image --
any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth..&quot; (20:4)  Whatever has our attention - whatever 'image&quot; we are beholding, that thing will possess our hearts.
The likeness of the Father has now been manifest in His Son Yeshua. Yeshua is the true image of God, so much so that He said, &quot;When you see Me, you have seen the Father.&quot;  (John 14:9) 

&quot;Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of Yahweh is there is liberty.   But we with unveiled face, (unlike those under the old dispensation through Moshe)  beholding as in a mirror the glory of Yahweh, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of Yahweh&quot;  2 Corinthians 3:17-18

The Ruach HaKodesh in us (the Spirit of Yahweh) is what transforms us to become like Him. We become His image here on earth liberating us from the bondage to the things of this world when our eyes are beholding His image, Yeshua the Messiah and not the things of this world.   

Yeshua's life illustrates true liberation from the things of this world. From the beginning of his time on Earth, He was threatened by oppression. He began life with the stigma of illegitimacy, He was born in a stable, and then, since His life was in danger, His family spent His early years moving from place to place. Later He was misunderstood by His own family, friends, and authorities. He endured great temptations, had to avoid attempts on His life, was unjustly arrested and sentenced to a most cruel death.   Yet in all these things Yeshua was free because He kept His eyes on the Father and worshipped Him alone. As He Himself said, He fulfilled the law - the ten commands.  (Matt. 5:17)

In every hardship, God was with him.  There was never a sense that His life was not under the loving control of His Father in Heaven. No one was ever able to manipulate Him.  While living a simple and poor life, not only did he have every need met, He was always able to give to others. In the end not even death could hold him, for on the third day He rose to life. The reason Yeshua could live a life of freedom was because he possessed in Himself the moral and spiritual qualities that were part of the original human design and which are spelt out for us in the ten commands.  The Ten Commandments, while providing us with a great moral standard, help us to see how morally weak we actually are.  It is this moral bankruptcy that is the main cause of our bondage.  The first step to freedom is found in accepting that we all fall short of God's standards for living.  

Whatever could be said about freedom from life's oppression, the greatest freedom we experience is internally.  To possess peace in the midst of chaos, hope in despair, joy when grieving, and confidence when facing failure, is true freedom.  To be generous in spite of poverty, to bring blessing when cursed, healing even while in pain, and so on, are the fruit of that freedom.

He overcame in every situation and His victory is ours through the indwelling Spirit - the Ruach Ha Kodesh.


Setting Aside the 4th Command

The fourth commandment is to &quot;Remember the Shabbat to keep it holy&quot;.   Six days we are to work and do all our creative activity; but the seventh day is Shabbat to Yahweh, our God; in it we are not do any creative activity, nor any of our household or those employed by us.   Because in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day.  (20:8-11).

The fourth commandment is the one particularly which modern believers wish to set aside. The humanistic approach to religion sees God as One who serves man and meets his needs, whereas Yahweh calls us to lay down our lives and serve Him  - to deny ourselves, take up our 'Cross'  and follow Him. Keeping the Sabbath involves laying aside all our agendas, our plans and purposes and instead consecrating the day for fellowship with Him. It is a day to come into His rest and cease from all of our own (and others) works and instead give Him the place of honour and worship that is due to Him.

The importance of keeping Shabbat is cited here as being that Yahweh created all things in six days and then He rested. Keeping Shabbat gives recognition o the fact that He is the Creator and Sustainer of all and that we are dependant upon Him. He also has set the example and established it as a divine ordinance for us to follow.  In that sense it has never been man's ordinance, it originated with the Almighty. It is as fixed as the weekly pattern that He set in place at the beginning in the days of the week, therefore not being a man's ordinance, it is not liable to be changed by man.


The Sabbath in Type

The Kesef Mezukak (super-commentary to Ramban by R. Avraham Lieblein) explains that in connection to Shabbat in Bereishit 2:3, Ramban elucidates that the six days of creation hint at the six thousand-year duration of world history, based on Tehillim 90:4:    “For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is past.”  The seventh millennium will be the purifying desolation of the Messianic era: it will be wholly a Shabbat and will bring rest for life everlasting. (See Sanhedrin 97a, Avodah Zara 9a and Ramban’s comments to Vayikra 23:36.)  In this case, “Because six days Yahweh made” means, literally, that Yahweh made a &quot;six-day&quot; ? that is to say, a six-millennium-world. 

The Alexandrian Jewish philosopher Philo (c. 20 BCE-c. 50 CE) writes, in &quot;Allegorical Interpretation&quot; (1.2):  It would be correct to say that the world was not made in time, but that time was formed by means of the world, for it was heaven’s movement that was the index of the nature of time. In other words, time is a property of the universe that Yahweh created.


Disregarding Torah

The scripture says, &quot;Someone who disregard the Torah of Moses is put to death without mercy on the word of two or three witnesses.   Think how much much worse will be the punishment deserved by someone who has trampled under foot the Son of God; who has treated as something common the blood of the covenant which made him holy, and who has insulted the Spirit, giver of God's grace&quot;     Hebrews 10:28-29   (David Stern's  Complete Jewish Bible)
 
The Torah of Moses sets out all of God's principles which has not been set aside but fulfilled in Yeshua's life which is imparted to us by the Holy Spirit.    When we set aside, or disregard His principles we are actually annulling the work of His crucifixion in our life purchased by His precious blood. By so doing we are cut off from our inheritance just as Israel was cut off from physical Israel in the natural. These included idolatry and moral issues  - Leviticus 20: 1-26; 18 :29;  7:22-27;   Keeping the feasts  -  Exodus 12:15-19;  and the keeping of the Sabbath  -  Exodus 31:14; Numbers 15:30-31 says that if a person sins presumptuously through &quot;despising the word of Yahweh and has broken His commandments&quot;, he shall be cut off from his people.  We despise His word when we set it at naught and disregard it.

The same principle applies in the new covenant,  compare  -  1 Corinthians 5: 9-12;  6: 9-11 and Galatians 5:19-21


The Manifestation of Yahweh

The sages report the tradition handed down the  passage of time, that when the words of Yahweh were spoken tongues of fire danced through the whole assembly of Israel passing from head to head so that each one heard the voice and words of Yahweh without Moshe needing to speak as an intermediatory.     This is derived from the understanding of the Hebrew words which have been translated as  &quot;thunder and lightning&quot; which literally translated mean &quot;voices&quot; and &quot;torches&quot;.

So the voice of Yahweh passed through the camp and was seen as 'torches' of fire passing through and among them. This is what caused them such awesome fear and parallels what took place at 'Pentecost' (Shavuot) after the resurrection of Yeshua. There again at the inauguration of the new covenant Yahweh came and spoke to His people.   Acts 2: 4; 7-11 

Yahweh came personally to speak to His Beloved Israel the terms of the marriage contract that she was entering into with Him.  A prospective groom speaks personally and intimately with his bride-to-be, heart to heart. So with Yahweh, He came and spoke to her personally the terms of His marriage covenant with her.    He told her that she would be His prized possession and that she would be a kingdom of priests unto Him, a holy, set-apart people that H e would delight in.

As all Jewish weddings do, it began with a 'mikveh', a ceremonial washing by immersion in preparation for the wedding to come. In traditional Jewish thought, a ritual immersion bath, known as a mikveh precedes the actual marriage ceremony.  In this ritual, the bride immersed herself completely into a pool of water, symbolically cleansing all impurities. She then came up out of the water to meet her husband.  The journey of the people through the waters of the Sea of Reeds (Red Sea) serves as the symbol of the mikveh in Jewish thought. 

In modern Jewish weddings, this canopy, called a chuppah is the large prayer shawl (tallit) owned by the groom. They met for the ceremony under the 'chupah' created by the cloud upon the mountain and there they entered into vows upon the terms of the wedding 'ketubah' (contract - the terms of agreement of the marriage) which certified the union. This was the ten words spoken to His Bride from the Cloud and accepted by her.   Exodus 31:13 tells us that the wedding ring, the sign of their betrothal is the Sabbath. He then went about making preparations for them to dwell together in the Tabernacle of meeting - the Mishkan.

In a marriage relationship, we do not consider it a burden to serve our partner, but a joy. So we also obey and serve Him out of love and find it a joy to do so.   Through the knowledge of His love for us, responding to that love by doing what pleases Him, is a pleasure and a privilege. No request of His, will ever be a burden or inconvenient as long as we are motivated by our love for Him. A son or daughter of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,  should always manifest this fruit in their lives.


The Revelation of the Shekinah Glory  Isaiah 6: 1-13 ; 7: 1-6  ;  9: 5,6

This portion is chosen where Isaiah is commissioned by a revelation of Yahweh's glory and the people's sinfulness, to go and speak to them and bring forth a remnant who will serve Him. The people had forgotten Him and broken their marriage covenant with Him and were going to incur His judgment. 
   
Yahweh is looking for a holy seed which will remain after His purifying work which will be of the original 'stock' which He planted - the Rod of the root of Jesse.   Unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.   Isaiah 11: 1-11

Only a revelation of His glory and majesty will bring us to a recognition of our true state before Him and to recognise the need of cleansing from our defiled human fallen state so that we may come to holiness of life and separation from sin. We need a cleansing touch from the altar  to purge and cleanse us from all defilement of the flesh in order to serve Him in true holiness.

Many are drawn to the likeness of the world - the idols of fame, financial prosperity and pleasure, to just name a few.  God's goal is that we be conformed to His likeness, which is an internal, spiritual likeness in our lives that reflects the image of God. He is looking for spiritual obedience from us. 

Each time that we decide not to speak and live the Word of Yahweh in season and out of season, the glory departs from us.  Let us invite Yahweh’ glory to lead us so that our enemies will flee before us as the Torah goes forth from Tzion.  We need more than a mere mist of glory from Yahweh today, we need to have Him speak to us in the thick cloud. Let us return in obedience to His Excellence.

[[Image:Booklet final advice.jpg|thumb|400px|]]

It is important to acknowledge that only certain types of people make self-employment a success. Being self-employed is never easy, but it can be one of the most rewarding and satisfying decisions you will ever make. However, there is never any substitute for experience.

Here are our last pieces of advice.

==Be realistic about budgets==
You may find that at first you never meet your budgets because you tend to inflate the sales you are likely to make and underestimate the expenses. So be tough on your budgets and never believe what others tell you about margins. Only experience will tell you what the real costs and expectations are.

==Success characteristics==
You must personally be able to handle being in a small business. It is not easy and you have to be made of the ‘right stuff’. For your business to succeed your partner and family must be committed to the enterprise as well. Specifically you will need to:

* Be persistent. Never take no for an answer and continually question and go back to people again and again.
* Be really good at what you do. Become the expert.
* Read as much as you can about being in business and what other people have done to succeed. Learning never ends.
* Go on as much training as possible. Attend all the Enterprise Training courses possible, especially in the areas where you lack skills.
* Find a mentor or person with whom you can talk through your business challenges.
* Take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. 

Be flexible enough to change what you are doing if this is necessary.

==Always invest in good people==
If you are going to hire people, hire the best you can afford. People and staff will be the most expensive, rewarding and frustrating investment you will ever make. You’ll probably spend more waking time with your employees than your partner, so you might as well create a healthy, happy and safe work environment that everyone enjoys. Invest in your staff to keep them and to encourage them.

==Selling==
Never forget that if you do not actually get to sell something, then you are not in business. Even if everyone loves what you are doing, unless the dollars come in, you are out. The acid test of any business is cashflow. Many people may give you false hope by saying your idea is brilliant—but they will not use your product or service.

==Small steps to big improvement==
Remember that Four Fives Rule (end of Chapter 4), where small improvements make a huge difference to the bottom line of your business. Continually seek to improve all aspects of your business by five percent every year.

==What the customer wants==
Never forget that whatever you do, it is the customer who pays you. If you do not provide what they want, you will not be in business for long. Continue to ask your customers through your market research what they want in case they change their minds over time. If you do not adjust, and one of your competitors does, you may still be wondering what happened long after the cash runs out.

==Planning ahead==
Any experienced business person will tell you that things do not always go perfectly in a business. Planning ahead to manage the risks of the business and the unexpected is another important aspect of being in business. This includes cashflow and working capital management, tax and compliance planning and health and safety issues. It also includes contingency planning for accidents and sickness and contractual disputes (whether with customers, suppliers, or your own staff). Get the best advice you can to help you manage these challenges. Sound planning can help you anticipate or minimise these risks and good business is always about minimising risks while maximising your opportunities.

==Sustainable Business practices== 
Customers will increasingly prefer to do business with companies that are sustainable or environmentally responsible or care about how others are affected by their business.

==Summary==
Your business plan is a road map guiding you to achieve your business and personal goals. Examine your plans at regular intervals to ensure you are on track.

The very process of review may show you that your original goals have changed over time. The changes may well require you to rebuild your plan to reflect a new direction or focus.
If that proves to be true for you, simply revisit this ‘do it yourself’ list to assist you in developing your new business plan.

We would stress again the need to take as much advantage as possible of the business training available under the Enterprise Training programme. Visit the website www.business.govt.nz or phone 0800 424 946.

Finally, learn to trust your instinct or ‘gut feeling’ on everything you do. Chances are your ‘feeling’ for what you should do is right. It has probably got you this far. Don’t ignore your own advice now.</text>

      <comment>/* Creating the shadow */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Drop shadows are a common way to emphasise an image.

==Creating the shadow==

The shadow can be created by taking a simple solid rectangle (usually black or grey, but you can also have coloured shadows) and applying the ImageFilter BLUR filter to it repeatedly. This filter uses a 5×5 kernel, so a single iteration will not be smoothly blurred. You can experiment to find the optimum number of iterations for your purpose.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
def makeShadow(image, iterations, border, offset, backgroundColour, shadowColour):
    # image: base image to give a drop shadow
    # iterations: number of times to apply the blur filter to the shadow
    # border: border to give the image to leave space for the shadow
    # offset: offset of the shadow as [x,y]
    # backgroundCOlour: colour of the background
    # shadowColour: colour of the drop shadow
    
    #Calculate the size of the shadow's image
    fullWidth  = image.size[0] + abs(offset[0]) + 2*border
    fullHeight = image.size[1] + abs(offset[1]) + 2*border
    
    #Create the shadow's image. Match the parent image's mode.
    shadow = Image.new(image.mode, (fullWidth, fullHeight), backgroundColour)
    
    # Place the shadow, with the required offset
    shadowLeft = border + max(offset[0], 0) #if &lt;0, push the rest of the image right
    shadowTop  = border + max(offset[1], 0) #if &lt;0, push the rest of the image down
    #Paste in the constant colour
    shadow.paste(shadowColour, 
                [shadowLeft, shadowTop,
                 shadowLeft + image.size[0],
                 shadowTop  + image.size[1] ])
    
    # Apply the BLUR filter repeatedly
    for i in range(iterations):
        shadow = shadow.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)

    # Paste the original image on top of the shadow 
    imgLeft = border - min(offset[0], 0) #if the shadow offset was &lt;0, push right
    imgTop  = border - min(offset[1], 0) #if the shadow offset was &lt;0, push down
    shadow.paste(image, (imgLeft, imgTop))

    return shadow
&lt;/source&gt;

First, let us ignore the last step and concentrate on the shadow. Let's see what we get for various numbers of iterations. The border was set to 8, the background was white and the shadow is 0x444444 grey. The inital image was 30×30pixels.

{| width=400 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - 1 iterations.png]]
|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - 2 iterations.png]]
|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - 3 iterations.png]]
|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - 5 iterations.png]]
|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - 10 iterations.png]]
|-
|1 iteration
|2 iterations
|3 iterations
|5 iterations
|10 iterations
|}

Notice that the shadow is always contained in the image boundary - this is caused by the blue filter &quot;hitting&quot; the image boundaries. If the border were to be made larger, you would see the blur spreading out at large numbers of iterations.

Now, we can add the last section and try it. The result is below. This image used an offset of [3,3] with 3 iterations and the same colours as before.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|width=100|[[File:Imagen.svg|30px]]
|width=100|[[File:PIL Tutorial - Drop shadows - result.png]]
|-
|Original image (the SVG was made into a rectangular PNG)
|Resulting image with drop shadow
|}

===Efficiency===

The calculations needed to produce the blurred shadow is computationally expensive, expecially for large images or many iterations, but the same shadow can be reused for any image of the same size. So, if you are going to creare lot of identically-sized image tiles, it will be beneficial to compute the shadow just once, and reuse it for each image.

You can also speed up the calculation of the shadow by recognising that the centre of the shadow will be flat fill of the shadow colour - only the edges need to be computed. How far in the lighter border extends depends on the number of iterations. Making this change reduces the problem from quadratic in the size of the image (i.e. doubling the width quadruples the the time taken) to linear (doubling the width doubles the time) for large images, but will be unlikely to have a large effect for icons.

==Dealing with non-rectangular images==

==Adding transparency==

      <comment>/* Analysis (two dimensional space) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Projectile Motion==
Projectile Motion refers to any motion moving under the effect of gravity. This kind of motion is famous for its trajectory being in the shape of a parabola.



==Analysis (two dimensional space)==

Suppose the object is projected at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; at a height h with an initial velocity of v with a gravity of g. When on Earth g will equal 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The components of velocity in horizontal (x-) and vertical (y-) directions are:

:&lt;math&gt; x'(t)=v \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y'(t)=v \sin\theta &lt;/math&gt;


By using &lt;math&gt;s=vt+\frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;,
The x- and y- coordinates of the object are

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=v (\cos \theta)t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=v (\sin \theta)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2&lt;/math&gt;

which are functions in time.

By eliminating t,
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=(\tan \theta)x(t)-\frac{g}{2v (\cos \theta)}[x(t)]^2 +h&lt;/math&gt;
which shows that the trajectory is a parabola

===Velocity at any time t===
The magnitude of the velocity at any time t is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|\vec v|=\sqrt{[x'(t)]^2+[y'(t)]^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and the direction is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta=\frac{x'(t)}{y'(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
===Time of flight===
To solve for the time of flight, we set y(t)=0
:&lt;math&gt;v (\sin \theta)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t=\frac{2v\sin\theta}{g}&lt;/math&gt;

===Horizontal range===
After &lt;math&gt;t=\frac{2v\sin\theta}{g}&lt;/math&gt;, the x-coordinate of the object is given by
:&lt;math&gt;x(\frac{2v\sin\theta}{g})=\frac{v^2\sin2\theta}{g}&lt;/math&gt;
===Maximum height===
The maximum height is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{v^2\sin^2\theta}{2g}+h&lt;/math&gt;
where h is the initial height

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Guitar Unleashed'''

Unlike other software providers today, we recognize the fact that guitarists have many sources of Video, Audio, Tablature and other documentation which they have accumulated as they progress with their studies, and most software does not cater to the guitarist who is past the initial phase of learning, and needs a more robust tool to allow them to expand their playing horizons.

We can fill this hole in your progression as a player.

Not only can we give you invaluable tools to enhance your knowledge and practice routines (including over 7 hours of quality guitar lesson videos; over 2,500 one octave scales; over 1,000 chord voicings; 5 triad types in 12 keys for root, first and second inversions at multiple locations on the fretboard; all configurable for left handed and right handed players) we have recognized that your library of information will constantly expand as your skills improve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;s&gt;While I have no knowledge particularly in the subject,
I thought the phrase &quot;the great majority of species have prospered with reliance on [sexual reproduction]&quot; was a little odd.
Is this true?  Surely the great majority of species in the world are single celled, and therefore generally asexual?&lt;/s&gt;
No, wait, my bad.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck! 

PS: I noticed your edits on the C++ Programming book. I will have to check them all as I review the edits, for now, just a remark regarding [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#main|main function]] &quot;''Unlike other functions, if control reaches the end of main(), an implicit return 0; for success is automatically added.''&quot;, if you have the time please add a comment to that effect to your additions (explicit is easier to read so I'm not opposing you additions of the return), and spot on adding the int to all that, if you are untested check out the code on [[C++ Programming/Exercises]] it should have similar issues...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:06, 28 February 2010 (UTC)

Yes, I understand that the return is implicit. But as the int in the main declaration is not optional, I believe the &quot;return 0;&quot; at the end of the main function causes less doubt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Inverse Operator ==

=== no ===

We use the little word ''no'' to invert or negate a relationship. I can mean slightly different things depending exactly where it appears in a sentence.

==== Examples ====

* no, mi vizka tu - It is not the case that I see you (no ''relationship'' between you and me)
* mi no vizka tu - I don't see you (but there is a ''relationship'' between you and me but its not ''seeing''. I could ''hear'' you instead, for example)
* mi vizka no tu - I don't see you (I see something but its not you)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Greater Picture, next-to-last paragraph, last sentence reads &quot;The time-turner will be destroyed accidentally in the fifth book, along with all other known artifacts.&quot;  What does &quot;along with all other known artifacts&quot; mean?  I'm not familiar enough with Order of the Phoenix to remember the destruction of the time turner, but based on this Wiki's article about it, the word &quot;artifacts&quot; should be &quot;copies&quot; or &quot;examples,&quot; or maybe the sentence should be rewritten &quot;This and all other known time turners will be destroyed accidentally in the fifth book.&quot;  The word &quot;artifacts&quot; makes it sound like every item, of any kind, in the entire Universe, that could be described as an &quot;artifact&quot; (defined as &quot;any object made by human work&quot;) is destroyed along with the time turner.  That didn't happen.
:Yup. I don't know what that editor was thinking... in any event, now cleaned up and cross-referenced. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 15 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Fixing bug introduced in revision 1728627 where &quot;{{{this}}}&quot; would appear instead of &quot;See&quot; when no &quot;this=&quot; argument was given.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;== Introduction ==

This template is used for cross-references in [[Na'vi]].

== Reference ==

{{tl|NaviSA}} accepts up to five positional arguments each of which should be a headword in the dictionary. The template produces a list of these arguments where each word points to the corresponding definition.

Additionally, the following optional, named template arguments are supported.

:{| class=wikitable style=&quot;max-width:67%&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Name !! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Description
|-
| “&lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt;” || Changes the template header. Can be one of the following:
* “&lt;tt&gt;lenited&lt;/tt&gt;” produces “Lenited form of ….”
* “&lt;tt&gt;shpl&lt;/tt&gt;” produces “Short plural of ….”
* “&lt;tt&gt;gen&lt;/tt&gt;” produces “Genitive of ….”
* “&lt;tt&gt;see&lt;/tt&gt;” produces “See ….”
If not given, “See ….” is used. If defined but left empty (“&lt;tt&gt;this=&lt;/tt&gt;”), a plain list of references is generated, without leading space and trailing period. Any other value is used directly, separated from the list of references by a single space.
|}

== Examples ==

The following examples demonstrate the use of {{tl|NaviSA}}.

:{| class=wikitable
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Wikitext !! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Result
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|kame}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|kame}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;le|nì|tì&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|le|nì|tì}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this=lenited&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|tsat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|this=lenited|tsat}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this=shpl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|tsaheylu}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|this=shpl|tsaheylu}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this=&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|kame|tsat|tsaheylu|'awpo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|this=|kame|tsat|tsaheylu|'awpo}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NaviSA|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this=Similar words:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|'awpo|'awve|nì'aw}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; || {{NaviSA|this=Similar words:|'awpo|'awve|nì'aw}}

==  Definition of User Generated Content (JH/SW)  == 
Today numerous Web 2.0 applications and technology-based web sites are constructed on a foundation of user generated content. Educational technologists, trend setters, innovators, and Internet users have helped define user generated content as content that is created, contributed, and distributed by regular web users. The formulation and production of rich content is created by the general public and not necessarily by paid professionals or experts in a particular field or subject area. User generated content (UGC), also known as peer production, or consumer generated media, or user created content, refers to a wide variety of digital media sources and technologies. Material such as the daily news, encyclopedias and other references, movie and product reviews as well as articles on any subject, all of which have been traditionally written by editors, journalists and academics. &lt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com]&gt; User generated content is by amateurs. User generated content is available on the Web via blogs and wikis.&lt;ref&gt;User generated definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia http://www.pcmg.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=user-generated+content&amp;i=56171,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, user generated content refers to materials to include but not limited to many forms and types of reference materials to include encyclopedias, videos, movies, podcasts, and articles on any and all subject matters. User-generated sites are trending as “some of the most frequently visited sites.” &lt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-use-generated-content.htm=&quot;WiseGeek.com&quot;]&gt;

==  Forecast for User Generated Content in USA (JR) ==
As Internet usage in the United States continues to rise it is expected that user generated content will continue to expand along with Web 2.0 applications and growing technology-based web sites. According to Tech Crunchies - Internet Statistics and Numbers, the phenomena of user generated content is likely to drive and encourage more than half of all internet users located in the United States into contributing content online. Below is a list of year to year projections going back to 2008 related to the percent of American Internet users who have contributed and researchers anticipate web users contributing to online generated content in the future &lt;ref&gt;Growth of User Generated Content Contributors in USA&lt;/ref&gt;: 

2008: 42.8 % 

2009: 44.6 %

2010: 46.6 %

2011: 48.2 % 

2012: 50.0 %

2013: 51.8 %

==  Exemplars of Web-Based and User Generated Content (JH) ==
With increased usage of The Internet and the continuing development of web based technologies and Web 2.0 applications, these practices are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life activities. Learning from user generated content is becoming commonplace among the young and old. From children and teens downloading and uploading music and videos, to middle and high school students creating video tutorials, to businessmen and women, to grandparents using social networking sites to stay in touch with their families, the creation of user generated content for learning is molding new social norms. Today, it is typical to see web based pages in many fields part of many colleges and universities. In addition to institutes of higher education, web based pages and user generated content applications are emerging at the high school, middle school, and elementary school levels.&lt;ref&gt; hN Good, JB Schafer, JA Konstan, A Borchers, B … - Proceedings of the …, 1999 - aaai.orgttp://techcrunchies.com/growth-of-user-generated-content-contributors-in-usa/&lt;/ref&gt; Web- based technologies and user generated content is fast becoming the media of choice to deliver modern advanced distance educational systems. Familiar web-based technology delivery systems of instruction and learning include Moodle, Angel, and Web-CT. Each systems provides “how to” instructions related to course content delivery tools, synchronous and asynchronous conferencing systems, polling and quiz modules, virtual workspaces for sharing resources, interactive whiteboards, student/teacher assignment and discussion components.&lt;ref&gt; hN Good, JB Schafer, JA Konstan, A Borchers, B … - Proceedings of the …, 1999 - aaai.orgttp://techcrunchies.com/growth-of-user-generated-content-contributors-in-usa/&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples of teacher and student created web-based and user generated content applications for learning include podcasting, vodcasting, project based learning, video-conferencing, YouTube type tutorials, student centric learning activities, blogging, social networking participation, web site creations, and Twitter.

==Implementing User Generated Content in Education (SW) ==

The thought of using web based user generated content in education may, at first, seem absurd.  However, the theory of Constructivism where students construct knowledge for themselves and develop critical thinking skills is not new. In fact, the theory has evolved from the work of [http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cogsys/piaget.html Jean Piaget] &lt;ref&gt;  http://www.exploratorium.edu/IFI/resources/constructivistlearning.html&lt;/ref&gt; on cognitive learning theory.
The idea of using user generated content in education in creates a collaborative environment for learning.  Users generate content and reflect on their own as well as other’s contributions.  Students develop critical thinking skills while working through a formal educational social network.  
Teaching through a [http://home.capecod.net/~tpanitz/tedsarticles/motivation.htm cooperative learning] &lt;ref&gt; http://home.capecod.net/~tpanitz/tedsarticles/motivation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; environment encourages student motivation and fosters a positive educational experience.  Students gain perspective and incite to guided topics through other’s contributions and continuously build a body of knowledge.
Incorporating these ideas into a web based learning environment broadens the possibilities for learning.  Students can participate outside of the traditional classroom.  Information and idea sharing can be regional, national and even international, exposing students to varying cultures both socially and academically.

Seymour Papert asserts that context is important for learning to take place.  His research builds on the constructivist view that learning is “building knowledge structures”. &lt;[http://learning.media.mit.edu/content/publications/EA.Piaget%20_%20Papert.pdf=&quot;Ackerman&quot;]&gt;  While Papert shares Piaget’s constructivist view he adds that “the role of context, uses, and media” is important for learning to take place. &lt;[http://learning.media.mit.edu/content/publications/EA.Piaget%20_%20Papert.pdf=&quot;Ackerman&quot;]/&gt;He also states that computers should be used for more than just “informational technology”. &lt;[http://mentalarcade.com/resources/Papert2004.mp4=&quot;Papert&quot;]&gt; Such a theory supports the use of open content in education.
Karsten Wolf,[http://www.slideshare.net/kadewe/you-learning-the-impact-of-user-generated-content-on-education Impact of User Generated Content in Education], states that there are four elements of user generated content in education. 
#Didactics and Design 
#Educational Research
#Educational Technology
#Educational Policy and Practice
Based on Wolf’s criteria user generated content is supported by constructivism theory.  Sharing and collaboration through expanded content and equal access provide an environment for learning.  “We are smarter than me.” &lt;[http://www.slideshare.net/kadewe/you-learning-the-impact-of-user-generated-content-on-education=&quot;Wolf&quot;]&gt;  Open content allows users to “re-mix” and “mash up” information.  Wolf defines “re-mix” as “reusing materials in a novel way” and “mash up” as “combining services and adding some usefulness.” &lt;[http://www.slideshare.net/kadewe/you-learning-the-impact-of-user-generated-content-on-education=&quot;Wolf&quot;]&gt;


==  Strategies for implementing user generated content (JB) ==
===Make Content and Assignments Relevant to Students' Lives &lt;ref&gt;  http://web.archive.org/web/20050518000009/http://www.cat.ilstu.edu/teaching_tips/active.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;===

1.	bring in and have students bring in articles from the mass media publications 

2.	relate class work to students' future goals and careers 

3.	use case studies or problem-based learning with topics of interest to students 

4.	involve students in research on topics relevant to them

===Provide Students With Choice and a Sense of Control===

1.	give students options and choices in planning the course, in assignments, in ways to demonstrate their learning, and in how they are evaluated 

2.	allow students to pursue their own questions and interests whenever possible (in discussion, on projects, for paper topics...) 

3.	have students draft exam questions (edit and use some of the best ones) 

4.	be clear about your expectations and objectives (students need to know why they are being asked to do something) 

===Use Peers===

1.	use peers to offer support and feedback 

2.	value and give credit to students' contributions 

3.	use formal and informal group work when appropriate 

4.	divide the material among students or groups of students. Require each group to teach their peers the material they have studied 

===Involve Students' Affective Responses===

1.	select topics and reading that are relevant to students 

2.	use controversial topics 

3.	have students engage in structured, intellectual debates
 
4.	have students argue the opposite of what they think/believe 

===Use Discussion===

1.	require each student to bring in a &quot;good&quot; discussion question covering the material of the day or some other form of the &quot;ticket in&quot; 

2.	require each student to take a turn as class discussion leader 
 
3.	have students answer the following two questions while reading and bring those answers to class: What was the most difficult part/concept/idea in the reading? What did you like the best/most exciting idea? 

===Encourage Student Self-Reflection on Learning===

1.	have students keep learning journals 

2.	take a class period to discuss strategies for learning

3.	take time to talk with students about their progress in individual conferences

==Adopting Web Based Tools for Implementing User Generated Content ==

1. Students can use an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine internet search engine] to find relevant articles for a given topic.

2. Students can collaboratively construct a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki Wiki] as a base of information. 
  
3. Students can discuss relevant topics in an open source [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_forum discussion forum].

4. Students can share and collaborate on documents using media such as &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_docs Google Docs]”

==  Teaching and learning roles in user generated content (JH/SW) ==
Teacher:
Enhance Student Learning With Quality, Not Quantity
Many new teachers focus on quantity, not quality. They feel compelled to “cover” everything listed on the state standards. They end up with a  teacher-centered approach that has nothing but  lecture. The problem with this approach is that the multitude of information is too great for the students to absorb. Teachers need to focus more on the mini-lesson concept, keeping it short and sweet. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.tefllogue.com/training/student-centered-activities.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Many teachers don't realize that the curricular choices are generally left up to them. The teacher needs to identify the pace and delivery at which the students truly can learn. Not all classes can be taught the same amount of material in the same way, and changes must be implemented mid-stream to adapt to students’ needs. User-generated learning deals with more quality learning rather than the push for quantity. &lt;ref&gt;hN Good, JB Schafer, JA Konstan, A Borchers, B … - Proceedings of the …, 1999 - aaai.org aaai.orgttp://techcrunchies.com/growth-of-user-generated-content-contributors-in-usa/&lt;/ref&gt; As the student becomes more involved in the learning activity, rather than just sitting and listening to lecture, the quality of learning increases.&lt;ref&gt; http://karentimberlake.com/student-centered_classoom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Student:
In a student-centered classroom, rather than sitting quietly, listening to the teacher and taking notes, they are forced to participate in activities in learning. This can be anything from hands on activates to discussions among the students about a topic. One suggested idea is that the teacher still talks, for about 2 minutes, then the students actively discuss what the teacher has presented.  This type of activity helps the student to construct their own understanding of the material that is presented.&lt;ref&gt; http://karentimberlake.com/student-centered_classoom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Encourage Student Learning With Depth, Not Breadth
Because teachers sometimes feel rushed to impart knowledge, they often make decisions that minimize student-centered discovery learning or cooperative activities – especially in high school. Again, time becomes an issue. many teachers feel that they don't have enough time for student-centered learning. They fear that group activities related to student-centered learning  especially will take too much time.  Teachers need to focus more on the depth of the lesson by keeping to activities small enough to encourage learning. They also need to realize that the depth of the lesson, even if it take longer than anticipated will make it more meaningful and encourage learning. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.tefllogue.com/training/student-centered-activities.html&lt;/ref&gt;

User generated content for an educational purpose requires students to have certain skill sets to participate effectively and safely.  The role of the teacher is to facilitate the learner and to instruct skills such as: analysis skills, cause and effect, effective writing, and fact versus opinion to prepare students to be discriminating learners.  Armed with such skills students interact with and are guided by the teacher. The Flipped Classroom is a model integrating user generated content. [&lt;http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/the-flipped-classroom-model-a-full-picture/&gt;]
The advantage of the flipped classroom is that the content, often the theoretical/lecture-based component of the lesson, becomes more easily accessed and controlled by the learner. 

1.	Establishes dialogue and idea exchange between students, educators, and subject matter experts regardless of locations.

2.	Lectures become homework and class time is used for collaborative student work, experiential exercises, debate, and lab work.

3.	Extends access to scarce resources, such as specialized teachers and courses, to more students, allowing them to learn from the best sources and maintain access to challenging curriculum.

4.	Enables students to access courses at higher-level institutions, allowing them to progress at their own pace.

5.	Prepares students for a future as global citizens. Allows them to meet students and teachers from around the world to experience their culture, language, ideas, and shared experiences.

6.	Allows students with multiple learning styles and abilities to learn at their own pace and through traditional models.

== Pros: (SW) ==
&quot; Student -centric learning methods include active learning, in which students solve problems, answer questions, formulate questions of their own, discuss, explain, debate, or brainstorm during class; cooperative learning, in which students work in teams on problems and projects under conditions that assure both positive interdependence and individual accountability; and inductive teaching and learning, in which students are first presented with challenges (questions or problems) and learn the course material in the context of addressing the challenges. Inductive methods include inquiry-based learning, case-based instruction, problem-based learning, project-based learning, discovery learning, and just-in-time teaching. Student-centered methods have repeatedly been shown to be superior to the traditional teacher-centered approach to instruction, a conclusion that applies whether the assessed outcome is short-term mastery, long-term retention, or depth of understanding of course material, acquisition of critical thinking or creative problem-solving skills, formation of positive attitudes toward the subject being taught, or level of confidence in knowledge or skills.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66o9XAPhrXM&lt;/ref&gt;

“We do it together to reach goals too large for each of us.” [http://www.slideshare.net/kadewe/you-learning-the-impact-of-user-generated-content-on-education.Wolf] User generated materials provide a learning environment with high quality materials freely available to anyone.

== Cons: (SW) ==
While there are benefits to user generated content concerns exist.  Naturally, if amateurs are creating content the chance of errors exists  However, Wikipedia has been found to be as accurate as other encyclopedias.&lt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jimmy_wales_on_the_birth_of_wikipedia.html=&quot;Wales&quot;]&gt; Another concern is how to assess student learning in the user generated environment. &lt;[http://opencontent.org/blog/=&quot;Wiley&quot;] “Cyberbullying or cyberharrassment” and “information exposure” could be issues with user generated content. &lt;[http://webhost.bridgew.edu/marc/Cyberbullying%20&amp;%20Information%20Exposure%20In%20PostSecondary%20Education.pdf=&quot;Englander&quot;]&gt; Bullying is not new, but user-generated content can provide a forum for bullying.  Research shows that this cyberbullying occurs from elementary to post-secondary levels. Elizabeth Englander of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center is concerned that young people are technologically savvy but naïve in regards to online security.  Her research shows that students are too willing to reveal personal information. Accuracy, assessment, cyberbullying, and information exposure are issues that will continue to be examined by interested parties as the trend of user generated content grows.

== '''Wikibooks Textbooks''' ==
[[File:wikibooks-logo-en.svg|left|150px|Wikibooks Logo]]

Wikibooks are open-source, user generated books designed to give people free access to information and learning.  Wikibook sujbects range from fine arts to foreign languages, to auto repair to European History.  Wikibooks also has a category for children under 12 called [[Wikijunior]].  Like [[w:|Wikipedia]] anyone can both access and create or edit content of Wikibooks.

==History==

Wikibooks was created on July 10, 2003 when Wikipedia user Karl Wick suggested that there should be an easier way to get open-content textbooks to all people, regardless of economic or geographic barriers.  The Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia and its sister projects, agreed, and Wikibooks was born.  Since then, the project has grown quickly, with 123 modules created in the first three weeks, 10,000 in the first two years, and almost 36,000 as of March, 2010  &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policies==

The over-riding guideline for contributing to Wikibooks is &quot;respect.&quot;  Respect for copyrights, respect for other users, and respect for the Wikibooks' purpose of being an instructional resource are all insisted upon.  The following are additional policies and guidelines:

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Editing Guidelines&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 

Wikibooks' advice to contributors is &quot;Be bold...but please don't be reckless&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Be bold]] accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  Anyone can edit pages in Wikibooks at any time, and people are encouraged to do so, especially in the case of factual, spelling, grammar, or formatting errors.  If the changes are more controversial, people are encouraged to use the discussion tab on each page to open a conversation and work to come to a community consensus before making drastic additions, deletions, or changes.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Content Guidelines&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===

Wikibooks suggests that anyone adding content to a Wikibook takes the following considerations into mind:  check your facts, cite your sources, and define or explain jargon.  It is also suggested that, when making changes, incorporate them into the text at an appropriate spot rather than just adding them onto the end.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Neutral Point of View (NPOV)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===

Wikibooks contributors are guided by a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV Neutral Point of View] policy to ensure fair, unbiased content.  The Wikibooks project is not served by advancing or detracting particular points of view, unless relevant within the content of the textbook. While the community self-polices and relies on each other to review content (changes are welcome) to ensure NPOV, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_war edit wars] are discouraged and will not be tolerated.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Style Guidelines&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===

While there is no official &quot;style&quot; for Wikibooks, the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] is generally considered helpful by many users.  This manual includes information on structure elements such as how to set up the main page, the table of contents, the navigation, the bibliography, and the appendices.  There are also suggestions on how to use headers, footnotes, references, and linking &lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] accessed March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Wikibooks in Education==
With Wikibooks, James Wales and the Wikimedia Foundation are “attempt(ing) to create a comprehensive, kindergarten-to-college curriculum of textbooks that are free and freely distributable, based on an open-source development model” &lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/Wikibooks-takes-on-textbook-industry/2010-1025_3-5884291.html accessed March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. Content found in Wikibooks are “free licensed” so they can be used anywhere in the world by classroom teachers.  Like Wikipedia, Wikibooks can be edited for content and are easy to use.  According to James Wales “the purpose is...to make available to anyone in the world, in any langauge, a curriculum that they can copy, redistribute and modify for whatever purpose they may have, for free” &lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/Wikibooks-takes-on-textbook-industry/2010-1025_3-5884291.html accessed March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Wikibooks in the Classroom&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 
One way teachers can utilize Wikibooks in the classroom is to review them for accuracy of content.  By evaluating the source itself, students learn more about the content.  If students find errors, they can edit the page to fix the mistake.  They can even edit the page to expand upon an idea already presented.  

Students can also create their own Wikibook on an assigned subject and share it with others.  Students can collaborate with other students anywhere in the world.

As part of a graudation project, Wikibooks serves as an excellent location to begin a conversation about a specific topic that can be built with other contributors.  Since graduation projects are designed to span time and develop expertise in a specific subject, a Wikibook is an excellent venue to support sustained research, inviting expert contributors to collaborate with the student.  The benefit of publishing through the wiki adds authenticity and sustained value to the endeavor.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Advantages of Wikibooks&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 

1. An advantage of Wikibooks is that the information found in the book is as current as possible.  In many fields, traditional textbooks are often out of date as soon as they are printed.  With Wikibooks, teachers can provide the most up-to-date information to their students. 

2. Another advantage of Wikibooks is that they are free.  Schools can save money by using Wikibooks instead of purchasing a new set of textbooks.  Utilizing free materials is one way that schools can offer more of a variety of classes to their students without a lot of cost.

3. Wikibooks are not limited by what existes.  It is an environment that invites creativity, adaptation, and development.  Unlike textbooks that are static and established, Wikibooks grows with the knowledge and vision of its users.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Disadvantages of Wikibooks&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 

A disadvantage of Wikibooks deals with the open nature of Wikibooks and authority.  Because anyone can add information to a Wikibook, the normal vetting &amp; peer-review process publishers use for ideas and information is not followed.  Therefore, educators and students using a Wikibook must read and think critically when learning.  Recently wikibooks has implemented a Editor position within individual books, a person to vet any submitted changes.

As a research site, the topic of focus may not yet be developed to the level needed by the user.  Instead of being a resource, the site would then have to be used for construction.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Wikibooks Card Catalog&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===
[[File:Three Catalogue Areas.jpg|right|Three Catalog Areas]]

All Wikibooks can be found at the [[Wikibooks:Card_Catalog_Office|Card Catalog Office]].  To aid browsing, Wikibooks uses three cataloging systems:&lt;br /&gt;

''' By Subject'''&lt;br /&gt;
''' By Completion Status'''&lt;br /&gt;
''' By Reading Level'''

Wikibooks listed '''&quot;By Subject&quot;''' are grouped together by related topics.  Wikibooks browsers often look for books that are complete or nearing completion; '''&quot;By Completion Status&quot;''' is indicated by percent increments of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%.  '''&quot;By Reading Level&quot;''' categories provides information to quickly find age-appropriate materials; content is categorized as either pre-reader, beginner, intermediate, advanced, or professional.  ikibooks within these first three systems are first listed as top-level categories (see image).  Clicking on each will open a second-level category.

An [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical_classification|Alphabetical_classification]] is also provided; all Wikibooks are listed alphabetically by the first letter of their title.

Contributors, or users, can learn more about these schemes at the [[Wikibooks:CCO_Resources|Card Catalog Resources]] page.

==Wikijunior==

[[File:Jackl_wikijunior.svg‎|right|150px|]]

“The aim of this project is to produce age-appropriate non-fiction books for children from birth to age 12” &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  Wikijunior books are created by kids, teachers, and parents.  They use text, photographs and diagrams, and original works &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  Wikijunior books are “kid friendly, collaborative, fun, reliable, and open” &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Wikijunior Categories&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===

Wikijunior books are categorized by subjects.  So far, those subjects include:
# Discovery and Innovation
# The Natural World
# Schooltime
# Pre-readers

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Examples of Wikijunior Books&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===
# [[Geometry for Elementary School]]
# [[Wikijunior:Colors|Colors]]
# [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs|Dinosaurs]]
# [[Wikijunior:Kings and Queens of England|Kings and Queens of England]]
# [[Wikijunior:How Things Work|How Things Work]]

Once you select a Wikijunior book to read, you’ll be taken to a new page similar to a table of contents.  The page first shows a brief summary of the book and how to navigate through the book to read the various articles found within it.  Wikijunior books are organized and with the click of a button, you can navigate to the subtopics within the book.  You can also learn more about the individuals responsible for creating the book by clicking the “Authors” link.  

Wikijunior also has a &quot;Featured Collaboration&quot; book that is highlighted to invite collaborators into the project.  Kids can also use a search feature to find a book.

Content is currently being developed in eighteen different languages.

==Featured Books==

[[File:featured_book_en.svg|left|150px|Wikibooks' Featured Book Template]]Wikibooks' [[WB:FB|featured books]] are nominated by Wikibooks users, known as Wikibookians, as exemplary books that should &quot;inspire people to improve the quality of other books&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Featured books]] accessed March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.  People can nominate books that they feel are &quot;good books,&quot; and then others may voice either their support, opposition, or neutrality for the nomination.  Wikibooks acknowledges that there is not everyone will agree on what makes a book &quot;good,&quot; but the following is a list of suggested criteria:

#  Adhere to the guidelines set forth on the [[WB:WIW|What Is Wikibooks?]] description page, have a neutral point of view, and follow protocol for any [[WB:OR|original research]].

#  Have an acceptable target audience, scope, and style.
#  Follow Wikibooks' naming policy and style guidelines.
#  Be clear enough and complete enough to be used as an educational tool
#  Be listed in an appropriate category.
#  Utilize a Table of Contents and navigational guides.
#  NOT be a candidate for deletion, reorganization, or maintenance.  
#  NOT contain any copyright violations.
#  NOT contain orphan pages, too many red links, or any unresolved disputes.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Examples of Featured Books&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===
# [[Spanish]]
# [[European History]]
# [[Wikijunior:Solar System]]
# [[Guitar]]
# [[First Aid]]
# [[Cookbook:Table_of_Contents|Cookbook]]

Compared to the thousands of books to be found at Wikibooks, there are less than 100 Featured books, attesting to the high standards that the community has for choosing them.  After a book is designated as a Featured book, a &quot;Featured Book&quot; template can be placed on the book and it is placed in one of the following categories:  Humanities and Arts, Languages, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Computing, Miscellaneous, or Wikijunior.

==Cookbook==

[[Cookbook:Table_of_Contents|Cookbook]] offers &quot;recipes from around the world&quot;.

==Other Wikibooks Features==

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Browse&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 
There are various ways you can search for books in the Wikibooks collection.  You can browse by subject, by title, by category, by completion status, or by audience.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Donations&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===
The Wikibooks page includes a link to the Wikimedia Foundation's [[wmf:Donate|donations]] page.  The page explains although Wikimedia runs some of the most popular websites in the world, the company actually employs less than 35 people.  For this reason, the non-profit organization relies on tax-deductible donations to keep its projects, such as [[w:|Wikipedia]], Wikibooks, [[v:|Wikiversity]], [[wikt:|Wiktionary]], and [[q:|Wikiquote]], running.  The donations page makes available relevant documents such as [[wmf:Financial_reports|financial reports]], information about the various [[wmf:Our_projects|projects]], and [[wmf:FAQ/en|Frequently Asked Questions]].  The money is used to support the technology infrastructure for the Wikimedia projects, as well as to pay a small number of employees.  However, the vast majority of the work done at for Wikimedia is done by volunteers who author, update, and maintain the projects &lt;ref&gt;[[wmf:Donate]] accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Languages&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;=== 
Currently there are Wikibooks in 58 languages and Wikijunior books in 18.

===&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Future Feature&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;===

Multimedia may be in the foreseeable future for Wikibooks.  Founder James Wales understands that some content needs to be learned through a multimedia approach.  He adds that &quot;Wikibooks could be extended to include audio books&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/Wikibooks-takes-on-textbook-industry/2100-1025_3-5884291.html accessed March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Releasing Material ==

Hello, this is in response to your query about [[The Entrepreneur's Almanac]].  I am an attorney and this is a handbook created by the Maryland State Bar Association.  I have been asked to post this for the public and for attorney's to add to and modify using your Wikibooks forum.  Please let me know what authorization you need from us so that it can be published.  Im not that familiar with how the structure works here and I need guidance. You can reach me either here on the wiki discussion or at 410-385-4233.

Thank you,
Bill McComas Esq.

== [[How To Beat The Draft Board]] says &quot;This document may be freely redistributed without any restrictions.&quot; Is that a problem? ==

Hi,

When [[User:DraftBoard]] wrote [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=How_To_Beat_The_Draft_Board&amp;oldid=893047 the first revision of the &quot;How To Beat The Draft Board&quot; table of contents], s/he included the sentence &quot;This document may be freely redistributed without any restrictions.&quot; That sentence is still there. Do those words mean that the text might not really be GFDLed or Creative Commons licensed?

*  If so, maybe someone should try to contact the author via User Talk and Special:Emailuser, and if s/he doesn't reply after a month or so, a Wikibookian who has their own website should move the book to their own website.  If you'd like me to do it, leave a message on my enwiki talk page.

*  If not, someone should remove the sentence in question.

Cheers, --[[User:Unforgettableid|Unforgettableid]] ([[User talk:Unforgettableid|talk]]) 16:51, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

:You are correct. Our licenses impose certain limitations (the GFDL more than the CC) and that makes the phrasing contradictory as you state above. That doesn't change the validity of the content, since contributors are informed about the licenses this project uses before committing any contribution. One could argue that it was somehow an extension of normal licenses (nothing new we used dual licensing before, but of compatible nature),  it could be discusser and agreed upon by that project community but would require at least a clear statement to be included on the work...
:In any case I removed the phrase.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:41, 9 February 2010 (UTC)
== Red Link ==

Hi, I just added [[Changing_Element_Styles|a page]] to the JavaScript book (before I logged in).  But it looks like I clicked a bad redlink and the page didn't get put in the JavaScript book.  I don't see any way to move it to the right location, short of blanking the old page and creating a new one.  Could somebody move the page please?

Thanks! -- [[User:Ken g6|Ken g6]] ([[User talk:Ken g6|talk]]) 20:48, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

:You should see a &quot;move&quot; tab above the page to the right of the &quot;history&quot; tab. This page describes the operation: [[Help:Pages#Moving]]. This will make a redirect page from the old page to the new one. I have seen it done without a redirect, but I think only people with admin privileges can do that. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:11, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

::No, I don't see such a tab.  It seems like on some wikis one has to have a certain number of edits before one can move a page.  It appears I have ''one'' mainspace edit, maybe that's why I don't see it? &amp;mdash; [[User:Ken g6|Ken g6]] ([[User talk:Ken g6|talk]]) 21:43, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

:::I have moved that page now, but I couldn't see the other page with the bad link, so I leave correcting that up to you. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:06, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

::::Thanks to both of you!  It looks like this might be a wiki bug.  On [[JavaScript/Anonymous Functions]] for instance, if I click the redlink for the next page, it tries to edit [[Closures]], not [[JavaScript/Closures]].  Also weird on that page: the previous link, which should have been a redlink, goes to the index. Anyway, thanks again for the help! &amp;mdash; [[User:Ken g6|Ken g6]] ([[User talk:Ken g6|talk]]) 22:58, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
::::Edit: Note that the page before my original problem page fixed itself once you moved the page. &amp;mdash; [[User:Ken g6|Ken g6]] ([[User talk:Ken g6|talk]]) 22:59, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:::I can't say I understand it, but I guess you will be safe if you go back to the [[JavaScript]] page and create new pages from the red links there. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:43, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

::::This is a '''design flaw''' in [[:Template:Prognav]].  (If I were being generous, I might call it a design ''limitation''; at any rate, it's certainly not just a ''bug'', which could be fixed once identified.)  Prognav is trying to cover several different cases, in a rather ad hoc way.  The logic says that, to decide what page the Next link should go to,
::::* First look for an existing page called {{nowrap|&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}} Programming/{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;}} &amp;mdash; here, the first argument &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is &quot;JavaScript&quot;, and the third argument &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is {{nowrap|&quot;Closures&quot;}}, but there is no existing page called {{nowrap|&quot;JavaScript Programming/Closures&quot;}}.
::::* If that didn't find an existing page, look for an existing page called {{nowrap|&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}}/{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;}} &amp;mdash; here, that name would be {{nowrap|&quot;JavaScript/Closures&quot;}}, but again there is no existing page called that.
::::* If neither of those names found an existing page, then assume that the correct page name is just &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, and don't even bother to check whether or not any such page exists.  So the page name is assumed to be just {{nowrap|&quot;Closures&quot;}}.
::::The simplest fixes are to either use a different navigation template, or, if you must use {{tlx|Prognav}}, never use it to specify a Next (or Previous) link to a page that doesn't already exist.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:58, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:::In the commercial world, we would call this problem a '''feature''' of course! There are simpler templates doing a similar job like [[Template:C_Programming/Navigation]], though this would need to be adapted as it contains &quot;C Programming&quot; as a hard-coded string.

== PDF version ==

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at [[:File:Kings and Queens of England test.pdf]] and give some advice or suggestions. Thanks, '''''[[User:The New Mikemoral|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0095B6&quot;&gt;The New&lt;/span&gt;]]''''' [[User talk:The New Mikemoral|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1E90FF&quot;&gt;Mikemoral&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/The New Mikemoral|♪♫]] 03:47, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

:I think it would definitely be useful to have a PDF version like this, if only to provide a stable version which has been checked. You could always make it more elaborate later, if you wanted to put in the hours. Perhaps the front page text could be bigger, so that people can read it if they are browsing the Commons category. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PDF_Wikibooks PDF_Wikibooks]

:I put a similar vague kind of author credit in the [[:File:French.pdf]] book recently, which has the issue that the main contributers are no longer active and never made much effort to credit themselves when they were active. I am still looking for a form of words which expresses the reality without putting people off too much. 

:There is a category &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Books with PDF version]], a template {{PDF_version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and a page listing the books and associated files at [[Wikibooks:PDF versions]]. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 00:37, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::Thank you. I have increased the size of the title so it is even readable at 20% in OpenOffice.org. Any other suggestions? --[[User:The New Mikemoral|The New Mikemoral]] ([[User talk:The New Mikemoral|talk]]) 01:03, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

I see some of the pages are all text but have space for more illustrations. You could perhaps include more period details like coats of arms, royal jewelry, weapons etc. 
see [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Coats_of_arms_of_England Coats_of_arms_of_England]
A recent [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/8523386.stm article] on the BBC website showed Richard III's boar emblem, which might interest children if there are publicly available images. 
You could also look at changing the font to something more elaborate like URW Chancery L which is available in OpenOffice 2.3.0. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 10:02, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

:I have OO.o 3.2.0 and I do not have that font. Is there a link to it? I'll add some coat of arms if I can find a few. --[[User:The New Mikemoral|The New Mikemoral]] ([[User talk:The New Mikemoral|talk]]) 00:41, 21 February 2010 (UTC)

[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SVG_fonts#Example_rendering Here] is a link showing what the font looks like. I don't have such a wide range in my OpenOffice so you might have something more suitable in yours. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 09:49, 21 February 2010 (UTC)

:The URW fonts cost money and I'd rather use free DejaVu fonts (free book, free font). I have the DejaVu fonts, I think I'll go with DejaVu Serif Condensed. --[[User:The New Mikemoral|The New Mikemoral]] ([[User talk:The New Mikemoral|talk]]) 19:44, 21 February 2010 (UTC)

== Is this Project Appropriate for WikiBooks? ==

I am a part of a group of students who in the late 1960s and early 1970s edited a student newspaper at NYU, ''Washington Square Journal.''  It was an important newspaper of the day, a turbulent time on campus in the heyday of protests against the Vietnam War. Several of its editors have gone on to become prominent journalists and authors (including winners of Pulitzer Prizes and other awards), and have achieved other distinctions.

One of the former editors has written a history of the ''Washington Square Journal''.  I would like to post it on WikiBooks and invite the others involved in the newspaper at the time to edit it.

Strictly speaking, this is not a textbook.  Is it appropriate for a WikiBooks project, or should we use another platform? If so, any recommendations?  We would like to stay within the Wikimedia framework if possible.  Thanks! &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Pfrishauf|Pfrishauf]] ([[User talk:Pfrishauf|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pfrishauf|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;

: Well before figuring out which Wikimedia project is best for the work, you will need to be sure you have permission to license the work under [[Foundation:Terms of Use]] from whoever holds the copyright to the work you wish to post. If the work has been previously published and if the copyright holder is willing to license it I think maybe an unedited version of the work could be included in Wikisource. A edited version might be appropriate for Wikibooks or Wikiversity depending on the intent. Do you intend to provide a neutral perspective of the journal's history? If the answer is yes I think Wikibooks might be an appropriate place to write it. If the answer is no Wikiversity is likely to be more appropriate. If you are unsure you can try here, and if the Wikibooks community later decides it is inappropriate the work can always be moved to Wikiversity later. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:58, 21 February 2010 (UTC)
== copyvio tagging regarding Wikipedia (in particular) ==

I recently noticed a copyvio tag on a small bit of content that was duplicated from Wikipedia, that in itself seemed weird, because there are many of reasons against doing so and not a single justifiable merit of putting usable content in the death row that the copyvio tag has been turned into recently...&lt;br&gt;
The particular event in itself is not of major importance, the low quantity of content almost prevented me to bring this to a brother discussion, in any case what I'm opposed is to the practice.&lt;br&gt;
In as fewer words as I can condense it. I proceeded by reverting the tagged page to the previous version (the initial contributor was anonymous), made some simple changes to the wording to conform to the topic at hand (since the original article was differently focused) and fixed the wikilinks, then informed the tagger with a smaller rational behind my action and opened myself to discuss the issue if he disagreed with me, that particular issue was then &quot;resolved&quot; by the tagger by re-tagging the page as to enforce his initial action, this is in it self a bad outcome, as the quicker outcome would be a reversing war and by disregarding my opposition to the initial action it raised the bar to have it broadly analyzed.&lt;br&gt;
The first point and one I have already raised some attention before is that the copyvio tag was edited to confer the tagged content a validity of 7 days, this without any approval from the community and deeply changing the process how we deal with copyright violations. The addition of this limit (probably based on the general notion that 7 days is a significant delay to get an outcome) is extremely shortsighted and permits removal of unique content without due process of verification, since the copyvio to my knowledge has never been used by a copyright owner to have his content removed but solely as a preemptively step to protect the project against suspected violation of the copyright of others, in this case we act as presuming the contributor guilty and put on him the burden of proving the accuser wrong, this may seem as a simple way to address the issue but step back and analise all the implication, consider the havoc this could snowball into. But my main concern in this is that 7 days aren't enough, this is the minimum time-frame we accept for decisions, in this cases it isn't helping anyone working toward benefiting the project and we should assume that the contributor did have a good motivation behind the contribution.&lt;br&gt;
The second issue is that not all content is copyrightable, people using the copyvio tag should understand this. Facts, measurements, quantities, and simple descriptions (architectural works were only recognized as copyrightable in the US in 1990), small phrases, formating edits, spell corrections any thing that doesn't consist in a substantial literary expression isn't copyrightable (this should be generally valid worldwide). This is how we can have projects like Wikipedia and Wikinews (disregarding other legalities).&lt;br&gt;
The rational to require attribution of other Wikimedia projects, especially inside the Wikimedia ecosystem, should not be used to scare off users and prevent useful evolution of the projects, the need for attribution is extremely important outside of Wikimedia but not as important inside due to the way work is done and how it is done (this could be further explored if people don't understand it), consider simple the simple fact that it was not always possible to preserve edit histories...&lt;br&gt;
The last issue is that tagging copied content from other Wikimedia projects (or even other repositories that are clearly compatible in licensing to Wikibooks). By tagging this type of content in such a way, one is simply promoting deletion, this is shortsighted, if we already know the content can be used, then the only conflict is attribution. Why not fix it by an edit of your own if it annoys you, add the attribution or transwiki the content, don't annoy other users (not only the editor that put the content, but every reader) that probably don't even understand the issue. If you have the time to educate do so, if not just ignore it. If the copyright owner has a problem it would be easily fixed it will not be as problematic as using prohibitive content (the reason why preemptive action is needed on those cases). So please avoid tagging usable content as copyvio at least until people remove the 7 days limit if for no other reason.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:13, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: This looks like me. For those scratching their heads, wondering what triggered this: I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_Course/Infrared_Wave&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1694481 tagged a module] about a week ago along with a bunch of others over at [[Physics Course]] for copying content over from Wikipedia. The contributor was naturally [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.52.201.184&amp;diff=1694479&amp;oldid=1683765 notified] and directed to [[WB:RFI]]. Yesterday, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_Course/Infrared_Wave&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1694481 Panic2k4 removes the tag] without an edit summary but [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASwift&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1698184&amp;oldid=1692359 a note] on my talk page. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Swift&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1698184 I responded] before [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_Course/Infrared_Wave&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1698180 re-addeding the tag]. That tag was later [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_Course/Infrared_Wave&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1698258 removed] by the module contributor. I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_Course/Infrared_Wave&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1698429 reverted] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.52.201.184&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1698382 warned the user].
: Panic2k4, no-one ignored you. You didn't show how the content was anything but a violation of Wikipedia's license and so I re-added the tag. Copyvios don't get a pass just because they're &quot;usable&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:50, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
::What part of what I say above you don't understand this time?
::The copyvio tag is abusive in these instances, especially since it now &quot;imposes&quot; a deadline of seven days. If you are indeed attempting to solve the issue, I've now explained why tagging with the copyvio is a bad approach and you still haven't put forward a good reason to continue to do so. In any case what irked me personally regarding that event was your &quot;reversion&quot; of my &quot;reversion&quot;, again not cool especially because of past events regarding reversions and you being aware that I'm always open for dialog, that for me was perceived as heavy-handed and intentional...
::Just for the record my action concerned just that page (and that content). I've now become aware that the user in question did similar actions on other pages (of the same project at least) and recently in what I see as an attempted resolve the copyvio tags have reworded the content so tagged, again this is as extremely bad example on how to pressure users to comply with best our practices and my rational above continues to be valid, even if the user is working in bad faith, what I still don't believe. You could have fixed it easily (even more being an admin), or just ignored it, time in this cases is not of importance. Exacerbating the copyright issue in the present way is abusive even on the expectations most contributors to Wikipedia place on the work they do, in any case the content you tagged on that particular page wasn't copyrightable. But as I said the event itself is a frivolity what I'm attempting to address is the practices not the event as no content was really lost.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:42, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

:I &quot;fixed&quot; one of the Physics Course modules that was tagged by importing [[w:Electromagnetic spectrum]], deleteing the module here, moving the imported page onto the deleted module then making some changes to make it look like a book. I could have done these for all of them but I was busy doing other stuff. I agree in principle a copyvio is the wrong tag for this kind of problem, but we don't have the huge array of tags WP has and nor, I would argue, do we need them. With such a small number of admins most come across most types of &quot;problem&quot; at some point and are therefore able to deal with it appropriately. By this I mean, for example, at WP you have admins who only deal with image deletions and wouldn't have a clue about how to investigate a textuxal copyvio or what the rules are - that shouldn't happen here. Personally I only tag for copyvio on a clearcut copyright violation and I actually think it should be deleted ''immediately'', not in seven days. Where someone has clearly copy / paste text, from another site (in some cases they even give the URL) that has an incompatible license I think it should be deleted straight away. More generally I'd say we could do with a beefing up of some of the guides to what is and isn't acceptable (both for the use of contributors and admins). &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:59, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
::My opinion is that the copyvio works for reporting &lt;u&gt;suspected&lt;/u&gt; violations or those needing confirmation. Copyright owners wishing to have content removed should just ask for administrative action, they will then be informed on how to proceed from there (verification of claims). In the particular cases I point out above (compatible licensing but failing to give acknowledgment and other easy fixable issues) the copyvio tag should not be used and the issue could even be ignored (not good, but no real damage is being done, we don't have to be preemptive).
::I rarely used the tag and only use when I don't see an easy fix (even yesterday I tagged one page and it was immediately deleted, no 7 days waiting for resolution). Even so one should step back and see that if all participants are in good faith it could be beneficial for the project to provide some more time (there should be a balance between the risk of contamination and the time given, the tag itself could be rewritten to include a clear warning not to copy content from that page), since if contacted the copyright owner could possibly agree to licensing the content. I have been successful in getting content for Wikibooks in that way several times. It must be carefully pondered up, the thing with the 7 days is plainly bad thinking and it changed policy (the deletion policy, the copyright page doesn't mention any time limitation) without validation from the community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:14, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

:: You're right, QU. Copyvios should be deleted on the spot. I guess I was trying to be more accommodating but the content needs to be deleted at some point and so one might as well do it right away and let a nice note to the contributor do. I also agree that we need to put some of our best common practices down in writing somewhere. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:24, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

:::I would be extremely worried if that was turned into practice but wouldn't attempt to block the change of procedure if the community sees it as beneficial (I doubt that many would agree with it). The only thing I would require is that some form of log would be kept on the deletions made under this presumption of guilt. This log would have to include at least the page(s) deleted, word count, presumable source and acting admin. 
:::The risk of contaminating free content would be eliminated completely (that is the only advantage). On the other hand it would also increase the level or errors and the need to undelete content and not all copyright violations are equal, as the examples I give above, and why this discussion was initiated and even other more complex issues, for instance the C++ Programming book was at a time tagged as a copyvio with several admins promoting deletion, so I'm extremely critical of trusting the common sense of others, to act preemptively, probably unilaterally on such issues.
:::We should protect the project but within reason, we aren't required to volunteer our work protecting other peoples interests in detriment of the evolution of the project, even more because our content is highly volatile and ever changing an issue today has an high probability of not being an issue tomorrow...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:21, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

I've been looking for more information on the several issues raised on this discussion, and others that have occurred on similar issues covering the issue of copyvio on viable content (but not attributed), pros and cons and deletions in general. One interesting page for the posts and views expressed is [[meta:Deletion management redesign]] (historical page). I've several ideas for proposals to make the proceedings more transparent to the community and more protective against unneeded deletions.
One issue that I found strange is that there isn't a way to search the Special logs for the comments (in this case I was specially interested on the [[Special:Log/delete]]). For example to check all deletions with a copyvio comment (probably not all the copyvio deletion but most of them) I would have to compile all the logs from Wikibookians with sysop flags since the start of the project and search on the results (only practical with a script). Is there a workaround ?  Or has anyone already done any work on such a script?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:58, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

== PDF versions of featured books ==

Some featured books have quite nice PDF versions, but they are generally about 3 years old now and I think this creates a bad impression. Perhaps we should consider making the PDF versions a bit less prominent if they get too long in the tooth.

The PDF versions I have seen were created by users who seem inactive now, but I think the books have generally continued to progress, if not at the original pace. Has the knowledge of how to do this been forgotten, or was it though to be too much hard work for the value of the final result? The OpenOffice [[:File:PDF_template.sxw| template]] by Hagindaz talks about pasting in text under each level 5 heading, which seems like a marathon task for the longer books. 

I know you can download a PDF version which is made automatically, but these lack pagination and are generally less polished. If it were possible for the system-generated PDF to start each module on a new page, I think that would be a worthwhile improvement. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:25, 4 February 2010 (UTC)

: That would be nice. A book on how to make well polished PDF books out of wiki-based books would also be nice. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:49, 4 February 2010 (UTC)

:: The help pages for polishing are [[Help:Collections|Help:Collections]] for the PDF-generation and [[Help:Print versions|Help:Print versions]] for the print versions. The problem with the PDF-generation is that advanced polishing would consist of finding work-a-rounds for all the formatting errors of the PDF-generation (however, these formatting errors change as long as the PDF-generation is under development). Polishing print versions requires quite some work. After I started with the {{tlx|Newpage}} template, I realized that I want to adjust the automatic page breaks to avoid page breaks right after section headings. I did this by including an empty-line template that I only &quot;activate&quot; (by editing it) for printing. (This empty-line template makes only sense for the specific paper format and font size that I'm using for printing; thus, it should usually be deactivated. A better solution could be based on {{tlx|Page-break}} but the required functionality is not supported by many browsers.) Once I had page numbers, I also wanted to have the page numbers in a table of contents. I'm doing this now by including the page numbers manually. (You can see the results [[Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_lessons|here]].) Overall, I'm not happy with the process. Therefore, I never included my approach in the help pages. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:49, 5 February 2010 (UTC)
::: A book is much more in depth than any help page. Wikibooks has [[Using Wikibooks]] and [[Editing Wikitext]] for example. I was thinking of something along the lines of how to generate PDFs with OpenOffice and other programs, how to edit PDFs, various techniques that people have found useful for polishing and improving the quality of PDFs, and the advantages, disadvantages, limitations, problems, and work arounds encountered when using each program for making PDFs. Such a book could be useful for helping people to understand how they too can make quality PDFs, and help people decide which program to use. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:17, 5 February 2010 (UTC)
:It's possible to use templates to create page breaks when printing from the browser, then print the print version to a software printer that converts it to a PDF.  However that suffers from requiring manual updating.  The system-generated PDF does add in page breaks for new chapters (lines in the collection with a semicolon) but not for individual pages (lines in the collection starting with a colon).  It seems like it would be an easy tweak but it would take some time for it to be made since few projects other than Wikibooks use this feature. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:30, 4 February 2010 (UTC)

== Deleting pages of seldom-used books ==

I'm trying to wrap my head around the procedure for deletion of pages for being outside the scope of the particular book, with an eye toward Wikijunior.  As I understand it, this is considered {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Wikijunior:How Things Work/GUI (Graphical User Interface)|inappropriate for WB:RFD]]}}, and I gather it is supposed to fall under {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions|Speedy Deletion Criterion 4]]}}.  But Wikijunior in recent times is a pretty quiet place, with few editors about at any given time, which seems to me to make the concept of a quorum for consensus on this rather problematic.

Some questions:
*What standards are reasonably expected for forming a book-specific consensus for this?  In particular,
*How many contributors, with what relationship to the book, can reasonably constitute a quorum for this (and is it possible for a book with few currently active contributors to be fundamentally incapable of supporting such a quorum)?
*Does it make sense to advertise a local discussion of this sort, say at {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]]}} (or somewhere else, and if so, where) &amp;mdash; or would the users attracted by that be considered ineligible for inclusion in the quorum for such a decision?
--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:39, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

: I think I would attempt to look at the specific circumstances of a specific book in making any call. Ideally a majority of people who have actively contributed to a book within the last month would participate in any decision to delete a page from a book. I don't think I would ignore or discount anyone's opinion though. Books are meant to be read by readers, so if readers decide to chime in I think I would consider there opinions to be just as important as any writers. If there are people volunteering to work on a page who have not done so up to now I would consider there opinions as well. I think the reasons are more important than the who, but I think people who contribute to the book, use the book, and read the book have a greater stake in what happens to the book and are more motivated to find solutions, than anyone who has not contributed, has not used the book, and is not going to read it. I think common sense comes into play as well. If a few people are suggesting deletion and there is a group of people actively contributing to the page, I think census is clear people are not interested in deletion. Discussion is by no means the only way to show what the consensus is. I also believe that at times if people seem to have reached a decision but have not attempted to act on it that that can show a new consensus as well. I think I would be very hesitant to act on any show of consensus if it was a bit dated and there was recent activity for example. I think that a good faith assumption that consensus might of changed even if there is no discussion to that effect is reasonable to assume in some cases.
: I think a reasonable attempt should be made to attract discussion on a book's discussion page first before advertising outside the book. If there is no book activity, I would say the decision is up to any person who takes an interest in the book, they can either be bold and do what they want, or seek feedback from the Wikibooks community. I think administrators though should err on the side of caution and keep works that are within Wikibooks' scope even if there is some question as to whether the work is within a book's scope. In other words, when in doubt don't do anything that any user couldn't undo.
: I don't think the standard for book-specific consensus is really any different from community consensus. I think the only difference is there will likely be fewer people who participate in the consensus process. Anyone can join in, any reasonable argument should be considered and count towards figuring out what the consensus is, and anyone can decide to work on improving pages rather than get involved in a discussion which should be considered too when deciding what the consensus is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:00, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

== Distinguishing between good and bad books ==

In a [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion|action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1719122&amp;oldid=1719104}} recent comment] on a RFD discussion, [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] wanted to discuss further why we keep stubs despite making books that are more useful to readers harder to find. As the RFD isn't the right place to discuss such a general case, I figured I'd respond here.

Essentially, any book that can be of use to future contributors is kept. As the hurdle of choosing a topic and starting a book can be high for future contributors, a simple structure can extremely useful. As NumberTheorist has noticed, there are lots of these stubs lying around and I can understand his frustration. Bear in mind, however, that since Wikibooks is primarily about (collaboratively) creating books, we're going to have plenty of undeveloped or developing books around. These need to be made accessible to potential contributors. Furthermore, the simple existence of undeveloped books does not necessarily make developed books hard to find. [[Wikijunior]] only has developed books on its front page and the [[Wikibooks:mathematics bookshelf|mathematics bookshelf]] shows books' [[Help:development stages|development stages]].

The [[Subject:Mathematics|mathematics subject page]] doesn't look terribly attractive and seems less accessible than the bookshelf. I wish anyone working on the huge task of getting these [[Wikibooks:subject pages|subject pages]] working all the best. Just keep in mind that books can (and should, where appropriate) be placed in multiple subject pages. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:03, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

I think we are attempting to determine the coverage level of pages and books, in which case this could probably be automated a bit by taking advantage of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;prop=revisions&amp;titles=Main_Page&amp;rvprop=ids|flagged&amp;rvlimit=1&amp;format=jsonfm json]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:39, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

: Littered stubs are always a problem with wikis. Writing actual content that covers a full page can take time, which may already be divided among other tasks (such as work, education, or other similar wikis), and may require the person to already be an expert in the field.  The result is books that either contain a few pages in the Table of Contents, or many pages with very little information (from editors that make a quick pass.) The only way to deal with stubs is to add to them whenever you see them, and we already have a standard for page completeness within a book.  It could be ported to the Subjects pages, where you can list stub-quality or incomplete books, but that requires some backlinks to make it easier to update.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:14, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

:This discussion is covering to many related subject to be clear what is really is being discussed.
:'''Regarding good or bad books''' the only qualification I recognize is what described in [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] policy as an expression of the community's will, I will express my personal opinion regarding the content but I would not impose my view of what is useful or good on any contributor and will look with some disdain to the actions of Wikibookians that haven't provided any content to judge or impair other volunteers to attempt to contribute content. &quot;Bad&quot; content is better than no content at all, content is the core of this project, and bad content can always be improved.
:'''Regarding stubs''', we have been extremely inconstant on how we categorize them, probably due to each stub having several categorizations regarding age, the creator, scope, structure and content, the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] even defines that &quot;In general, keep stubs that can be improved on, but delete stubs that are too narrowly defined or do not have a decent definition of what it is about.&quot; so admins could in fact delete stubs without a RFD, we are extremely fortuned that no one has decided to proceed with unilateral deletions, probably some work to incorporate the common practice into the policy is in order, we rarely delete stubs (as any page created that has some intelligible content regarding the title of the page, some exceptions are known like the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General#copyvio_tagging_regarding_Wikipedia_.28in_particular.29|copyvio discussion]]) I still remember some admins waging a war on red links so the situation has improved never the less) as we have now extended the &quot;Meaningful content&quot; to include meaningful structure (even if empty of useful content), these last works have mostly been saved on RFD but it depends mostly on the community attention and good will, personally I do not support keeping stubs with only structure that have been stale for more than a year and will always support anyone on a vote to keep stubs in the first RFD...
:'''Regarding adding stubs to Categories''' I haven't any issues and they should be promoted there I would even regard as useful a new effort to categorize those works under a new category (IIRC this practice has been abandoned), on the other hand using Subjects to list stubs to my view is polluting the well, we already suffer for information overload and diluting the usable content we have seems an extremely bad idea (contributors are a minority of our userbase), I don't see that promoting mere concepts next to usable content as beneficial and an incentive to participation.
:'''On the topic of Subjects''' I recently noticed that an alteration had occurred, to what I'm opposed but will not at this time attempt to change. Today a book (cover/toc) page displays Subjects: on the top of the page (but the links provided goes into categories). This behavior is not expected and for me wanted. Now a user will not have direct access to the related subject page. Whiteknight even had included more useful concepts like minimum requirements etc., this information is now obstructed from users, subjects are important to seek other books on the same subject (and related subjects) and having Categories displayed on the root is somehow redundant and they are hard to read (even with the improvements added, here the font change on focus flickers a lot, and long page names are unreadable). It is also confusing to see the line indicate subject and all links are going to the categories.     
:Innovations for the mere sake of innovations are mere distractions, as always I'm extremely vocal on putting the content above format. On another tone we have to recognize the extreme effort done to make Categories work, but it seems to me that people haven't yet come to grips or have forgotten the distinction that was intentioned for Subject pages. Categories are for contributors, Subjects are for readers. As a contributor I rarely use the Categories and prefer to navigate using the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&amp;prefix=&amp;namespace=0 list by prefix]], this is why I also disfavor redirect pages).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:33, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

== [[A More Efficient Prime Number Generating Algorithm]] and original research ==

Hello, I wonder about this book.  It seems to be original research in some ways.  The first bit is stuff you might learn in an intro to programming course and then he talks about things he developed starting in 1984 under the heading PG7.8.  Any way, so I don't know if it's original research but it seems to be.  There are no references at all and he talks as if he's the one who has developed this idea though I didn't read it real carefully.  So, what is the policy for this?  I understand that original research does not belong here but I do not know anything beyond that.  Thanks. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 17:19, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

: It does, indeed, seem like that. I don't think it's original research in the sense that it is presenting some new truth; I haven't bothered going through the code or running it, but as long as it builds on established techniques, it should be fine. I've copyedited it to make it sound a little less like an academic paper (removed stuff like &quot;my code&quot;) and moved it to [[Efficient Prime Number Generating Algorithms]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:18, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

::Okay, sounds good.  One thing I thought of was merging it into one of the books on algorithms.  But, I asked on the talk page of [[Algorithms]] to see if they thought it would fit in that book and no response yet.  There is also [[Algorithm Implementation]] which has prime number generating algorithms in it but the book seems to be more about just having an algorithm than having the best one.  I will ask on that talk page too to see what they think.  The thing is, by itself it's not a book.  It's like a short article.  And, most of it is code.  --[[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:00, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

::: The only problem is that [[Algorithms]] is a book on techniques, but [[Efficient Prime Number Generating Algorithms]] on a specific problem.

== Starting a book for computer beginers ==

Hello everybody,
I'm just writing to say hello and declare my intentions.
Basically, its my experience that lots of people have no idea how computers work, so I want to fix that. The current book on the site is really good at explaining what things are, and how to use them, but I want to take a different track: I want to make the reader know ''why'' computers are the way they are. 

As an example: in making a manual for a car, you could just include instructions for changing the oil, tires and air filter. But what'd be really good is a manual that told you how the engine generates power, how the oil keeps things going, and how the cooling systems works. A car owner with such a manual would know things about their car without having to be explicitly told, because they understand the basic idea of how thing should work.

When it's all said and done, I want a book that I can hand to my grandma, and which she can read without fear or confusion. And hopefully when she's done reading it, she'll be able to do anything with a computer that she wants to, or anything she wants to learn about.

So, that's the idea. I'll have more specifics of the philosophy of the book on the book page itself.

Peace,

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

	Developing a group or [[w:team|team]] is a useful approach to accomplishing a task.  During this discussion the term “group” and &quot;team&quot; are used interchangeably.  When developed and run effectively a team can be used to pool the ideas and experiences of its members in search for a collective outcome.  Organizations of all types can benefit from the work of teams.  An effective team should be able to share experiences and provide each other feedback.  By sharing experiences, teams can generate insight and become effective problem solvers through a collaborated effort.  Developing a successful team requires understanding [[w:group dynamics|group dynamics]] and planning for those dynamics is an important step for building positive group dymanics. The first section of this chapter focused on Tuckman’s model&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  His model gives a good idea of how teams are formed and some of the dynamics that develop as the team progresses.  This section will focus on what is a team, what you can you do to foster good group dynamics and what are some problems to look for.

== What is a Team? ==

	A team is “two or more people who share a common definition and evaluation of themselves and behave in accordance with such a definition.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  A team is any group of people organized to work together interdependently and cooperatively to meet a specific need, by accomplishing a purpose and goals. Teams are created for both long term and short term interaction.  A Team can also be defined as a collection of people who act in response to a common goal or outcome.  The team is only as good as its members and how they interact with other.  How many members should be on a team is largely dependant on the reason the team was established.  According to Sharpening the Team Mind&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, when deciding the number of members to have on a team consider the “uneven communication problem.”  The theory states, only a handful of team members do all the talking.  For example a team of six, three people do 86% of all the talking.


== Create positive group dynamics ==
Important aspects of a group that works well together, is how individuals interact with each other and how individuals react with the group.  Positive relationships are important in a group, and understanding them is equally important.  In order to develop good group dynamics, you must first develop good relationships. 

According to LaFasto and Larson in “When Teams Work Best,”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; there are four aspects of a good relationship: constructive, productive, mutual understanding and self-corrective.  These four aspects are the basis for LaFasto and Larson’s Connect model (Table 1), which can be used to develop good relationships.

A '''&lt;u&gt;constructive&lt;/u&gt;''' relationship can also be between a person and the team.  “Good relationships are constructive for both people.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; In order to have a constructive relationship, there must be trust and mutual understanding between both parties.  Constructive relationships do not happen overnight, it takes time to develop trust and to be open with others.  '''&lt;u&gt;Productive&lt;/u&gt;''' relationships are important because if the relationship between two individuals on a team is not productive, the team may not be productive.  Productive relationships also, “allow us to focus on real issues –the ones that matter– and to do so in a way that makes a difference.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;u&gt;'''Mutual understanding'''&lt;/u&gt; is critical because, “they encourage us to focus on and understand the other person’s perspective, and they offer us the satisfaction of being understood.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  Not only is it important to validate other person’s point of view, it is important for us to be validated.  It goes back to trust and building a constructive relationship, in order to be understood, you have to be able to understand others.  Good relationships are &lt;u&gt;'''self-corrective'''&lt;/u&gt;.  It is like a marriage, each part is committed to improving the relationship.  By continuing to work on improving a relationship you are developing trust and mutual understanding between the parties.

&lt;u&gt;Table #1&lt;/u&gt;

The Connect Model (Summarized) 
1993 Frank M. J. LaFasto, Ph.D. and Carl E. Larson, Ph.D. 
# Comment to a Relationship
# Optimize Safety 
# Narrow to One Issue
# Neutralize Defensiveness 
# Explain and Echo
#Change one Behavior Each
# Track It!

As you are working on developing good relationships another way to foster good group dynamics is to identify strengths and weaknesses and assign group roles.  For a new team that has not worked together, assigning roles can also help surface individual strengths and weaknesses.  By simply assigning roles at the beginning of the project a team can quickly focus on the tasks.  Everyone should be responsible for brain storming, problem solving and providing their experience and knowledge, but some roles are more generic and may or may not vary by task.  Here are four roles that no team should be without: 

# '''A  Leader''' – In the event there is no clear chain of command, a team must be prepared to assign the role of leader.  A leader can keep the team focused, mediate conflicts and ensure that individuals are held accountable. 
# '''A note taker or scribe''' – again, a simple idea, but documenting every meeting is an important step in developing a productive team.  A scribe can quickly get a team up to date with past notes so little time is wasted remembering where you left off.  By documenting and distributing notes from each meeting, all members of the team will be equally informed.  
# '''Lessons Learned tracker''' – Identify one person to track both positive and negative outcomes of meetings and projects.  This individual can solicit input from other members.  By documenting what everyone things went well and why and what did not go well and why, can keep a team productive by not repeating past mistakes. 
# '''Devil’s Advocate''' – Teams need to embrace conflict and different points of view.  By assigning a devil’s advocate, this person can freely bring up alternatives or objections, making the team more objective.

== Problems that hinder good group dynamics ==
	There are many problems that hinder good group dynamics.  We don’t usually have the luxury of picking who we are going to work with on a team; dealing with different personalities and personal agendas are common challenges in working within a team.  Other commons challenges like, poor leadership, bad communications, and lack of focus can be helped or eliminated by establishing team roles as mentioned above. 

The first challenge that hinders good group dynamics is poor leadership.  There are a few things an individual can do if the poor team leadership is your boss or someone with authoritative power is in charge of your team.  First, be supportive, if your boss trusts you and you are supportive, you may be able to influence decisions by suggesting alternatives.  If the poor leader did not assign a devil’s advocate, suggest it during a team meeting and why you think it would be beneficial.  Once the devil’s advocate is in place, coach him or her to bring up alternatives.  Once alternatives are out in the open and debated, the poor leader may see that the new idea is better.   

Bad communications is a quick way for a team to be unproductive and ineffective.  By using a scribe and lessons learned tracker to document team meetings and activities a team can easily be kept up to date and in the loop.  An effective team leader can assign tasks and hold people accountable for their contributions, which can prevent social loafing and incite good communications.  

Lack of focus can make a team just a group of individuals.  Keeping the team focused takes constant effort.  A good leader can keep teams focused and on task by assigning roles and enforcing accountability.  A good method to keep teams focused is by using an agenda and distributing it prior to the meeting.  An agenda can get people on the same page and will encourage them to prepare based on the topics under discussion.  
           
Groupthink, dominate personalities and social loafing are all challenges you will face when working with a team.  The key to combating these challenges is to be able to identify when they are taking place.
  
- [[w:Groupthink|'''Groupthink''']] is simply going along with the team on a decision because that seems to be the consensus and they want to avoid conflict.  Having a strong devil’s advocate will help reduce the chances of groupthink.  

- '''Dominate personalities''' are difficult to deal with, sticking to an agenda, establishing protocols during meetings, and having an effective leader can be used to combat strong personalities.  

- [[w:Social loafing|'''Social loafing''']] is someone that is putting forth less effort as a member of a group than they would as and individual.  Again, leadership and holding people accountable is a great tool to deal with social loafing.

== Conclusion ==

When the team process is executed effectively a team can be used to pool the ideas and experiences of its members in search for a collective outcome.  Team can help organizations of all types be more efficient in problem solving by pooling experienced employees to work together.  A key to an effective team is to understand group dynamics.  Good group dynamics begin with good relationships, both on an individual basis and the relationships of individuals with the team. LaFasto and Larson developed the Connect Model to assist individuals develop good relationships.  The Connect Model was built around the four most important aspects of a good relationship, constructive, productive, mutual understanding and self-corrective.  Once you have established good relationships, assigning positions in the team will give a team the opportunity to be successful.  By identifying possible pitfalls that may hinder good team dynamics team members can combat the effects and develop a more productive and successful team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SATA, MBR and GPT hell ==
With the [[w:Extensible Firmware Interface|Extensible Firmware Interface]] originally developed by Intel adoption in recent BIOS and on the new OSs (especially the 64bit variety) one is pushed to adopt a new set of technologies. This signifies considering dropping other older technologies. For instance the older [[w:Master boot record|MBR (Master Boot Record)]] technology may be replaced with the new [[w:GUID Partition Table|GPT (GUID Partition Table)]] system but carefully consideration should be given to the trade-offs.

There is the issue with compatibility with older or less developed OSs. For instance you need a OS higher than Windows XP or a recent distro of Linux to access GPT disks, that signifies that is something breaks you will have to be prepared to deal with the new technology, this includes the limitations in portability of those disks to another computer or OS. 

The only real advantage of GPT is some increased security and accuracy in regards to partition information and over the installed OSs, also the capability to support partitions above 2.20 TB (2.20 × 1012 bytes) and dropping the scheme of extended partitioning (see [[w:Extended boot record|Extended boot record]]) that served under the MBR system to bypass the 4 main partition limit, but at a cost of some drive space since the GPT uses a dedicated partition to keep its information that takes much more space than the old MBR system. Note that in the new [[w:Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)]] only GPT partitions can be used for booting.

Since Windows Vista, the Windows Boot Manager uses the [[w:Boot Configuration Data|BCD (Boot Configuration Data)]] as a firmware-independent database for boot-time configuration data. This information is kept in the Extensible Firmware Interface GUID Partition Table partition of the GPT disk.

GPT disks are only accessible in recent OSs on the Windows platform, on Windows XP x64 edition (no boot, only for data storage), Windows Server 2003 SP1, Windows Server 2003 (64-bit), Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. For instance under Windows XP (even SP3) GPT disks are recognized but not accessible for reading or writing at file-system level (one can access their data using a file-system recovering tool that supports the properties of the file system used on the GPT partitions). More information regarding GPT under Windows is available on the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463525.aspx#MixMatch Windows and GPT FAQ] page maintained by MS (with some &quot;minor&quot; inaccuracies).

== Virtualbox (Windows Host - Ubuntu guest) ==
'''shared directories'''
After having defined a static shared folder for the VM image

sudo apt-get update&lt;br&gt;
&lt;reset if needed&gt;&lt;br&gt;
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y&lt;br&gt;
&lt;make sure Additions CD is installed&gt;&lt;br&gt;
cd /media/cdrom&lt;br&gt;
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run&lt;br&gt;

&lt;reset or mount /media/windowsshare&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The go into /etc/rc.local (a script) and add (&quot;sudo gedit /etc/rc.local&quot;) the mount command for it, next boot it will be there. (mount -t vboxfs [sharedfolderID] [mountpath])

== DOS on Windows extra setups ==
Go to the DOS window's 
*Options | Command History | Buffer Size | 500
*Options | Command History | Discard Old Duplicates | True
*Options | Edit Options | QuickEdit Mode | True
*Layout | Screen buffer size | Height | 999

Check any need to change the size of the window and my favorite colors are 192,192,192 bright gray on 0,0,0 black.

PS:Don't forget F7/ESC cli history

== Doxygen and Visual Studio ==
Set Doxygen WARN_FORMAT to $file($line): $text.
Set Doxygen WARN_LOGFILE to the location and name of the file that will list the warnings.
On VS Tools | External Tools add Title:Doxlog Command:%systemroot%\system32\cmd.exe Argument:/K type &lt;the file set on Doxygen WARN_LOGFILE&gt; and check &quot;Use output directory&quot;.
On VS Tools | External Tools add Title:Dogygen Command:&lt;path to&gt;\doxygen.exe Arguments: &quot;&lt;path and doxygen config file for the project&quot; (include the quotes) initial Directory: &quot;$(WkspDir)&quot; and check &quot;Use output directory&quot; verify that Doxygen QUIET is not checked so you can get messages of the work being done.

== Windows Install and Boot Disk ==
Simpler way is to have a Win98 DOS (7.0) (No [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120630091842/http://madsenworld.dk/con_auto/index-uk.htm DOS-FU] required) bootable device. Copy system SYS x: to the active partition (will now boot into DOS), copy xmsmmgr.exe (memory manager to access extended memory) and [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130116130311/http://www.computerhope.com/smartdrv.htm smartdrv.exe] (to cache device operations into the extended memory) and go into the i386 directory and run winnt.

Failing to use smartdrv will make the operation extremely slow...

== Wine ==
A reliable method of detecting Wine presence is by checking for the existence of the Wine configuration registry key branch.

== Firefox 7+ / Pale moon ==
To access the config (hidden in recent versions of firefox) type the normal about:config on the url field.

browser.urlbar.trimURLs  (set to false so that HTTP:// and HTTPS:// are properly displayed)

about:memory gives information regarding memory usage

(fantastic loss of time)
Pale moon doesn't seem to like my FEBE imported permissions (this is important since the corruption prevented cookies exceptions to be saved), go into the [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox Profile folder], not the Mozzila version but the one in Application Data\&lt;u&gt;Moonchild Productions&lt;/u&gt;\Pale Moon\Profiles\ and delete permissions.sqlite that will fix the issue.

== DAISY (ebook format) ==
Looking for a freely available copy of [http://books.google.com/books/about/Of_spies_stratagems.html?id=3mcZAAAAIAAJ Of spies &amp; stratagems] by Stanley P. Lovell I found a version of archive.org but it was only available on the freaking [[w:DAISY|DAISY]] format (and encrypted) (PDF versions and other) give a report that they were removed due to problems of content ?!? Anyway I'm keeping this info here since I may try this again later (or find any other work in this hateful format). There seem not to be any free converters even to non-ecrypted works and there is a limited availability of readers [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ddreader/ DDReader] (FireFox extension for version 3.0 of the format) and [http://www.daisy.org/amis/download AMIS] (beta for Windows in Java)

== Flash ==
Flash sucks, big time... Can't wait for HTML5 (or 6) to start to kill it, hopefully quickly...
For updates one has to at least check once every week as this is a very important vector to get security problems on your machine. The freaking web update is not only annoying as hell but unnecessary (and the McAfee crapware plug, or others, builds up my distaste) as to any benefit it may have for you the user. Go into the [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installation-problems-flash-player-windows.html FAQ page and look at the section for how to install flash behind a firewall] for the link to the stand alone executable. At least if you have to reinstall it you save yourself the trouble of downloading it again. (not that it will have a very long shelf life)...

Notice that they go out of the way to hide it from you (it is clearly intentional) [http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/current/support/install_flash_player.exe Windows (non IE) version]

Note also that there is a bug after the Flash upgrade if you visit youtube, probably due to some information about your player being kept in the cookies, you have to manual delete them to be able to see the videos normally.

== Java ==
Dang, they adopted the same policy of flash for the obfuscation for the offline download so I'm keeping it here as not to have to process the wasteful information to [http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp get to it].

== Win 8 ==
As the machine continued to be sluggish I have attempted to determine the cause, [http://withinwindows.com/2012/06/28/workaround-for-windows-8-freezing-issues/|Workaround for Windows 8 freezing issues] the last change was to change the

in situations that the computer will remain idle it can be reversed with:
 bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes

(It needs a restart to become effective, this is probably why it is not in the power settings)

It is useful to consider what is important to you in temrs of how you run your business to help you know how to spend your time and what to pay attention to.

Every day in the business, there will be decisions to make about how to do business. It will be helpful to have clarity over what is most important to you about how you run your business and what your bottom lines are to ensure you continuously make decisions in line with what is important to you.

Rank the following values from 1 to 8 with 1 being the most important value to you: (this needs work)

Making a living for myself and/or my family

Being the best and most well known at my business

Contributing toward a healthy, sustainable planet for future generations to inherit

Being a contribution to other people – both in my local community and elsewhere

Being a good employer – being committed to employees satisfaction, development and wellbeing and treating everyone fairly

Encouraging others to treat the environment and people with respect

Having a good balance between how much time I spend working vs other things that are important to me (family, hobbies etc)

Treating everyone I interact with fairly

All my decisions are honest and ethical

And to support me in operating this way,  how do I ensure that those I work with know what is important to me and are able to integrate it into the way they do business?</text>

== Delete or Rfd ==
I'm not so familiar with the deletion process in Wikibooks that I'd say flat out it's an error, but could someone with more knowledge here please take a look at this statement in the page:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Place {{delete}} at the top of the module in question.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Shouldn't that be:&lt;br/&gt;

'''Just one request:''' In order to have a uniform reference format for the User-Generated Content wikibook, I requested that we follow the reference format in our sample page at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education. Do you have time to make that change? --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:46, 8 March 2010 (UTC)


S.B.~ Nicely laid out page!  Great information and I liked the offset of the pictures.  The information you published was worthy of a good read and presented an unbiased representataion of what Wikipedia is, good and bad.  I wondered, though, if the in paragraph links should have read as numbers rather than words to bring the reader to your reference list.  It seemed that one particular citation showed numerous times.  I am in no way an expert on this format, but saw that as something that stood out to me.  I love the idea that anyone can post comments but everything is reviewed when posted to Wikipedia.  I think that really helps to support the reliability of the project as a whole.

J.F.- Page was very well done!  I liked the pictures as well.  Excellent list of resources that can be utilized for further research.  Information on Wikipedia was well laid out and objective.

R.Y. - I love Wikipedia and I love this overview of how to use it in the classroom.  You did a very nice job of being objective with what is a controversial topic in our field!

KC- I really liked the layout of the Wikipedia in Education page! Nice quote at the end: &quot;A Wikipedia entry should not be “used as a source of truth but as a springboard to further inquiry.&quot; Definitely information everybody should remember!


The wikipedia book was easy to follow. I liked how the external links are set up. It lets you know what type of media you are going be seeing.(MH)

LH - Learned how to set up references properly and helped clean up original posts and citations in APA format

LH- Completed part of the definition of Wikipedia at the top of the page.

LH - Added more concise lines to the Advantages of Wikipedia topic area.

LH - Cleaned up some spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the article.

LH - Added an additional line to Advantages to using Wikipedia and fixed a spelling mistake in the Pros and Cons section but both are coming up with a pending review message.

LH - Added additional external links to the bottom of the page. Also, some of the external sites were not working  so I fixed those problems.

LH - Edited Videos and Articles section to add embedded hyperlinks and brief annotations to help direct readers 

SK - Finished revising citations and reference list. I followed the citation pattern suggested by the previous class (SGarrigan) patterned on the Assistive Technologies wikibook. Some of these citations needed updating with accessible versions.

SK - Edited Blogs and Websites section to add embedded hyperlinks and brief annotations directing readers. 



S &amp; L--Nice job on the Wikipedia page!  I enjoyed reading the pros/cons of Wikipedia and how it can be used in the classroom.  At my school, Wikipedia is often not encouraged as a resource.  It is helpful to have some background knowledge in which to use for support when questioned. ---N.K. 2011.</text>

CK-12 Flexbooks was informational. The reference numbers in the texted easily corresponded with the references section. Pictures could be added to explain the topic.(MH)


M.P.   Hey, I really liked the history of the YouTube. You gave very good details but in a short and direct manor. When you mentioned the date of the first YouTube post, I was hoping to have a link the the actually post. I was curious as to what it was. This way I could have made a comparison to how far the website has come. I use YouTube in my classroom very frequently, and I know my students use it all the time. With the creation of YouStream.... there are unlimited opportunities for classroom use!

I always wondered where YouTube came from. Who came up with the idea and what it was meant to do. great addition to the Wikibook. - JBusch

I really liked the layout of the Wikipedia in Education page! Nice quote at the end: &quot;A Wikipedia entry should not be “used as a source of truth but as a springboard to further inquiry.&quot; Definitely information everybody should remember!-KC

I liked your quote too. You did a great job. JBusch

CK-12 Flexbooks was an informative page. I hope save in the future my school will become part of the initiative and it sounds like it will save many other educational organizations a lot of money. -KC

T.M. I looked at both the YouTube etry and the CK-12 Flexbook entry and was very impressed with both.  I was taken with how professional looking they both were.


K.E.  located resources, linked articles, created and/or revised content for Wikibooks in Education, Wikijunior and Featured Books.  My partner is the real hero, she figured out the formatting and I piggybacked from hers :)

B.D. I created the user-created music page of the wikibook. This was a difficult task as there wasn't a whole lot of information available on the topic.


The Youtube/Teacher tube books is very well organized.  I like the Benefits and Criticism sections as well as the information about copyright laws.

Hi. Dr. G,

In regards to my contribution to our wikibook page entry:

JR I helped create Definition of User Generated Content, Forecast of User Generated Content USA, Exemplars of Web-Based and User Generated Content, co-authored links/references


Comment on two colleagues wikibook pages:

JR YouTube - provided a very interesting historical perspective in how Teacher Tube was created. Informative links.

JR CK Flexbooks - great insight about how both Florida and California embraced the concept of flexbooks for two very different reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==

'''Mathew 16''' takes place in the region of Magadan and is a continuation of the events reported in Mathew 15 (Jesus feeds the four thousand after healing masses of people) beginning with the request of signs from Heaven from the Pharisees and Sadducees.  After Jesus chastises them for there request of signs again He and the Disciples depart.  

With lack of food the disciples began to worry and Jesus begun to warn them about the yeast of the Pharisees which they took to be a scolding for not bringing food.  Jesus then questioned there faith and explained to them that they need to worry about the Pharisees teaching not the lack of food for they have already witnessed Jesus ability to provide.  

Once they had reached Caesarea Philipi Jesus asked the question about who people believed he was.  After some debate the Peter claimed that Jesus was the Christ.  It was then that Jesus named Peter the head of the Church and called him the Rock unto which he would build it.  After some discourse Jesus informs the disciples that they must not tell anybody who he is.  Keeping up with the Messianic Secret.  From here on out it says Jesus began to show or explain what he must do in Jerusalem.  

Peter exclaims that this can not be.  Jesus then responds to Peter the one whom he had just said he would place the Church by saying “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not on the side of God but of men.”  

Jesus tells the disciples as a whole that anybody who wants to follow after him must pick up their cross and follow him.  Jesus also tells them that if they want to save there life they will lose it and by forfeiting there life they shall gain it.  

Jesus finishes by telling the disciples that some of them will not “taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom”.  This narrative can be found in Mark 8 as well but there is no similar account found in Luke.


== The Author ==

===I.One of the twelve apostles===
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1.when listed he is seventh in Mark and Luke, eight in Mathew and Acts. &lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2.Suggesting disciple of lesser status.&lt;p&gt;
===II.identified as a tax collector before becoming a follower of Jesus.&lt;p&gt;===
===III.Originally thought to be a Jewish Christian writing to other Jews and the gospel was possibly written in Hebrew first.&lt;p&gt;===

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1.Though modern thought has allowed for a view in which Matthew is a Gentile who simply merged a form of Jewish Christianity into his Gospel.&lt;p&gt;

===IV.First hand witness to many of the events mentioned in the Gospel.&lt;p&gt;===
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. It can be argued that all the other gospel writers were telling the story second hand, if Mathew is the disciple then it is a unique perspective of the story with a kind of authority. &lt;p&gt;

===V. Focus on teaching&lt;p&gt;===
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Mathew often puts more focus on teaching material than we can see in one of his sources Mark.  This new emphasize shows the need for a kind of catechism in the church quite possibly in the Jewish-Christian &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; community.


== Contextual Information ==
==='''Textual Context'''&lt;p&gt;===
==='''I.autho'''r:  Attributed to the apostle Mathew at least from the time of Irenaeus (A.D. 185), although the earliest manuscripts are anonymous.===

==='''II.sources'''===
I.author:  Attributed to the apostle Mathew at least from the time of Irenaeus (ad 185) though earliest manuscripts are anonymous. &lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.most scholars agree that Mathew  had 2 different sources at hand during the writing process.  The two sources attributed are the Gospel of Mark and the source most known as Q. &lt;p&gt;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.Many scholars often believe that Mathew is a revision of Mark which can be seen in the way Mathew retells many of the miracle stories. If in fact Mark was used in the writing of Matthew it implies that the evangelist in Matthew did not feel as though Mark had covered all the needed material. Also it is likely that Mathew reworked Mark to make specific theological claims.&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.Mathew often shortens them or removes some of the details.&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.This means that Mark pre-dates Mathew by some unknown amount of time.  &lt;p&gt;

==='''III.The structure of the Gospel of Mathew'''&lt;p&gt;===
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.it is agreed that the gospel has an introduction followed by 5 discourses with other anecdotal events squeezed in and then concluded. &lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.Genealogy and Infancy  (chapters 1-2)&lt;p&gt;

== Paraphrase ==

'''Matthew 16 Paraphrase:'''

This Paraphrase is based on the NIV, NKJV, NASB and the Message translations of the Bible intended to present a modern understanding of the text that reflects my personal understanding of the text. Translations used can be accessed online at  [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mathew%2016&amp;version=NIV Biblegateway.com] 

1.The Pharisees and Sadducees approached Jesus with intent to test him into showing them a sign from heaven.&lt;p&gt;
2.Jesus rebuked them saying “When the evening comes you say 'it will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'&lt;p&gt;
3.'and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You think you can forecast the weather but you fail to see the signs of the times. &lt;p&gt;
4.A wicked and adulterous generation looks for and relies on miracles, but they will not be given any except the sign of Jonah.' Jesus then walked away.&lt;p&gt;
5.When they (the Disciples) travelled across the lake they had forgotten to bring bread.&lt;p&gt;
6.“Be careful.” Jesus told them “Be on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees”.&lt;p&gt;
7.They discussed this amongs themselves and believed that Jesus was commenting on them for forgetting the bread.&lt;p&gt;
8.Jesus being aware of there discussion asked, “You of little Faith, why are you so concerned with having no bread?&lt;p&gt;
9.Do you not Get it? Don't you remember the fives loaves that fed five thousand, and all the leftovers you gathered.&lt;p&gt;
10.Or the seven loaves that fed the four thousand and the leftovers you gathered that time? &lt;p&gt;
11.How do you still not understand that this is not about the bread? But be ready to fight off the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducess.” &lt;p&gt;
12.Then they finally understood that it was not about the yeast used in bread, but rather against the teachings and ideas of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&lt;p&gt;
13.When Jesus reached the region of Caesarea Philippi He asked the disciples, “Who do the people say the Son of Man is?”&lt;p&gt;
14.They answered “some say John the Baptist while others say Elijah, and some believe Jeremiah or another prophet.”&lt;p&gt;
15.“But what do you think?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?”&lt;p&gt;
16.Simon Peter replied, “ You are the Christ, The Son of the living God.”&lt;p&gt;
17.Jesus answered, “Blessed are you Simon son of Jonah, because this was not revealed to you by a human but rather by my Father in heaven. &lt;p&gt;
18.I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock my Church will be crafted, and the forces of Hell will not overcome it. &lt;p&gt;
19.And I will give you the keys to this Kingdom and whatever you bind here on earth shall also be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose here on earth will be loosed in heaven.”&lt;p&gt;
20.Jesus then warned the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ.&lt;p&gt;
21.From this point forward Jesus began to explain to the disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer a great amount at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law and that they would eventually kill him so that he can be raised back to life on the third day.&lt;p&gt;
22.Peter pulled him aside and began to rebuke him for the things he said. “Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!”&lt;p&gt;
23.Jesus looked at Peter and said “Get out of my sight Satan! You are causing me to fall short; you do not understand the plans of God, but only the ideals of men.”&lt;p&gt;
24.Jesus told his disciples “If anybody is to follow after me they must first deny themselves and pick up their cross, then follow.&lt;p&gt;
25.For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever gives up their life for me will find it.&lt;p&gt;
26.What good is it to have the whole world but have no soul?&lt;p&gt;
27.The Son of man is coming with his Father's glory and his angels, and will reward everybody in accordance with what they have done in life.&lt;p&gt;
28.I tell you the truth. That some who are with us now will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”&lt;p&gt;

== Commentary ==

==='''1-4'''=== 
The second demand for a sign takes place in Magadan flowing straight into the next narrative which indicates that there is a distinct connection between the two passages.  This set of verses is the second time that Jesus has been asked to show a sign and the second time he rebukes the request.  It is clear that the Pharisees and Sadducee are asking for signs from heaven not because they want to see Jesus the messiah in action but rather for some alternative motive.  It is very clear after reading chapter 15 that Jesus has the ability to work wonders on the world after healing people and feeding thousands with just a few loves of bread and a few fish.  It is not a sign that is desired but rather are attempting once again to trap Jesus so that they can persecute and kill him.  It is at this point that you reach the apex of the mountain and at the bottom you can see the Cross awaiting Jesus' Death and eventual resurrection. &lt;p&gt;

==='''5-'''9=== 

Jesus' claim to the “little faith” of the Disciples is a direct result of there concern with the absence of provisions, which in reality was a very small problem in relation to the miracles they had previously seen Jesus accomplish (Albright and Mann ##).  By worrying about the next meal the disciples have given complete disregard not only to prior miracles but to the God who provides for all (Hare ##). 

However, instead of addressing the disciples and their worries, Jesus begins a new conversation in reference to what happened in verses 1-4.  Jesus is minimally concerned, if at all, with the disciples desire for food but uses it to make an example.  The use of yeast or leaven as a symbol for teachings specifically poor teachings is not exclusive to this particular narrative but rather can be seen through out the NT (1 Cor 5:6-8; Gal 5:9) and also in other rabbinic literature (Albright and Mann 192; Bromiley 589). The disciples missed Jesus' symbolic use of leaven or yeast as a symbol for the corrupt teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. They mistook this as some kind of advice or warning against purchasing poisoned loaves of bread (Bromiley 589).  

This is just another instance in the book of Mathew in which the disciples miss the point due to their lack of attention to detail. Or, is it because God has hardened their hearts, as some have suggested, so that they do not figure out the identity of Jesus until the ideal moment in his ministry.  

After Jesus heard the disciples discuss the lack of bread at length, he called them “people of little faith.” This phrase is used in Matthew only to describe the disciples.  

Jesus addressed their disregard for the miracles that they had already seen. Were the disciples constantly forgetting or were they completely unintelligent? Or, had God prevented them from realizing who Jesus really was up to this point in time?  &lt;p&gt;

==='''9-12'''===
Jesus continues on starting off with a reminder that they have seen much greater things than the mere feeding of 13 men in but that they have seen  him feel thousands.  As stated Jesus two questions the intelligence of the disciples asking if they don't understand or if they don't remember.  Through out the Gospel encounters the disciples are constantly dropping the ball and Jesus in a since is prodding them in the middle of his rebuke for not being aware of what is going on around them.  Jesus clearly disappointed returns to the issue at hand and repeats what he said earlier “But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducee.” the only difference is that Jesus previously announces to them that he is not talking about bread,  though this time it is possible that with the small hint Jesus Game them they were able to come to a more accurate conclusion as to what Jesus was saying the second time around.  &lt;p&gt;
==='''13-19'''===
This particular group of scripture is a major climax that has been in the making since very early on in the gospel and from this point on there is no question for the read and for the disciples as to who Jesus is and what he has come to accomplish.  Through out the gospel narratives we have seen many different people make statements or ask questions regarding his identity all of that suspend has come together at this moment in which Peter makes a clear and bold statement that Jesus is the Son of God the Messiah that has been promised.  (Hagner)
Jesus and the disciples have traveled out to Caesarea Philippi in a kind of retreat quite possibly for the purpose of what is about to take place and to begin the journey toward the Cross.  Also it could very well be much more practical as a way to retreat from the populated areas and the attention that Jesus has been gaining in attempt to slow the inevitable.  The Pharisees are already preparing to kill Jesus which present new challenges not only for Jesus safety but the safety of the Church.  Jesus as far as we know from the way the evangelist tells the story is very direct and asks the disciples up front what people are saying about him and then after they respond and the is a slight discussion Jesus asks them who they say he is.  Peter steps forward and responds with a claim that Jesus is the Son of God and in turn the Messiah.  It is important to note here that Peter is not the only one of the disciples who believes this statement but rather he is most likely acting as a spokesman and restating what they believe as the disciples have already claimed Jesus as the Son of God in chapter 14 after Jesus walks on water  (Luz).  Thought Jesus says Peter is set apart there is no real new revelation because the evangelist has already informed the audience of who Jesus is and that God the Father alone can reveal the identity of his son to others.  It is at this point Jesus claims that Peter is the Rock that the by “ my Church” will be constructed upon. The claiming the Church as being Jesus he is implying that it is not simply a congregation but rather Jesus is referring to the universal Church body.  By stating the placement of the Church on a rock Jesus is making a claim of stability and permanence in reference to previous discussion involving houses built on different surfaces (a house built on a rock remains standing)(Luz). Baker suggests that Jesus promises in verse 19 are not specifically granted only to Peter but they are promises to anyone who proclaims the truth of Jesus Christ.  If this is correct than it can be said that any man who has a clear understanding and grasp on Christ nature will have an understanding of what will go on in the kingdom of Heaven.  (Gaebelein)&lt;p&gt;

==='''20-23'''===
As stated the previous passage is a major shifting point not only in the Gospel but in Jesus ministry there is now a clear path that can be seen directly to the cross.  We see here that Jesus reveals the ending to his disciples as if the fore shadowing that can be seen in the narrative so far was not enough.  However once again the miss the point and just like before Peter speaks in protest to the claim that Jesus the Messiah must suffer at the hand of the religious leaders.  Jesus with a strong hand rebukes not only Peter but the crowd (crowd could be more than just the disciples)as well claiming that by trying to hold on to Christs physical being they are in fact doing the work of Satan(Maclaren).  &lt;p&gt;

==='''23-28'''===
As Jesus begins to lay out the script for how one is to follow after him it seems as thought the disciples do not realize that the consequences of Jesus life are in turn the consequences for them and many of the Christians to follow after them.  Jesus calls not only the disciples but all people to deny the earthly desires and pick up the cross.  Jesus backs up the previous claim by asking essential what the price for a human soul would be.  Our earthly pursuits are nothing more than selling out our Imagio Dei in attempt to fulfill ourselves with earthly matter (Albright 200).  After warning the disciples about the cost of not following Christ he tells them of the rewards that are to come for those who are willing to lose their life for the Cause of Christ.  &lt;p&gt;

== Questions and Concerns ==
'''This chapter starts of with Jesus being tested, what is it that they are testing him for?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Jesus has been doing miracles all over the region and just feed thousands of people why do the Pharisees and Sadducee's still need a sign and why wont Jesus give it too them?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Why is it that the Disciples forgot to bring food with them? Wouldn't the Fisherman among them at least realize the need to bring sustaining with them.''' &lt;p&gt;

'''Why should they beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? What is this leaven if it is not for bread?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Note that the disciples have no idea what Jesus is talking about?  Where else does this happen in Mathew as well as in other Gospels?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Why is it that the disciples are so worried about food when they have seen Jess feed thousands. ''' &lt;p&gt;

'''What where the Pharisees and Sadducees teaching that was so bad?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Where is Caesarea Philippi and is it significant in any way to this narrative?'''&lt;p&gt;
 
'''Why does Jesus ask the disciples this question and at this particular time?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Why does Peter throw out the answer and why is it that he is the only one who has been reviled this new information?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Why would Jesus give Peter such honor when shortly after he is scolded and told to get back?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''Why Is Jesus insisting that they tell nobody about what they have been told?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''What has Changed that Jesus is no ready to tell them what is going to happen in Jerusalem and why don't they believe him?''' &lt;p&gt;

'''Why does Peter who knows he is the Messiah call foul and rebuke Jesus?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''What does it mean to pick up your cross daily?'''&lt;p&gt;

'''What does Jesus mean when he says that there are some with him that will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom?'''&lt;p&gt;

Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Goran Hadzic
(+)
(Confessions of a Female War Crimes Investigator)


	Retrospectively, it was all so simple, natural and matter of fact being on a boat restaurant in Belgrade, sitting with, laughing, drinking a two hundred bottle of wine and chatting about war and peace while Ratko Mladic held my hand.  Mladic,  a man considered the world’s most ruthless war criminal since Adolf Hitler, still at large and currently having a five million dollar bounty on his head for genocide by the international community.  Yet there I was with my two best friends at the time, a former Serbian diplomat, his wife, and Ratko Mladic just chilling.  There was no security, nothing you’d ordinarily expect in such circumstances.  Referring to himself merely as, Sharko; this is the story of it all came about.

	It all began as former United States President Bill Clinton spearheaded NATO’s war against Serbia, Montenegro and Slobodan Milosevic (March 1999).  Thirty-five years old, conducting graduate study work at the New School for Social Research in New York City in political science,  I planned graduating spring 1999 with an area study emphasis in international law and human rights.  I was naïve then, still believing strongly in democratic liberal concepts such as freedom of academic thought.  Hence, I never anticipated my political views would impede either my graduation or completing my master’s thesis work on whether NATO member states committed gross violations of customarily accepted international criminal law in launching military aggression against Serbia and Montenegro owing to not acquiring United Nations Security Counsel approval prior.

               Then as hit with the identical smart bomb dropped on Milosevic’s presidential palace in Serbia the night of April 22nd 1999, political science chairperson then at the New School, Professor David Plotke, summoned me into his office before class that evening and dismissed me from the master’s program at the New School owing to what he considered my possessing unsavory political science opinions.  

	Only having to complete two more classes to graduate, I always thought my future in political sciences as wide open with innumerous possibilities; unfortunately this proved untrue.  Plotke told me in no uncertain terms that I was not the type of person the New School wanted walking around with a degree stating the New School’s prestigious name on it.

	Ironically, the New School was an institution I attended only owing to its’ placing great pride and emphasis on allowing students complete academic freedom of thought without dictating what is and what is not politically correct to discuss.  Yet surprisingly, dismissal from the program and blow to my graduate work should not been completely unexpected since the semester immediately prior, the school refused allowing me to conduct my graduate thesis work on the subject of whether the NATO and Bill Clinton committed war crimes against the former Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war (1999) and internally suggested I write about infringement of Muslim human rights in France.  

	I suppose with the likes of Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair hanging about the fourth floor of the school at the renown World Policy Institute in 1999, I should have expected the university would not take kindly to student‘s speaking out critically against Bill Clinton and the Kosovo war (1999) he went down in history for advocating.  Then again, in 1999 I still believed in the school’s core ideals of academic freedom, especially since I was paying no less than one thousand United States dollars a credit to attend.  My civil rights lawsuit against the college is another story in and of itself not deserving extended amounts of space here, except what I already mentioned. 


	Dismissal from graduate school left me in a complete state of  scholarly anomie seeking empathy and solace from my few friends and confidants at the time including many diplomats I studied with at the New School for several years.  The list included  but was not limited to ambassadors from Iran, Oman and a newly appointed First Secretary of the Bosnian Mission to the United Nations in New York, Darko Trifunovic.  

	Noteworthy of mentioning, both the ambassadors from Iran and Oman both confided in me their own extreme dissatisfactions and the scholarly problems they themselves currently encountered at the New School for Social Research.  On the last day attending the school, both aforementioned men explicitly complained to me the school was holding them back from graduating owing to their own so-called extremely unsavory political viewpoints.  In particular the Iranian ambassador, Amir, was writing his master’s thesis on the Iranian contra affair and the UN Ambassador from Oman told me, for years he was being held back from graduating because Greek Professor Addie Pollis strongly disdained his Islamic religious and cultural views insofar as human rights and multiple marriage partners by Muslim sultans in his country of origin.  It was May (1999).

	Riddled with uncertainty about my future scholarly status, I immediately applied for graduate study at Farleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey where I studied an additional two years before encountering similar problems with the graduate school faculty there.  Ironically it was only FDU professors whom formerly studied themselves at the New School still in touch with the faculty there, who were later responsible for my having to leave the graduate program at FDU in early 2002.  

	Between the time of my dismissal from the New School and my dismissal from FDU in the fall (2002), I stayed in touch with many scholars and other politically active persons sharing similar anti-war views as myself regarding NATO’s 1999 Kosovo war including: Professor Barry Lituchy (NYC), Ramsey Clark’s people at the International Action Center, and a couple of new acquaintances I’ve chanced meet online in Serbian political activist forums.  
	One of those people was, Darko Trifunovic. Darko and I were e-mailing each other regularly by early spring (1999) at which time he informed me that he became the newly appointed First Secretary of the Bosnian Mission to the United Nations in New York City and wondered whether I would pick him up at JFK airport when he arrives in a few weeks;  I acceded.  

	Another event in my life occurring in Manhattan in late spring (1999) was chance meeting Nikola Sainovic; Slobodan Milosevic’s former Deputy Serbian Prime Minister. It just so happened I was in the city attending Ramsey Clark’s anti-NATO lectures immediately after NATO’s bombing campaign against the former Yugolsavia began.  I was walking up to the main lecture building and paused at the door momentarily to examine how to enter and where to go when Nikola walked up for me , surprising me from behind, he said “hello, are you here for the lecture also“? I replied “yes.” I was shy, but Nikola kept the conversation going as we walked into the building together discussing the horrendous actions the NATO was currently undertaking against his country in Serbia.  Although I did not know then who exactly he was, he was handsome, educated and he wore a very sharp brown suit, tie and wore glasses. His identity is unmistakable to me now viewing the photos of him sitting in the Hague currently awaiting his own trial for complicity in war crimes.   During the lecture intermission he again came over to speak with me and asked me my telephone number stating he’d like to get together and talk sometime with me while he was in town; I acceded.

	It was not long after Ramsey Clark’s lecture that Nikola called me and we agreed to have dinner together at the Peking House in Butler NJ on Route 23.  He met me at the restaurant and we enjoyed a great dinner and lively conversation regarding American diplomacy and politics between the United States, NATO and Serbia.  After dinner he asked me if there was somewhere quite we both could go to continue talking and being shy about men and their intentions, I told him since it was a beautiful summer’s evening, I suggested we drive up 23 North into West Milford NJ where there was a lovely “rest stop” where we could sit down on the picnic table chairs and continue our conversation together. 
	He offered to drive me up to the spot in his fancy brown Jaguar.  I had never really been in a Jaguar before and it drove really smooth.  Nikola and I spent several hours just chatting about Serbia and the illegal NATO actions undertaken against his country and when we commenced, he drove me back to my car waiting by the restaurant and we decided we would meet again for lunch in about a week; he would give me call soon.

	I was attending Montclair State University for one semester that summer so when Nikola call me in about a week for lunch I recommended we meet at about 4pm at the 6 Brothers Diner on Route 46 by the university. Nikola never made any unwanted advances towards me and we just like to chat about war and peace.  He told me, ‘Jill, I like to come talk with you because I can trust you. I can let down my hair so to speak with you and not worry about you wire tapping me or stabbing me in the back.” I thanked him for his compliment and company. He told me his daughter lived in Tarrytown New York and when we parted that day, he told me this is where he was headed. He gave me his business card bearing his name, Nikola Sainovic. I forget the business it listed, it might have just said Prime Minister but I think it said something else politically related but I can’t remember now. I took it and thanked him.  Whomever I did meet, they also gave me photos and showed me a brief portfolio of their news ideas in the space saving architecture and additionally gave me some photos of their work and a business card for what I remember as a German PASSOS company.  It had to be be Nikola.  We actually had a great chat about what I thought about his new architectural ideas. I loved them telling Nikola I believed he would be extremely successful in his new endeavors. I think we may have had lunch one additional time and then I never heard from him again. 

	Darko arrived first, his very beautiful wife, Bojana, arrived as expected about one month later after he was settled.  Darko greatly impressed me at the time.  Being a former political advisor to the to the former female President of the Republic of Srpska in Bosnia, he had a degree in international law, diplomatic immunity, was a writer, handsome, was extremely brilliant and fun to just hang-out with and work.  The three of us became extremely close friends and confidants. 
	
I even became voted in as the executive director of the Law Projects Center Yugoslavia in New York .  The Law Projects Center was a United Nations accredited NGO and offshoot of the Yugoslav Coalition to Establish and international criminal court.  Darko and some political people originally founded the organization in Belgrade Serbia prior his arrival in New York City in diplomatic capacity. 

	I worked fervently legally registering the organization  in New Jersey as a legally filed non-profit successfully.  	The Law Projects Center and its activities demanded Darko, his wife and I often stayed the night over each others’ apartments often; many times working days at a time with very little sleep.  From winter (1999) until fall (2002), Darko, his wife and I worked daily at the Bosnian Mission to the United Nations in New York City co-authoring two books: 1) The Bosnian Model of Al-Qaeda Terrorism and; 2) The Srebrenica Massacre.  As a young student of war and peace in the former Yugoslavia, I was in scholarly heaven accessing the United Nations to work with Darko daily.  This enabled my meeting many of the most fascinating people in the world.  I vividly remember Senator Bill Richardson at the time giving nightly press interviews on television about meeting with OPEC members states, “setting them straight about lowering oil prices in 2000.”  Yet when I’d chit-chat with the Iranian ambassador in the city before class asking him about it he would say to me something to the effect as,” We at OPEC are so angry about former  colonialism by England and America, OPEC will continually attempt bringing both the United States and England to their financial knees on  energy issues…And by the way Jill, Russia does not in any manner intend to halt weapon sales to Iran.”  

	In fact Amir and I, notwithstanding our theological differences, got alone well.  We’d often sit together before class acceding on a great many matters.  In particular I remember us sitting one night and looking me square in the eye stating, “You know Jill, I will never believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”  I replied, “And I Amir will never convert to Islam.” Now that we got that out of the way, we both smiled at one another getting  down to discussing real issues.
	
	The Bosnian mission to the United Nations in New York City in 2001 was an extremely interesting place.  Reflecting the rotating ethnic presidency existing in Bosnia unto present, Mission employees were comprised of people of completely bipolar ethnic, theological and politically ideological viewpoints.  

	The Head Ambassador of the Mission post 9-11 was then combating rumors of his soon becoming persona non grata in the United States for allegedly giving Osama Bin Laden a visa to travel through Bosnia illegally when previously stationed in Italy in 1993.  There were also rumors he confessed to the United States Department of State of running international arms trades in connection with Al-Qaeda. 
 
	The number two man at the Bosnian mission, the First Ambassador was Serbian, Orthodox Christian and a doctor of medicine by university degree.  The First Secretary of the Mission was my friend Darko, the Consulate department was headed by an ethnic Muslim lady from Bosnia, and there was an ethnic Croatian woman floating around with other various diplomats being of Roman Catholic Croatian descent. 

	My time at the Mission was primarily spent fixing Darko’s laptop computer which became daily infected with computer viruses he continually claimed emanated from other employees at the Mission who were allegedly trying to sabotage him because of his ethnic Serbian background.  I vividly recall the constant bickering between all the mission employees; always accusing each other of committing war crimes and giving each other computer viruses making it virtually impossible for any of them to get along.  The Croatian diplomat usually stayed to herself with her office door shut while the others present usually just listened to Led Zeppelin rock music on their personal CD-ROM players.  They told me repeatedly they had nothing else to do with their time at the United Nations beyond an occasional meeting except for  listening to music and playing computer games.  

	Sad and ironic was the few things I noticed all the Bosnian mission employees agreeing upon was their undying love for the rock band, Led Zeppelin. 

	A year had come and gone while I totally immersed myself into political inquiry as to just who was guilty of committing war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.  My favorite subjects of inquiry included: 

	NATO, Kosovo &amp; Metohia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and persons of interest such as Mladic and Hacim Thaci (Albanian Leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army).  It was not enough for my merely taking in nightly news reports from CNN and other mainstream American media; to conduct an investigation for inquiry of social fact, I needed to go to Serbia and investigate for myself. 

	Only after seeing firsthand the goings on in the Balkans could I make a discriminate determination of guilty parties insofar as genocide there.   After my fateful month long trip to Serbia and Montenegro in the fall 2002 I later concluded all warring parties involved had blood on their hands (Croats, Serbs, Muslims and the NATO); there are no innocents.  But in 2001, neither my finances nor busy schedule allowed such a trip.  Moreover, not speaking fluent Serbian coupled with the  anti-American sentiment existing in Serbia then listed on the United States Department of State travel warning website caused going to there an unfeasible option.  Hence, my life and studies went on as usual.

	Several seasons went by and now it was spring 2001.  Darko and his wife Bojana had time off which they spent visiting friends and family in Serbia for about two weeks.  Because of this Darko was unable to function in full diplomatic capacity.  In spring 2001 there was a preparatory commission meeting of plenipotentiaries to establish an international criminal court at the United Nations in New York City.  Topics of the meeting included but were not limited to defining interstate acts of aggression, court financing etc..  Darko asked me if I would sit in for him at the meeting taking as many notes possible owing to the Law Projects Center possessing United Nations accreditation as a NGO (non governmental organization) with full observer status at the United Nations;  I acceded.

		Darko faxed me all necessary paperwork enabling my application attendance at this crucial meeting; I filled out the necessary forms and faxed them to the appropriate United Nations office for approval. 	It was an extremely exciting time for me.  My close friend and colleague, Arnold Stark (History professor and Columbian University PhD) drove me into Manhattan walking me through the United Nations main entrance and security the day of attendance.  	Professor Stark himself was an old foreign service man from way back in the day and he told me I never looked as professionally sharp as I did on that day; I wore a navy blue pin striped suit.  I must admit, I looked good. 	

	Only post attending that day did I truly understand the total lapse of  security existing then at the United Nations in New York City.  I say this owing to the social fact that the Law Projects Center was indeed registered as an United nations accredited NGO it is true.  However, closed meetings of this sort meant attendance was strictly limited to head ambassadors of valid United Nations member state missions and non governmental organizations possessing observer status were not allowed.

	Unto present, I’ve yet understood whereby I gained entrance into this privy closed meeting consisting of only United Nations  ambassadors, but I did.  Walking to the basement floor of the United Nations building that day, I merely wore a visitors badge given to me at the front desk in no manner indicating that I was an ambassador of a United Nations mission;  least of all the Bosnia mission as required for entrance.  Totally unaware I didn’t possess necessary credentials to enter the meeting, I walked confidently towards the entrance door and past the guard stationed outside it.  The guard never bothering to  examine the type of badge I wore around my neck simply said “good day Madame” and urged me into the meeting; it was just about time to begin.

	I immediately sensed something wrong once through the door past the guard.  First, I was uncertain where to sit.  Everyone else had a sign in front of their seat stating their country of origin. The Israeli ambassador sat in front of the Israel sign, the Spanish lady sat in front of the seat indicating she represented, Spain etc..  

	I looked fervently around the room seeing no seats indicating seats for United Nations observers anywhere.  The last thing I wanted to do was to embarrass myself by taking the seat of an important ambassador; I noticed a couple of men seeming from some African state grabbing some meeting paperwork nearby so I inquired of them. 
	I told them I was a newbie and inquired where to sit and what I should do.  With heavy African accents one of them said, “just grab a bunch of these papers, sit there and look like you are busy,” so I did.  In fact, I grabbed as many extra copies as I could without looking conspicuous when noticing another peculiarity.  

	The meeting papers indicated they were for restricted for the eyes of state mission heads’ only (chief ambassadors of countries) and allowing other persons and/or United Nations employees to view them was a punishable offense.  Uncertain what to do, and with the meeting beginning, I merely sat there stunned.  My seat and the one the African gentleman next to me took seemed extras because they neglected having any indication regarding country origin in front of them on the table; I felt safe.  

	As totally immersed and interesting as I found the topics, the African ambassador seated found boring.  I say this owing to noticing during the entire meeting he was merely doodling nonsensical pictures on some legal pad.  I think that no one took more notes that day than me.  I was especially interested in the interstate bickering about financing the international criminal court should and when it came about.  Spain was particularly forceful in vocalizing its opinion that the countries giving the most monetary contributions to the court itself ought have more power over both its staffing and its innocent and guilty verdicts as well as judges appointed.  My suspicions’ equally shared by scholars such as Noam Chomsky and former attorney general, Ramsey Clark were now fully justifiably confirmed.  The court itself was a great travesty of justice and I was actually witnessing quarrels between countries insofar as controlling the courts judges and verdicts based on financial contributions rather than on law and true international justice.   

	The most shocking point of the meeting for me was when the Israeli ambassador admitted openly to the other attendees that Israel was indifferent to war crimes, crimes against humanity and would in no manner support any international structure limiting its’ ability for practicing war and peace against any other state and/or party it considered a threat to its national interest.  

	The ambassador representing the United States that day strongly and equally explicitly backed the Israeli position making clear American attendance was more for information gathering purposes and show than true concern for international law, world peace and social justice.  When the meeting ended I slipped quickly out the front entrance of the United Nations; notes and papers in hand; I would read them in detail later that evening. When I attended these Preparatory Meetings at the end, the First Ambassador to the Bosnian Mission in NYC (The Serbian Doctor with glasses) came in but only stayed a short while as my witness to my being there.

	
	It must have amazed Darko upon returning from Serbia I actually gained entrance to the ICC preparatory closed meeting because within a week he invited me to the city to attend another important meeting at the United Nations comprised of diplomats from some very selective and prestigious  NATO member states.  I don’t recall the date but by his return fully I understood the definition of a closed meeting.  Upon approaching the meeting door I became at once  cognizant the meeting stated  “closed meeting,” on the door.  I did my best to point this fact out to Darko who told me to go in with him anyway; we did.  Darko obviously thought because I gained entrance to the ICC meeting I ought not have in his absence, perhaps if I were with him, he covertly could gain access this closed NATO meeting; no dice.  Upon entering the room, immediately some important looking man called him over and diplomatically informed him that “Serbia was not invited.”  Darko pointed to me explaining that he was with the American lady but he was asked politely to leave; I followed him out the door embarrassed. 	

	The following year was mundane.  Filled with activities like shuttling back and forth to FDU for graduate school, fund raising for the Law Projects Center and co-authoring two book with Darko.  The fateful day of 9/11 and the attacks by Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center Towers in New York City changed my venue forever.
	 Post 9/11 Darko became a man on a personal mission seemingly unrelated to the Bosnian mission itself. 

	He told me it was the utmost importance to publicize the alleged fact that the head ambassador of the Bosnian mission was in his estimation involved with Al-Qaeda. 

	Darko had a seemingly ton of secret documentary evidence emanating from the ministry of internal affairs in Belgrade and Bosnia seeming true bolstering his allegations in my eyes then.

	Asking me to fervently work on editing a book on which topic was meant for exposing the head ambassador of the Bosnian mission at that time; I acceded.  The publication was later published by the Repubika Srpska information agency in Bosnia.  The Serbian government in the Republika Srpska in Bosnia then was seriously pressing Darko for a fast publication so we stayed up many nights over his apartment in Forest Hills, New York working to do so.  The book was entitled, ”The Bosnia Model of Al-Qaeda Terrorism.  It can probably still be found and read online.  Last time I checked it was posted on the website: http://www.analyst-network.com/profile.php?user_id=240.

	  	Darko always told me I possessed full rights to this and  other publications we worked on together.  Although I edited and co-authoring the Al-Qaeda work, a few years back I noticed Darko removed my name on the inner front cover page as editor replacing it with the name of a Serbian editor.  When questioned about it Darko told me he kept my name from being published because of the death threats and dangers to my life that he himself encountered because of its publication.  I do vividly remember Darko receiving a great many death threats and threats towards his wife at the time, Bojana, so it is possible he was telling me the truth.	

	Even prior completing our work on the Al-Qaeda book together Darko was obsessed with manifesting the Bosnian Chief ambassador at the time as a terrorist.  At the time I had no reason to doubt Darko’s word and assisted him in rabidly writing an open letter to all the United Nations member state missions exposing him as such.  I surmise this is when Darko’s job at the United Nations as First Secretary of the Bosnian mission became jeopardized.

		Today I surmise Darko’s employment at the United Nations genuinely became compromised owing not only to the inter-ethnic conflicts existing between him and the head ambassador then, a proud Muslim man, but also owing to the fact he forged birth certificates to acquire his position in the first place later becoming a social fact from the interior ministry in Bosnia.  It was an emotional shock when Darko informed me a by summer 2001 that he lost his job and he and Bojana had to immediately return to Belgrade to work out the matter in court.  This was also a great emotional blow to me also owing to the fact that I always possessed a crush on Darko and he knew it.  This was a social fact I never publicly admitted previously to writing this book.  I once even asked Darko if he wanted to have an affair with me but he declined stating he would never be unfaithful to his beautiful wife, Bojana.  This left me in an extreme morally uncomfortable position because Bojana was my best friend.  I continually told myself being attracted to her husband Darko was a non-option.  Working so closely with him on an almost daily basis however made my attraction to him difficult to overcome.  

	I was also engaged to Professor Arnold Stark at the time and wore the ten thousand diamond ring he bought me on my finger. Arnold became increasingly jealous of Darko in time and eventually forbid me to work with him altogether. Notwithstanding, I continued working with Darko against Arnold’s wishes.  This coupled with my trip to Serbia and Montenegro in 2002 eventually led to my breakup with Professor Stark and after almost an entire decade, my relationship with Arnold never fully recovered.

	Darko tried keeping his job in diplomatic capacity at he UN as long as possible but the bipolar friction and hate existing between himself and the chief ambassador at the mission proved too much.  The chief ambassador in contact with the Bosnian government at the time in Sarajevo eventually had Darko dismissed as first secretary of the mission.  To the best of my recollection Darko was no longer receiving a monthly salary from Sarajevo by spring or summer 2002 (approximately).  

		I often came visiting Darko and Bojana’s  apartment in Manhattan then situated on a side street within walking distance from the UN to help them out financially by buying them inexpensive dinners and such in Manhattan and chauffeuring  them around (they did not own a car for the majority of their stay in the States).  

	In July 2002 as I remember the three of us spent many memorable moments going to the beaches outside the city and just spending time talking etc..  At the time and owing to my being in graduate school at FDU, I had plenty of extra money to burn owing my taking the maximum GSL student loans totaling about twenty thousand dollars a semester.  Then one day that summer Darko informed me he and Bojana were only awaiting the Bosnian government to wire them a sum of five thousand dollars to pay off their American bills, last month rent and they would make a hasty exit back to Belgrade permanently.  I was emotionally crushed. 

	Desperate not to lose contact with Darko because of my personal feelings towards him, I told him my summer classes at FDU were about to end August 2002 and although the fall semester was about to begin, I wanted to visit him in Serbia as soon as possible.  Soon for me meant as soon as I received a check from the United States government for the total of that semesters’ student loan money in the amount of about ten thousand dollars.

	Darko, hesitant at first soon gave in to my constant petitions to visit him.  The day I brought them both to JFK to return to Serbia permanently, Bojana whispered something in Darko’s ear as we hugged saying our goodbyes all three of trying to hold back tears of parting and Darko looking me in the eye said something to the effect, “Jill, don’t worry as soon as you can afford it call me and we’ll arrange your visit.” Darko never could stand to see me cry which on many occasion I did owing to the loss of my two children and other personal challenges in my life.  They turned and boarded their plane to Belgrade as I drove back to New Jersey. 

	 Driving home I felt an odd combination of extreme sadness at the loss of my two best friends mixed with the cheerful prospect I would shortly be boarding a plane myself destined for Serbia and Montenegro by mid August 2002 when my student loan check arrived.  Upon arriving home I immediately began making all necessary arrangements for my forthcoming trip. 

	The day following Darko ‘s departure, I bought a great many  prepaid phone cards for the purpose of calling him owing to both my missing him and also my primarily wanting to began making all necessary arrangements facilitating my forthcoming visit from JFK to Beograd.  I had countless questions such as: how much money will I need, how will I obtain a VISA being an American citizen with all the US State Department warnings against US citizenry traveling to the region, etc., etc., etc..  I had already obtained a valid United States passport many years ago which I always carried with me.  I’ve always held the strong opinion that having a valid passport with you at all times is just a good idea.  It enables one the necessary freedom to go to the airport and catch a plane going anywhere at anytime. 
		
		Darko told me that I need not worry about all the complicated VISA requirements listed on Serbian government website required of other Americans  that he would handle everything.  I was told merely to bring with me about five thousand United States dollars in cash spending money and it was a done deal.  I went to buy some new suitcases and clothes for my trip in Wayne, New Jersey during the first two weeks in August 2002 in preparation.  Packing was always a problem for me as Darko can attest to owing to my medically diagnosed attention deficit disorder.  I had a difficult time deciding what to bring, so I tried to bring everything I thought I needed.  The day of my departure my suitcases weighed way over the weight limit restrictions indicated by the airline.

	Getting to JFK for departure in mid August 2002 proved to be an almost insurmountable task in and of itself owing to my heavy luggage and everyone I asked to drop me at the airport that day had strongly held views against my going.

	 Arnold Stark declined to bring me owing to his personal jealousies insofar as Darko and everyone else had one or another excuse rooted in the anti-American sentiment in Serbia at that time and danger involved.  

	Undeterred, I finally convinced Archbishop John LoBue, my priest and confessor at the Holy Name Orthodox Christian Church in West Milford, New Jersey to take me as far as the Port Authority in Manhattan; from there I took a bus to JFK managing myself.

	Post 9/11, JFK was supposedly safe beyond reproach insofar as security; this proved untrue.  I had not traveled outside America in many years so I was unfamiliar with the new travel restrictions on such items as nail scissors etc., being illegal to bring onboard flights and carried several very sharp ones right passed JFK security inspection inside my purse on board out of my own ignorance of new flight rules.  It was not until I arrived on my stopover in Paris, France that I was boarding onto a JAT (Yugoslav Air Travel) flight for Belgrade that the security officer of JAT told me that he had to confiscate the aforementioned items owing to new security precautions implemented post 9/11. 

	I informed him upon boarding my initial flight at JFK in New York, the security guards at the gate allowed me to board my flight to Paris carrying them in my purse.  The JAT security employee merely shook his head in amazement mentioning something insofar as his seriously questioning American security in general stating that Jugosalv Air Travel obviously took airline and passenger security much more seriously.  

	I loved flying JAT!  Not only was I completely satisfied the flight from Paris to Belgrade was many times more secure since JAT searched boarding passengers more thoroughly than JFK, the hospitality, food and drink was excellent.  I say this owing to my being a well seasoned traveler having previously visited places such as Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong, etc..  It was extremely laid back on the flight.  People moved around switching seats and chatting with good friends and the  food was the best!  
	My favorite Serbian food and drink were served and all airline employees shoed me the highest level of hospitality.  I was extremely pleased with the professionalism and service on JAT I later began an online blog about it on Yahoo360.
	
	Upon my flight arriving in Beograd, all passengers left the plane in the usual manner except Serbian citizens were shuffled through customs quickly merely showing their passport.  All others including myself were asked to relinquish their passports and told to wait an unspecified amount of time in a holding area at the airport.  An airport security officer went around confiscating our passports afterward leaving us merely standing there not knowing what to expect next.  No other announcements were made; I did the only thing possible I relinquished my passport to the Serbian custom official along with the other western Europeans and/or Americans (if there were any) which I surmised like myself were attempting to enter Serbia from countries that were NATO allies in the Kosovo war against Slobodan Milosevic in 1999.  There must have been about twenty persons with me just waiting. 

	All types of nagging thoughts plagued me such as “perhaps my friends were correct that I ought not have taken this trip…was it really too dangerous to travel to Serbia with all the anti-American sentiment and what would happen if Serbian customs decided I was an American spy, kept my passport and I ended in some unknown jail and/or murdered….who would find me…what could I do about it etc., etc., etc..”
     	 
	It seemed nearly an hour passed; me and the others were still standing there waiting.  I didn’t want to seem scared or overly curious by asking either Serbian custom officials or anyone else waiting with me anything as to not cause unnecessary attention to myself.  I also kept checking my watch wondering if Darko knew I was here waiting.  I had hoped with his government connections he would at least inquire about my arrival since he told me he would pick me up.  I drew comfort from the fact Darko was always very punctual picking up and bringing himself and others to airports. 


	On numerous occasions I gave him and others rides to and from them.  These and other thoughts plagued me when suddenly I heard a voice on the loud speaker call my name, Jill Starr, asking me to go to a customs area to claim my passport. 

	I was the first person called so I don’t know what happened to the others standing there still waiting.  I hurriedly went to obtain my passport and was told that I cleared; the guard pointed the direction for me to go claim my luggage.  You have no idea what a relief that was!

	I took in my new surroundings pleased that I made it into the country successfully.  As a young child my father took me with him traveling the world when he was an active nuclear engineering consultant for Chas T Main, USAID and the IMF.  I had been in Indonesia during the turmoil in East Timor so I was used to being in war zones surrounded by soldiers with guns.  I was presently older, but still I found such travel extremely exciting more than dangerous and looked forward to enjoying the rest of my vacation with Darko and Bojana.       

	Making it to the baggage claim area successfully I was relieved seeing Darko standing their waiting for me.  I was not fluent in Serbian and didn‘t want to publicize it by asking people questions in English manifesting I was American.  I hurried towards him, giving him a large hug.

	I was so glad to see Darko.  I noticed upon my arrival at the Belgrade airport that there were many female police officers equipped with guns wearing short mini skirts and extremely high heels.  I asked Darko how they apprehended criminals in such high heels and he replied smirking that they don’t have to run, they merely shot those not halting in the back and that stopped them.

	Like a dream come true, there I was in Beograd Serbia against all odds and complaints from my friends.  Darko helped me get my luggage to his friend’s vehicle telling me we could talk about everything I had to say later because we had to hurry.  

	Darko‘s friend, a German man living in Serbia for years and an important military employee of the Serbian government in a grayish older large SUV vehicle with what seemed a special license plate was impatiently waiting at the front gate of the airport for us. 
	
	Darko’s friend did not speak fluent English but he did speak fluent German and Serbian. Upon writing the first edition of my book I still wondered who this man really was because Darko pointed out to me proudly, while placing my luggage in the vehicle of his car, this car “specifically bore special Serbian military license plates;“ Darko pointed this out to me at the airport and I was greatly impressed to be in a Serb military vehicle. 

	The man picking me up at the Serbia, Beograd airport with Darko  also referred to himself merely by a nickname.  If my memory serves me correct he said to call him, “Babic or Babo” or something like that. “Babic” is not probably not 100% correct because my memory is kind of fuzzy on this.  However, in coming across a BBC website with a photograph of Dragan Dabic, the male construction worker whom apparently Dr. Radovan Karadzic was assuming the identity of before he was arrested and transferred to the Hague in 2008; it does look about 90% correct in my memory that  it was Mr. Dragan Dabic who picked me up at the Beograd Serbia airport that day.  Even his glasses look the same and he told me he used to work as a military mercenary for the Serbs during war  time and he was originally from Germany.   Whoever it was, he was a relatively short man in height with salt and pepper hair.

	He said he worked in the military during “ the war/s” but (I forget which war he meant now), did say currently since all “the military business ended, he now worked construction and was  building a second house himself outside of Beograd because his girlfriend was having a child. He told me he had several children but was not married. I saw him also my first night in Beograd at Bojana’s parents residence visiting as well as a day or so before I departed Beograd Serbia.  


	We drove all around the city of (Beograd) in his large van type SUV again; he gave me a large tour of the entire city area pointing out everything.  

	It seems almost surreal to me actually chance meeting so many fascinating and exciting people, I almost didn’t want to mention  possibly meeting, Dragan Dabic, too in the second edition of my book.

	But, I decided to write the best and most truthful testimonies of my memories as possible about my super cool vacation in Serbia &amp; Montenegro in 2002.  

	Anyway, so 	Darko told whomever this man was to please help lift my luggage into the trunk in Serbian and he did.  Darko always liked to brag and as usual he introduced me to his friend giving me the details of his being an important man in the Serbian military etc.. We went straight from the Beograd airport to the home of Bojana’s family in the suburbs of Belgrade and all became reacquainted. Whomever it was, he was a relatively short man in height with salt and pepper hair and muscular with that triangle type of nose.
	
	Bojana and I hugged; she introduced me to her family (father, mother and brother who was a high school student in Beograd).  Afterward, Darko showed me the room upstairs where I would sleep which was actually Bojana’s room also informing me of our three week itinerary; he had it all planned out.  Darko told me we would all spend the night over Bojana’s house, the next day sleep at his apartment outside Beograd and later explained the next day we would stop at his father’s family’s house for dinner and leave from there making our way into Montenegro for a ten day vacation staying at his friend’s resort on Budva’s seaside coast.  Along the way Darko told me he would give me the best tour I could ask for and he did.  He showed me military installations and one of my favorite stops was the NATO bombed Chinese embassy which I stood in front of only several yards from.  

	
	My night at Bojana’s residence was wonderful. I was never showed as much love and hospitality as I did from her family. Although it was late in the evening (about 11pm Serbian time) when we arrived, Bojana’s mother, a wonderful woman, treated me as her own daughter.  She insisted that Darko, Bojana and I enjoy what seemed a 10 course home cooked meal.  She was still cooking while she served us a variety of cooked steaks, vegetables and pastries. And like many Italian families she insisted I tried and ate everything.  To top the night off before bed Bojana and her father performed an accordion duet live in the kitchen for me.  Apparently, Bojana and her father were professional accordion players and Bojana explained that her father’s employment consisted of playing nightly in a local bar. Thereafter, we went to bed with full stomachs.

	The next morning we all enjoyed an equally exquisite breakfast.  Bojana’s family had livestock in the backyard and her mother cooked us a fresh eggs and steak for breakfast like never before experienced. We said our parting goodbyes and left for Darko’s apartment in the hills of Beograd.  We brought my suitcases in and upon entering I noticed there were lots of stray dogs around the apartment entrance.  One in particular was very cute and Darko explained that the various residents fed it because it was so adorable.  I found it interesting that so many old men were just hanging about the entrance to the apartment building drinking and just sitting there with seemingly nothing to do.  They remained there throughout my entire trip. 

	Even when Ratko Mladic came to see me on my final day in Serbia in full military regalia giving me a parting gift (a book he inscribed to me entitled Serbija) while Darko took pictures of Mladic with his arm around me, the men remained there merely looking like old bums. Retrospectively, I wonder if they weren’t some watchmen and/or guards. Unto this day I always wondered what Darko did with those photos.

	I was surprised what a very large apartment Darko owned.  He showed me into his guest room and I unpacked my suitcases in just enough time to inform me I was to consolidate all my truly necessary items for Montenegro into one small bag that would reasonably fit into his trunk in the morning because he needed enough room for his and Bojana’s luggage also.  He laughed at all the things I brought with me to Beograd telling me that I had no idea how to pack.  
	
	By the time I was done with that task Darko told me it was time to go meet some friends at a local café for coffee.  It was late summer and the outside café’s in Beograd were the best !  

	We met up with a few friends in some restaurant in Beograd; there was about five of us sitting there just chatting and drinking coffee when I noticed an older gentleman sitting a few seats down with feathered salt and pepper colored hair not saying much except for an occasional laugh and nod at us.  I wondered wherefore Darko a man about thirty would associate with such an older person, as for me being several years older than Darko, I thought to myself, what a cute guy.  Then upon closer inspection, I realized it was doctor Radovan Karadzic.  I knew he was a psychiatrist.  By no means was this to be our last meeting.  Throughout the time I spent in Serbia Darko met with Karadzic on many occasions in Beograd.  The meetings were usually brief; only to exchange oral information and/or a few papers with Darko and whisper something or other in Darko‘s ear.   He looks as the news media portrays him dressed in his gray wrinkled suit and tie and salt and pepper colored hair.  He was a perfect gentleman all times I met him with Darko. After finishing our coffee, Darko said we ought leave and get a good nights rest because we had to leave early the next day for Montenegro.
	
	The next morning we all got into Darko’s blue Audi (car) and left for his Father’s house.  I remember arguing with Darko about wanting to bring lots of luggage with me and he replied I didn’t need all that stuff and I could only bring one normal sized bag with me and I had to leave the rest of my things at his apartment; I did. On the way to his father’s, Darko made a few important stops for the purpose of giving me the grand tour. 

	We only stopped briefly at some military installations; we didn’t get out of the car.  We drove up to the gates and Darko pointed out, “look Jill, this is an important military facility.”  Darko always sarcastically smirked as he pointed out these places to me.  The only place we got out was in front of the bombed out Chinese embassy in Beograd.  There were Serbian military officers in front of the embassy.  I was amazed owing to I always had thought bombed out buildings were totally demolished.  But standing in front of the Chinese embassy that was bombed by the NATO in 1999 taught me the definition of a “smart bomb.” 

	Only the portion of the building hosting the embassy employees on the upper level of the building itself was demolished and in particular the window where the Chinese embassy officials worked.  I could see in the window and I even got a sad glimpse of the Victorian styled chair sitting there empty in the bombed out window.  I wondered who used to sit there and if they were dead or alive. No other parts of the building was seriously damaged.  There were even flowers and trees still growing untouched in front of the building.  I strongly believe that NATO knew exactly what they aimed at when they bombed the building.  

	I brought a digital camera with me on my trip but upon returning to the United States, all the film Darko claimed to snap for me was returned by my local film developer as blank.  I wondered if Darko told me the truth about snapping photos for me at all.  Throughout my trip he insisted on taking all the photos I wanted claiming I take poor pictures.  

	It since crossed my mind he may have removed the film from my camera prior my departing Serbia so I could not take it back with me.  One thing I am sure of  is both Darko and Bojana refused having any photos taken of them throughout my entire stay.  After leaving the scene at the Chinese embassy, we made our way to the home of Darko’s father driving through a beautiful park not dissimilar to Central Park in Manhattan along the way.  I can’t be certain what park it was because I didn’t know the geographical area; we soon arrived at our destination. 

	Darko’s father lived in the most incredibly beautiful green hills in an area of Serbia existing somewhere between Beograd and Montenegro.  Immediately upon entering and meeting his father, stepmother and grandmother who recently passed away, I felt part of the family.  Although his family did not speak English, Darko and Bojana translated for me. 

	 Darko’s grandmother was an extraordinarily warm and wise woman in whose presence I felt comfortable and happy the entire time.  Before dinner there was the customary libation of grappa (a Serbian hard liquor of incredible potency).  If only I could find grappa here in America.  After another dinner that would give Manhattan’s top chefs a run for their money,  Darko brought me upstairs into a guest room to take a nap.

	I told him I was not tired but he insisted I nap saying we would be driving all night before reaching Montenegro and I need my rest.  I must have slept an hour before he awakened me to say our parting goodbyes and begin our journey.  I was extremely excited; Darko promised me a three week Adriatic holiday allowing me swimming privileges at every beach from Hercegovni to an area he said was only ten meters from Kosovo’s border.  We couldn’t go into Kosovo Darko said because it was too dangerous.  I knew Darko had been shot several times and almost killed in Kosovo previously so I didn’t push the issue. As a former lifeguard and avid swimmer, I couldn‘t wait for my vacation to start and Darko delivered it to me as promised. 	

	The onset of our journey began at sunset; still adjusting to the time zone differential I dozed off in Darko’s backseat; for how long I’m uncertain.  I dozed on and off until sunrise when we reached the Montenegrin border.  I mean, there wasn’t much to see driving in the dark cover of night.  The wider well lit highway we initially set out upon gradually narrowed as the highway lights became fewer.  Eventually there were no highway lights at all.  My body continuously shifted from one side of Darko’s backseat to the other making sleep difficult. 

	It was obvious the road we traversed was analogous to Pacific Coast Highway in California driving through Big Sur. 

	It was mountainous, dangerously ridden with hairpin turns and no guardrails.  In Montenegro, inexperienced travelers could almost mistake the scenery for Big Sur with the beautiful blue Adriatic sea hugging the bottoms of the cliffs we not so cautiously traveled.  I asked Darko to slow down because he was driving like speed racer.  He replied not to worry explaining he could drive these roads blindfolded he knew them well.  I thought to myself, better safe than sorry buddy.  

	It is a good thing I had some prescription Xanax with me, I popped one, maybe two just to relax while simultaneously trying to hide this act from Darko since he hated drugs in general.  He especially hated my taking the prescription medications my doctor gave me saying I didn’t need them, they were addicting and poison.  He also strongly disdained cigarettes; Bojana smoked covertly. 

	The sun was just rising when Darko awakened me excitedly pointing out the tunnel we were driving through.  I think he said at the other end we’d be entering Montenegro.  Driving to the Budva Riviera in Montenegro we drove through some similar tunnels; the scenery was unbelievably breathtaking.  There is no other place in the world I’d rather be than in Budva Montenegro and I recommend everyone vacation there.  We were making our way to a seaside resort a friend of Darko owned.  Still driving like speed racer around the hairpin turns and mountainous cliffs compromising the road, we finally arrived at our destination safely.  I admit Darko is an excellent driver; his driving is reminiscent of agent 007 in James Bond movies.

		Because of the Kosovo war, there was not one functional  ATM in either in Serbia and Montenegro.  To be safe I split the five thousand dollars we had between Darko and I.  I held onto half and he the other.  One of my favorite stories I tell people of my trip is how I swam with my money throughout the trip; it made me feel secure always keeping some cash on me at all times; even when I was swimming a quarter mile out in the Adriatic sea.  Darko told me not to; I did anyway.  

	Owing to that, the cash I held was often wet.  One particular time we went to a bank in Montenegro. 

	The banks there are so remarkably careful of counterfeiting, they refused exchanging my United States dollars for Euros because my money was wet; the three of us returned to the hotel using my blow dryer to evaporate the dollar bills until dried.  The three of us henceforth joked about this saying we laundered the money.     

	Upon arriving at the resort, Darko introduced me to his friend and we worked out the financial gratuities for our stay.  We paid him eight hundred United States dollars for ten days; meals included.  Unlike hotels in America, meals meant an extremely large home cooked breakfast consisting of large varieties of meat, coffee and juice.  Lunch and dinner consisted of many course meals where main dishes consisted of either freshly caught seafood or meat.  Our accommodation consisted of two medium sized rooms with separate entrances; one for myself and another for Darko and Bojana.  To reach the beach we only needed to walk across the street and down a small path; one could see Italy at the other end of the horizon on a clear day.  I was ecstatic loving to swim.  Since Bojana didn’t swim, Darko couldn’t always accompany me to the beach so I‘d just walk to it myself for periodic swims throughout the day; August was a very hot month.  Of any country I’ve visited, Serbia and Montenegro wins my top prize for fun, food, beauty and hospitality.  

	
	Everyone is friendly, warm, the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back and most persons speak some English owing to children learning English as a second language in school at a young age.  Unfortunately, American school children do not grow up learning another language other than native English which leaves them I feel at an intellectual disadvantage. 

	Each day Darko took us to another beach for a day enjoying food, drink, music, perhaps some shopping and primarily, swimming.  As long as I could swim for hours each day I was happy.  By the time nighttime rolled in all of us were so tired each day we usually had dinner and retired early, except for one night.  This just happened to be the one night of my entire vacation I was overly exhausted wanting to retire early at any cost.  Inversely, this was the one evening both Darko and Bojana incredibly excited informed me to take a shower, dress and get ready for a big surprise.  

	When I asked Darko what this surprise was and its great importance being I was so tired; he merely insisted I go get ready for it.  Darko was always very bossy in my estimation constantly telling us when to sleep, awakening Bojana and I up early, limiting our time before breakfast for dressing, blow drying our hair etc. which the two of us always complained about privately to each other.  I always accepted this as part of his personality but this night it annoyed me to no end; I simply wanted sleep, surprise or not.  

	As usual I gave into to Darko’s demands by hurrying to my room, showering, changing, and preparing myself for a night out.  If you’re a woman, you understand when you have a crush on someone as I did Darko, you usually give into his demands easily; so I did.    

	Upon changing, Dark and Bojana were waving me to hurry to the car;  exhausted I got in and slammed the door.  Less than ten minutes up the pitch black road Darko pulled the car over and we got out.  Darko and Bojana said, “Hurry Jill look down there.”  At the bottom of the cliffs was the most beautiful city of lights I’ve ever seen. 

	Darko said proudly, “this is Budva Jill, that‘s where we are going.”  It was many times more beautiful that Paris or Manhattan at night and situated in a valley about a mile and a half wide forcing the Montenegrin peninsula farther out.  It was a remarkably amazing sight, Budva itself being lit up with a wide variety of bright lights surrounded by an aura of pitch black.  By this time Bojana started complaining to Darko to move his car in more because someone may come around the sharp turn in the darkness sideswiping it.  Darko never worried much about illegal parking or his speed limit owing to whenever getting pulled over, he just made manifest to the officer his huge governmental badge and they let him go;  the badge was at least three times larger than the usual American police officer badge and was gold in color.       

	Darko became annoyed with Bojana’s complaints so we returned to the car, got in and descended about five minutes down the treacherously dark road into Budva and parked.  I couldn’t believe it! It was like a dream,  We walked down around Budva, Darko pointing out everything.  

	We stopped to have a drink at one of the many outdoor bar/café’s and listened to the live entertainment while we sipped our drinks.    Then I went to buy another bathing suit at a small shop when Darko told me to follow him and Bojana into the most amazing bar I’ve ever seen, anywhere in the world.  The bar itself was actually a small island rocky island;  to reach it one had to walk underground below the Adriatic Sea maybe a little less than one quarter mile.   Upon entering the bar it had many levels; all outside surrounded by the roaring nighttime surf of the sea and live entertainment. 

	I saw a few people illegally swimming and asked Darko if I could swim there too.  He informed me the swimming was closed for the evening.  We ordered  drinks and sat there chilling for a while.  On the walk back Darko showed me all the gambling casinos along the Riviera.  It looked like anyone could get whatever they wanted in Budva if they had the correct amount of money with them.  

	Montenegro was to me akin to a luxurious playground for the ultra rich, famous as well as infamous.  We then walked back via way of the tunnel, stopped at a small outdoor restaurant all ordering a type of delicious pancake we enjoyed by dipping it in chocolate syrup and drove back to the hotel to get some rest.

		The next day Darko took merely us to another gorgeous beach.  It was reminiscent of Greece.  The water was sapphire blue, clear and warm.  The beach itself was not large, but completely hidden by huge rocky cliffs.  The three of us took a kind of small craft about a quarter of a mile out into the Adriatic; Darko and I jumped in for a swim.  Bojana was partially nude sunbathing at the time on the boat and since she was unable to swim, Darko teased her by stealing her clothes, pretending not to give them back to her.  She immediately became upset demanding Darko return her clothes;  Darko soon complied with her demands.  Thereafter, we ended the day with lunch and drinks.  The following day was one of my vacation high points.  We visited the Ostrog monastery.    

	Driving to the Ostrog monastery was long, hot and boring.  It lied somewhere deep beyond the Montenegrin coastline inland.  We drove a long windy road without even so much as a store on it.  After a couple of hours, Darko stopped for lunch at the only restaurant I noticed the entire trip.  You’d think it would be small being situated in the middle of what I considered, “nowhere.”  However, this was not the case.  

	There was actually a long line and tons of people there having lunch.  I could only imagine like us they were on their way to visit Ostrog.  The restaurant itself was classy and I can only liken it to seeing a luxurious restaurant in the middle of the Mohave desert.  While I was visiting Ostrog monastery in Montenegro, Darko introduced me to a Serbian priest asking me if I wanted confession. The man looked almost verbatim to Karadzic in his monks getup. I mean the way the latest news photos of Karadzic in his monk getup looks.  I only became cognizant of this recently since the photos of him since his arrest have been made publicly manifest.

	In particular I remember the priest’s large darker curl on the top of this priest’s head like in the recent Karadzic photos; I wondered who would make their monks hair like that. This priest blessed me and told Darko in Serbian he could not hear my confession owing to his not understanding English well. He gave me a gift, a book about the monastery itself which I gave to Archbishop John LoBue in West Milford (my priest).   
	
	While visiting Ostrog, we venerated the holy relics leaving an offering of either food or money at the door leading to the holy relics; I can’t remember which now.  Leaving, we looked around the gift shop, had coffee at the small Ostrog monastery café  and Darko gave me a tour where the monks sleep and shower.  Then we made the long drive back to the hotel.  We had the usual dinner at which time Bojana was overcome with a terrible toothache.  I told her I’d pay for the filling tomorrow; Darko knew a dentist 10 meter from Kosovo‘s border.  Tomorrow we‘d swim there and have Bojana‘s tooth looked at.  The town we went to the next day possessed an ethnic Albanian majority and organized crime was everywhere.    
	
		There is one more sough of significant event that occurred to me during my stay on the Budva coast. Darko was extremely insistent one friend of his “read my palm.” You guys just aren’t going to believe this, and I can’t be 100% certain because I only met this man who read my palm once, but I could swear it was Goran Hadzic (!) He was dressed like an old 1960s “hippie” with some old ripped blue jeans and old dirty T-shirttoo. He had long straggly hair but I( could never forget his tall drawn out thin pail nose and face.  I did not want anyone to “read my palm” because as a staunch Orthodox Christian chick, it was against my religion to do have my palm read. But I gave in to Darko’s persistence for this man to “read my palm.” I really did not agree with much of which he told me, he took a long time to read my palm, like about for 45 minutes and I really wanted to go across the street swimming instead.  But this man told me I had a “strong lifeline” on my palm. After that I never saw him again.

	And I think he also gave me a business card; the same one that  the BBS displays on their website of 
“quantum energy practice/ alternative medicine,” and I definitely remember the care  bearing three Greek Letters “Alpha or Delta” like on the card (like a triangle, that letter. in the internet news media. I lost it a long time ago.

	Before retiring for the evening I went for a small walk around the corner from the hotel to buy some snacks; there was a small store there.  I never felt endangered at any time by anyone.  During my stay in Montenegro I walked to the store myself almost daily buying drinks and other items I could enjoy privately in my room at night.  I never noticed previously to that evening’s walk just how many persons actually were vacationing from Western Europe in Budva the fall 2002 like me.  

	After promenading to the store, upon returning to the hotel, a German man sitting outside the hotel and speaking in broken English introduced himself.  When I told him that I was from New Jersey in the United States he became extremely interested and warmly said he is pleased I was able to enjoy the area.  I replied, “I was tired and needed to retire.” Saying he understood he returned to his card game.

		We had the usual dinner at which time Bojana was overcome with a terrible toothache.  I told her I’d pay for the filling tomorrow; Darko knew a dentist ten meters from Kosovo‘s border.  Tomorrow we‘d swim there and have Bojana‘s tooth looked at.  The town we went to the next day possessed an ethnic Albanian majority and organized crime was everywhere.    

	We awoke early as to get Bojana to the dentist.  This is actually where the Montenegrin bank had refused to exchange our money for Euros.  Managing cash was difficult in Serbia and Montenegro owing to that the national currency in Serbia was still dinars and in Montenegro it was Euros.  Most businessman preferred either Euros or American dollars, but one never knew which.

	Upon parking, Darko led the way down the busy street towards the dentist who I remember being an ethnic Albanian man.  Apparently, they visited this dentist previously and he was extremely friendly.  Not at any time did any ethnic Albanians cause me, Darko or Bojana any problems because I was American and they were Serb.  The dentist was going to take a while and since the bank would not exchange our American dollars for Euros, we could buy neither lunch nor anything else and we all possessed a ravenous hunger for lunch.

	Ignoring Darko’s warnings not to go wondering myself, I left the dentist office under the pretense of going for a walk while Bojana had her dental work completed.  Before Darko could catch me I was gone.  I walked up the main street about one mile and began asking people in English where I could exchange United States currency for Euros.  I came upon a well dressed ethnic Albanian high school student, a girl speaking perfect English who told me to walk up the street about another half mile and when I see men selling the cigarettes outside on a bridge table, ask them to do the deed; I did.  

	The girl asked me about America saying her greatest wish was to study in New York City one day.  When I told her about my experience at the New School for Social Research, being dismissed for my anti NATO views on the Kosovo war she replied to me, “maybe she was wrong about wanting to study in Manhattan.”

	I made my way to the table with about five ethnic Albanian men hanging about selling cigarettes and asked them in English if they could exchange money for me; they did.  They were definitely organized crime.  They took my wet cash, examined the bills, one man walked into an apartment building with my cash while I merely waited.  He didn‘t rob me and returned with my Euros. 

	Surprisingly,  I found everyone in both Serbia and Montenegro very honorable in their business dealings; even if those dealings are organized crime.

	Upon receiving my Euros from the men, I walked away back to see if Bojana was through with the dentist; she was.  I excitedly told Darko that I had successfully managed to exchange American dollars for Euros thinking he’d be pleased with me; he wasn’t.  Darko was always very protective of me.  Instead of commending me he immediately got very angry; scolding me he said exchanging money illegally in the streets of Montenegro was both illegal and dangerous.  You can’t change the past so I diplomatically apologized and Darko soon forgot his anger I lieu of the fact that now we all could have lunch.  Afterward, Darko brought us to a beautiful beach nearby.  The majority of the sunbathers were ethnic Albanian and again no one  harassed us based on our ethnicity.  I tried pushing Darko into driving into Kosovo but he flatly refused.  I found it interesting that the international news at this time was reporting that there were hundreds of thousands of homeless ethnic Albanians being ethnically cleansed to Albania, I did not see one ethnic Albanian or Roma homeless on the streets anywhere. All seemed normal only ten meters from the Kosovo border.  After a day of swimming and partially nude sunbathing, we returned to the hotel.

	Insofar as sequence of events, at this junction in time it was the last few days I spent in Montenegro; it’s difficult now to remember the exact timeline of events.  In other words, I remember visiting Old Town  and Podgorica also in Montenegro but uncertain of which locations we visited first.  

	During the last two days, Darko took me one day to Old Town in Montenegro for dinner; there we greatly enjoyed an expensive seafood meal after which we walked around.  Darko got a parking ticket that night in Old Town and greatly complained about its five dollar fee;  for some, five dollars is equal to an entire week pay in Serbia.  I think I offered him the five dollars for the ticket feeling guilty because it was only for my benefit he parked there at all.  Darko wanted to show me Old Town; he already knew what the beautiful cobble stone streets looked like.      

	We also went to the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica.  I really don’t remember much of Podgorica except for walking around the streets one night.  Since we didn’t swim there so it wasn’t a high point for me.  When our ten day stay in Montenegro was finished we all packed and returned the way we came in Darko’s car.  The day before we left, Darko’s car required maintenance.  We didn’t have enough cash on hand left to pay for the needed repairs so I called Arnold Stark, my fiancée in the states, asking him to please wire us five hundred dollars cash to Montenegro; he did.  This is a fact that Arnold himself can verify being that he alone possesses the charge card receipt for wiring us the money through Western Union to a town not far from Budva.  With Darko’s car repairs complete, we returned home for Beograd.

	On the way back to Beograd we made two more important stops.  One was Hercegovni where we met up with Darko’s cousin, a soon to be freshman college student and her friends.  We had a couple of drinks, snapped some photos and Darko and I went for a quick swim in the sea.  When it began to rain, we called it a day.  The other stop was somewhere on the way back, where I have no idea.   We pulled up to a large lake.  Darko pulled his car onto a large ferry boat.  There were some people on the ferry, but primarily soldiers from the Serbian military.  Reaching the other side we drove around but I can’t remember much.  
		
	Returning on the ferry, we piled into Darko’s car and appeared at his apartment several hours later.  We were all extremely exhausted and passed out as soon as possible in our separate rooms.  Again, we walked past the same old men sitting in front of Darko’s apartment building seeming to do nothing; they waved at us.  	

	There were only two days left of my vacation at this point; I didn’t feel like doing much of anything.  I’d come down with terrible stomach symptoms that began in Budva several days prior.  This was probably owing to my ignoring Darko and Bojana’s warning not to drink tap water but only bottled; a lesson I ought have learned in Indonesia as a young girl.

	We were all feeling tired and slightly under the weather merely wanting to recuperate.  Notwithstanding, Darko, always an avid early morning riser, insisted we promenade Beograd’s renown indoor marketplace; an extremely large indoor flea market.  We walked approximately an hour or two.  I tried on several dresses before finally buying myself one; the type I can’t recall.  Bojana bought herself Serbian brand makeup after which Darko informed us it’s time to leave. 

	Shopping was always boring to Darko unless it was for himself and during his stay in the United States Darko, Bojana and I hit many malls in New York and New Jersey such as Willow brook in Wayne, New Jersey.  Other favorite stores we often visited were Daffy’s and Macy’s in Forest Hills, Queens, New York.  I vividly remember the Republika Srpska diplomatic contact, Dejan Miletic,
 to the Hague court in the Netherlands visiting.  Me, Darko, he whose name was, Dan, Dejan Miletic (he gave me his  busines card at the restaurant), in English, along with my daughter little Jill went to Macy’s at the Willow brook Mall in Wayne NJ allowing Dan to buy some gifts for his girlfriend back in Bosnia.  Afterwards, we all enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Six Brothers Diner on Route 46 not to far from Montclair State University in New Jersey.

	I can’t recall whether it was prior to vacationing in Budva or after, but close to the Beograd marketplace we visited the apartment of a Serbian basketball player and his disc jockey roommate (the walls of the apartment were covered with music CD’s from around the world). It was a very impressive CD collection.  He said he often spent time in Manhattan studying when not having to compete. 

	I became increasingly sad during this time owing that in another day I’d again be saying goodbye to the man I loved, Darko; perhaps leaving Serbia forever.  I wanted to stay and live in Beograd permanently but I had duties to my graduate studies at FDU in Hackensack, New Jersey.  Had I known the university (FDU) would be soon dismissing me from their graduate program similarly to the New School for Social Research, I would have stayed in Beograd.  I always told Darko my greatest desire was to live in Serbia and/or Montenegro.  	He always replied, “Jill you have your children and your studies now.  After your children leave and you complete your graduate degree, then you can come reside in my country.”  After the New School discriminated against me and I was recently receiving poor grades at FDU from professors that had formerly studied and graduated from the New School themselves, I felt I wanted to leave America thinking strongly I would have more academic freedom in Serbia.  In fact during my entire Serbian trip, I discovered that myself and others freely spoke our minds on a myriad of subjects such as politics and theology without being badgered.  This was my personal experience and I know allegedly not all Serb citizenry under  previous regimes enjoyed such privilege. 

	Upon leaving the marketplace we enjoyed lunch at Darko’s which Bojana prepared; she was an excellent cook!  My favorite Serbian food is Gibanica (I think this is the correct spelling).  Gibanica is an exquisite main dish comprised of Greek filo dough, beef, cheese and sometimes spinach baked in layers similarly to Italian lasagna.  After lunch, I decided to walk by myself to a local store for purchasing some items.  I wanted some air alone outside not wanting Darko to see me cry.  As aforementioned, I became extremely sad about returning to the United States the following day.  When returning to the apartment, Darko suggested I nap a while so I did.  I don’t remember what time it was when Darko knocked on my door waking me up.  He informed me we  were heading out soon to meet up with a friend of his named, Sharko, he wanted to introduce me.  

	We left Darko’s apartment after dusk and about ten minutes later parked nearby a beautiful green park lined with trees along the river, somewhere in Beograd.  

	Uncertain exactly where we were going, I allowed Darko and Bojana to lead.   Strolling down the narrow paved path a few feet wide cutting into a grassy hill, we headed directly towards a boat restaurant.  Traversing the small shaky wooden bridge, we boarded.  The place was empty; we were the only persons present besides one waitress.  
	
	We sat as follows; Darko and Bojana sat next to each other as in American restaurant booth’s and I sat alone across vis-à-vis.  The boat itself was very luxurious resembling the interior of several large boats formerly owned by the late Aristotle Onassis.  I have several books on Aristotle Onassis so I have seen photos of the interior of his large boats.  The waitress came over to take our order; there was no menu.  We verbally told her which libation we wanted; as she walked away Sharko came in.  Sharko was Ratko Mladic; he wore old faded blue jeans sagging a bit around his waist.           

	I wasn’t scared at all.  When first shaking hands with Mr. Mladic I thought quietly, this couldn’t possibly be happening; but it in objective reality it was really happening.  I’ve met many interesting people since graduating WPUNJ in New Jersey in 1997.  I personally coined the term, extreme sociologist which I consider myself.  I may not be rich, but achieved my scholarly goals notwithstanding either FDU or the New School for Social Research in Manhattan dismissing me from their graduate study programs.  Since completing my undergraduate degree, I’ve desired to better understand our world by meeting with and talking with the world’s most controversial individuals.  I believe in traveling to hidden and seemingly remote places around the world, partaking in local cultural activities for better understanding wherefore people behave as they do. 

	Mladic first seated himself across from me, in a separate chair the right of Darko.  The waitress returned asking Mladic what he preferred to drink; he ordered expensive wine saying jokingly it was “two hundred dollars a bottle,” smiling.  I was already drinking an alcoholic beverage of some sort I can’t remember along with Bojana.  Darko rarely drank and sipped on something non-alcoholic.  Extolling me to Mladic, 

	Darko explicated whereby I was the only American college student standing firm on grave issues pertaining to international justice insofar, the NATO and the former Yugoslavia.  

	Darko finished boasting about me to Mladic after which I in an extremely forceful forthright manner explained to Mladic my political views insofar as NATO’s breaching international law by launching military aggression against the former Yugoslavia, by bombing the Chinese embassy in Beograd, and, by purposely bombing other civilian targets in Serbia and Montenegro in 1999.  I have a film of when NATO bombed a newborn baby hospital unit in Beograd; disgraceful!   

	Mladic seemed impressed with my viewpoints on war and peace.   He was very warm friendly man; very relaxed and laid back.  He smiled the entirety we were chilling out just enjoying each other’s company and drink.  Hanging out with Mladic was no different than chilling with my other friends back in America.  I ordered another drink with Darko’s disapproval.  As aforementioned, Darko strongly disdained mind altering substances, always trying to help me overcome my craving for them.  Then, Mladic opened his wallet, showing me photos of his wife and children;  he had a very attractive family as portrayed in his wallet sized photos.  I think he missed them, perhaps empathizing to the loss I felt being estranged with my own two children for so many agonizing years. 

	Like General Mladic, I possess very few photos of my own children.  The photos Mladic had in his wallet were obviously very old because his children were still very young in the pictures.  It was evident he didn’t have any recent photos of his family in many years; I sympathized with him in this respect.  After reminiscing over family photos he got up sitting next to me across from Darko and Bojana.  I let him hold my hand gently massaging it.  He kissed my hand, inviting me to spend the night with him in the hills of Beograd; I declined on account of my strong Orthodox Christian theological convictions. I admit Mladic having warm inviting hands and greatly enjoying the manner in which he touched me.  I did consider him an attractive man; yet as aforementioned I declined his invitation. 

	
	
	He accepted my decision although he did ask me again; again I replied the same answer.  It was getting late and I was departing Serbia the following day in the afternoon.  Still sipping my drink, I began urging Darko to return to America with me making a life for himself teaching as a professor at a university. 

	In retrospect, I now feel tremendous guilt and shame because of my advances towards Darko owing to Bojana my best friend sitting  there with me vis-à-vis.  Feeling a bit tipsy from drinking, Mladic continued making sexual advances towards urging me to go home with him.  Darko laughed seemingly thinking Mladic’s advances towards me were cute stating, “go ahead Jill, spend the night with Sharko, it’s fine…Sharko‘s a good friend of mine…don‘t worry if you want to…I promise you’ll not miss your flight back to America tomorrow…“  I continued declining the advances and when it became obvious I wouldn’t change my mind, Darko said we had to leave because I had to finish packing for my flight and get a good nights sleep.  

	We all departed identically to boarding the boat restaurant, crossing the small narrow wooden bridge; Sharko/ Mladic departed with us.  After exiting, Mladic and I stood in front of the boat restaurant for several minutes.  I began crying because I loved Serbia not wanting to leave the next day.  Mladic pulled me close to him and embracing me, he kissed both my cheeks.  I kissed his cheeks also embracing him.

	In examining photos online of the Topcider Serbian military barracks in Beograd recently, the photo scenes look identical to where I met Ratko that night.  Even the photos of the trees, walkways and benches/Gazebo and river where we met look exactly the same. I remember the shape of the trees there that night even. The scene that night when we met looks very much identical as seen in the newly released Mladic home videos. 

	I wonder if Mladic did not have any security when he met me because Darko had brought me in the Topcider military barracks to meet Mladic that night; I believe he did. I would not have known the difference since it seemed merely a beautiful park. 

	Darko and Bojana were walking ahead towards the car leaving me and Mladic alone.  Knowing, I’d continue crying, I broke our embrace saying “goodbye.”  Mladic promised to visit me the next day dressed in his full military uniform before I left Serbia.  I didn’t want to part; but I did.  I saw Darko and Bojana walking towards their car up the grassy hill and followed.  I walked briskly catching up with them; I was exhausted and still had to finish packing back at Darko‘s apartment.  Once more I turned and saw Mladic drive away in an old brown Mercedes Benz on its left front side.  I was surprised to see it was scratched and slightly dented.  Arriving back at Darko’s place, I completed preparations for departing the following day and fell fast asleep.

	The next day I woke up around mid morning feeling depressed so  I went for a walk to a local store picking up some things.  Returning to Darko’s, we were standing outside his apartment discussing something when I turned seeing Mladic approaching me in full military regalia.  We shook hands glad seeing each other.  Of all photos I’ve seen online, Mladic never looked better than he did then.  

	His military uniform was clean, ironed and he wore every military metal ever earned it seemed to me.  He was as honorably decorated as any of the American Joint Chief’s of Staff; even wearing his gold colored in sigma upon his green military cap.  He had many gold colored metals hanging from his uniform on the left side by his chest.  I was privileged to see him this way; I confess being impressed. 

	I was surprised to say the very least.  Darko said to stand next to Mladic insisting on snapping some photos of the two of us.  Mladic placed his arm around my shoulder and I his; we both smiled as Darko  snapped some photos.  When finished Mladic presented me with a gift.  The book I posted online for you all to view, signing it to me under the alias name, Sharko thanking me for beautiful times spent together in Beograd.  We embraced and he left as Darko interjected saying we had to hurry to the airport before I miss my flight. 

	Darko’s German friend delivered me back to Beograd airport the same manner as picked up.  There was little time, my flight was actually locking the gate and about to depart without me.  Darko ran up to someone important showing his governmental badge as I recall, asking them to hold the flight until I board.  There was hardly time for JAT to weigh my luggage; they did however inform me it weighed over the limit allowed.  Darko said there was no time to be picky about what I was bringing back to the States ; I obeyed leaving one full suitcase behind with him as to not miss my flight.  Quickly helped me through customs and the gate,  I tried prolonging our goodbye.  Darko didn’t want seeing him cry and urged me on as the Serbian flight attendant waved me to hurry.  The gate was closed up and I had to run with my carry on to board the plane.  One last time I turned briefly to see Darko; he tried hiding the tears swelling in his eyes as I.  
I took my seat on the JAT flight back home to America.  Upon reaching JFK my luggage was lost and it was delivered over the weekend to my home in Bloomingdale New Jersey.  This is what it’s like to chill with the most ruthless men in the world. No biggie really.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
In the true spirit of former United States President, Woodrow Wilson’s American Democratic 
Ideals#, I hereby forward you draft documents from the recent United Nations meetings held 
in New York City on establishing a permanent International Criminal Court.

over the entire world, that you should fully comprehend its meaning and raison d’etat. 
Hence, I believe that all persons possessing a strong commitment to enhancing democracy, 
internationally applying equitable social justice and peace for our perpetual human survival and for our posterity [without prejudice], should read these documents.
Respectfully Yours,
Miss Jill Louse Starr 

PS: I probably have other documents I’ll have to check. Start reading these including a scanned photo image of the secret Richard Holbrook and Radovan Karadzic Immunity Agreement.

'''Irrefutable Proof ICTY Is Corrupt Court/Irrefutable Proof the Hague Court Cannot Legitimately Prosecute Karadzic Case

http://picasaweb.google.com/lpcyusa/
(The Documentary Secret United Nations ICC Meeting Papers Scanned Images)

This legal technicality indicates the Hague must dismiss charges against Dr Karadzic and others awaiting trials in the Hague jail; like it or not.

Unfortunately for the Signatures Of the Rome Statute United Nations member states instituting the ICC &amp; ICTY housed at the Hague, insofar as the, Radovan Karadzic, as with the other Hague cases awaiting trial there, I personally witnessed these United Nations member states openly speaking about trading judicial appointments and verdicts for financial funding when I attended the 2001 ICC Preparatory Meetings at the UN in Manhattan making the iCTY and ICC morally incapable trying Radovan Karazdic and others.

I witnessed with my own eyes and ears when attending the 2001 Preparatory Meetings to establish an newly emergent International Criminal Court, the exact caliber of criminal corruption running so very deeply at the Hague, that it was a perfectly viable topic of legitimate conversation in those meetings I attended to debate trading verdicts AND judicial appointments, for monetary funding.

Jilly wrote:*The rep from Spain became distraught and when her country’s proposal was not taken to well by the chair of the meeting , then Spain argued in a particularly loud and noticably strongly vocal manner, “Spain (my country) strongly believes if we contribute most financial support to the Hague’s highest court, that ought to give us and other countries feeding it financially MORE direct power over its decisions.”

((((((((((((((((((((((((( ((((((((((((((((((((((((( Instead of censoring the country representative from Spain for even bringing up this unjust, illegal and unfair judicial idea of bribery for international judicial verdicts and judicial appointments, all country representatives present in the meeting that day all treated the Spain proposition as a ”totally legitimate topic” discussed and debated it between each other for some time. I was quite shocked!
The idea was &quot;let's discuss it.&quot; &quot;It's a great topic to discuss.&quot;

Some countries agreed with Spain’s propositions while others did not. The point here is, bribery for judicial verdicts and judicial appointments was treated as a totally legitimate topic instead of an illegitimate toic which it is in the meeting that I attended in 2001 that day to establish the ground work for a newly emergent international criminal court.))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

In particular., since &quot;Spain&quot; was so overtly unafraid in bringing up this topic of trading financial funding the ICC for influence over its future judicial appointments and verdicts in front of every other UN member state present that day at the UN, &quot;Spain&quot; must have already known by previous experience the topic of bribery was &quot;socially acceptable&quot; for conversation that day. They must have previously spoke about bribing the ICTY and
ICC before in meetings; this is my take an international sociological honor student. SPAIN's diplomatic gesture of international justice insofar as, Serbia, in all of this is, disgusting morally!

SPAIN HAS TAUGHT THE WORLD THE TRUE DEFINITION OF AN
&quot;INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.&quot;

I remind everyone, when I attended those ICC Preparatory Meetings in 2001, witnessing first hand the country plenipotentiary representatives present with me discussing so openly, trading judicial funding of a new international criminal court, for its direct judicial appointments and judicial verdicts, those same state powers were

concurrently,

those same countries and people were already simultaneously, funding the already established ICTY which was issuing at that time, arrest warrants for Bosnian Serbs under false primary diplomatic pretenses.

The ICTY and ICC is just where it should be for once. Cornered and backed into and an international wall, scared like a corned animal (and I bet it reacts in the same way a rabid cornered animal does too in such circumstances). (ICTY associates)

(Documents: Hague war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has destroyed all material evidence about the monsterous KLA Albanian/KLA organ trade in Kosovo).

 I believe strongly that ICYU assocaites murdered former Serb President, Slobodan Milosevic, tried to murder me, as well and other Serbs prisoners and presently places , Doctor Radovan Karadzic’s life in direct danger as well as Ratko Mladic’s life
in danger should he be brought there.

The ICTY has no other choice than to halt all further court proceedings against, Doctor Radovan Karadzic, and others there both serving sentences and awaiting trials. Miss JIll Louise Starr (The UN Security Council has no choice but to act on this now).

I accuse the Hague ICTY war crimes tribunal of attempted assassination on my life and others, contempt of court and obstruction of international justice and &quot;international witness tampering&quot; in complicity with Richard Holbrook and Bill Clinton (Former US President of the USA) as well as political players in Spain and the Netherlands .

I represented the state interests' of the Former Yugoslavia, in Darko Trifunovic’s absence in those meetings and I am proud to undertake this effort on Serbia’s behalf.'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Start a Sentence ==

=== i ===

The little word ''i'' indicates the start of a sentence. We can also combine ''i'' with other operators to produce sentence combining forms such as ''ica'' (''i'' + ''ca''). 

==== Examples ====

* mi vizka tu. ''i'' tu vizka mi - I see you. You see me.
* mi fleti la Romas. ''i'' tu stolo le livhao - I fly to Rome. You stay at home.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://search.cpan.org/dist/PSGI/PSGI.pod PSGI] is an interface between Perl web applications and web servers. PSGI is inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. The specification was discussed in YAPC::Asia 2009, and the reference implementation [http://plackperl.org/ Plack], has been developed by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.

The concept of PSGI can maybe describe as &quot;The middle layer of everything&quot;. It extends and enhances the old CGI standard such that web applications on top of the same PSGI layer can share certain common data, such as http authentication, database connection handle and session. While those may have been implemented as Apache modules over past years, PSGI specification makes it possible and easy to develop middle-wares for all  applications and all front-end servers.

The core specification of PSGI is very simple. A PSGI application, is a Perl subroutine, that takes exactly one argument, the environment and returns an array reference of exactly three values. The status code, the response headers, and the response body. Here's an example of a &quot;Hello World&quot; PSGI application:

  sub app {
      my $env = shift;
      return [
          '200',
          [ 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain' ],
          [ &quot;Hello World&quot; ]
      ];
  }

The $env is a hashref that contain environment variables. It includes the values in the %ENV hash, but there are more PSGI-specific values inside. Developers writing PSGI-based web applications should not access %ENV hash directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Energy ==

We define energy as the ability to motion. All physical things have an ability to move which can depend on its position, its current motion or its chemical make up. A ball at the top of a hill has more ability to move than a ball at the bottom of a hill. A fast moving object has more ability to move than a slow moving one and certain chemical have great ability for motion, such as oil, than others, such as water. We can measure the ability to motion in different ways, which leads us to define different types of energy; potential energy, kinetic energy, chemical energy and energy in transfer such as heat energy and electrical energy. 

For any physical object or system to move or to do anything it first requires a ability to move. When it moves it changes its ability to move from one form to another. A ball at the top of the hill has an ability to move (it can roll down the hill) at a certain rate which we can measure and calculate. As it move it exchanges it ability to move for other forms of energy such as heat energy and kinetic energy (sound). When the balls comes to a rest at the bottom of the hill it has less ability to move but we also have heat and sound generated. If we add up all our energy at the start and at the end of the ball rolling down the hill we find we have the same about of ability to move but the form has changes; from potential energy to heat and kinetic energy (as some, much less, potential energy). Thus, all that we do involves converting energy from one form to another.

Our socioeconomic system represents another example of a physical system; far more complex than a ball running down hill but still requiring energy and converting it from one from to another. Thus our socioeconomic  requires energy to run; no more energy means it will collapse and die. 

At the beginning of the 21st century our socioeconomic uses a number of different sources of energy; chemical in the form of oil, nuclear as well as potential in the form of wind and hydro power. However, we heavily depend on oil as our main sources of energy to keep things running. Oil will not last. We use oil up at a rate far exceeding the Earth's ability to renew the oil deposits. We also use up oil at an exponential increasing rate. 

We not only need to move to a sustainable source of energy and away from oil but we also need to maintain a state dynamic equilibrium with our energy supply. Our dependency on oil and our increasing need for more energy both result in the potential, for an economic collapse and thus, a need to look at alternative systems.

Hello.I'm Vincent you can call me Vince for short.I want to share this story to you.It's a real life story.It's a game BS for short.In this game I'm a captain of a ship.When I start in this game I don't know what will I do because it is new to me.I click the links and discover until I learned.In the first time it is easy to gain one level but the higher my level the harder to level up.I equip several weapons.I change to many different class.Now I'm level 109 and my class is Explorer.I have a good setup of weapons.In addition I'm a clan master also.We build clan BLAZERS with my brother.I discover friends too.My BS name is mmm.

Hi Mike1722,

Did you mean to remove content from [[General Chemistry]], or from the Middle School version you've been working on? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:22, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
:Ping! (Just trying to get your attention - I don't think you're meaning to edit [[General Chemistry]]). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:30, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
::Mike - please answer. I'm about to start rolling back your changes unless you tell me you are making them intentionally. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:36, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
:::One last time.  I hope blocking your account is not the only way to get your attention. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:42, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

Hi Jomegat,

No blocking my account is not the only way to get my attention, my wife usually pokes me also.  Thank you for catching my error; I thought (being a newbie is that really possible?) that I was editing my Primer, not the General Chemistry Wikibook.  There should be no changes to the General Chemistry Wikibook.  All of the changes are to the Primer.

[[User:Mike1722|Mike1722]] ([[User talk:Mike1722|talk]])
:Hi Mike - thanks for answering.  I figured that's what was happening.  I'm trying to see if there's a good way to copy GC over to your book and keep the history intact, but I don't think there is.  For now you should cut-n-paste to create new pages.  The edit summary should contain the page name of the source. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:35, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biographical Information ==

:David Wiesner was born in Bridgewater, New Jersey on February 5, 1956.  As a young child he had a great imagination and would draw very creative things like prehistoric jungles, far away planets, vegetables and many other items that he would dream about.  His parents would encourage this hobby by keeping a stockpile of pastels, pen-and-ink, and paint around the house.

:When David was growing up in suburban New Jersey he started to become influenced by different great artists.  He first became interested in Renaissance painters like Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Durer. Their specialty was in realistic, academic style art.  David was very interested in the background of the painters more so than the subject of the paintings.  The other painters that he became interested in were Dali, Magritte, and De Chirico, who were surrealists.

:David attended and graduated Rhode Island School of Design where he was able to further his passion for wordless storytelling.  After he graduated with a BFA in Illustration he married surgeon Kim Kahng in 1983.  They have two children.  They both wrote his first book ''Loathsome Dragon''.   ''Free Fall'', his second book, was an accordion-style book.  When you opened it up, it was about forty feet long.  It was a representation of his huge stockpile of imagery and ideas that had been building up for years.  He received his first Caldecott Honor for this book.  

:Another one of his favorite books was ''Tuesday''.  A magazine cover that he designed for Cricket inspired this book.  He had models of frogs that were bumpy, different colors, and very weird-looking.  He had a great time drawing these frogs.  This book was probably the most spontaneously generated book he had ever done, completing it in about an hour.  This book also won a Caldecott award.

:David experimented with a new idea when he wrote and illustrated ''The Three Pigs'' with pigs flying off the page onto another page and words floating all around.  He put in blank white pages throughout the book.  He had other characters from other stories in this as well.  He used dragons, fish, and cats.  In this story, the pigs did not die. 

:David Wiesner's work has evolved over the years.  He can remember drawing when he was as young as four years old.  He started drawing fish, vegetable and flying things and has never stopped.  David has illustrated more than twenty award-winning books.  He has won many Caldecott Medal Awards, IBBY Honour Book nomination for illustration and has made the New York Times bestseller list.  His family resides in the Philadelphia area where he continues to dream and creates books.

== Books of Interest ==

'''''Free Fall''''' begins with a young boy fast asleep, a storybook lying open on his chest. The boy begins to dream while the pages of the book start to fly and take life. He becomes a character in the book as the chess pieces begin to talk with him. He then goes through many exciting adventures during the course of the book. It would keep a child’s attention throughout the entire story because the artwork is amazing and it is like a moving picture with things turning into other things as the dream proceeds.  

'''''Hurricane''''' is a very realistic story that many young readers could become addicted to and not want to put down. It is about 2 brothers who are waiting for a large hurricane to arrive in their town. When the storm finally hits both of the boys get really scared. After the hurricane lets up and is over the boys notice that there is a large tree that fell down right next to their house. It wasn't their tree; it was the neighbors, but they decided to play on it one day because they were extremely bored. Wiesner uses very descriptive words and pictures that are detailed and precise.

'''''Tuesday''''' is a good book for discussions that should start while looking at the pictures. The illustrations are so realistic and comical that any child would enjoy them. His illustrations are simple watercolors, well detailed and in-depth. Beginning at 8:00 pm, the reader sees a three-part picture of a pond that changes perspective to focus on an alarmed turtle. Frogs on lily pads have taken flight and begin to chase after birds, intimidate a dog and confuse a man eating midnight snack. This is a great imagination book for all children to read and look at.

'''''June 29, 1999''''' is a beautiful science fiction story. This book is an excellent example of science fiction because it demonstrates the impact science can have when it is implemented in an extraordinary and imaginative ways.  Wiesner's interesting combination of pictures and text makes this book incredibly unique and captivating. The exquisite watercolors are truly out of this world. The photo realistic quality of the figures and background add to the story line.

'''''The Three Pigs''''' is a creative and delightful picture book. This book is a good example of a fairytale because the story is set up so that the reader can withhold skepticism and enjoy the fantasy world that the author has created. The pigs wander through other stories, their bodies changing to take on the new style of illustration as they enter the pages emerging with a dragon and the cat with a fiddle.

'''''Flotsam''''' is a wordless picture book, with detailed illustrations that reward close examination. A story is told through a series of events with only pictures. The pictures are very detailed and wonderful. When a boy finds a camera washed up on the beach, he develops the film inside and finds pictures that give a glimpse at a hidden world, and a past world.

==Ingredients==
*1 ten-ounce package of frozen, chopped [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
*¾ cup each all-purpose flour and [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat Flour|whole wheat flour]]
*1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]]
*¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3 tbsp [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*115 ml skimmed [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*3 oz (90 g) shredded low fat [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]].

==Procedure==
#Cook broccoli according to package directions.  Drain.  
#Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Have an ungreased baking sheet ready.
#In a large bowl, combine both types of flour, baking powder, garlic powder, and salt.  Mix well. 
#Add the margarine. Mix with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
#Add milk and stir until all ingredient are moistened.
#Place dough on a floured surface and knead a few times until the dough holds together in a ball. Add a small amount of flour if the dough is sticky.
#Roll dough, or press with your hands, into an 8 x 14 inch rectangle.
#Sprinkle cheese evenly over dough, staying 1 inch away from the edges.
#Spread broccoli evenly over the cheese.
#Starting with one long side, tightly roll up dough like a jelly roll. Pinch the ends and seam together. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.
#Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the bottom is nicely browned. Remove to a rack to cool for 5 minutes, then slice and serve warm.

=='''21st Century Physics Flexbook – Virginia''' ==


[[File:Physics003.jpg‎‎|right|thumb|150px|Students working on lab]]

===CK-12 Foundation ===
The CK-12 Foundation is a non-profit organization based in California and was founded by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeru_Khosla Neeru Khosla] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan_Pal Murugan Pal] in 2006. The one mission of the foundation is to reduce the cost of textbook materials for K-12 education.  Most of the material currently available is English-based.  However, the foundation's mission also includes creating and maintaining material for world-wide usage.  The Foundation consists of advisors, contributors, partners, and a team.  The partners are categorized based on educational (such as wikimedia), content (such as McRel), technology (such as Qoop), and design &amp; UI (such as fuseproject). &lt;ref&gt;CK 12 Foundation. (2011). Retrieved March 04, 2011 from http://www.ck12.org/about/about-us &lt;/ref&gt;

The CK-12 Foundation is known for the creation of the FlexBook, which are open-content curriculum textbooks aimed for education purposes.  The FlexBooks have a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike License.

===History of Flexbooks (Flexibility + Textbook = Flexbook)===

In August of 2008, a new model of textbook that will allow teachers, parents, professionals and even students to adapt, create and configure those resources to be used in schools to teach the next generation was launched. These custom built textbooks will be made faster and cheaper than traditional books and will allow for flexibility in content, custom tailored to the needs of individual districts. (Flexbooks,2008)&lt;ref&gt;Flexbooks, (2008). Retrieved March 1, 2010 from http://www.wikinomics.com/blog/index.php/2008/02/14/flexbooks-a-wikinomics-approach-to-education &lt;/ref&gt;  The creators of the flexbook currently identify the following benefits of this format: 

* Access to free textbooks

* High quality educational content created by educators

* Content customized to reflect &quot;today&quot; and the different needs of students

* Quality ensured by CK-12's Community of Educational Practitioners

* Increased pedagogic choice for all teachers, aligned to state standards as well as developmentally correct content

* Supported by publishing tools that facilitate quick and easy content creation and distribution

* Collaborative learning via a community where authors, teachers, and students create, access, share, rate, recommend, and publish  &lt;ref&gt;CK 12 Foundation. (2011). Retrieved March 04, 2011 from http://www.ck12.org/about/about-us &lt;/ref&gt;

Please visit the flexbooks page in this document for more information regarding the flexbook model. (Wikibooks, 2010) &lt;ref&gt;wikibooks (2010). Retrieved March 3, 2010 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User-Generated_Content_in_Education/CK-12_Flexbooks &lt;/ref&gt;

===The Making of a Flexbook Textbook-Virginia ===

[[File:AneeshChopra.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Aneesh Chopra]]


Aneesh Chopra acted as the fourth Secretary of Techology for the state of Virginia before stepping in to the role of Chief Technology Officer of the US Government.  As such, Chopra advanced the idea of the flexbook and sought to further the initiative by inviting knowledgeable stakeholders to share their cutting edge knowledge.    
Virginia officials define a Flexbook as, “an adaptive, web–based set of instructional materials, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike (CC–BY–SA) and thus can be used as is, used in part, or enhanced by teachers based on their curriculum and classroom needs.”  

To ensure the quality of the content, the Flexbook underwent four reviews prior to release: a technical review by a college physics professor, a peer review by other authors, two student reviews, and a public review following an early release on February 27, 2009. There will be periodic reviews of the Flexbook to ensure the most relevant and appropriate information is included.

This move represented the first open-content textbook to be approved by any state.  Authors of chapters included in the flexbook write as volunteers and area considered experts in their fields.  

In November of 2009, Jim Batterson, leader of the Physics FlexBook movement in Virginia, presented data of the relationship between Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  This [http://www.vsba.org/Convention2009/Presentations/sciencetechnology.ppt PowerPoint] illustrates data that points to a desire by the 11-member panel to include aspects of each of the four disciplines in open source FlexBooks.

=== ''K-12 Physics Flexbook''  ===



The Flexbook is intended to cover all current topics of physics.  It is able to be edited by experts as needed in order to keep it as relevant and up-to-date as possible.  It consists of these 13 chapters, designed by 7 K-12 teachers, two scientists, and two university professors (see listing).  It was peer-reviewed three times before it was opened to students for review.  This particular Flexbook was initiated by the State of Virginia but anyone can utilize it as a resource.

=== Official Press Release ===

===Virginia physics flexbook to help supplement 21st century materials for teachers===

Governor's Office news release 

Published: March 16, 2009 

Governor Timothy M. Kaine announced the official release of the 21st Century Physics Flexbook: A Compilation of Contemporary and Emerging Technologies on this date.  The collaborative effort resulted in a free to schools supplement to textbooks that may be outdated and in many circumstances, not contain information on newer advances and technologies.
“As we work to prepare our students to compete in the global economy, it is important that we think creatively about how we provide our students with the best education possible,” Governor Kaine said. “The Virginia Physics Flexbook will strengthen our physics curriculum by providing teachers free access to materials that will expose Virginia students to cutting-edge technologies.” (WSLS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.wsls.com/sls/news/state_regional/article/virginia_physics_flexbook_to_help_supplement_21st_century_materials_for_tea/30625/ Retrieved March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>moved [[Talk:Radiation Oncology/Lung]] to [[Talk:Radiation Oncology/Thorax]]: reorganization of /Lung chapter to /Thorax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I have been thinking about reorganizing this a bit more to fit with the overall structure of the wiki. I think /Lung ought to become /Thorax. And I think we should move the subchapters (NSCLC, SCLC, etc) back out to main level, ie Radiation_Oncology/NSCLC, and just link them from /Thorax. What do you think? [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] ([[User talk:Tdvorak|talk]]) 01:28, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
:I think this idea makes good sense.  So, we'd end up with each subchapter currently under /Lung being moved back out to main (NSCLC, SCLC, Carcinoid, Mesothelioma). This just leaves a few of the non-disease-specific pages to be dealt with: Lung Anatomy and RTOG Lung Trials.  I suppose these could be put under the /Thorax hierarchy, i.e. Thorax/Anatomy and Thorax/RTOG Lung.  Carcinoid can be moved to /Carcinoid/Lung since we already have a Carcinoid heading.

At this point, let's see how this page turns out. It seems to fit well within the User-Generated Content topic of the book. If there's an orphan page or book somewhere that was never completed, then that should probably be deleted. If there are other concerns, they should be clearly described here. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 03:46, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

My contributions to this page include the History of YouTube/Teachertube, Features that are found on the site, and the Educational Value of the websites. Also, I added to External Resources and References and was able to upload a picture of a keyboard! -KCurry

I was in charge of copyright, benefits, and critisim on the youtube and teachertube wikibook. I add the links to the further readings, external links and the reference.I added an images of copyright symbol and creative commons.(MH)

This page is really nice and has a lot of good information and I'm impressed you were able to upload a image, I never did figure out how to do that! [[User:Margaret.mourer|Margaret.mourer]] ([[User talk:Margaret.mourer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Margaret.mourer|contribs]]) 02:05, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

I just learned something new!  I didn't know there was a TeacherTube.  What a great way to share information.  I guess Id better start paying more attention to what is happening in technology.  ss

The Youtube/Teacher tube books is very well organized. I like the Benefits and Criticism sections as well as the information about copyright laws.  KE

'''Four things to consider''' (in priority order):
# Add your initials and who contributed what to this page. See how that was done on the previous two pages.
# There are many ways to format references in Wikibooks, and it's important that we standardize on one. It's the one I shared on the example page at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education.
# Remove the reference to Wilkes. It doesn't relate to your topic. You could put references to your own e-mails on this DISCUSSION page if you wish.
# The source for your primary information (the first big section) has no references. Where did this come from. It needs a citation. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:26, 8 March 2010 (UTC)


===March 2011===
My contributions to this page include several additions to the section on &quot;History.&quot;  I also uploaded a photo of the original YouTube headquarters.  I added some facts to the section titled &quot;Historical Facts&quot; and &quot;Features.&quot;  I added the new section titled &quot;YouTube Guidelines.&quot;  
I also made some changes to the information about Creative Commons and added the whole section about how serious YouTube takes copyright issues under the &quot;Privacy&quot; section.  I added the YouTube logo at the top of the page (though I forgot to sign in so you won't see my name), but it was Ashley's idea to do that.  I also changed the placement of some of the topics to make it &quot;flow&quot; smoother.----N.K. 2011

I added the information about teacher tube teaching resources. I also edited the &quot;History&quot; section by organizing the teacher tube info after the you tube information. --SLR 2011

My contributions to this page include ideas in the history section of the wikibook and also the criticisms section.  CDelazio


=== Peer Comment:  Andrea Ayers ===
Great work with inserting the image.  I also inserted an image on our OER page.  I struggled with some of the markup language to get it inserted properly as well as figuring out the correct licensing issues.  Yours definitely adds value.  That image represents the site.

===Peer Comment:  Courtney Delazio ===
I too agree with Andrea.  The image on the page does add value to the wikibook and makes it more appealing.  Great job!

=== Peer Comment: MTP ===
I do feel that you have a good bit on information on the book and that it definitely is a good start.  Yet, after looking over the site I found a few areas of concern.  I feel that if you are going to use the Youtube logo at the top of the page there should be come caption or information that describes it.  Right now it just seems all alone.  In addition Youtube, You Tube, and YouTube are all used on the page I feel that one standard name for the company should be used.

I believe that I made all changes to the problems with the different names.  Thank you for pointing that out! ---N.K.

=== Peer Comment: Teresa ===
Your changes definitely enhance the page overall.  I like the addition of the YouTube logo at the top, makes the page more appealing to the eye.  I especially like the additions of the YouTube Guidelines and the importance of privacy.  Often people think, &quot;if its on the web its fair game&quot;, which is far from the truth.  It is  important for potential users to know proper internet etiquette and copyright requirements.
Nice Job!

Peer Comment by Jenn B.- What a fun topic to work on.  I'm not sure what was previously there, but the page looks great.

== Peer Edit - Ashley Brunner ==

I added the Tosh.O section, as well as several links to the further readings section.  I originally tried to add the YouTube logo, but it was the wrong picture.  The Nicole added the correct image for me (thanks so much).  Everything looks great.  Go team!
'''

'''Peer Comment: Tom S.'''

I like that you added a section about Tosh.  It is important to note the impact these resources have had on popular culture and Tosh is a great example of how youtube has been accepted and is being woven into our society.  Just like news carriers are using youtube as a reference more and more often, so are entertainment outlets finding a profitable way to use that material which, in turn, only fuels more usage and content.

== Julie's Comments ==

Good job with the picture.  I attempted to add a picture to the OER book but had some difficulties.  I didn't realize that YouTube was so &quot;new&quot;.  I found the history section to be nicely detailed.

== Sue's Comments ==
Lots of great information.  It would be nice to see a more specific treatment of the use of TeacherTube to let students teach other students.  The videos that students create work very well for topic introduction, differentiation, and models for class projects.  Well done.</text>

==Introduction==
With Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced the Ease of Access Center to make computers more functional for people with special needs, particularly those “with visual difficulties, hearing loss, pain in their hands or arms or reasoning and cognitive issues (Williams, 2006, p. 4).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. (2006, August). Microsoft's Vista guarantees people with special needs access to computers. Exceptional Parent Magazine, 36(8), 54-57 (p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ease of Access Center features make it easier for those with vision, hearing, and mobility issues to navigate the computer. For instance, Windows keyboard shortcuts in [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Keyboard-shortcuts/ Vista] and [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Keyboard-shortcuts/ Windows 7] assist  who have difficulty controlling a mouse due to poor motor skills or vision. (Dell, N., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Dell, N., Newton, D., and Petroff, J. (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom: enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility tools help schools by removing the need for expensive equipment that may draw “undue attention to students' disabilities” (Dell, N., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;148).&lt;ref&gt;Dell, N., Newton, D., and Petroff, J. (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom: enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft gave the Ease of Access center functions titles that are easy to remember. The Common Tools include Magnifier, Narrator, On-Screen Keyboard, and High Contrast. Other tools and functions include Audio Description, Text to Speech, Speech Recognition, These settings can be customized by user profile, so if multiple students are using a computer they can use Windows set up the way that works best for them.

The improved speech recognition tool in Vista will benefit those who limited hand control and mobility, as well as those who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome (Williams, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. (2006, August). Microsoft's Vista guarantees people with special needs access to computers. Exceptional Parent Magazine, 36(8), 54-57&lt;/ref&gt; it is designed to adapt to the user's style of speaking. Speech recognition allows you not only to dictate text, you can do anything you would do with the mouse and keyboard including navigating between applications and editing and  formatting documents.

==Common Tools==
Microsoft grouped the most common accessibility tools into one place for easy access. These tools assist those with weak or no hearing and vision, as well as those with limited mobility. Once turned on, they will stay active until the user logs off (Williams, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. (2006, August). Microsoft's Vista guarantees people with special needs access to computers. Exceptional Parent Magazine, 36(8), 54-57.&lt;/ref&gt; When you open the Ease of Access Center window, Windows will start navigating between the four tools, and read each one out loud as it is highlighted.&lt;code&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

----

===Magnifier===

Magnifier allows you to make any text or image on the screen larger. It can be a bit awkward to use, but with practice it gets easier. When you turn on Magnifier, Vista open a separate application window that uses settings you specify in the Magnifier tool. Whatever you are looking at when you turn Magnifier on is what displays in the new window. The magnification ranges from 2x to 16x.

'''Start Magnifier''' by selecting it in the Ease of Access Center.
* Keyboard shortcut = Winkey + U then ALT + G.

To change the settings, you must select the Magnifier tool from the Windows Taskbar at the bottom of the window. (You can also hold the Alt key and press Tab until Magnifier is the active window). 
To turn Magnifier on, select “Start Magnifier” in the “Ease of Access Center”. 
To turn Magnifier off, click the red X to close the window.

'''Magnifier settings'''
* Minimize on Startup. This will minimize the Magnifier window when you turn Magnifier on.
* Scale factor. Control the amount of zoom. 1x is normal. 2x is 200% of normal. 3x is 300% of normal.
* Invert Colors will reverse black and white.
* Docked specifies where on your monitor the magnified window will appear. The options are Top, Bottom, Left and Right.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

----

===Narrator===

Narrator is a simple text-to-speech tool that will read Window's menu items as the student navigates within windows.

'''Start Narrator''' by selecting it in the Ease of Access Center.
* Keyboard shortcut = Winkey + U then ALT + N.

Narrator preferences allow a student to specify what will be read. Choices are:
* Echo Keystrokes (reads each key pressed)
* Announce System Messages
* Announce Scroll Notifications
* Start Narrator Minimized

Other Narrator settings allow you to increase or decrease the speed, volume and pitch of the voice.

A complete listing of Narrator keyboard shortcuts is available on the [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/narshortcuts.aspx Microsoft Website].&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft.com. (2008, February 14). Windows vista accessibility tutorials. Retrieved from http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/narshortcuts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

----

===On-Screen Keyboard===
The visual keyboard function makes it much easier for students with limited mobility, to type on the computer. Vista provides a full virtual keyboard including a number pad which be used with a mouse, a switch device, or any other pointing device.

'''Start On-Screen Keyboard''' by selecting it in the Ease of Access Center.
* Keyboard shortcut = Winkey + U then ALT + K.

The on-screen keyboard can be configured to display a variety of keyboard layouts to accommodate different needs.
* Enhanced (includes number pad) or standard keyboard
* Block Layout (displays keys in rows)
* Keyboard is 101, 102, or 106 keys

Other virtual keyboard settings further customize keyboard to meet the needs of those with limited mobility.
* Keys can be selected by clicking, hovering, or scanning.
* The font displayed on the keyboard can be set to any installed font. Students can also modify the font size and style.
* Audible key clicks are another option.

----

===High Contrast===
[[Image:High contrast explorer.png|thumb|400px|right|Screenshot of Windows Explorer in Vista with High Contrast]] Increasing the contrast can make reading and navigating the screen easier for someone with poor vision. When a user turns on High Contrast, screen colors are basically inverted so that important text and images stand out, though images will display normally. The screen displays with a black background and bright with text.

'''Start High Contrast''' by selecting it in the Ease of Access Center.
* Keyboard shortcut = Winkey + U then ALT + U '''-- OR --''' ALT + Left SHIFT + PrtScn. ''If using a laptop, press ALT + Left SHIFT + Function + PrtScn.''
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==Other Tools and Functions==
===Audio Description===
Provides audio descriptions of what is happening in enabled videos viewed on the computer.

To turn on Audio Description, open the Ease of Access Center and click on the link that says, &quot;Use the computer without a display.&quot; Click the text box for Audio Description, or press ALT + I.

===Text to Speech===
The Vista Narrator tool can also read some text displayed on the screen.

To turn on Text to Speech, open the Ease of Access Center and click the link that says, &quot;Use the computer without a display.&quot; Then, click the &quot;Set up Text to Speech&quot; link or press ALT + O.

From here, you can
* Preview the voice (ALT + P) or
* Change the rate of speech with the arrow keys (ALT + C)

===Speech recognition===
Windows Vista includes a basic speech recognition program that allows a user to use their voice to navigate the compute, and create documents and email, creating a nearly hands-free interface. With speech recognition, students can use their voice to &quot;start programs, open menus, click buttons and other objects on the screen, dictate text into documents, and write and send e-mails&quot; (Microsoft, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft. (2008, February 14). Start speech recognition. Retrieved from http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/sr.aspx ) among other things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vista offers speech recognition in English (US and UK), German, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese (Microsoft, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft. (2008, February 14). Windows speech recognition. Retrieved from http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windowsvista/speech.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; While a headset is recommended, Speech Recognition will also work with a desktop microphone and a built-in laptop microphone.

A Speech Recognition tutorial is provided both for the student to learn how to use it and also for the computer to learn the student's voice. Unfortunately, each Vista workstation can only be trained to recognize one voice.

===Mouse settings===
====Mouse Properties====
Access these settings by going through the Control Panel to the Mouse icon. 

* '''Buttons tab'''
** Left-handed mouse. Switch between left and right-handed mouse to accommodate &quot;other&quot; handedness. The left and right mouse buttons be switched.
** Double click speed. Adjust the double click speed from very slow to very fast. A slower double-click speed will make computer use easier for a student with less dexterity.
** Click lock. This feature allows a student to highlight and range of text and to drag text and images without having to hold the mouse button down.

* '''Pointers tab'''
** Scheme. This option lets you choose the graphic for your mouse point. Instead of an small white arrow, you can increase the arrow size and color. You can also choose other graphics such as a hand or a dinosaur.
** Pointer shadow. A check box offer a student the option to apply a pointer shadow, making the mouse pointer easier to located on the screen.

* '''Pointer options tab'''
** Mouse pointer speed. This option adjusts the speed the mouse pointer travels across the screen. A slower speed makes it much easier for a student with limited mobility to navigate on the computer.
** Snap to. When checked, the Snap to feature will make the default choice the active choice. Pressing the Enter key or Left mouse button will then select it.
** Mouse pointer trails. Pointer trails can make the mouse much easier to locate on the screen, particularly for those with limited vision. There is also an option to adjust the length of the pointer trails.
** Hide pointer while typing. Hiding the pointer can limit the visual distraction of having the mouse pointer on top of the text.
** Show pointer with CTRL key. When this option is selected, pressing the CTRL key causes a large circle to surround the mouse pointer briefly making it easy to locate.

* '''Wheel tab'''
** Adjust horizontal and vertical scrolling to a specific number of lines per scroll.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

== Introduction ==

[[Image:Kindle 2 - Front.jpg|left|280px|The Kindle 2]]

'''E-readers''' are devices designed primarily for the reading of digital books and other publications.  Most E-readers make obtaining printed materials easy to obtain, store, and read. For reading, the portability, frugal energy use, and levels of gray scale offer e-readers advantages over multi-use devices such as laptops and netbooks. While makes and models differ, many e-readers can download free or low-cost print materials directly from the Internet, and store thousands of books and publications. Most printed materials can be downloaded in less than a minute.

==Obtaining e-Book Content==

There are an ever-increasing number of popular books, best sellers, newspapers, magazines, and blogs available for download. An e-Reader supporting Wi-Fi may deliver an entire book in fewer than 60 seconds. E-Books typically retail for $9.99 which is frequently less than a book’s hard-copy price. When making a purchase decision, several pages of e-Books are usually available for previewing. There are several websites from which one can download out-of copyright, pre-1923 books for free. Unless one is looking for a hard-to-find textbook, the availability of content should not impact the purchase decision.

== E Ink Technology ==

'''E Ink''' technology is used in many e-Readers including: the Amazon Kindle, the Sony Reader, the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, and Plastic Logic’s Reader (E Ink, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;E Ink&quot;&gt; E Ink Corporation. Our Technology. Accessed March 8, 2010 at http://www.eink.com/technology/howitworks.html &lt;/ref&gt;   Because E Ink typically uses power only when the page turns, a battery charge can last a week (Educause, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Educause&quot;&gt; Educause Learning Initiative (2010) Seven things you should know about e-Readers. Accessed March 8, 2010 at http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7058.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, E Ink is available only in grayscale and provides no back lighting; this typically requires a user to have some kind of light when reading in the dark (Hamblen, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblen&quot;&gt; Hamblen, M., (2010). In pictures: Apple's iPad vs. e-readers. Accessed March 8, 2010 at http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9150039/In_pictures_Apple_s_iPad_vs._e_readers?taxonomyName=Mobile+Devices&amp;taxonomyId=75 &lt;/ref&gt;


== Accessibility Considerations == 

E-readers are now mass market consumer items whose pricing is several thousands of dollars less than the readers of the previous generation. Today, most e-readers include features which might be utilized to enhance learning or may be considered for adaptive technology. Most readers include a dictionary, highlight and note features, and the ability to search through text. E-Readers typically include a headphone jack which is suitable for headphones or external speakers. For individuals with low vision, e-readers offer a variety of text sizes as well as several levels of gray. Most e-Readers have the ability to convert text-to-speech and permit the user to choose from a variety of synthesized voices. 
While e-Readers may read aloud newspapers, magazines, blogs, and books, the menu choices typically are not read, making it difficult for anyone with low vision to manipulate the menu choices. Those lacking dexterity may also find that the small keyboard and small toggle found on many models may make the devices difficult to use.

== Kindle Controversy ==

The National Federation of the Blind and the American Council of the Blind have complained that the Kindle devices discriminate against students with vision problems. Four U.S. universities, participating in a Kindle pilot program, have announced that they will not be promoting Amazon’s Kindle in classrooms after reaching an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The Kindle DX has the capability to convert text-to-speech, but the device does not include text-to-speech for its menu and navigational controls (Gross, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross&quot;&gt; Gross, G., (2010). Kindle in classroom hurts blind students, DOJ warns. Accessed March 8, 2010 at http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9144418/Kindle_in_classroom_hurts_blind_students_DOJ_warns?taxonomyId=13&amp;pageNumber=1&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, a blind person could really only use the device with the assistance of a sighted person (Pate, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pate&quot;&gt; Pate, S., (2010). Kindle banned in schools discriminates against blind. Accessed March 3, 2010 at http://www.njnnetwork.com/njn/2010/01/kindle-banned-in-schools-discriminates-against-blind/&lt;/ref&gt;


== Makes and Models ==

===Amazon Kindle ===

The Kindle ($259) is a wireless e-reader which permits the downloading from Sprint’s 3G network. (The Sprint connection is free.) The six inch screen displays pages from books and publications using E Ink technology. The black-and-white screen has 16 shades of gray and several sizes of text. The Kindle supports text-to-speech. The model has the ability to store approximately 1,500 books.  

Amazon Kindle DX ($489) The Kindle and DX model share similar features; however, in addition the DX has the ability to store approximately 3,500 books, and boasts a 9.7” display.

===Sony Reader===

The Sony Reader PRS-700BC ($349) also uses E Ink technology which is considered frugal on battery power. Sony manufactures the first e-book reader with a touch screen which it claims makes manipulating through the content easier. Unlike the Kindle, the Sony e-Reader does not support text-to-speech, is not Mac compatible, and requires a USB computer connection to download new content (Consumer Reports, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reports&quot;&gt; Consumer Reports. (2009, July). Lab tests: E-readers: Kindle beats Sony, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barnes &amp; Noble Nook===

The Barnes &amp; Noble Nook ($259) also has built in wireless and utilizes a free 3G wireless connection. The nook features a virtual keyboard, a SD expansion slot, but no support for Word or text files. The Nook features a color touch screen, E Ink technology, and a removable battery.


== Not Your Ordinary e-Reader . . . ==

The Kurtzweil National Federation of the Blind (KNFB) Reader Mobile ($550) is smaller than a tissue box, the reader offers not only portability, but also the ability to quickly “read” many varieties of text including: glossy, curved text, as well as text in columns. The mobile reader also has the ability to read currency. Disadvantages of this particular reader may be the extended time needed to scan textbooks.

===Apple iPad===

The Apple iPad was released April 3, 2010. The iPad is a multi-tasking device which comes with a screen reader, support for closed-captioned content, and many other accessibility features. There are over 200,000 available applications for iPad. The 9.7” LED backlight touch-screen may be particularly appealing. Apple's pricing for the iPad is from $499 to $829. 

== Soon to be released . . . ==


===QUE proReader===

The QUE proReader is a multi-tasking device with a full touch screen, virtual keyboard. The QUE comes with an 8 ½” by 11” screen which is the size of a standard sheet of paper. Users can adjust their screen to eight shades of gray, highlight text, add notes, and zoom. The manufacturer claims that users can quickly go back and forth between reports, spreadsheets, and presentations. This portable device, should be available during the 2010 summer. The Barnes &amp; Noble website lists models which retail for $649 and $799. (QUE, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;QUE&quot;&gt; Que. (2010). QUE proReader with 4GB and wi-fi.

==The Future ==

It is hoped that future electronic devices will continue to include an increasing amount of adaptive technology. In a press release, Amazon noted that the Kindle team is currently working on an audible menuing system so blind and vision-impaired readers can easily navigate to books unassisted. A super size font, which will be twice the size of the current largest font, will be also be added. These new features are scheduled for release by the summer of 2010 (Amazon Media, 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazon&quot;&gt; Amazon Media Room.

== '''INTRODUCTION''' ==



Why assistive technology for music – what is the justification? First, it is more than just a good idea, it is the law: “In addition to IDEA 2004 [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act], two other federal laws have had an impact on the provision of assistive technology to students with disabilities, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973…and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990…&quot;  &lt;ref name= &quot;Textbook”&gt; Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J.G., . (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education &lt;/ref&gt;  Together these laws ensure that special needs students have equal access to education. Music is part of that education. Kimberly McCord points out that “Children with disabilities can be found in every music classroom…However, learning disabilities are harder to recognize and…the literature on musical creativity offers little guidance for educators in designing music lessons for children with disabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McCord, K. Moving beyond &quot;that's all I can do:&quot; encouraging musical    creativity in children with learning disabilities. Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; John Brockhouse also writes, “…the opportunity to learn a musical instrument is a basic human right which should be available equally to children attending…schools” (2006, p. 20).&lt;ref&gt;Brockhouse, J. Getting better all the time: using music technology for learners with special needs. Australian Journal of Music Education, 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the following is to provide a variety of assistive technologies that can be used with special needs students in music activities. Dell et al. states that an assistive device “…must have an impact on the functioning of the child with a disability&quot; (2008, p. 4). &lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;&gt; Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J.G., . (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In music, assistive technologies should enable a child with disabilities to participate in music activities.  These music assistive technologies will be discussed across a continuum from low to high tech, as defined by Dell et al.: “Low-tech devices use no electronic components…relatively inexpensive…High-tech devices…are based on computer technology…more expensive…require more training…Mid-tech devices are electronic…but are much less expensive and require less training than high-tech devices” (2008, pp. 5-6). &lt;ref name= &quot;Textbook&quot;&gt; Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J.G., . (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In designing any technologies to assist in making it possible for any disabled student to participate in music activities, first work with occupational and physical therapists who can often create inexpensive alternatives to expensive specially made technologies. Also, one can look at what might be available through commercial products, e.g., Wii music [[http://www.wiimusic.com music]] &lt;ref&gt;Nintendo. (2008). Retrieved from http://www.wiimusic.com &lt;/ref&gt;, instead of otherwise more expensive specialty technologies created for the learning disabled community only.

== '''LOW-TECH''' ==
In working on notation, some simple solutions include providing students with enlarged manuscript/score paper.[[http://www.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_score.com score]] &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.wikipedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Pencils with appropriate grips can also aid students in the writing process. Instructors may also wish to create Velcro type boards on which students can place notes; this is helpful for students with compromised motor skills. Even easier than working with a Velcro board is the old-fashioned vinyl Colorforms [[http://www.areyougame.com colorforms]] &lt;ref&gt;Original colorforms. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.areyougame.com &lt;/ref&gt;; there is a set available from which the music instructor can construct a staff and notes.In the area of music performance there are a number of low-tech instruments that would enable a student to participate. Because these instruments enable a child with disabilities to engage and learn, they fall into the category of assistive technology devices. A musical instruments station [[http://www.enablingdevices.com station]] &lt;ref&gt;Enabling devices. (2010). Retrieved from http://enablingdevices.com &lt;/ref&gt; [[http://www.backtobasicstoys.com/ basics]] &lt;ref&gt;Back to basics. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.backtobasicstoys.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, consisting of percussive-type instruments, also enables students with motor skills issues to participate in a performance. Percussion family instruments also enable students with cognitive disabilities to still be a part of the performance. One easy to grip instrument is the bell[[http://www.backtobasicstoys.com/item/productid/7564/txt/Musical_Hand_Bells_Set bell]] &lt;ref&gt;Back to basics. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.backtobasicstoys.com &lt;/ref&gt;; although each plays a particular pitch, a student with cognitive disabilities can be given one bell, and cued when to perform, thus enabling performance without the specific knowledge component of pitch. Lastly, electronic bongos[[http://www.backtobasicstoys.com/item/productid/8056/txt/Electronic_Bongo bongo]]&lt;ref&gt; Back to basics. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.backtobasicstoys.com &lt;/ref&gt; provide both pitch and non-pitched sounds. [[File:Hand bell large.jpg | left| thumb | 200px]]

== '''MID-TECH''' ==
Some electrical performance instruments that would fall into this category include
switches, which are a way for the severely disabled to participate in music performance. Rhythmic accompaniments can be created through the software program, Band in a Box [[http://download.cnet.com/Band-in-a-Box/3000-2133_4-10017366.html BAIB]] &lt;ref&gt;Band-in-a-box 9.0. (2010). Retrieved from http://download.cnet.com/Band-in-a-Box/3000-2133_4-10017366.html &lt;/ref&gt;, and then activated by the user through a switch. There are many types of switches, and instructors need to use the one that best meets the abilities of the student. The following website offers information about various types of switches and how to install and use them: http://www.northerngrid.org/&lt;ref&gt;Northern grid: harnessingtechnology… because every child matters. (2009). Retrieved from http://www.northerngrid.org &lt;/ref&gt;  A music teacher, known as Dr. Laz, demonstrates the use of switches to engage severely disabled students in music making (Embed Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afKfSPvYQ3M &lt;ref&gt;Lazerson, D.(2009, May, 19). S.w.i.t.c.h. - see what i can totally handle. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afKfSPvYQ3M &lt;/ref&gt;  Available assistive technology for aural disabilities is all but impossible to find, since the popularity of cochlear implants. Certainly, earphones and hearing aids of various types are still used. In music, it is understood that the hearing impaired can hear the music by feeling it, feeling the vibrations of music: &quot;Deaf people love music just as much as hearing people do...they just understand it differently. They can feel it.&quot; (Ell, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Ell, Kellie. &quot;Deaf Nation Celebrates Life.&quot; Oakland Tribune. 2005 Nov 12
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20051112/ai_n158&lt;/ref&gt;. However, many times the music education of the deaf has been more about the socialization in music making rather than bona fide music education (Burgin, 2008) &lt;ref&gt;Burgin, R. (2008). Music and the deaf. ASL University, Retrieved from http://www.http://www.lifeprint.com/index.htm &lt;/ref&gt;. Percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie – probably one of the most recognized hearing impaired musicians of our times – makes this distinction between the socialization process and the education process as music therapy and sound therapy, respectively; her Disability Essay concurs with Burgin that music for the deaf can, and should include a thorough music education.&lt;ref&gt;Gleenie, E.B. (n.d.). Disability essay. Retrieved from http://www.evelyn.co.uk/Evelyn_old/homepage.htm&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, there are a number of assistive technologies for the hearing impaired. In her article, ''Music Instruction and the Hearing Impaired'', Eugenia Bulawa Walczyk emphasizes technologies that can be used in an assistive capacity to ensure a complete music education for the deaf: signing will singing, use of piano keyboards for learning pitch and duration, use of music software programs so that students can connect the sound of music notation/duration to the visual score (1993, p. 42-44) &lt;ref&gt;Walczyk, E.B.

== '''HIGH-TECH''' ==
Dancing Dots[[http://www.dancingdots.com//limelighter/limelightermain.htm DD]] &lt;ref&gt;Dancing Dots: The Lime-lighter low vision music-reader device. (2008). Retrieved from http://www.dancingdots.com//limelighter/limelightermain.htm&lt;/ref&gt; offers a product – the Lime Lighter Low-Vision Music Reading Device - that gives performing musicians a number of options to make reading music easier. First, there is the magnifying feature, ranging from 1.25 to ten times the original size of the music score. Another nice feature is that its touch- sensitive screen allows one to put marks on the score, via a stylus, just as one would with a pencil on a paper score. This is an important feature since musicians often mark-up their music as needed to remind them of various features of the music such as sharps, flats, changes in time signatures[[http://www.8notes.com/school/theory/musictheory/files/index.html  theory]] &lt;ref&gt;Adam, R. (2005). Ricci adam's music theory. net. Retrieved from http://www.8notes.com/school/theory/musictheory/files/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;. Music scores can be downloaded into this device from web sites, and by scanning scores into this device via its own scanner. Music can be played back and printed. Pages are turned via a foot pedal device. This product works in conjunction with built in assistive technologies such as zoom features and reading of text in program menus as found in Microsoft and Mac. Some of the drawbacks include its price tag of $3995 (MSR price) and its claim that it has the ability to create scores through a piano keyboard: such devices require high levels of accuracy and precision that can be impossible for a student with special needs, especially a student with motor control issues. Its zoom feature enhances one measure of music at a time. This is a drawback because musicians read musical phrases just as we read sentences: both require the ability to see the bigger picture so that performance does not sound choppy and incomprehensible. A plus of this program is that it offers an hour-long training session via telephone. Dancing Dots also offers a number of products (Goodfeel) to enable blind students to read music by converting the notated music to Braille. This can be accomplished through a number of programs including the Finale and Sibelius notation software as well as via scanning music into this product. It should be noted that Finale[[http://www.finalemusic.com/finale Finale]]&lt;ref&gt;Finale: the premier family of music notation software. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.finalemusic.com/finale &lt;/ref&gt; and Sibelius[[http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.htm  Sibelius]]&lt;ref&gt;Sibelius 6. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.htm&lt;/ref&gt; notation software programs require good fine motor skills.
The Soundbeam [[http://www.soundbeam.co.uk Soundbeam]] &lt;ref&gt;Soundbeam. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.soundbeam.co.uk/special-needs-music-therapy/video-clips.html&lt;/ref&gt; device enables students with severe disabilities – cognitive and/or motor – to participate in music making. While this technology is not difficult to use it can be a challenge for the instructor setting it up and running it; therefore, this technology has been placed in the high-tech category. A demonstration illustrates how a disabled student – especially those with severe mental and physical handicaps – can participate in a music class. This is far more interactive than cause-and-effect devices such as switches. Music is activated and controlled through beams of light, as demonstrated in this video.[[http://www.soundbeam.co.uk/special-needs-music-therapy/video-clips.html video]]

== '''CONCLUSION''' ==
In my opinion, the most important feature of any assistive technology for music is that it is content driven, and not just making sounds through cause-and-effect technologies. It is also important that disabled students be given a variety of sounds to experience and to perform. As pointed out to me by a friend with a child with Rett’s syndrome, too often such students are given the same instrument in every music making experience; it is not surprising that the student then becomes disinterested in music making. Also, the use of assistive technologies in music must go beyond music therapy. While all music making can be therapeutic, the music class is about learning content and not just experiencing feelings about a sound. For more information – which is updated continually – please go to http://delicious.com/jenmusician  ; look into the assttech (assistive technology) and musicassttech (music assistive technology) bundles. I would be very interested in anyone contacting me to share more information on this topic: jcollins@po-box.esu.edu  or jenden@ptd.net.[[File:Evelyn-glennie.jpg | right | thumb | 500 px  [[percussionist Evelyn Glennie]]]]

=== ha ===

For an OR operation to have a truth value of true only one item in the list need a truth value of true. So,  the question &quot;would you like sugar or milk in your coffee&quot; has the answer &quot;yes&quot; if I would like sugar or if I would like milk or if I would like milk and sugar. It only has the answer &quot;no&quot; if I want neither milk nor sugar. Technically correct the answer &quot;yes&quot;, but not very useful. If I answer &quot;yes&quot; do I want milk, sugar or both? To over come this, Loglan provides the little word ''ha'' to mean ''which if any''. 

==== Example ====

* ei, tu danza le sakta ''ha'' le malna kii letu skafi - Would you like sugar or milk with your coffee?

Sometimes a composition forms something. For example, a black and white cat composed of both black fir and white fir. In loglan, if we say a ''black and white cat'' (le nigro ce blabi katmu) we mean the cat is both black and white at the same time, which not only forms and example of an impossibility but also we do not mean that. Loglan, however, does provide a word to mix things together.

==== Examples ====

* le nigro ''ze'' blabi katmu - black and white cat
* le redro ''ze'' vegri hasfa - The red and green house

== Awalan ber- ''(Prefix ber-)'' ==

Prefix ''ber-'' is used '''to form verbs or adjectives''' from nouns or other base verbs. The resulting word typically means ''having'' or ''being'' the property or attribute that the prefix is applied to. As such, the English translation of ''ber-'' prefixed words may be classified as verbs or adjectives, depending on the context. Typically the verbs created with the ''ber-'' prefix are intransitive verbs.

== Ber- + Kata Benda ''(Ber- + Noun)'' ==

When combined with a noun, the prefix ''ber-'' converts the noun to a verb, meaning to have or perform the ability or property of that noun.

Examples that may translate as verbs:
* Apa Anda berbahasa Indonesia? ''(= Do you speak Indonesian?)'' — from bahasa ''(= language)''
* Saya beragama Kristen ''(= I am a Christian)'' — from agama ''(= religion)''
* Dia berpacar Yusuf ''(= He/She is dating Yusuf)'' — from pacar ''(= boy/girl-friend)''
* Anjingnya berjalan ke kandang itu ''(= The dog is walking to the kennel)'' — from jalan ''(= way/path/road)''

Examples that may translate as adjectives (from nouns that are properties/conditions):
* Dia berbahaya ''(= He/She is dangerous)'' — from bahaya ''(= danger/hazard)''
* Rambutan ini berair ''(= This Rambutan is succulent/juicy)'' — from air ''(= water)''
* Jabal itu berbatu sekali ''(= That mountain is very rocky)'' — from batu ''(= rock)''

== Ber- + Kata Kerja ''(Ber- + Verb)'' ==

When combined with a verb, the ''ber-'' prefix generates an intransitive verb (where the [[Indonesian/prefix me|''me-'' prefix]] or other affixes would typically create the transitive verb).

Examples:

From ajar ''(= to teach)''
* '''Intransitive''': belajar ''(= to study)''
* '''Transitive''': mengajarkan ''(= to teach)''

From kendara ''(= to ride/drive)''
* '''Intransitive''': Saya berkendara ''(= I'm driving)''
* '''Transitive''': Saya mengendarai mobilku ''(= I'm driving my car)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Website Design=
==Goals==
Before designing a website it is important to set goals. What purpose is the website serving? Not all sites serve the same purpose. For example, a retail site will have very different goals than a nonprofit site. 

Some common website goals are:
*Sales
*Marketing
*Update information
*Generate leads
*Distribute information

Goals, in any setting, are important to business success. By setting goals for one aspect of the business, in this case, the website, it will help in accomplishing other goals of the business, such as:
*Expanding the audience
*Increasing sales
*Connecting other businesses or other parts of the company
*General communication

==Design Message==
The design message is the image the organization wants to portray to the reader. This can also be called the brand. When creating the look of the website you must consider logos, colors, fonts, and images. These must all support the personality of the organization.

Communicating the brand is something that is becoming more prevalent in the workplace. Consistency is needed everywhere within a business so that the company can portray a unified front--and believe in it. Giving web pages a consistent look will help define it as a cohesive website and will make it easier to navigate. Since companies are building their workplaces around the &quot;theme&quot; or the &quot;brand&quot;, there is no reason that the website should not be done in the same manner. In fact, it is necessary for brand identification, therefore helping the company advance and succeed. A consistent brand and image also build trust and value for a company.

Some important items to consider when communicating the brand are:
*The brand, whether communicated through the website or the customer service, must be consistent
*The brand should be found everywhere--there are no limits to exposure of brands
*Short and simple is always the best route
*You are the brand and the brand is you. If your brand does not reflect the values and beliefs of the company, it most certainly should not be on your website.

==Recognizing Your Audience==
Knowing your audience will help you to make better decisions when it comes to deciding which browsers to support and which new technologies to endorse. Before designing a new website, it would be helpful to look into the likely browsers, computer user knowledge, and connection speeds of the audience you are addressing. In redesigning a website that already exists, you can review the past site usage information so that you are providing improvements to the site where it is needed most.

There are several different guidelines that should be used when designing websites. Here are common site types:
* academic and scientific sites should have additional focus on how the site functions in graphics-free browsing environments
* consumer audience websites should pay special attention to site performance and presentation
* a controlled environment where a specific browser is being used, as in a corporate environment, is where it is best to use all that the website has to offer. Employees usually attend training to learn how to use these sites and the designer can use the browsers full potential.
* gaming websites is where you can assume that the users will have the latest plug-ins and browsers and are quite technologically savvy

You can also take a balanced approach to web design. This type of design integrates the latest web technologies, but implements them in a way that is still functional to those that have older browsers.

==Examining the Site's Purpose==
Figuring out how the site will be used in another important step in website design. Those who use the internet usually fall into two categories:
* those who seek information
* those who search the internet for entertainment
For the informational sites, you may want to consider the technology of the client or use more general approach in design. For the sites of those seeking entertainment, more cutting-edge technology can be used to better the experience of the user when they are accessing your site.

There are options for those who want to use the latest technology for their websites, but want to make it available to everyone. For this situation, you can use a browser detector to serve alternate version depending on the type of browser the user has. This allows you to use the latest technology and still recognize users that have older browsers.

==Testing Your Site==
Test your website on many different browsers and browser versions. Doing this before going live will help off-set problems you may encounter before it is available to the public. Professional web design firms run their sites through an intense quality assurance phase. If this is not a feasible task, you can make your site available on a private test site. You can then run your own quality assurance test throughout the following browsers:
* Acquaintances' browser
* Corporate office browser
* Different ISPs
Website pages will appear different depending on the environment it is viewed on. The overall idea of this testing phase is to make sure that the information is being presented clearly and there are not any overt problems.

==Content==

Content is one of the most important reasons for even creating a website in the first place. If you think about it, a website with no content has no purpose. A website with no purpose is wasted space on the internet.

When considering content for your website, be sure to think of the following items:
*What is the goal of the website?
*Who is the website trying to reach?
*How much time to people have to spend reading information on the website?
*How did individuals reach this website?
*What is the most important information to the reader?
*What questions do the readers have?
*What action is the reader supposed to take after reading the website content?

Another aspect to consider about website content is how it will be searched within different search engines. Key words are needed throughout your website to make sure that the website is found by people who are looking for specific information. It is important to be specific with words, and use them multiple times, so that search engine robots find the word and place it high on the results list.

Content must also be age and audience appropriate. Age appropriate is hard to determine on the internet since it is something that can be accessed by everyone who knows how to use a computer. Content on websites, however, still must be age appropriate so that the right audience is reading the right material. Age appropriateness also falls under appropriateness in general of making sure that private information does not become public on the internet. Audience appropriate means that the content of the website is serving the people with the right information at the correct level of reading to which the intended readers will understand.

With companies becoming more interested in the usability of their websites, positions are being created specifically for content writing. A website content writer is someone who specifically writes information for websites. This is written in a different voice than academic writing so that a web surfer will stay interested in the website, and therefore the information.

==Creating a Home Page==
Your home page will be the most visited page on your website. Your home page may not always have what your viewers are looking for, so if you have something that will draw them in to make them ''want'' look further for their information. You will have ten seconds to draw your customers into your site, or else they will hit the &quot;back&quot; button and will begin to look elsewhere. Your home page should be able to load quickly. The ten seconds you have to draw the customers into your site begins when they click on the link to your site. If it takes five seconds for your site to load, you only have a few seconds left to draw customers further. Here are some tips to help your site download quicker:

* Keep media images small
** limit images to no more than 5 to 10KB
** pages should not be more than 30KB total per page
* Avoid using ads from external websites on your home page that may slow down the loading time. You cannot control how fast another server will serve its content.
* Write your HTML in sections so that when the bottom of the page is still loading, your customers can read the top sections of your home page.

Another important point about home pages it to '''never stop modifying it'''. Reviewing your log files once your website is up and working can help you make your home page more user friendly. Updating the links or the colors may improve the appeal or ease of use to your site. Remember that everything can be changed, and you don't have to settle with something if it's working.

==Compatibility==
Features do not always display the same way in different Web browsers. It can be useful to check a created page using more than just one browser, to ensure that the page displays correctly for a wider audience.
Completed HTML code can be validated by visiting validator.w3.org. Saved HTML code can be uploaded and checked for accuracy. Any issues with the syntax of the HTML will be listed, as well as suggestions for changing the errors. This eliminates the need for a person to search their own code for errors after attempting to display it in a browser.

=Design Considerations=
==Synthesis==
==Usability==
Usability is defined as the ease of using the website. This could be for the intended audience of the website (see Audience), or it could be determined by the industry or business standards needed for websites. Usability of websites has gone through different definition changes with the evolution of the internet. In its early years, many people did not know how to navigate through websites or read the information provided. This made the website unusable. Now, people look for the easiest possible access to whatever information is needed.

===Usability means Communication===
Websites are a form of visual communication, serving multiple purposes. Websites can be informative, persuasive, long-term, advertising, or entertaining. Usability is determined based on the goals of the website.

If the website accomplishes its goals and communicates the necessary messages, it can therefore be considered usable.

===Developing Usability===
Starting to test a site before it is built will help avoid some problems before a lot of effort is put into the site. Plan on doing usability testing in focus groups to help you prepare for a better, more user friendly site. If you do not have access to a focus group, you can print out your ideas and share them with family and friends and ask for their insight. Some points to keep in mind when beginning your site are:
* Find out what people expect from your site. Customers may want something different than what you were preparing to build.
* Wording that you use will be important in how effective your site will be. If you begin testing early, you can find out what words relay your message better with your audience.
* Customers will provide you with good ideas. Testing with customers will give you ideas that you may not have thought of.
* Use descriptive headings, bold words, and bullet lists for easy reading
* Incorporate links and resources for more information
* Add pictures, charts, and graphs to enhance communication
* Avoid adding unnecessary information, pictures, sounds, or colors that are more distracting than helpful
* Test the website with audiences to determine usefulness

Testing is key to building a website. You must be willing to listen to the input of others, friends or potential customers, so you'll have a better site from the start.

==Appearance==

Appearance should be aesthetically pleasing.  One that is easy to look at and maneuver.  Tasks (what the user has come to this page looking for, such as an email address or information about an event) that are most important and or most commonly sought should be the main '''focal points''' of a web page. Whether it be certain colors driving that importance, or size, or placement on the page, even directional line guiding you to that point, the important tasks must not become secondary.  ''In other words'', they should stand out more, not become secondary to an image or a background.  Everything on your site should have a purpose, a reason for being where it is and looking the way it does. 

Pictures and colors are important and interesting, but far less important than the '''content'''.  This is true for any web page.  The user must not get confused upon entrance to a site.  They should know where they need to click (and understand what will come from that click) and not be distracted by images. Unless it's intended, images should be minimal and only help PUSH the contents importance, not overwhelm the page.  As such, it is the web designers job to make sure that doesn't happen.  Be it by '''Layout''' (see layout) or by visual distractions, forced eye movement using line or color, or by any other means deemed worthy by the designer, the content should be seen first, images second or third.

==Visability==
Visibility could be considered the most important aspect of website design. People must first find the website before they can view it. Most often people find websites through search engines. 

Here are some tips to increase visibility:
*Add text to pictures
*Check the html code for errors
*Use relevant title tags
*Use navigation that all internet users are able to view
*Get rid of duplicate content
*Do not use hidden text

==Layout==

The layout of a website should be as simple as possible.  Extra fluff will only distract the user and cause confusion.  You want your site to be visually pleasing, but first and foremost, understandable.  The user is at your site for a reason, if the layout isn't successful, the user will most likely leave the page and look for their information elsewhere. 

'''Things to keep in mind while creating your layout:'''

*Start with a wireframe; use simple boxes and lines to organize your page.  Pictures should be an afterthought.
*Think of what you want the user to see first and what is the most important. Make those the biggest, the boldest, the most colorful, anything you can think of to draw attention (but be careful not to overwhelm your users)
*Always remember, as accustomed, most cultures read from left to right, up then down
**Put your logo in the '''UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER''' to draw the user into the rest of your page
**Put your least important info (contacts, outside links, site map, related info, etc.) in the bottom left hand corner.  People wont miss it, but they will        have gone through the rest of the page before wandering into that corner.  This prevents the viewer from seeing things they may not be looking for
*Try to draw your viewer through your page at a downward diagonal from the upper left hand corner to the bottom right hand corner.  If this is the way you design your information, your viewer will see that the things in that diagonal first.  Then they will proceed to see any other information you have placed strategically throughout your page
*If you're new to wed design, I'd advise sticking to a custom layout with '''title''' in the upper left, '''tabs''' across the top left (leave space under the logo before you insert your tabs, logo's need room to prosper), '''scroll bar''' down the right side, '''buttons''' are semi 3D (afford clicking, let the user know &quot;hey, I'm clickable, I have more information about this on another page.&quot;  People scan for things that stand out, if something doesn't look clickable, no one will try to click on it)

These are just some basics.  There are far more things to think about before achieving a successful web page, but this is a starting point.

=Constructing the Web Site=
==Get Organized==
==Assembly==
===Web-authoring Programs===
===Site Files===
===Templates===
==Be Search Engine Friendly==
===Title Tags===
The title tag plays an important role in any web page. The text that is placed inside the title tag becomes the name of the page, which can be seen in the browser toolbar. For example, if you are looking at Google's website, the title of the page will simple be &quot;Google.&quot; Titles are helpful because they allow the user to easily see what websites they have open by simple looking at the tabs in their web browser. The title tag also provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites and displays a title for the page in search-engine results.

In HTML, the title tag lives inside the head tag. Similar to all other HTML tags, it is opened with &lt;title&gt; and closed with &lt;/title&gt;. Between the two tags, the creator of the HTML document can place whatever text they think best identifies the web page they are creating. For example, the Google title would be written as &lt;title&gt;Google&lt;/title&gt;.

===Body Tags===
The body tag defines the body of an HTML document. This is where all of the content of an HTML document is placed. This includes text, links, images, tables, lists, and anything else that the page needs. Everything that can be seen when looking at a web page is inside of the body tag.

While the body tag is written in the same manner as all other HTML tags, it almost always is more than one line. For example:
:&lt;body&gt;
:Document content
:&lt;/body&gt;
Each line in the body is usually a single element. For example, one line might be a link and the next line is a picture. Splitting the body in to multiple lines in this way makes writing and editing the HTML much easier because it makes everything easier to see individually. In addition, lines can be indented to make the document even easier to read and edit. For example:
:&lt;body&gt;
::&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
:&lt;/body&gt;
This also helps the creator of the HTML document easily see if all the tags are properly opened and closed. While splitting the HTML into different lines and indenting accordingly is recommended, it is not required.

===ALT Tags===
===META Tags===
The &lt;meta&gt; tag provides metadata, or information, about the HTML page. Some things commonly found in the &lt;meta&gt; tag are the page description, keywords, author, date created, and any other data that the author wishes to be included with the document. While it is never visible on the web page itself, it can be seen and used by computers and search engines. The &lt;meta&gt; tag is always placed in the &lt;head&gt; element of an HTML document. 

Unlike many other tags in HTML, the &lt;meta&gt; tag has no end tag. That is, all of the information included in the tag is placed within the brackets. For example:
:&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;HTML, CSS&quot; /&gt;
In this example, the &lt;meta&gt; tag is telling the browser that the keywords for the HTML document are HTML and CSS. The name and content fields can be any information that the author wants to include. If the author wished to include the date the document was created, he or she could write
:&lt;meta name=&quot;created&quot; content=&quot;3/28/2012&quot; /&gt;
This makes the &lt;meta&gt; tag very valuable when one is creating and organizing multiple HTML documents.

The &lt;meta&gt; tag can also tell browsers to perform certain tasks, such as reload the page. To do this, one would simply write:
:&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;30&quot; /&gt;
This tells the browser to reload the page every 30 seconds. In addition to this, the &lt;meta&gt; tag can also tell the browser how to handle cookies and specify the text direction, and many other things.

This is not a non-fiction book for children. Therefore it is not appropriate for Wikijunior. 1) It is at its core [[WB:NOR|original fiction]]. 2) The parts that are not original fiction are not [[WB:WIWJ|written for children]] to read, but instead are clearly directed at adults. 3) It includes languages other than English. 4) It does not appear to adhere to [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] standards and instead takes the form of a [[WB:SOAP|personal essay]] on morality. 

I hope that a good home can be found for this, but it seems to me that the book is outside of Wikijunior's scope. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:43, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

As well, it was a lot of work to collect all the translations and I believe, that the benefit of this compilation is lost, when it is placed in each different separate language sections. I am against the deletion request. [[User:Rudolf0100|Rudolf0100]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rudolf0100|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;

::The main problem on Wikijunior is that it is a work of fiction (that goes against how Wikibooks are defined) the other issue is that the example story has multiple translations.
::One possible option would be for you to adapt it as a sub gender for merging with [[Creative Writing]] or a standalone book on how to write children's books (and move part of the focus from story telling, that could still be covered, to story writing) an adaptation of the introductory content and the utilization of example story (and future extensions), the translations would still be somewhat of a problem (but it could be integrated as part of the example), doing these subtle alterations on the scope would make it conform to Wikibooks requirements.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:46, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

::{{comment}}Wikijunior is for books for kids to read. Is it possible to change the book so that the discussion section and the author's forward are written for children to read themselves? 
::Wikijunior is in English, but we have sister projects in other languages and the translations could be hosted by those projects. Please remember that a primary focus of Wikibooks and Wikijunior is to collaboratively write books. Versions in languages other than English are unlikely to find contributors here. Having those languages hosted on other language Wikibooks doesn't mean that they cannot be linked directly from here. For the reader, the experience would be little different. 
::The third critical issue for me is that it is a personal essay on morality, and I do not believe that it adheres to [[WB:NPOV]]. I do not know if it can be rewritten to express a neutral point of view (or at least be brought closer).

::Today I noticed the [[Children's Authors]] book (that at this point also doesn't seem to conform to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], note that it was only created in 8 February 2010), given my proposal to reformat/restructure and modify the scope of the work under RFD, this is another project that could be merged together under an instructional book on writing for children.

This doesn't seem educational.  More of a game, really; granted that a game ''can'' be educational, I don't think this one is.  More specifically, it does not appear to be a [[WB:WIWJ|macropedia, textbook, or primer]], nor to fall in the close penumbra of any of those groupings.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:12, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I wouldn't have a problem with a Wikijunior incorporating coloring as part of activities designed to solidify material in a young person's mind.  Like the Kids' Discovers of my past with their activities at the end of the magazine, such a concept could be useful for Wikijunior.  However, this book doesn't have any content that these would be working to reinforce. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:29, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

:{{comment}} I don't see a problem in general with having coloring books in Wikijunior. They are certainly by nature non-fiction. They are also by nature educational. The problem I see with this book is that it is lame. But so far as I understand it we don't delete books just because they are lame.

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I would second any one that supports keeping this book, if it is further developed. I've examined [[Wikibooks:What is Wikijunior]] and this work doesn't go against anything that it stipulates a Wikijunior work should be, just the contrary.
:The main point against coloring books on Wikijunior is that they aren't really fit for the wiki environment, if they don't have any text content. This could be easily fixed by including some form of content with the images even if simple rhymes or poetry, the text in itself doesn't need to be educational, the action of painting the figures does indeed cover that function (see [[w:Coloring book|Coloring book]]).
:That said deleting this work will not be destructive as the images can be preserved. It is up to someone to come forward and attempt to do something out of it, if not I don't see much point on keeping it as it is...
:I'm also of the opinion that the WIWJ policy could be updated by the conclusions extracted from this discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:49, 29 January 2010 (UTC)

::For whatever insight this might offer into the current state of the book:  The book's current content was all created by [[Special:Contributions/Nikola Smolenski|Nikola Smolenski]] on {{nowrap|1 May 2007}}.

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I agree with Xixtas that it's not exactly the most inspiring wikibook, but its intent is educational. The only problem I see is that it's nearly solely an educational ''activity''. On the other hand we do have plenty of similar modules (there's even a book devoted to mathematical problems) and I don't think it harms the project to include this type of content. Being a game is irrelevant for the sake of this discussion. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:45, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I don't see this project going anywhere without some active support (probably a little of promotion on Wikimedia Commons. Anyone active there ?). Creating some background text could also be interesting...

: {{keep}} My main issue with the book is that it's currently a set of unorganized images.  It could be converted so that there's a set of themed images (e.g. color stuff red, then orange, etc), and later with a bit more free-style images. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 22:24, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

I've exported this page, and I'm getting it ready for [http://strategywiki.org/ StrategyWiki]. Based on the book content, it's a strategy guide for a video game, which isn't suitable on this site.   Some of the pages won't survive the transwiki, since they aren't suitable for StrategyWiki either.  The best case is that there may be a mathematical importance to the game, but it's not at that level of quality and would require someone to salvage it. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:04, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

:: The distinction meant to be be made by policy WB:GUIDE, as I understand it, is between a scholarly book about a video game and a ''walkthrough'' of a video game &amp;mdash; the latter being the intended target of WB:GUIDE, so I gather based on the discussions that led to that policy.  See especially [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_33#Conclusions|here]].  Looking over this book, it seems to me to be very clearly a walkthrough, and therefore exactly within the intended target of WB:GUIDE.  The Rubik's books seem to me to be scholarly in character, so that they would not be walkthroughs even if Rubik's Cube were an exclusively virtual-reality game.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:25, 12 February 2010 (UTC)
:::That said, Minesweeper the game is very much a logic puzzle except for the very few stages where one must guess, and could be discussed as a scholarly work of logic. The fact that this is not done, but instead we are simply given patterns to memorize, is what takes it out of the scholarly category, in my opinion.

:Transwiki completed - [[StrategyWiki:Minesweeper]]. One of the pages didn't survive (it amounted to &quot;try playing a self-imposed challenge&quot;), and a few others got renamed to the standards on that wiki.  For those that feel the Wikibook could be kept, there appears to be some historical and analytical information shown on the wikipedia page, which could be academic enough if the book is worked on.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 22:21, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

I am new here and I don't know any of the policies to explain why this should be deleted.  But, here is why I think it should be deleted.  It has nothing except a few chapter titles and some red links, no content whatsoever.  And, the chapter titles that are given are all things already covered in the book [[Topology]]. And, it looks like the guy who created it created it over 3 years ago and hasn't touched it since. So, I can't think of a single reason to keep this page.

::Actually, according to the policies and guidelines, &quot;Absence of meaningful content includes Abandoned pages displaying intent, but no actual content.&quot;  I would not consider a few chapter titles, likely copied from the one textbook listed as a reference, to be actual content.  So, that is another valid concern.  In fact, this is exactly my other argument.  Someone came along with an intent to start a book over 3 years ago and then &quot;abandoned&quot; the idea and did nothing as far as actual content.  This is an important point as I will likely be nominating several other math books for deletion as I went through every single book last night and found many that have no meaningful content.  Please correct me if I am wrong but I don't see any meaningful content in this book, even if it didn't overlap with Topology.

::::Well, I'd like to talk about this to understand better.  My thoughts: A bunch of crappy books among the good ones makes it harder to find the good ones.  So, if they have no content except chapter titles and haven't been found worthy to be added to for several years, they are more trouble than good.  I don't have tons of time to devote to this, but I looked through all the books in the Mathematics subject last night.  Beside this one, I found 7 books that have basically nothing in them.  On top of that, there are many other books which have very little and should be merged with another book that is already farther along.  All this makes things sloppy and harder to use.

::::Any way, more importantly, Swift told me to read the policies and guidelines and I did and they point to deleting such things.  I copied from it above.  This is exactly an abandoned page displaying intent, but no actual content (chapter titles are not content).

{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''&amp;mdash;consensus for deletion.  Given amount of discussion modification to project policies may warrant discussion. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:47, 3 March 2010 (UTC)}}
I think this is the second speedy delete nomination I've seen for a user page on the grounds that it is spam. Personally, it doesn't really bother me that people put links to their companies on their user pages. In fact, I don't really care much what people do with their user pages as long as they aren't being used as private hosting and don't affect the content of books.

The reason is that deciding what is spam and what is a personal description will always be a problem. User pages are personal by nature and imposing some policy that user pages must only contain content relevant to the user's work on Wikibooks is, I think, counter-productive. Compare, for example, [[User:Swift|my user page]] with [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]], [[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] or [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]'s: Theirs are evidently more personal, more interesting and give fellow Wikibookians a good idea who they are. Mine is just dull.

In this case, no modules link to the user-page (so it isn't spamming anything) and the page mentions a website (and thus is not using Wikibooks for hosting). I therefore say we [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' this user page. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:13, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''speedy delete''' It's been deleted twice before by myself and QuiteUnusual.  Speedy the third time added by global rollbacker and small wiki monitoring team member Wutsje.  This user has only registered to promote their website and it's not about whether anything links to their page.  Links from high profile sites like Wikimedia sites to other websites are designed to increase Google Pagerank and that only counts external links from a website, not internal links to where the link is located.  While there are no functional links on this user page, is this what you really want to promote on Wikibooks?  While I'm all for personal freedom to work with one's own user page, this is a spammer. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:22, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
:: As you note, the page doesn't actually contain any links and thus doesn't help with search engine ranking. Were this a persistent problem, I could see the need to clarify what is acceptable and what isn't.
:: &quot;''is this what you really want to promote on Wikibooks?''&quot; No, but that's largely beside the point. What matters is that it's harmless. I similarly don't care about links to open-source online roleplaying games. Demanding that links be taken down, whether site-wide or just on pages of Wikibookians not deemend committed enough ''is'' harmful. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:15, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I don't think we need to be as tolerant of a business advertising their products as we might be of an individual acting in a personal capacity. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 17:47, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' The user account is only being used to maintain the user page.  It's either webhosting (Wikibooks is being used as free host for an advertisement) or spam; I don't see any third way to look at it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:42, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''&lt;/s&gt; This is the personal user space, unless it was offensive/abusive, a copyright violation or used to display the personal data of others, it is out of our bounds to act, we shouldn't make the deletion a personal and discriminative action and bring them to RFD, this can be extremely distressing to the target and depending on the reasons create and promote instability on the general community. The community has better things to do than policy Wikibookians personal opinions, tastes or preferences, this can lead down a slippery slope, even into legal actions and problems to Wikimedia, if some limits are to be set on what is acceptable on the &quot;private&quot;/personal userspace it has to be done by a policy or guideline.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:35, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

::[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Also, the user name is the name of the company. That is forbidden on Wikipedia (see [[W:WP:CORPNAME]]), and I would have expected the same policy here. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:59, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

:::I don't think we can copy paste that policy here, the project goals are different, for instance we have people working under foundations and recently a law firm started contributing content, some protection should be in place but a total prohibition will be hard to defend if we wish institutions and enterprises to donate or create useful free content here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:20, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

::::According to [[Using Wikibooks]] the use of '''promotional usernames''' is against Wikibooks policy already. see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Using_Wikibooks/Setting_Up_A_User_Account&amp;oldid=1607531#Username_Policy Username Policy] [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 10:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

::::Even if Using Wikibooks on promotional usernames is not official policy, it seems like good sense. If someone contributes using a company name, how do we know they have been properly authorised and are not just an employee being more generous than they should be? If I claimed to represent a company, how would that be verified and recorded? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 13:27, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::The same way we verify copyright. A similar action is done with trademarks...
:::::All these are not only restricted to usernames but also booknames, etc...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:36, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::I thought copyright and trademark verification was a process of deleting submitted material which is published under a conflicting licence. What we are talking about here is a way of overriding that presumption to delete by saying company names or copyrighted material can be used here if the right person has given us permission. In the case of your law company for example, who gave and received that permission? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:20, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::::For what I gather from the user posts, he is doing contributions in accordance to a decision by the firm. Since I presume he is doing it on their behalf, the contributions may constitute [[w:Work for hire|work for hire]], disregarding other considerations and in relation to what we have been debating, it wouldn't be abusive if the firm registered an account specifically for those types of contributions, these would make thing clearer not only for administrators but even for readers that could better understand and check the motivations and permit recognition for the work done. This would also permit some sort of promotion of the firm on that account userpage. I don't see this as something bad if the work done is productive, it could even lead in the future to sponsored work on Wikibooks with full transparency and due recognition. This could be problematic on WIkipedia but it is feasible on Wikibooks, in fact I'm aware of at least one book that documents a commercial product (VoIP) that has been mostly done by someone working on that firm (I even have corrected a minor issue of NPOV violation with that user)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:39, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::::There is no work being done, productive or otherwise.  The account is being used ''solely'' for the purpose of advertising a commercial ebook site ({{nowrap|See: [[Special:Contributions/Indiaebooks]]}}).  Its relationship with Wikibooks is purely parasitic, not symbiotic, leeching off Wikibooks without any attempt whatsoever to provide any benefit to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:05, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::Yes [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]], we are discussing the general cases not this specific one. I did change my vote and in general agree with you but you are making too many assumptions and expecting the worst from the user. You also seem to miss some points, there is no leeching off Wikibooks (well, space and now the time we are discussing the issue) in fact it would be within reason that this or similar accounts would be interested in donating to Wikimedia or even evolve in some sort of paid advertising, we have to understand that due to the lack of activity the number of Wikibookians that would visit that userpage is very low, mostly it would affect in site seaches that included the userspace, in any case during this discussion I think we have come to see that it isn't really doing harm to the project ([[User:Swift|Swift]] position above, is valid) it just isn't morally right and abuses the &quot;spirit&quot; of the project, but we can't generalize it, had the user done contributions I would be more worried in keeping it going that in escalating the situation because of that page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:29, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::::::General policy needs to be able to handle specific cases.
::::::::::I submit that page User:Indiaebooks is in fact doing harm to the project, and I stand by my term ''leeching''.  Here is what I read off the page now (disregarding the rfd tag):
:::::::::::User:Indiaebooks
:::::::::::From Wikibooks, the open-content textbooks collection
:::::::::::indiaebooks.com was founded in June 2006 by Esource Software Solution Pvt.Ltd. [...]
::::::::::That sounds like Wikibooks is endorsing Indiaebooks.  Which is damaging to the reputation of Wikibooks.  It is essentially a sort of spoofing &amp;mdash; and an especially virulent sort of violation of [[WB:SOAP]].  Any general policy worth its salt should come with bounds that keep this clearly unacceptable.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:09, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::::I agree with that in general terms, but I wouldn't call a userpage a Wikibooks project endorsement at best it is an endorsement by a particular user. This has lead us again to what we already discussed about permitting some freedom of expression, I don't see any issue in a user expressing political views or preferences on his user page (respecting civility and personal attack rules), like Free Tibet etc the line must be drawn on reducing the use of Wikibooks &quot;only&quot; as a vehicle to promote those messages and I believe we can came up with some limitations, for example based on number useful edits ...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:23, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::Returning to the issue of corporate user names, Panic, I see you have not identified any corporations making positive contributions. The main guy contributing to the VOIP book [[MagicJack]] uses the name Az2008 and does not appear to claim any connection with the company. I think it would be safer to start with a general presumption against corporate names but make exceptions for special cases with positive identity verification. They could be required to advertise their contribution to Wikibooks on their own company web site for example. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:42, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

::Again this is hard to define when in the personal space. In my userspace I mention brands and several Wikibookians do also even linking to educational institutions all that would fall under the definition of advertising, we could define a policy banning blatant endorsement of commercial ventures but even that can be problematic and hard to define.
::I remember a post by Jimbo (not that it should be a deciding view point) advancing the idea of utilizing the userspace as a blogs, all this makes defining a line of what is acceptable on the user space extremely difficult.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:27, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Some people do take a strict view of user pages, in that they have to be relevant to Wikibooks work.  When I imported a bunch of [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|userboxes]] in the past, I did receive a remark denouncing them as not being directly related to the task of creating textbooks and therefore pointless to have on user pages.  [[WB:SOAP]] and [[WB:HOST]] are pretty clear and don't make a distinction based on namespace.  Where does it say user space gets a free pass?  I personally would expect a user page to describe a user, not to be used to circumvent policy that would apply were the content in any other location. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:13, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

::::That is the same in several other Wikimedia projects (I did a search to find the Jimbo post and there seems to be in general no consensus), I also note that Jimbo Wales was one of the editors of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].
::::Interestingly that policy does cover Wikibooks modules (and is named &quot;what is&quot;), but if you read the section fully you see the mention of essays and we clearly promote the creation of those in userspace, basically the text is badly written at points it mixes the project and the Wikibooks themselves, this makes [[WB:SOAP]] and [[WB:HOST]] not applicable on userspace or at least opened to valid challenge if the &quot;violation&quot; is within reason.
::::The closest project to Wikibooks is Wikisource. For policies/guidelines and practices we should look there first.   
::::I do agree with you that the userpage (the root of the userspace) has a very specific function and limits should be imposed for it to continue to serve a standard purpose, this is expected by the users.
::::Regarding standardization of format, I'm strongly opposed to it, people should be free to express themselves as they wish (within civilized constrain that we already have as policies). In your case you decided to comply or agreed with the points presented to you, fine but that wasn't the only possible outcome.
::::I'm willing to change my vote since the user in question hasn't decided to defend his content and it is clearly abusive of the function of the userpage, taking in consideration also the level of involvement he had with the project. I think I made the necessary points to prevent this RFD to serve as a base to future similar deletions.
::::In any case don't you agree that this issues should be clearly defined in a policy or guideline and not be dependent of personal viewpoints and chance ?
::::We should start by reexamining [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and debating a section about userspace to be included there or as stand alone guideline.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:36, 17 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::As a start, I propose we formally adopt the username policy in Using Wikibooks. see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Using_Wikibooks/Setting_Up_A_User_Account&amp;oldid=1607531#Username_Policy Username Policy] [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:20, 17 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::I see that there is a rejected policy [[Wikibooks:No_offensive_usernames]], so relevant parts of the Using Wikibooks page are presumably not acceptable, even if they had been presented to new users for the past 2 years as the Username policy. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:42, 19 February 2010 (UTC)
::::::That was only rejected in favor of [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] instead. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:27, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
All Sinitic languages and dialects, including Cantonese are written with Hànzì (Mandarin)/Honji (Cantonese), a picture-like writing system.  However, many English-speaking students learn to pronounce Cantonese using a Romanization system, usually either the Yale Romanization or Jyutping. See below for some examples.

'''So how do characters work?  Does Chinese have an alphabet?'''
No, Chinese does not have an '''alphabet'''. They do use radicals, which will be explained below.  '''Character'''s however, are written with strokes, or different lines. There are three main types of characters: pictographic, ideographic, and picto-phonetic.  Pictographic characters are just what they sound like, they try to represent a thing or action as a picture.  For example, the character for sun (yat) was originally a circle with a dot in the center, an attempt to draw a sun. The modern character is a vertical rectangle divided in half by a horizontal line.  It is a 4 stroke character. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|alphabet|all the letters of a language.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|character|a letter, number, or punctuation mark.}}

Ideographic characters are used for things that are a bit more difficult to describe than with just a drawing.  Love, hate, anger, happiness, goodness — all of these are very hard to capture in a simple picture.  Ideographic characters try to address this problem by combining different pictures to convey meaning.  Going back to the goodness example, the Chinese character for goodness, “hǎo”, is depicted using two separate characters, a woman and a child, combined into one character.

Picto-phonetic characters combine a meaning radical which hints at the meaning of a character with a sound radical which hints at the pronunciation of the character. &quot;Grass&quot; for example is written as the character for &quot;early&quot; (which similar to the word for &quot;grass&quot; in Mandarin and Cantonese) with a radical meaning &quot;grass&quot; above it. A reader can look at the grass radical and guess or recall the meaning while looking at the sound radical and guess or recall how it is pronounced.

Radicals are the closest thing that Chinese has to what English speakers would call an alphabet.  Radicals, like an alphabet, allow speakers to reuse portions of the language.  And since Chinese has some 10,000 plus characters in usage, radicals become very useful to allow for fast memorization of a character.  Characters will get some of their meaning and/or sound from a radical (like picto-phonetic characters).  You can imagine radicals as a foundation, or base, of the Chinese written language.  

Radicals are kind of like the different symbols used in public signs. A &quot;no smoking sign&quot; is a cigarette that has been crossed out, a &quot;no dogs allowed&quot; sign has a dog that has been crossed out. We can reuse the meaning of the crossed out symbol to create new signs and guess at the meaning of new signs we have never seen before.  In the same way Chinese characters that  have to do with children may have the radical for &quot;child&quot; in them, and characters that have to do with actions or things done with the hand may have the radical for &quot;hand&quot; while the rest of the character hints at the pronunciation.

'''Are there different ways of writing Chinese?'''
Yes, there are two main ways of writing Chinese, simplified and traditional.  Simplified was invented by the PRC (People’s Republic of China) to increase literacy, or reading levels in China.  Traditional is as you can guess, the “traditional” way of writing Chinese.  It is used in places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.  It is also used in traditional texts, paintings, genealogical charts, food packaging, and more!  If you want to live in China, it is handy to know both simplified and traditional, as you are likely to run across both forms. Because most written vernacular Cantonese occurs in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese learners will most likely come across traditional characters more frequently.

==How many people speak this language?==
Cantonese is spoken by between 70 million to 80 million people around the world. This number includes all dialects of Cantonese (Yue Chinese dialects). There are also many other closely related Chinese languages, sometimes called dialects (though each of these has their own different dialects), such as Minnan (including Taiwanese), Wu (including Shanghainese), Hakka, and Mandarin. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|dialect|one form of a language; sometimes different regions of a country develop slightly different forms of a language, called dialects.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
Cantonese is mostly spoken is the People's Republic of China, particularly Guangdong province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong, and Macau.  It is also spoken around the world in Chinese communities where people from Cantonese-speaking regions have settled, including Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Cantonese is used as an official language and in government, media, and education in Hong Kong and Macau.

==What is the history of this language?==

China has a history of five thousand years of continuous civilization, so it is probable that the oldest form of the Chinese language is at least as old as this. Archeologists have found Chinese pictographic writing on pottery, bones and turtle shells from as long ago as the Shang dynasty, over 3000 years ago. By the time of the Qin dynasty, 2000 years ago, Chinese writing had been standardized and it has changed very little since then. 

Because Chinese is not an alphabetic language, it is hard to know exactly what the language sounded like in the distant past, but linguistic scholars have been able to reconstruct models of the language of this time, which indicate that modern Chinese languages sound very different from Old Chinese.

In the year 226, the Guang province was formed in the modern Guangdong and Guangxi territories. Over time, more and more Han Chinese migrated southwards towards this province, bringing the Middle Chinese language with them. During the Tang Dynasty, Guangdong and Guangxi formed the Lingnan Circuit, which was eventually split into a &quot;west&quot; (Xi) and &quot;east&quot; (Dong), giving the modern Guangxi and Guangdong. Middle Chinese became the foundation for the Cantonese language, which also absorbed some influences from the Zhuang language (a language related to modern Thai). 

Ancient Chinese dictionaries such as the Guangyun preserve the sounds of Late Middle Chinese, which linguists confirm to be very close to modern-day Cantonese and Hakka (another Chinese language closely related to Cantonese).

The first appearance of written vernacular Cantonese occurred during the Ming Dynasty. Written Cantonese has continued to be used sporadically right up until the present. Nowadays, it is popular in Hong Kong and used mostly in informal contexts, such as advertisements, tabloids and other media, and online messaging. There is also literature written in Cantonese, mostly having to do with daily situations of Hong Kong people.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

As all Chinese languages share a common literary tradition and past, due to the ability of the Chinese script to be read by speakers of any Sinitic language or dialect, the below poets and authors belong to all of the Chinese languages. Indeed, it is well known that poetry of the Tang dynasty often rhymes better when read in southern Chinese languages, such as Cantonese, Minnan, or Hakka.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biographical Information ==

Rick Walton was born 1957, in Provo, Utah. He received his bachelor's degree in Spanish from Brigham Young University in 1980 and his master's degree in 1999. 

Walton is the author of over sixty books for children. His works include joke books, picture books, a collection of poetry, activity books, mini-mysteries, and educational software. He loves to read, travel, play the guitar, study foreign languages, and write. Rick was raised in Utah, and lives in Provo, Utah with his wife Ann, and their five children. Ann is a computer programmer having worked for IBM, Novell, and WordPerfect, and now works with Rick maintaining his web site www.rickwalton.com. 

Rick says, “I became a children’s writer because after trying almost every other career in the book I realized that writing for kids was one of the few things that I both enjoyed and I was good at”. Rick’s books have been featured on the IRA Children’s Choice list, on Reading Rainbow, and on CBS This Morning. 

Rick claims the authors who have shaped his writing are: Jon Scieszka, Daniel Pinkwater, Roald Dahl, Dave Barry, Woody Allen, Monty Python, Robert Sheckley, Lemony Snicket, Robert Benchley, and others. Rick collects humor and comic strips. He claims his favorite authors are anyone who is “really funny”.

In 2005, just before Thanksgiving, Rick and Ann’s then four year-old son was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes. Less than a month later Rick was diagnosed with Parkinson’ disease. Rick and his wife are advocates of finding a cure and strongly support The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International.

More information can be found on Rick and his writings on his website.

== Books of Interest ==

'''''There Once Was a Bullfrog''''' plays on compound words.  The Bullfrog has lost his hop and doesn’t know where it is.  He spends the whole book looking for it.  He looks under a toad, then the page is turned to see it was a toadstool.  He looks by the dog, then the page is turned to see a doghouse.  He looks by the cow, then the page is turned to see a cowboy.  He finally finds his hop, but after all the looking he is now hungry.  Every page is a surprise.  The illustrations are done by Greg Hally.

'''''Why the Banana Split''''' is a fun western story about T-Rex dinosaur who comes to town.  The townspeople are petrified and flee.  Then the play on words such as the jump rope skips town, the train made tracks, and of course the banana splits.  Rex explains he just eats fruit, so everyone comes back…all except the bananas (being fruit).  The pictures explain the play on words.  The illustrations are done by Jimmy Holder.

The inside cover of '''''How Can You Dance''''' is inviting, showing a conga line of animals dancing across the page.  It is a great book for younger children who have the wiggles because it tells the reader different ways to move.  It is a rhyming story in black and red text.  The red text is part of the story, but tells readers how to move.  The illustrator, Ana Lopez-Escriva, uses acrylics to make brightly colored pictures.

In '''''Bertie Was a Watchdog''''' a watchdog is alone in the house at night.  He’s called a watchdog because he is tiny—the size of a wristwatch.  A burglar comes into the house and laughs about how ineffective and small he is.  The dog eventually turns the tables on the burglar by getting him to bark, then bark louder, until the police hear the barking and come to arrest the burglar.  The watchdog is given a medal.  The illustrator, Arthur Robins, used watercolor and ink.

'''''Bunnies On the Go''''' is a rhyming book about a rabbit family who packs and goes on vacation.  Readers are able to guess the mode of transportation because it’s the last word that fits in the rhyme.  Then the page is turned to see if they are correct.  The various modes of transportation are by car, train, wagon, tractor, hot-air balloon, boat, bikes, truck, bus, ferry, cab, plane, and then home.  Beautifully colored full illustrations are done by Paige Miglio.

In '''''A Very Hairy Scary Story''''', young Sarah leaves Ann’s house to go home in the dark night.  As she walks home, she encounters giant, scary monsters:  spider, bat, skunk, bear, ape, and lion.  The reader doesn’t know what she will run into until the page is turned.  She comes across her dad who takes her the rest of the way home.  Sarah realizes she left her friend’s house too late and won’t do that again.  The illustrations are done in pen &amp; ink and watercolors by David Clark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''

• Statistics is the applied branch of mathematics especially appropriate for a variety of research analysis

'''Descriptive Statistics'''

• Descriptive statistis are used to summarize data under study. Some descriptive statistics summarize the distribution of attributes on a single variable; others summarize the associations between variables. 

• Descriptive statistics summarizing the relationships between variables are called measures of association.

• Many measures of association are based on a proportionate reduction of error (PRE) model. This model is based on a comparison of 1. the numbers of errors we would make in attempting to guess the attributes of a given variable for each of the cases under study - if we knew nothing but the distribution of attributes on that variable - and 2. the number of errors we would make if we knew the joint distribution overall and were told for each case the attribute o one variable each time we were asked to guess the attribute of the other. These measures include ''lambda'', which is appropriate for the analysis of two nominal variables; ''gamma'', which is appropriate for the analysis of two ordinal variables; and ''Pearson's product-moment correlation'', which is appropriate for the analysis of two interval or ratio variables.

• ''Regression analysis'' represents the relationships between variables in the form of equations, which can be used to predict the values of a dependent variable on the basis of values of one or more independent variables 

• Regression equations are computed on the basis of a regression line: the geometric line representing, with the least amount of discrepancy, the actual location of points in a scattergram.

• Types of regression analysis include linear regression analysis, multiple regression analysis, partial regression analysis, and curvilinear regression analysis.

'''Inferential Statistics'''

• Inferential statistics are used to estimate the generalizability of findings arrived at through the analysis of a sampling to the larger population from which the sample has been selected. Some inferential statistics estimate the single-variable characteristics of the population; others - tests of statistical significance - estimate the relationships between variables in the population.

• Inferences about some characteristic of population must indicate a confidence interval and a confidence level. Computations of confidence levels and intervals are based on a probability theory and assume that conventional probability-sampling techniques have been employed in the study.

• Inferences about the generalizability, to a population, of the associations discovered between variables in a sample involve tests of statistical significance, which estimate the likelihood that an association as large as the observed one could result from normal sampling error if no such association exists between the variables in the larger population. Tests of statistical significance are also based on probability theory and assume that conventional probability-sampling techniques have been employed in the study.

• The level of significance of an observed association is reported in the form of the probability that the association could have been produced merely by sampling error. To say that an association is significant at the .05 level is to say that an association is large as the observed one could not be expected o result from sampling error more than 5 times our of 100.

• Social researchers tend to use a particular set of levels of significance in connection with tests of statistical significance: .05, .01 and .001. This is merely a convention, however.

•A frequently used test of statistical significance in tabular data is chi-sqaure.

• The ''t-test'' is a frequently used test of statistical significance for comparing means.

• Statistical significance must not be confused with substantial significance, the latter meaning that an observed association is strong, important, meaningful, or worth writing home to your mother about.

• Tests of statistical significance, strictly speaking, make assumptions about data and methods that are almost never satisfied completely by real social research. Despite this, the tests can serve a useful function in the analysis and interpretation of data.

'''Other Multivariate Techniques'''

• ''Path analysis'' is a method of presenting graphically the networks of causal relationships among several variables. It illustrates the primary &quot;paths&quot; of variables through which independent variables cause dependent ones. Path coefficients that represent the partial relationships between variables.

• ''Time-series analysis'' is an analysis of changes in a variable (such as crime rates) over time. 

• ''Factor analysis'', feasible only with a computer, is an analytic method of discovering the general dimensions represented by a collection of actual variables. These general dimensions, or factors, are calculated hypothetical dimensions that are not perfectly represented by any of the empirical variables under study but are highly associated with groups of empirical variables. A factor loading indicates the degree of association between a given empirical variable and a given factor. 

• ''Analysis of variance'' (ANOVA) is based on comparing variations between and within groups and determining whether between-group differences could reasonably have occurred in simple random sampling or whether they likely represent a genuine relationship between the variables involved. 

• ''Discriminant analysis'' seeks to account for variation in some dependent variable. It results in an equation that scored people on the basis of that hypothetical dimensions and allows us to predict their values on the dependent variable.

• ''Log-linear models'' offer a method for analyzing complex relationships among several nominal variables having more than two attributes each. 

• ''Geographic Information Systems'' (GIS) map quantitative data that describe geographic unites for a graphic display.

'''Key Terms''' that are important for understanding statistical analyses.

• Analysis of variance (ANOVA): Method of analysis in which cases under study are combined into groups representing an independent variable, and the extent to which the groups differ from from one another is analyzed in terms of some dependent variable. Then, the extent to which the groups differ is compared with the standard of random distribution. 

• Curvilinear regression analysis: A form of regression analysis that allows relationships among variables to be expressed with curved geometric lines instead of straight ones.

• Descriptive statistics: Statistical computation describing either the characteristics of a sample or the relationship among variables in a sample. Descriptive statistics merely summarize a set of sample observations, whereas inferential statistics move beyond the description of specific observations to make inferences about the larger population from which the sample observations were drawn.

• Discriminant analysis: Method of analysis similar to multiple regression, except that dependent variable can be nominal. 

• Factor analysis: A complex algebraic method for determining the general dimensions or factors that exist within a set of concrete observations.

• Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Analytic technique in which researchers map quantitative data that describe geographic units in a graphic display. 

• Inferential statistics: The body of statistical computations relevant to making inferences from findings based on sample observations to some larger populations.

• Level of significance: In the context of tests of statistical significance, the degree of likelihood that an observed, empirical relationship could be attributable to sample error. A relationship is significant at the .05 level if the likelihood of its being only a function of sampling error is no greater than 5 out of 100.

• Linear regression analysis: A form of statistical analysis that seeks the equation for the straight line that best describes the relationship between two ratio variables.

• Log-linear analysis: Data-analysis technique based on specifying models that describe the interrelationships among variables and then comparing expected and observed table-cell frequencies. 

• Multiple regression analysis: A form of statistical analysis that seeks the equation representing the impact of two or more independent variables on a single dependent variable.

• Nonsampling error: Those imperfections of data quality that are a result of factors other than sampling error. Exampling include misunderstandings of questions by respondents, erroneous recordings by interviewers and coders, and keypunch errors.

• Partial regression analysis: A form of regression analysis in which the effects of one or more variables are held constant, similar to the logic of the elaboration model.

• Path analysis: A form of multivariate analysis in which the causal relationships among variables are presented in a graphic format.

• Proportionate reduction of error (PRE): A logical model for assessing the strength of a relationship by asking how much knowing values on one variable would reduce our errors in guessing values on the other. For example, if we know how much education people have, we can improve our ability to estimate how much they earn, thus indicating there is a relationship between the two variables.

• Regression analysis: A method of data analysis in which the relationships among variables are represented in the form of an equation, called a regression equation.

• Statistical significance: A general term referring to the likelihood that relationships observed in a sample could be attributed to sampling error alone. 

• Tests of statistical significance: A class of statistical computations that indicate the likelihood that the relationship observed between variables in a sample can be attributed to sampling error only.

• Time-series analysis: An analysis of changes in a variable (such as crime rates) over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==

The &quot;nadir&quot; of race relations in the United States was an ideological era of nationwide hostility by whites against blacks. Racism was so pervasive and, in many cases, so violent that many African Americans realized that they could not influence racists to change their views. Many came to believe that only whites had the power to destroy white supremacy and the racist economic, political, cultural and social networks that supported it. Historians still debate when the nadir took place, although the peak period of lynchings of blacks, ranging from about the late 1880s to just after World War I, is often cited. Others divide the nadir into periods: '''The True Nadir''' (1889-1923), and the '''Post-Nadir Period''' (1923-1941). During this period, the popular and academic understandings of the histories US slavery, the Civil War (&quot;The War Between the States&quot;), and Reconstruction supported a Confederate/pro-slavery southern white point of view that argued African-American demands for justice were ill-informed and illegitimate since the competition between blacks and whites over resources and power was a zero sum game. By this erroneous view, many white Americans around the nation and in the US held territories overseas supported legal and customary rules of segregation known colloquially as &quot;Jim Crow,&quot; especially in the mid-west, middle states and south.

== Clouds of Racism ==

The Nadir originated during the time of Reconstruction. The Reconstruction, as discussed before in Chapter 3 of the previous unit, constituted problems for both ex-Confederates and newly-freed Blacks. Congress was split over the ordeal. Senators in southern states issued discriminatory statutes known as &quot;Black Codes&quot;, which attempted to hinder the emancipation movement started by Black and White abolitionists, and Radical Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studyworld.com/newsite/reportessay/socialissues/Racial%5CRacism_and_Reconstruction.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Race riots broke out throughout the south. Whites killed at least one African-American servicemen per day in Mississippi. In 1868, around 1,080 persons were murdered in Louisiana alone.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James. &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot;. 2007. Second edition. p. 158-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race Riots ==

In most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacked by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans’ involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury’s wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left 12 blacks dead and seventy injured.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resource Allocation==

Economic systems form an example of a resource allocation system,; we allocate the rocks in the ground and the crops in the filed to production facilities that produce the goods we desire. Our current socioeconomic systems, however, has a liner nature to it. We retrieve the rocks in the ground and harvest the crops, produce goods which go out for consumption and then we dispose of them. We throw them away.

Out current system does have some recycling but the liner production / disposal mode of operation forms the dominate characteristic. Such a mode of operation forms the characteristic of a n unsustainable system. Any physical system, such as our current socioeconomic system, that consumes a finite physical resource collapse as the resources that it depends on run out and we depend on so many finite resources, from cooper to oil to land, that we consume as if they would last for ever.

This constant need for production forms one of the main characteristics of our current system. We need to produce to keep people employed, to keep the money flow work and to keep the economy growing. Yet, as we do so, we dig our own graves. Our system has a number of ways to maintain constant production from fashion to built in obsolescence.   

A sustainable system has a different characteristic; a cyclic nature. In a such a system resource acquisition leads to production then to consumption and then, rather than dispose, to recycling where we use the recycled goods as resource to start the cycle all over again. In addition to the cyclic nature, a sustainable system also aim to maximise the life expectancy of an item. In such a system we would try and make sure that any item produced stays in the system as long as possible so such a system minimises production. Both such characterises of a sustainable system stand in opposition to our current system. Any attempt to make our current system sustainable with our minimising production and making the system cyclic fails to address the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mishpatim – Sentences/Judgements     Shemot/Exodus Chapters 21 - 24
Isaiah 28:9-13;  Matthew 12:38-39;  John 10:27-28

This Torah lesson is Yahweh’s basis for establishing a pathway to Holiness for His people Yisrael.  Torah is a document which teaches, both by instruction and example, how a redeemed person is to live in a redeemed community.  It is in short, Yahweh’s manual of life.  Due to the inclination of men’s hearts, Yahweh establishes these edicts for our daily living to protect us from ourselves.  Yahweh’s intent was to create a nation of righteous people and by so doing, they would spread His edicts for the way-of-life to all men that they encountered.  As we read this week’s lesson, we quickly realize that Yahweh establishes these measures to protect the innocent, the poor, and those in society who do not have a voice to be heard.  He champions the cause of each to ensure their safety and their place within the nation of Yisrael.  The basis of the Mishpatim were not to limit Yisrael’s civil liberties, but to ensure the freedom of all.  We must follow the leading angel Yeshua to receive this truth, for where the Ruach haKodesh dwells, there is liberty. 

In last week’s message of Yisro, the Ten Commandments were given.  These commandments were seeds for nurturing growth of a holy lifestyle unto Yahweh.  These seeds were planted as an everlasting affirmation of our relationship unto Him from season to season and from year to year throughout our generations.  Holiness was to be indivisible for the nation of Yisrael.  It was biblically impossible to separate Holiness from Yisrael as a nation.  The government was predicated upon the Word of Yahweh.  It was the world’s first true theocracy based upon the Word of Yahweh. 

The Hebrew word mishpat actually means sentence. The plural form of the word mishpat in Hebrew is mishpatim, which means sentences.   Its secondary meaning is that of a court judgment of what punishment is to be inflicted, on a convicted person, formally after deliberation.

These laws are also a guide to keeping the testimony of the One they represented.   If they were His people, they were to reflect His likeness.    They were called to be a holy nation, to be a people that would be in His image and likeness according to the original creation.  (Exodus 19: 6;  Genesis 1:26)
When Yahweh called Abraham, He said to him,  &quot;Walk before Me and be blameless&quot;  (Gen. 17: 1)  As the head of a nation, he was called to holiness by keeping all of His commandments and principles, which he did.   (Genesis 26: 5)
In that, he was a testimony to all around of the One whom he served and he saved many souls. Both in Haran and in Canaan, Abraham gathered many into his household for the kingdom.

We also are called to reflect the light of His presence within and shine as lights in the world.    The life of Yeshua Who is the &quot;brightness of His (the Father's) glory and the very image of His person&quot;,  should radiate from us, being seen by the good works of righteousness which we do for His Name's sake.   (Matthew 5:16)
In keeping His precepts we become a walking testimony of His life within us and demonstrate that we also are the children of Abraham, walking in the commandments and precepts of the Almighty.

This lifestyle did not save them. This lifestyle served to prepare them to meet the true &quot;Teacher&quot;,  the Messiah, as they reached the age of accountability.  In this way, the New Covenant teaches that the Torah acted as a custodian, or a &quot;schoolmaster&quot; (read Galatians 3:24-25).  Once we reached the age where a conscious decision could be made, the Torah should have presented us with the proper framework to make the right decision: trusting faithfulness in Yahweh, as demonstrated through our dependency in His provision in His Son Yeshua the Messiah! 

This faithful lifestyle is magnificently portrayed in the covenants that the people had experienced thus far. 


The Promise of His Presence

&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish, but he that keeps Torah happy is he.&quot;   Proverbs/Mishle 29:18

The vision of their inheritance and the promises relating to it were dependant upon them keeping Torah.  

In their keeping of the covenant He says that His Presence will go with them to keep them in the way and to bring them to the place which He had prepared for them.  &quot;Behold! I send an angel before you to protect you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have made ready.&quot; (23:20)

Yahweh had said to them in Ch 19:5  &quot;Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice, and keep My brit (covenant), then you shall be My own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine;&quot;

Yahweh will be sending His special Angel with Yisrael to first “keep” them by the way (from the Hebrew root word “shamar” which can mean to restrict within certain boundaries)  and second, to bring them into the place He prepared for them.  Then they are told to pay attention to this Angel (in Hebrew the word Mal’ach – Angel also can be translated as Messenger), to listen to His voice (kol), not to provoke Him for He will not pardon their disobedience. Why?  - Because Yahweh’s Name is in Him.   The word 'voice' (kol) as used in the Hebrew is idiomatic for obedience.  But more than that, the word kol is also idiomatic for the Word (Memra in the Aramaic Onkelos Targum).  
 
The voice of God is the Word of God!   

This Angel will keep the bnei Yisrael within certain boundaries while they are on their way by His voice (kol) or by His Word.  Therefore, what is being said here is that the Word of this Angel will be the boundaries bnei Yisrael will be restricted to! 

We know that angels normally are sent as ministering spirits and they do not to interfere with us.   (Hebrews 1:14) 

&quot;Beware of him – hearken to his voice, do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your willful sin – for My Name is within him.  For if you hearken to his voice and carry out all that I shall speak, then I shall be the enemy of your enemies and persecute your persecutors.  For My angel shall go before you and bring you to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivvite, and the Jebusite, and I will annihilate them.&quot;  (21-23)

He will not forgive their disobedience.  Nowhere in Scripture are we ever told or even given the impression that an angel can speak laws or forgive sin, only God can do that!  The third thing we are being told about this Angel is that He bears the Name of Yahweh.  This is the Memra, the Word of God manifested in 'Angelic' form.

The Name of Yahweh represents His character.  God’s Name is His character!  Therefore, what we are being told is that this Angel will not just do great and mighty things as acting “in the Name of God,” nor will He just do great and mighty things by the “power of God,”  but He will actually have the whole nature and essence of God.

Yahweh has used a variety of ways to &quot;manifest&quot; his holiness among men. These include: angelic representatives, a burning bush, a pillar of a cloud, a pillar of fire, thick darkness, a thunderous voice, etc.  All of these manifestations are known in Hebrew thinking as &quot;Sh'khinah&quot;, coming from the root word &quot;shakhan&quot; meaning &quot;to dwell&quot;.

Moshe and the leaders catch a glimpse of his holiness when they went up on the mount (24: 9-11),  They saw God, and ate and drank and yet were not consumed.
The root Hebrew word used for “saw” in this passage is “yirah” which can be translated as; “see”, “observe”, “appear”, “gaze”.  In addition, the fact that they saw what was under God’s feet, “…a paved work of sapphire stone…,” the seventy elders saw the Divine Angel, pre-incarnate Yeshua, spoken of in verse 23:20.  This explanation will also confirm the deity of the Angel, thus explaining why He had these supernatural and divine attributes. It will also explain why the elders were able to look upon God and live.

The best and most complete revelation of Yahweh still remains to be in the person and life of Yeshua his Divine Son, the Word of God! 

John tells us that the Word (God) was made flesh and &quot;dwelt&quot; among us in the form of Yeshua the Messiah.  That term &quot;dwelt&quot; shares the exact same root word as &quot;Sh'khinah&quot; above.

Do not prostate yourself to their gods, do not worship them, and do not act according to their practices; rather, you shall tear them apart, and you shall smash their pillars. You shall worship Yahweh your God and He shall bless your bread and your water, and I shall remove illness from your midst.&quot;  Shemot/Exodus 23:20-25

Also in 23:52-53b &quot;You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods .. .. .. For if you serve their gods it will surely be a snare to you.&quot;  
At this time an ancient Kenan'ani (Canaanite) practice was to kill a beast of burden (an ox, cow, or goat of some sort), and seethe its body (boiled, stewed, i.e. cooked) in its own mother's milk as a symbol of the animal's fertility. This ceremony invoked the powers of both the agricultural gods, as well as the fertility gods.  The pagans believed that this sacrificial ceremony would appease these gods into blessing them with health, offspring, and abundant crops.  Yahweh forbids His people in 23:19 from imitating this practice! 

Some of the rabbis, not knowing the background for this warning in the scripture, have turned the mitzvah into a prohibition of eating milk and meat products in the same meal.  We have the scriptural record of Abraham who kept God's commandments, preparing meat and milk products together and offering them to the heavenly visitors who came to him.  (Genesis 18:1-8).

Also in 2 Samuel 17:27-29 the people brought mixed dairy and meat products to David to eat, not observing this custom which has developed after the second century AD.

Hearing The Word

Yeshua is the Word of Yahweh our God, which manifested Himself and became flesh, see the gospel of John 1:14; and He said, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” John 10:27-28
The Pharisees of Yeshua's day could not hear Him.   They claimed to be disciples of Moshe, but if they were,  they would have known who Yeshua was and embraced Him through the interpretation of the Mishpatim and followed the leading of the 'angel of Yahweh' who had His name within him. 

The Pharisees of today are the rabbis, the preachers, the bishops and Elders which interpret the precepts upon precepts, precepts upon precepts, lines upon lines, lines upon lines according to their own understanding.  
“In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathways thereof there is no death.”  Proverbs 12:28

Man is to live by the Word of Yahweh.  “It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh.”   (Matthew 4:3-4;  Deuteronomy 8:3)   In the observance of His Word is life.
The Targum of Johnathan confirms that it was the Word of Yahweh who tells Moshe to go up to Yahweh on the mountain and Who gave the ten commands on Sinai.  (Shemot 20:1 &amp; Shemot 24:1)

The Desire for Signs   
 
&quot;Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying, Lord, we prefer to see a sign from you. But He answered and said unto them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah.”   Matthew 12:38-39
The harshness of Yeshua’ response was to emphasize the point that they were seeking signs as proof of His word instead of hearing His voice and putting Yahweh’ Kingdom first in their lives.  The way to the kingdom is through holiness and full acceptance of His Mishpatim.  They had made themselves interpreters of the Torah.

&quot;Yeshua said unto them, “If Yahweh were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth from and came from Yahweh; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.”

“Why do you not understand my speech? Is it because you cannot hear My word?”   John 8:42-43

The world today seeks a sign from Yahweh to determine how-to-prioritize their life and their time while they still maintain control and do things their way.   This is the generation Yeshua spoke of as an evil and adulterous 
generation; it is a generation which seeks out its gratification through the pursuits of the things of this world.  Every aspect of daily living is given to the god of this world, mammon.  It is a generation given to positive thinking instead of the power of prayer; a generation given to Wall-street instead of the walls of the new Jerusalem with 12 pearly gates and streets of gold for the children of Yisrael.  The word of Yahweh says that we are to seek first the Kingdom of Yahweh and His righteousness.  Let him that has an ear to hear, let him hear.

The gospel of John 8:31-2 says, “ If you continue in My word you are My disciples indeed and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.&quot;   We must first accept the truth and allow the truth to begin to operate in our lives, only then will it effectively change us.  We must first empty ourselves and allow and make room for truth to reside within our hearts. His Mishpatim must first begin with our voluntary submission and acceptance of His will upon our lives.  Only then will truth begin to manifest itself from within us and finally to our outward walk and that is when the truth shall make you free. 

“Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, But happy or blessed is he who keeps the law.”  Proverbs 29:18

May we never become as those who live just for today and the spiritual needs of the day only, but always have the vision of being prepared and adorned as His Bride ready to meet Him whenever He comes.   

Judicial Laws for Slaves   21: 1-11

The very first judgment has to do with slaves purchased from a Hebrew family.  As a people dedicated to morality and ethics, they were called to stand out from the societies around them by the standards they set. Having come out of slavery themselves, this is one of the first issues that Yahweh addresses.    In the society of that time, slavery was part of the social structure and the laws which Yahweh gave them were for humane treatment of them. From their experience they were able to have a heart of compassion for the 'slave' and to release him after six years of service.

In today's society, we work for wages and what we do can be making or producing items which will thereafter belong to the one we serve and we walk out of that employment without those goods.   Female workers today have the benefit of good conditions.

Death Penalty   21:12-27

The first instance deals with  slaughter where there has been malice and previous intention.   This is again cited in Leviticus 24:17, 21it only being done on the evidence of two or three witnesses.    Deuteronomy 17: 6;  19:15
Monetary payment cannot be substituted for the life of the offender  -  Numbers 35:30-31

The second instance is pre-meditated and planned murder.  They are not excused by taking hold of the horns of the altar. (21:14)

Mishpatim deals with the very act of striking a parent being worth the death penalty, regardless of the consequences of such an action  (death does not have to be involved).    The violent act is sufficient to warrant it.   Even cursing a parent warrants death. Honouring parents is essential, the rebellious son is to be taken for judgement to the elders, and verbal abuse amounts to murder as Yeshua brought out in Matthew 5:21-22.    See also Deuteronomy 21:18-20

Making Restitution    21:18-27

The 'eye for eye',   'tooth for tooth' compensation covered here has been misunderstood by the western mind.
It is intended to mean fair compensation of the same value as the loss and is not meant to be taken literally.

Payment in money is usually intended.    Such is the case in v.18-19 where willful harm was done and the perpetrator has to pay for the victim's loss of time and medical expenses.

21:22-25  is another example, where payment for the cost of the loss of the child only is to be made to the family as set by the judge if no agreement can be reached.    If there was loss of life to the woman, then the law for manslaughter would apply.

In verse 26, we see that adequate compensation had to be given for the loss of whatever body part was damaged, giving them their freedom if permanent damage was sustained.   In all the instances the one who sustained the damage is to 'give' to the victim a compensation.   Giving a literal eye for an eye is no real compensation.   Certainly the victim has no desire to receive a gouged out eye.   Monetary compensation fits the description, a dismembered limb doesn't.     This is the Jewish understanding of the passage.

Animal Control Laws  21:28-35

This was to cover situations which could occur and are an example of how loving your neighbour as yourself would apply in these situations of life.

Responsibility Regarding Property and People    22: 1-31

This section deals with the various situations where a man may be wronged by another either by accident or by intent and the right manner in which to deal with it and make restitution.  
If there is a dispute and someone infringed the rights of another where it could not be resolved between them, they were to come before the judges (v.9) and the guilty person was to pay double.
If someone steals,  the Torah requires him to repay four to five times as much.   But it allows him to repay his debt through a six-year servitude.   If he wishes to extend his servitude, the Torah prescribes the piercing of his ear at the doorpost.

Judgement on Witchcraft    22:18, 20

&quot;You shall not permit a sorceress to live&quot;
The Hebrew here is 'to whisper a spell'   Strongs 3784   
A sorcerer was one who used magic to gain for someone whatever advantage he wanted in a situation.    The feminine is used here as most likely those who practiced this were women.  This was a very common practice among their neighbours and was involved with the worship of their many gods which Israel is forbidden to worship.    Death is the penalty for these crimes and the only way to keep the redeemed community free from the polytheism of the surrounding nations.
Bestiality  22:19 also incurred the death penalty, which was also practiced by the nations around them.

All Judgement Based Upon Witnesses

The principles of the Torah would  seem to allow the guilty sometimes to escape punishment, because it requires that everything be established by two or three witnesses.   The Torah prohibits condemning a person based on probability or 'hear-say' evidence.

Provision For the Needy  22:21-27

This section covers the four disadvantaged groups which were vulnerable and which come under the special concern of Yahweh
These are the stranger, the widow, the poor and the orphan.

The Stranger  covers all who are in a strange place away from family that can give them sustenance, counsel and care.
The Torah places great importance on the treatment of strangers, covering it a total of thirty-six times.

&quot;you shall not mistreat a stranger nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot; v.21

We are to love them as He does  -  Deuteronomy 10:17-19
We are to love them as ourselves  -  Leviticus 19:33-34   See also 1 John 3:16-18

The Widow and the Fatherless    
&quot;You shall not afflict the widow or the fatherless child&quot;  v.22 

Yahweh Himself champions the cause of the widows and the orphans saying that He personally will bring retribution on those who do them wrong.    Proverbs 22:22-23;  23:10-11

&quot;If you afflict them in any way and they cry out at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry, and My wrath will become hot, and I will kill you with the sword, your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.&quot;  (22-24)

The Poor

Lending money to the poor is not to be with the charge of interest and his need is to be considered in any pledge that he may give for things borrowed or loaned.   Also he is to be dealt with justly and not to be treated with partiality -  verses 23: 3, 6

Yeshua said,  &quot;Whatsoever you have done to the least of these My brethren you have done it unto Me&quot;   Matthew 25:34-40)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial covers some of the more advanced, multi-user features of git. For the single-user features, please go to the [[Git/Overview|Single developer basics]].

== Checking out remote repositories ==
One way to check out a remote git repository is
 $ git clone ssh://username@server.com:port/remote/path/to/repo

Now you have a local copy of that repository. You can use all the commands that were introduced in the [[Git/Overview|Single developer basics]]. Once you are done, you might want to check in your changes to the central repository again. 

First you want to do a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; in case the repository has changed in the meantime and you might have to merge your branch with the repository. After merging, you can use &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; to send your changes to the repository:
 $ git pull /remote/path/to/repo
or
 $ cd repo
 $ git pull
then
 $ git push

=== Checking out local repositories ===
git clone also works for local repositories:
 $ git clone /local/path/to/repo

=== Checking out remote branches ===
You might also want to check out remote branches, work on them and check in your local branches. First you might want to know which branches are available:
 $ git branch -r
 $ git remote show origin

Get a remote branch (pull into a local branch):
 $ git pull origin localBranchName:remoteBranchName

Update a remote branch (push a local branch into a remote branch):
 $ git push origin localBranchName:remoteBranchName

This assumes that you have a remote repository called &quot;origin&quot;. You can check this with &lt;code&gt;git remote&lt;/code&gt;.

If you want to create a local branch from a remote branch, use:
 $ git checkout -b mylocalbranch origin/maint

Deleting remote branches works like this
 $ git push origin :remoteBranchNameToDelete

The following command synchronizes branches
$ git fetch origin

=== Tags ===
Git allows to specify some tags in order to focus on somethings in the history&lt;ref&gt;http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging&lt;/ref&gt;.

In order to add a tag:
 $ git tag -a mytag

or also:
 $ git tag -f mytag HEAD

To display previous tags:
 $ git tag 

Tags can be pushed to remote with
 $ git push --tags

=== Tags vs Branches ===
Both tags and branches point to a commit, they are thus aliases for a specific hash and will save you time by not requiring to type in a hash.

The difference between tags and branches are that a branch always points to the top of a development line and will change when a new commit is pushed whereas a tag will not change. Thus tags are more useful to &quot;tag&quot; a specific version and the tag will then always stay on that version and usually not be changed.

== Create and Apply a Patch ==
In order to create a plain text patch (series) for the changes between origin and master, use
 $ git format-patch origin/master

In order to apply a submitted plain text patch (series), use
 $ git apply --stat  P1.txt  #see the stats, how much will the path change?
 $ git apply --check P1.txt  #check for problems
 $ git am &lt; P1.txt           #apply the patches in the correct order

      <comment>/* Method */  properly re-ordered steps that had been put out of order by previous edit</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to add HTML markup to a textarea.

== Method ==
We will use the CKEditor JavaScript libraries.  This demo was done using version 3.2.

Steps:
# Download the source code from: [http://ckeditor.com CKEditor] web site.
# Uncompress the zip file on your local file system
# Change any occurrences of &lt;b&gt;&quot;&amp;&quot;&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;&amp; a m p ;&lt;/b&gt; and remove &lt;b&gt;&amp; n b s p ;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&amp; c o p y ;&lt;/b&gt; in the HTML files to make the files well formed XHTML files so that eXist can index them.  The following files in the 3.2 release will need to be modified:
## ckeditor/CHANGES.html
## ckeditor/_source/plugins/wsc/dialogs/ciframe.html
## ckeditor/_source/plugins/wsc/dialogs/tmpFrameset.html
## ckeditor/plugins/wsc/dialogs/ciframe.html
## ckeditor/plugins/wsc/dialogs/tmpFrameset.html
# Drag the main ckeditor folder into eXist.  It should immediately index all html files and store all non-XML files (javascript, css etc.) as binaries.
# Note: this does not seem to be possible.  Change the Configuration file to not encode the XML.  


Failure to follow these step 3 above will result in the following error message:
    XMLDB exception caught:
    Failed to invoke method parse in class org.exist.xmlrpc.RpcConnection:
    org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The entity name must immediately follow the '&amp;' in the entity reference.


This can be attempted by editing the config.js file.(see [http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html Config File Parameters] )
# Add the following line to config.js
##  config.HtmlEncodeOutput = 'false';
# Replace the sample_postdata.php with the following sample_postdata.xq

== Sample XQuery to Echo Post Data ==
In the _samples folder you will find several samples of how to use CKEditor.  Each of these HTML files has an HTML form
with the following line:

   &lt;form action=&quot;sample_posteddata.xq&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;

The following program can be used as a substitute for the sample_postdata.php file.

'''sample_postdata.xq'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml omit-xml-declaration=yes indent=yes&quot;;

(: Get the content of the editor1 parameter :)
let $editor1 := request:get-parameter('editor1', '')

(: wrap the content in a div to make sure we have well-formed XML :)
let $wrapped-content := concat('&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;', $editor1, '&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;')

(: parse the escaped text so that we now have true XML markup :)
let $data-to-save := util:parse($wrapped-content)
return
&lt;results&gt;
  {$data-to-save}
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Configuration File for XML Systems ==

CKEditor has a very large number of [http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html configuration options].  They are set by editing the '''config.js''' file in the main CKEditor directory.

The following changes to the CKEditor configuration file should work but it does not seem to have the correct behavior.

'''config.js'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
CKEDITOR.editorConfig = function( config )
{
   // Define changes to default configuration here. For example:
   // config.language = 'fr';
   // config.uiColor = '#AADC6E';
	
   // This should turn off encoding of the XML files as they are sent to the server
   config.HtmlEncodeOutput = false;
   config.entities = false;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;


==Angle Addition==
In the following problems, find the sum '''&lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt;''' and the difference '''&lt;math&gt;A-B&lt;/math&gt;''' of the two given angles.

 &lt;td&gt;5.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;A = 98^{\circ}41^{\prime}42^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B = 50^{\circ}25^{\prime}55^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;6.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;A = 150^{\circ}2^{\prime}1^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B = 266^{\circ}44^{\prime}9^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;8.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;A = 138.7222^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B = 21.9111^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;A = 335.8500^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B = -34.9500^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


== Convert To Decimal ==
In the following problems convert the given angle in degrees, minutes, seconds to decimal degrees.
&lt;table border=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;12.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;38^{\circ}15^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;13.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;-71^{\circ}22^{\prime}43^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;14.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;428^{\circ}0^{\prime}18^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;15.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;180^{\circ}17^{\prime}38^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Convert To Degree-Minutes-Seconds==
In the following problems convert the given angle in decimal degrees to an angle in degrees, minutes, seconds.
&lt;table border=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;16.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;279.6938^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;17.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;-23.3040^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;18.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;167.0030^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;19.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;316.2575^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Draw The Angle==
[[Image:five_six_angle.png|right|thumb|300px|Example: The point (5,6) is plotted and the line is measured to be about fifty degrees with the x-axis.]]

On paper, draw the following angle. If the angle is negative or larger than 
&lt;math&gt;360^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, convert it to an angle between &lt;math&gt;0^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;360^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;20.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;72^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;21.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;400^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;22.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;-42^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;23.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;-395^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

On graph paper plot the following points and measure the angle with a protractor.
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;24.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(7,2\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;25.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(-5,7\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;26.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(-2,-8\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;27.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(1,-5\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Real World==
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;28.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;During an orienteering competition, you are headed in a compass direction of &lt;math&gt;38^{\circ}29^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;You find that you need to head in the direction of &lt;math&gt;298^{\circ}4^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;How far must you change your course in order to travel in the new direction.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;29.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Tuning the engine of your early model Chevy Camaro, you find the sparkplug fires at &lt;math&gt;1^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; ''after'' the flywheel reaches the top position. You want the sparkplug to fire at &lt;math&gt;5^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;''before'' it reaches the top. How many degrees must you adjust the timing so that it fires correctly?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;30.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;If your bicycle wheel spins around twice, how many degrees has it rotated?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;31.&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;A radar antenna rotates twice each minute. How many degrees will it rotate in an hour and a half?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Team Building Activities ==


'''Introduction'''

Team building activities are important for a number of reasons. Everyone participating will enjoy the benefits including the work force, management, customers, up to the stockholders. Team building can keep employees motivated and enthusiastic about every phase of their job. It may not be easy to always get the group or team members excited about doing an activity, but if implemented well, it can bring a sense of purpose and unity unlike anything else. Once you get everyone to understand the importance of team-building, the program has a better chance of being accepted. 

Team-building activities help people understand the importance of working together. A company is more productive when everyone works together for a common goal, without factions or other divisive elements. Along with understanding the importance of working together, below are the benefits that can be reaped by effective team building activities, namely:

'''Establish Rapport'''

When an organization utilizes team building activities it helps employees to establish rapport with each other. This helps employee’s work together in an amicable environment. 

'''More Productive'''

Team building activities help employees understand that they are much more productive working as a cohesive unit trying to accomplish the same goals and objectives. More work is accomplished by a team than one person could ever hope to accomplish alone. 

'''Cut Costs'''

Employees that participate in team building activities are more energetic, enthusiastic and are absent from work less often. This reduces costs for the company across the board. 

'''Quality Ideas'''

When there are team building activities employees are more likely to submit ideas that ultimately help the organization function more efficiently and could save money. Ideas can help a company capture market share, develop people and save time.
 
'''Brainstorming'''

A team that comes together can accomplish just about any objective when they cooperate to brainstorm different scenarios aimed at achieving goals. 



'''Team Building Activity Examples and Starters:'''

Activities that allow team members to work together in a scenario outside of their normal group environment can be an extremely effective way to build cohesion and unity.  Some are simple and some can be complex.  Some are short, and others can be very involved!  

Every team activity requires a small amount of planning, a few supplies, and an effective activity planner.  Here are some examples of some fun and simple activity ideas!


'''''EGG DROP ACTIVITY'''''

Teams work to build a holding container that will protect an egg when dropped from two or three stories high.

*Engaging and very messy small group activity (4 or 5) as part of larger group (e.g., 20 up to 100)
*Can be run as a competition between teams
*Task is to build a single egg package that can sustain a fall of whatever height you decide
*Can be used to highlight any almost aspect of teamwork or leadership
*Lends itself to production line or project management metaphors


''Materials'' (Provide the materials for each team to use, or allow them to gather their own materials.)

A suggestion of useable supplies:

Drinking Straws

Tape

Towel

Rubber band

Masking tape

Egg 


''Timing''

~30-45 minutes to build package

~15-30 minutes for Great Egg Drop

~15-45 minutes cleanup &amp; debrief


'''''MULTI-WAY TUG-OF-WAR'''''

Teams work to pull the other teams across a center line using guile and strategy.

*Fun, finale-type activity.  Physically exhausting and emotionally climaxing! 
*Works for kids through to corporate programs.  Ideal for adolescents and possibly youth at risk.  Especially with older adults, be careful with this activity, especially if they are unfit or if overexertion is contraindicated (e.g., heart problems). 
*Use for any size groups, indoor or outdoor.  Ideal is large group outdoors.  Pick a soft location e.g., grass/beach. 
*In traditional 1 on 1 tug-of-war it is mostly strength that wins, with a few tactics. 
*In multi-way tug-of-war it is mostly tactics that wins, with some strength. 
*Lay out the ropes, etc. as shown in diagram below. 
*Participants should prepare appropriately e.g., watches and hand jewellery off. 
*Divide into groups and make sure the groups appear to be of similar strength. 
*Brief group on normal tug-of-war safety rules, basically: 
**no wrapping or tying rope around anyone or anything - only hold rope with hands  
**watch out for rope burn on hands - let go if rope is moving through hands 
**watch out for rope burn on body - let go if you lose footing 
*First command from the Tug-of-War master is &quot;take the strain&quot;.  This is only to take up the slack, that's all.  The Tug-of-War master makes sure the centre ring is stable and centered.  This needs strong leadership because teams are always keen to add extra strain! 
*Second command is &quot;Go!!&quot; 
*Teams attempt to pull the center ring or knot over their finish line.  This can rarely be achieved by strength alone and instead will require guile.  Teams can swivel to cooperate / compete with other teams, then switch directions, etc. 
*Conduct several rounds.  Continue, say, until one team earns 3 victories and the Tug-of-War title. 
*Allow teams plenty of time to physically recover and debrief/plan after each round. 
*Team building groups may wish to discuss what the secrets to success were in this activity - and whether these lessons apply elsewhere. 


''Materials''

Make your own 4 way tug of war with several good quality ropes each ~60ft+ with attachment e.g., via knots, splicing or ring/karabiners 

''Timing''

~30-60 minutes

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Who is John Salt?&quot; for females &quot;Who is Joan Salt?&quot;

John Salt is a composite being, he is every man and woman and boy and girl that keeps the whole world going for the elite fat cats that secretly control and manipulate and ruin things.

John Salt died for his or her country in every war ever fought.

John Salt died in the Nazi Holocaust and the Communist Gulags and Death Camps and during the USA Japanese Concentration Camps, and was shot in the head until dead by terrorists, dictators, fascists, communists, and really really evil people who were monsters and not even remotely human beings and killed by serial killers and workplace shooters and terrorist suicide/homicide bombers and terrorists poisoning or crashing planes into them.

John Salt was discriminated at his or her job by every employer on the planet for no good reason and treated by management like something they scrapped off their shoes.

John Salt was lynched and hanged and raped and murdered and destroyed by racists like white supremacists, Black Panthers (the ones who kill people), Communists (The ones that kill people not you guys here), Nazis, Neo-Nazis, and other groups who teach hate and violence against those who are different by race or something else. John Salt is considered inferior by these groups and then murdered or forced into silence or forced into living in Ghettos with no hopes of ever getting a good paying job to earn a decent living.

John Salt was beaten up by the mafia and gangstas because he or she knew secrets about his or her employer that they fired him or her for, because they feared he or she would go public with it to make sure he kept quiet. In some cases John Salt was forced into suicide or murdered or killed and made to look like it was suicide or an accident.

John Salt was picked on by bullies at school while teachers, vice-principals, and principals did nothing to stop it and they all only encouraged the savage beatings as &quot;School Spirit&quot; and &quot;School Pride&quot; to weed out the deadwood, the inferior ones, the geeks, the nerds, the homosexuals gay lesbians transsexuals transvestites or even those accused of being those but not really like that, the dorks, the unpopular kids, the ones that nobody liked because they were of a different culture or race or religion or non-religion, or whatever. Many nerds, dorks, and geeks, went on to do computer, engineering, and scientific work for those who bullied them in school and never got credit for their work as the bully managers took credit for it and then fired and discriminated against them heaping stress and verbal abuse, emotional abuse, psychological abuse, and even physical abuse on the John Salts of the world until they quit or get fired.

John Salt was screwed by every government in the world and forced to pay taxes he or she didn't fairly owe and his or her business was forced into bankruptcy and he or she either became disabled, homeless, both, or just got thrown in jail on trumped up charges or a mental hospital for no reason than he or she didn't fit in society or the community or wasn't notable enough or didn't fit the plan.

John Salt had everyone he loved turn on him or her because of his or her mental illness, his friends abandoned him or her because they called him or her names like crazy, stupid, retarded, nuts, insane, and used their negative emotions instead of empathy, compassion, forgiveness, or any common sense, logic, reason, or critical thinking to treat him or her fairly, because he she was different in some way or they projected their problems on him or her and used him or her as a scapegoat.

John Salt was trolled off the Internet by Anonymous, hackers, dupe hordes, liberal professor debate scripts, Glenn Beck &quot;Arguing With Idiots&quot; debate scripts, logical fallacies including personal attacks and appeals to emotions, politics, and other things.

John Salt has died billions of times, but still survives and lives on through the other John Salts of the world and thus John Salt will one day survive enough and band together with his many selves to start to bring justice, fairness, mercy, compassion, kindness, fair play, courtesy, honesty, respect, dignity, and he is a student of [[Jesus Christ]], The [[Buddha]], Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatmas Gandhi and many other peaceful people with passive resistance using words against violence and nonsense.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OSPF(Open Shortest Path First) ==
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a preference to RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and they are used in autonomous system networks. RIP is an older routing protocol which is installed in many today's corporate network. 

While using OSPF if a host detects any change in the network then that host immediately  multicasts the information to all the host connected in the network so that they have the same routing table information. The main difference between the RIP and OSPF is that in case of RIP the whole routing table is multicasted to all the host but in case of OSPF only the change in the routing table is multicasted to affected connected routers that are running OSPF.

More information will be added later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Objectives==
This book is to illustrate the use of combinations of Chinese medicinal materials to treat diseases before the advent of modern medicine.

==Introduction== 
Chinese medicinal formulas have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. Formulas consist of combinations of herbs to treat various diseases. These formulas or prescriptions may be classified according to types or symptoms of diseases.

On the other hand, individual Chinese herbs may be classified in a number of ways, including tonifying, invigorating or nourishing herbs for [[w:Yin_and_yang|Yang]], Yin, [[w:Qi|Qi]] and ''blood'', as well as herbs to reduce or purge ''fire'', ''wind'' or ''dampness''. This classification may be affirmed by modern scientific studies on the effects of individual herbs, where conclusions such as the following may be drawn: &quot;The results obtained from studies using myocardial mitochondrial fractions isolated from herb-pretreated mice suggest that 'Yang-invigorating' herbs might speed up ATP generation by increasing mitochondrial electron transport.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;K.-M. Ko, T.Y.Y. Leon, D.H.F. Mak, P.-Y. Chiu, Y. Du, M.K.T. Poon. &quot;A characteristic pharmacological action of ‘Yang-invigorating’ Chinese tonifying herbs: Enhancement of myocardial ATP-generation capacity&quot;, Phytomedicine, Volume 13, Issues 9-10, 24 November 2006, 
Pages 636-642.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synergy==
The usual method to prepare a herbal formulation is to boil the herbs in a prescription together, and then consume the liquid when cooled. Boiling the herbs together sometimes have effects beyond that of boiling the herbs separately, and then mixing the solutions together. 

===Danggui Buxue Tang===
An example of herbal synergy is in the use of the formula ''Danggui Buxue Tang'' 

The two herbs in ''Danggui Buxue Tang'' ('''DBT''') are ''Radix Astragali'' ('''RA'''), roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge or Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var. mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao, and ''Radix Angelicae Sinensis'' ('''RAS'''), roots of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. These two herbs are used in the ratio of 5:1 by weight.

It was found that&lt;ref&gt;Qiu T. Gao, Jerry K.H. Cheung, Jun Li, Zhi Y. Jiang, Glanice K.Y. Chu, Ran Duan, Anna W.H. Cheung, Kui J. Zhao, Roy C.Y. Choi, Tina T.X. Dong, Karl W.K. Tsim. &quot;A Chinese herbal decoction, Danggui Buxue Tang, activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase in cultured T-lymphocytes&quot;, FEBS Letters, Volume 581, Issue 26, 30 October 2007, Pages 5087-5093&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;DBT, an ancient Chinese herbal decoction having a combination of RA and RAS in a weight ratio of 5:1, possesses much better effect in stimulating cultured T-lymphocytes as compared to that of the extracts derived from RA, or RAS, or RA + RAS (boiled separately and then mixed together in 5:1 ratio). In parallel to this effect, cytokine array analysis revealed a specific set of cytokines being stimulated to release from the cultured T-lymphocytes by DBT; the cytokine release was not triggered by RA alone, or RAS alone, or RA + RAS. In addition, the insufficient stimulating effect of RA + RAS in cultured T-lymphocytes suggests that '''boiling of the two herbs together is essential'''; this method of DBT preparation, indeed, has long been recommended by TCM practitioners. Besides the effect in T-lymphocytes, the role of the '''correct weight ratio of RA to RAS in making the formulation of DBT has also been demonstrated in cultured breast cancer, macrophage and osteoblast'''.&quot;

===Zuo Jin Wan===
Other examples of synergy can be found between the herbs berberine and evodiamine, as well as in the formula ''[[w:Zuojin Wan|Zuojinwan]]''. &quot;Generally, an enhancement or synergy effects are observed when different medicinal plants were used combined in TCM research. For example, the excellent pharmacological action of ''Zuojinwan'' was produced by the synergy of C. chinensis Franch and E. Fructus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;X.-N. Wang, X. Han, L.-N. Xu, L.-H. Yin, Y.-W. Xu, Y. Qi, J.-Y. Peng. &quot;Enhancement of apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells through synergy of berberine and evodiamine&quot;, Phytomedicine, Volume 15, Issue 12, December 2008, Pages 1062-1068&lt;/ref&gt;

===Er Zhi Wan===
Synergy is sometimes interpreted as compatibility.  For example, it is stated &lt;ref&gt;Hong Zhang, Wei-Wei Xing, Yu-Shan Li, Zheng Zhu, Jin-Zhong Wu, Qiao-Yan Zhang, Wen Zhang, Lu-Ping Qin. &quot;Effects of a traditional Chinese herbal preparation on osteoblasts and osteoclasts&quot;, Maturitas, Volume 61, Issue 4, 20 December 2008, Pages 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; with reference to ''Er Zhi Wan'' (二至丸), a traditional Chinese formulation, that &quot;According to the law of compatibility of traditional Chinese medicines, a single herbal medicine usually exerts a limited therapeutic action. When several herbal medicines are mixed in a certain proportion, they will display their superiority over a single drug in the treatment of a disease. Therefore, for more than a millennium, traditional Chinese formulations have been extensively used, apparently safely and effectively, in Asian countries, especially in China, Japan and Korea, to alleviate various symptoms of diseases.&quot;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">J.B. went through each section of the wikipage and updated and added information that appeared to need further clarification.  Most of what I added were enhancements to what already existed as compared to being ‘new’ content.  I spent the majority of my efforts considering the material already posted and then scouring resources for information to add, whether just a key word or a paragraph.  I liked not having to create a page from scratch as we had a framework to work with, yet both of us found this more challenging in some ways.  The existing page was pretty solid and very little additional information was needed and/or available to add.  We both were hoping to add pictures of the founders but licensing was an issue.  We also hoped to add information about the next phase, but neither of us found that information either. 

S.W. Added chart for Phase II and Phase III summary information and chart. Added information and links in Neeru Khosla and a link in Murugan Pal sections.

ATTENTION: Photos have been added, but we were not sure how to add the captions properly

K.D. - CK-12 Flexbook section, editing

J.F. - California Initiative section, editing

'''TO ADD CAPTIONS''', check how the photo is formatted in the example page at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education
Page looks great. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:09, 8 March 2010 (UTC)


M.P. I really like the idea of Flexbooks. I know for the next several years there will always be opposition to using materials such as flex books in the classroom, but I truly believe this is the direction of the future. I like how you added some information about the two founders, but would have liked to of seen a link to a homepage for one or both of the authors. (I don't know maybe that is still yet to come). You also gave a lot of good research on the development of the Flexbooks and the 3 phases.


S.B ~ There is some good information here that is useful to someone looking for basic information on the flexbook and its inception.  I liked reading about California's investigation into texts that addressed their standards and finding that only the flexbooks addressed 100% of them!  Interesting and powerful stuff!  I agree with M.P that some links for the founders would have been nice.  It would be interesting to see what these creative and cutting edge thinkers are doing now. Good job!

R.Y. - Love the image you found of a concept map of a digital textbook.  Your page is full of useful information.  I agree with the others that Flexbooks are very intriguing, and definitely the direction we will see ourselves heading in the near future!

KE--great diagrams!  They're easy to follow.  I like how you linked your references to the specific place in the article (how did you do that!!??)

KC-- CK-12 Flexbooks was an informative page. I hope save in the future my school will become part of the initiative and it sounds like it will save many other educational organizations a lot of money.

CK-12 Flexbooks was informational. The reference numbers in the texted easily corresponded with the references section. Nice pctures.(MH)

== MTP Reflections ==

I thought that the CK-12 page was extremely informative and well-done.  I appreciated all of the citatiosn and links to important articles.  I did see a few places where commas and periods needed to be added or a space needed to be added, but I felt that the page overall was done very well.

==LH Reflections ==

I thought that the CK-12 page was well designed and detailed in its information. I thought the pictures added to the overall look of the article. In addition, the tables and properly placed citations added more credibility to the information given.  The resources were varied as well as informative. Overall, nice job.

==Peer Review by Michele==
Very nice job on this!  What a fantastic idea.  I will definitely be checking these materials out.  Thank you!

==SK Thoughts==
Excellent page! This is thorough, well annotated and easy to read. Well done.
==KZ Thoughts==
Very thorough.  I especially like the future initiatives as it let everyone in on where this idea is going.  Nice job!
==JB Thoughts==
I loved the diagram about what all goes into a digital textbook. I have always loved digital textbooks and would love to convert my class to use them if our district was on board. I wish there was a digital version of our current textbook so that I could make the shift even though the rest of the school hasn't yet. Thanks for the additional information.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dino Romano recently took me to task for linking to a modern Italian (in Italian) marinara sauce recipe that took liberties he was right to object to, saying: &quot;Even Neapolitans, known for some departures when it comes to plain tomato sauce, wouldn't use parsley and oregano AND onion mixed with garlic in a sauce.&quot; Here is his marinara sauce recipe. Actually, two marinara sauces, one with whole tomatoes and the other with pureed tomatoes. 
Prep Time: 30 minutes
Cook Time: 60 minutes
Ingredients:
Ten pounds of VERY ripe tomatoes
Garlic
Olive Oil
Salt
Sugar
Black Pepper
Fresh Basil
Pecorino Romano Cheese, grated
Pasta
Preparation:
Continuing with Dino's introduction, he says,
&quot;I've noticed over the past ten or fifteen years that the 'younger' generation of Italian food writers have begun to truly bastardize so much of traditional Italian cooking that it has come to look and sound like the convoluted workings seen on American television cooking programs. Now THAT is a shame. 

&quot;A very traditional recipe (prepared in the best kitchens, both North and South in Italy) for 'Marinara,' a word which is indeed derived from that fact that a sailor or Marinaro would easily cook this meatless dish on board ship, was prepared virtually daily at our farm in Lexington, MA when we were growing up. One version included the entire tomato the other pureed tomatoes with the seeds and skin removed. It was best when our eleven acres of trellis tomatoes were in season. We moved from Sicily to the U.S. in the early sixties and my father farmed until just a couple of years ago. My cousins are still farming the same land, which was recently pegged by an historian as having been farmed continuously since the early 1700's.&quot; 

Whole Tomato Version:

The ingredients listed above. 
Chop the washed tomatoes into small cubes (to reduce the area and cooking time). 
Sautee ten or fifteen large garlic cloves in olive oil until they are dark golden. 
Add chopped tomatoes and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to avoid burning or sticking. 
Pour in an additional quarter cup of oil (or more according to taste). 
Add salt, a heavy dusting of black pepper and about three tablespoons of sugar (depending on the acidity of the tomato you can use less or no sugar). 
Lower heat to medium and cook uncovered, stirring regularly, until all fluid is thickened. THIS SHOULD NOT TAKE FOUR HOURS BUT MORE LIKE A HALF HOUR. Why people insist on torturing tomato sauce on a stove for half a day is beyond me --- we call it the &quot;Nonna syndrome.&quot; 
Remove from heat and immediately add a large quantity of fresh chopped basil. 
Cook pasta extra al dente and drain. 
Add pasta back to pan and add five or six ladles of tomato sauce to the pasta and stir over a medium heat until sauce and pasta are thickened. 
Serve each plate with an additional ladle full of sauce on top and a drizzling of fresh cold olive oil and a heaping of Pecorino Romano. 

Pureed Tomato Version:
Same as above except that initially you cut tomatoes in half, put into a large pan and heat until softened, not necessarily boiling. 
Run all the heated tomatoes through a Foley Food Mill to remove skin and seeds. It is important to run the tomato skins back through the mill three or four times to get all the richness out of them. This is where the flavor is. 
This mixture may be utilized immediately to make the above Marinara or stored in the refrigerator to be used as needed to make a completed sauce of any type marinara or meat sauce. 

It can also be jarred immediately and stored for over a year. It is important to put a large sprig of basil into the unadulterated puree before sealing. 

O.K., hope I haven't offended anyone by putting my two cents worth in. Keep up the great work. 

Regards,
Dino Romano 

When I asked Dino for permission to publish his recipes, he replied,

&quot;Please feel free to publish my recipe for simple 'marinara.' You might want to add that there is a parallel, sister version to this recipe where the garlic is NOT browned but put in completely raw. The method with which one introduces garlic makes for completely different flavor in just about any dish. Another version of garlic introduction to this marinara is fresh, uncooked garlic introduced with the fresh basil at the end.&quot;

What more can I say, other than Grazie Dino!
Actually, I can say something more: Dino has begun to work with The Pasta Channel, and presents a version of his Marinara Sauce beginning with canned tomatoes (preferably without citric acid added), which will be perfect when sun-ripened tomatoes are not available.</text>

FreeReading.net is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software open source] reading intervention program for grades K-6. The program is primarily designed for grades K-3, and has hundreds of research-based activities, lessons and materials that are available at no cost. The research used in developing this program includes the [http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/publications/summary.htm 2000 National Reading Panel research] concerning the five Big Ideas in Beginning Reading (Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Vocabulary, Fluency, and Comprehension). &lt;ref&gt;Freereading.net (2009). Retrieved October 2, 2010 from http://freereading.net/index.php?title=About_FreeReading&lt;/ref&gt; FreeReading is currently used by educators in all 50 states and in over 180 countries. &lt;ref&gt;FreeReading.net (2009). Retrieved from http://freereading.net/index.php?title=Integrated_Program:_Intervention_A_for_K-1_%28IPID:_101%29&lt;/ref&gt;  Freereading is a F/OSS (Free Reading Software Systems) program designed to improve literacy. It is a high-quality, open source, free reading program designed as an intervention program for K – 1 but can be used for students up to 6th grade.

==What does being &quot;open source&quot; mean?==


Open source refers to the source code as being made available to developers that would like to add/edit content. While the core information is locked, participants are encouraged to share lessons using the Five Big Ideas in Beginning Reading as their guideline. 

FreeReading.net is available for use under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons license Attribution-Share Alike 3.0],also known as the &quot;Wiki License&quot; which basically allows you to use content so long as you attribute the origianal content and allow others the use this information as well.

==Launched in 2007==
FreeReading was launched in 2007 and is the “first free, open source curriculum product approved for use through a state-wide adoption.” &lt;ref&gt;Wirelessgeneration.com (2008). Retrieved February 28,2011 from http://www.wirelessgeneration.com/pdf/press-releases/FreeReading_Florida_press_release_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008-2009 school year, all districts within
Florida were using this intervention program for the first time. This has helped save valuable dollars that  would have been spent on literacy products.

==Updates to FreeReading==
In 2009 FreeReading began a partnership with the Scientific Learning Corporation with the goal of contributing free neuroscience materials and new lessons to FreeReading thus expanding its reach into other subject areas. &lt;ref&gt;scilearn.com (2009). Retrieved February 28,2011 from http://www.scilearn.com/company/news/news-releases/20090402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Florida State Board of Education Adopts FreeReading==

[[image:Child reading at Brookline Booksmith.jpg|thumb]]

In the spring of 2008 Florida became the third state to adopt FreeReading.  Districts and schools in Florida are using FreeReading's Intervention A program as an approved intervention tool.&lt;ref&gt;FreeReading.net (2011).

==What does the FreeReading program include?==
The core content provides activities that are of high quality and research-based.  The scope and sequence of the instruction is provided.  The 40 week program is a stand alone program, or can be used in conjunction with existing programs. It is designed to be taught for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week to a small group of one to six students. The first half of the program is targeted for kindergarten students. For first grade students work can start at week 21. However, individual abilities and needs will determine the best starting point. By using reading assessment tools, when available, the teacher can fine tune the best place to start. 

Teachers may also use individual lessons to supplement curricula and, as needed, use the program for older students. 

The program includes core activities, educator-contributed activities, teaching tips and resources for phonological awareness, phonics, comprehension, vocabulary, fluency and writing. &lt;ref&gt;FreeReading (2009). Retrieved October 2, 2010 from http://freereading.net/index.php?title=Find_Activities&lt;/ref&gt; The site provides free, downloadable supplemental materials like flashcards, picture cards, phonics cards, word list generator, word family lists.

==Uses in the Classroom==
This research-based program has utilized decades of reading research with the goal of helping every child become a reader.  
The activities are broken into ten categories.

# Phonological Awareness – The process of learning to blend and segment the sounds in spoken words.
# Letter Sounds – The most common sounds for printed letters are presented.
# Letter Writing – Students learn the commonly accepted way to write letters.
# Sounding Out – Students learn how to produce and then blend the letter-sound patterns to read words.
# Word-Form Recognition – Sight words are learned (words that are recognized without having to sound them out).
# Irregular Words – High-frequency words such as “the” and “was” are taught.
# Reading Connected Text – Students presented with their first stories.
# Letter Combinations – The most common sounds for letter combinations are taught sh and oa)
# Irregular Words II – More high-frequency irregular words are learned to be read by sight.
# Advanced Phonics – Words with inflected endings, silent letter, and multiple syllables are taught.

==Advantages of the Program==
The open source model combined with a Web 2.0 platform gives FreeReading program users significant advantages over the traditional publishing model.  &quot;Instructional material can be regularly updated to reflect the collective wisdom of teachers and researchers, can be produced and distributed inexpensively, significantly reducing or, in the case of FreeReading.net, completely eliminating the prices that schools pay for such programs.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Wirelessgeneration.com (2008). Retrieved February 28,2011 from http://www.wirelessgeneration.com/pdf/press-releases/FreeReading_Florida_press_release_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the program is continually field tested and is constantly updated. This allows for districts to better use the money saved from the cost of traditional textbooks which schools nationally tend to spend almost 7 to 8 billion dollars per year. &lt;ref&gt;Wirelessgeneration.com (2008).

'''1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 2.Nc3 f5'''

The Dutch Stonewall, contrived through a transpositional trick! This variation avoids the 2. Nc3 and 3. Bg5 lines against the Dutch. Black opts to play f5 only after White plays c4 and Nc3. 

Black gets a bind on e4 while creating a hole on e5, but White can play f3 to guard e4 while black does not have similar option to protect e5. White will try to blast open the position by arranging to play e4 at an appropriate time. Black will try to build up against White's King with a kingside pawn roller. Qh5, Rf6, etc. with a King's Indian-type attack on White's King is always on cards. White also has play on the queenside. Black's Queen Bishop is a tricky piece. It could be a problem piece for black in certain variations. In others, it aims for a deadly sacrifice on h3 at an opportune moment, as in the King's Indian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">S.B.~ formatting, research and information, images, references, postings, editing, corrections

Three small concerns:
# There seems to be a formatting issue by your first image. There are two EDIT buttons that seem to have overlapping content. Not sure exactly how that should be fixed, but explore if you have time.
# The reference links are different from the model shared at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education. All of the pages in the wikibook should have a uniform reference format. You could also check the page after yours which uses this reference format.
# Rather than copy the complete text of the Governor's announcement, it's customary to simply place a hot link (like you did) to avoid redundancy. You could quote a particularly compelling section or you could paraphrase the part that you think is most meaningful. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:04, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

I will address these issues this evening.  Thanks for your input!  S.B.

I made the corrections that I could this evening.  My format is a bit different with the retrieval date after the citation.  It would not show up if I tried to type it in as instructed.  Thanks for your help!
Sharon

Looks good now --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:57, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

I will finish editing the citations today. Thanks

== Spring 2011 updates ==

In regards to my contributions to this page:
I added the category of CK-12 Foundation and content.  I also added several links in the further reading section.  I also updated the chapters in the Physics Book section.  Furthermore, I fine tuned some items...like adding the hotlink to the Powerpoint mentioned under the Flexbook making, adding to titles, etc. 

I actually had forgotten to log in a few times and undid items and redid them under my username.  

Nichole K.


For my part, I added the VA state standards for each chapter of the physics flexbook, added images for that section and for the founder of Ck-12, added hotlinks in the contributors section, and modified the flexbook description to include the benefits of a flexbook. 

Tom S.

Nice job Tom and Nichole, your page looks great. And Nichole I can commiserate with you not remembering to click save - I did that myself a few times! Nice Job overall.[[User:Margaret.mourer|Margaret.mourer]] ([[User talk:Margaret.mourer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Margaret.mourer|contribs]]) 02:09, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

Nice work on all aspects.  NPOV in the CK12 category and benefits of flexbooks.  Images are nice - I looked at code for another image and found that adding |left or |right would wrap the text around the image.

This page looks very informative...great work!  SLR

From Sue: Lots of nice work. I'm glad to see in your comments that you spent time cleaning up the page as well as adding your own content.  Sometimes it is hard to find our own grammatical errors that others can see.  Since this is a community project and resource, it is always useful to have the community help put our best collective face forward.</text>

==Installing a new chain==
In general a new chain comes with detailed mounting instructions.
For Shimano 8 speed or more , chain can be shipped :
# With a preinstalled pin , that can be used to close the chain 
# Without preinstalled pin, but with a special reinforced connecting pin 

Important is for Shimano, and probably for many modern chains, to DO NOT reuse ordinary pins .
It is explained here : 
[http://www.parktool.com/repair/readhowto.asp?id=25]
On modern Shimano chains you should push the original rivet out entirely and replace it with a special replacement rivet, reinstalling the original pin is likely to cause the chain to break at that point.

It’s important to buy the right type of chain for your bike. If you ride a geared bike then a multi-speed chain that is compatible with your drive train is the correct choice. It’s also important to make sure your chain is compatible with the brand of components you are using.

&lt;p&gt;I've suggested merging the contents of this page (not the whole section though) with the introduction page because although it gives the impression the user is about to actually do something to get started, 86% is talking about Java (I'm so sad I actually worked it out), something that I think should be done in the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 17:29, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

= Citation needed=
I removed the citation needed mark on &quot;everyone has once used a computer to do something&quot;. Clearly this is a false statement if interpreted literally, however, I think the intention is clearly to make a generalisation for the purposes of easy reading style. A more formally correct statement wouldn't enhance the meaning here. Furthermore, there's no way a citation could possibly be provided for this sentence. Either change the sentence or leave it alone, a citation needed mark needlessly clutters it up. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 12:08, 19 November 2010 (UTC)

== Is this getting started? ==

Surely this chapter is a bit much for newbies starting out, is there a need to bombard them with things like Abstraction, Classes, Objects, OOP or &quot;Understanding Systems&quot;. I wouldn't have thought they would have any meaning to anyone who is new to Java or OOP.

Does anyone have any objections to making the &quot;Hello World&quot; exercise at the end the main content of this article and leaving the rest until later when the user has a better understanding of the basics of Java.
--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattylaws|contribs]]) 09:21, 10 August 2012 (UTC)

For what it's worth, I found the introduction of abstraction at this point to be helpful. I'm beginning to learn Java from a background in non-OOP and reading several books on the issue. I interpreted the kind of &quot;abstraction&quot; that's being introduced here as the programming thought process, not the particular feature of declaring e.g. an abstract class, which is of course out of scope at this stage of the course. In other words, I don't think total newbies will be confused because they won't know there's anything to be confused about, and for those learning programming for the first time, especially OOP, having this mindset as you go in will be, I believe, of great benefit.

== java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError ==

If you're getting this issue, try this.  

Be sure and add a . (period) in the classpath followed by a ; (simicolon)
-OR-
In addition to adding your jdk to your System Variables path and the lib to your classpath (JAVA_HOME/lib), run the FirstProgram as so:

java -cp . FirstProgram

Hopefully it will save you a couple of hours.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">S.W. - You did a great job presenting the advantages and disadvantages. It is very informative.

J.F. - Great job of covering a large amount of issues within the topic succinctly!  Also, I liked the fact that you included a lot of links so if the reader wanted to find more information on a particular topic it was very easy for them to begin.

K.D. - Your wikibook page looks great.  I din't even know there was such a thing as wikijunior.  My guess is that this will become quite popular as my daughter gets older.


'''Two concerns:'''
# In order for the book to have a uniform reference format on each page, I requested that the reference format from our sample page be followed: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Assistive_Technology_in_Education
# Usually the first paragraph would be sort of an introduction rather than jumping into factual details right away. This is a minor point but would help a reader who is unfamiliar with Wikibooks. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:43, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

R.Y. - I think we addressed your concerns, Dr. G.  Kelly added an introduction and I fixed the references.  Thanks!


Contributions: 

K.E. located resources, linked articles, created and/or revised content for Wikibooks in Education, Wikijunior, Featured Books,  and Other Wikibooks Features. My partner is the real hero, she figured out the formatting and I piggybacked from hers :)

R.Y. haha...I'm no hero!  located resources; linked articles; located and inserted images; created and/or revised content for History, Policies, Featured Books, and Other Wikibooks Features

S.R.P. I added the cookbook section, which took me a little to figure out how to get all the links to work.  I also added information to Wikijunior and Features about the availability of languages.  I augmented advantages and disadvantages but had little to contribute to the history section.

=== Peer Comments:  Andrea Ayers ===
Did you have any issues linking your references?  That provided me a little struggle when completing my portion of our OER page.  Once I got one down it was smooth sailing.  It seems like your contributions cleaned up the page a bit and allowed for easier navigation between content sources.  Nice work!

'''Peer Comment - SK'''
This is a great page. Easy to follow and nicely detailed. I'm sure it's difficult to find many outside references since Wikibooks hasn't taken off the way Wikipedia has. Good edits and nice presentation.

=== Peer Comment: Courtney ===
Very nicely done!  Very informative and well-organized!

=== Peer Comment: Teresa ===
Well Done!  Very informative from all points of view, educationally and personally.  The page flows nicely, giving the basic overview of wikibooks, then leading into specific types and uses.</text>

In regards to my contribution to our wikibook page entry:

JR  I helped create Definition of User Generated Content, Forecast of User Generated Content USA, Exemplars of Web-Based and User Generated Content, co-authored links/references


Comment on two colleagues wikibook pages:

JR  YouTube - provided a very interesting historical perspective in how Teacher Tube was created. Informative links.

JR  CK Flexbooks - great insight about how both Florida and California embraced the concept of flexbooks for two very different reasons.</text>

A lot of information on Free Reading!  You did great with your new section, written in NPOV and very succint.  The rest of the page could use a bit of organization though, couldn't it?  Some of the content seems out of sequence; I wouldn't feel confident moving paragraphs around in a more logical manner and I'm sure you didn't have time or inclination either!  But your contributions are wonderful.  Louise[[User:L0u1ser1ce|L0u1ser1ce]] ([[User talk:L0u1ser1ce|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/L0u1ser1ce|contribs]]) 21:07, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

I researched the topic, typed the content, and tried editing to make the page look professional.  ss

I proof read the article, making corrections where necessary.  I also found and inserted several pictures.  mf

I believe the references are fixed, and I added a link for the video tutorials. I am not sure about
the text boxes but I shortened the sentences. They look good to me. I adjusted the pictures, making the classroom one bigger so it
makes more sense under the classroom uses paragraph. If you can think of anything else let me know. mf

I think I was looking at the page previous and not the one after. I hope the references are now correct. Please let us know.
I made the picture small again. :)

Great job LB this site seems very useful.  Being an elementary teacher I could find many uses for this sit.  Thanks.  AF

== Open source ==

&quot;Open source&quot; does ''not'' mean that the materials are free in terms of cost. It only refers to the fact that the materials are open for modification and redistribution by users. It's the well-worn distinction between &quot;free as in speech&quot; and &quot;free as in beer&quot;. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 16:48, 3 March 2011 (UTC)

== MTP Additions ==

In working on the Wikibook page I did the following:

Researched the topics on the page and added several notations that linked to the material talked about that previously had no citations MTP

Additionally, I added the following sections and content within the sections i.e. Freereading and the Open Educational Movement, Advantages to the Program, Updates the Florida Program (Partnership with Science Foundation) MTP

Also, I proofread the pages and made several spelling corrections in addition I cleaned up the wording in several sections and listed the board of the organization.  I also update the section on its use in Florida MTP

Mthomasphillips and M - nice job on how the page is set up as well as the thorough information that you have included. I appreciated the new categories that you developed. LH


M &amp; M—Nice job on the updates that you made to the page on FreeReading.  Though this was a topic that we researched in class, I sure learned a lot!  Seeing the specifics of the actual program was very helpful.  It made me realize that the program does have some resources like the decodable passages and irregular word cards to name a few that I can use for my 5th grade students.  It is also helpful to see that there are resources out there to help me understand the process if I have difficulties.   ---N.K. 2011

Julie's comments - I found this page to be very informative.  Great resources and references worth exploring.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Scientifica''' is a collection of pedagogical articles outlining the ''epistemic foundations'' of modern scientific research as an aid to new and current researchers, especially graduate students.  For each topic, which is to be kept as restricted as possible in scope, the Scientifica article will answer the following questions:
: In what regime and under what conditions do we believe the current scientific theory to be applicable?
: What experimental or theoretical evidence leads us to believe the theory to be (approximately) true?
: What research avenues exist for improving the beauty, applicability, and/or accuracy of the theory?
: What experimental or theoretical evidence restricts alternative avenues of inquiry?
The Scientifica article covering a certain topic will generally assume familiarity with the basics of that topic.  For example, rather than teaching one how to solve certain problems in general relativity (GR) ''given'' the mathematical postulates of GR (i.e. equivalence principle, locally obeys special relativity, etc.), the relevant Scientifica article will examine the experimental evidence supporting these postulates, as well as the motivations for and problems with alternative approaches (e.g. modified Newtonian Dynamics).

An historical approach is often helpful for introducing the logical structure of ideas, but Scientifica is not a mere ''history'' of a research field.  For instance, modern experiments which more accurately demonstrate the non-existence of the luminiferous aether are more epistemically compelling than the original Michelson–Morley experiment.

Finally, Scientifica covers more than just extremely well established theories like GR, although it is definitively ''not'' a platform for original research.  It catalogs both research programs, like tensor-scalar cosmology, and foundational ideas, like the holographic principle.  The goal is to get new researchers up to speed on the &quot;lore&quot; of their subject as quickly as possible.  Further, Scientifica articles serve as a guide to the literature.  References to original publications and review articles are crucial.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This formula was first published in [[w:Shanghan lun|Shanghan Lun]] (Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Diseases). Its Chinese name means &quot;Minor Decoction of Bupleurum&quot;. This formula is typically decocted in water for oral application.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients of Xiao Chaihu Tang are:
# Chaihu - 24g,
# Huangqin - 9g,
# Renshen - 9g,
# Zhigancao - 6g,
# Banxia - 9g,
# Shengjiang - 9g,
# Dazao - 4 pieces.

The main herb is Chaihu which expels the pathogenic factors in the shaoyang meridian. The secondary herb is Huangqin which purges accumulated ''heat''. Renshen, Zhigancao and Dazao supplement ''[[w:qi|Qi]]'' and strengthen body resistance. Banxia and Shenjiang regulate the stomach and prevent vomiting. Zhigancao coordinates the actions of various herbs in the formula.

==Application==
This formula has been used for attacks of chills and fever, fullness of the chest, influenza, the common cold, chronic hepatitis, acute or chronic cholecystitis, pleuristis, pyelonephritis, postpartum infection, gastric ulcer and other febrile diseases of the shaoyang meridian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Black Hole Thermodynamics is a potentially very important subject for developing a theory of quantum gravity.  In short, is a set of principles which extend thermodynamic concepts and laws, which appear to fail when applied to black holes at first glace, into the realm of general relativity.

==Logical Foundations==

===Recall basic thermo logic===
(1) We observe conservation of energy in non-dissipative systems after we define (i) potential/internal energy and (ii) work/kinetic energy:  dU = dW

(2) We observe that work can be converted completely into &quot;hotness&quot; (something proportional to heat) at a constant exchange rate in dissipative systems.  This suggest we define heat (in units of energy) such that for single material,
:dU = dQ + dW. 

(3) For a single material which is not a heat engine, dU=dQ+dW is almost a tautology.  However, by allowing multiple materials with different heat capacities interact, dU=dQ+dW is non-trivial.

(4) Thermodynamically, we get the second law by starting with Lord Kelvin's postulate (can't turn heat purely into energy) or Clausius' postulate (heat flows from hot to cold) and showing that the quantity dS =dQ/T cannot decrease.

(4') Statistical-mechanically, we get the second law by counting states, assuming the fundamental assumption, and showing that S *almost* always increases.

===Surface Gravity-Temperature Analogy===
It can be derived based on the laws of classical GR that the surface gravity, k, is constant everywhere along the horizon of a *stationary* BH (Schwarzchild, Kerr, whatever).  At first, this is not very interesting because many quantities (e.g.  curvature, radius) are constant along the horizon of a BH due to the high symmetry of stationary BHs in 4 dimensions.  However, in higher dimensions BHs can be much more complicated, so that things like curvature and radius are not constant along the horizon.  Nevertheless, the surface gravity is *always* constant in arbitrary dimensions once the BH has settled down. 
   
'''This weakly suggests that the surface gravity is a monotonic function of the temperature T ( :=dQ/dS ) in the true theory of quantum gravity.'''

===Area-Entropy Analogy===
It can be derived based on the laws of classical GR that, in a system with one or more BHs, the sum of the horizon areas never decreases.  Note that the total mass is *not* conserved. In general, some energy will be radiated away in the form of gravity waves, so the final mass of a BH created by merging other BHs together can be less than the initial total mass.

'''This moderately suggests that the BH area A is proportional to the entropy S ( := ln g) in the true theory of quantum gravity.'''1  (Applied to a single BH, we would only have monotonicity.  But since we can add BH's together, we get proportionality.)

===Hawking Radiation===
If you drive a motorized wheelchair, you can derive based on QFT in curved space that stationary BH's radiate like black bodies with temperature T = k/2*pi . This holds true even though the relationship between T and other BH parameters (q, M, J) is different for different types of BHs. Apparently, it's a pretty convincing derivation, although see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation#Trans-Planckian_problem] and references therein for objections.

'''This strongly suggests that the surface gravity and the temperature of a BH are related by'''
:T = k/2*pi
'''in the true theory of quantum gravity.'''

===Conservation of Energy Analogy===
It can be derived based on the laws of classical GR that
:dM = k dA / 8pi + w dJ + Vdq,
where
:J=ang momentum added to BH,
:w=ang velocity of BH,
:V=external electric potential,
:q=charge added to BH. 
This is analogous to dU=dQ+dW.  The identifications are
:dU --&gt; dM ,
:dW --&gt; w dJ + V dq ,
:dQ --&gt; k dA / 2pi .
The first two are not just analogies; in relativity, the mass of a system at rest ''is'' its energy, and wdJ+Vdq is precisely the work done on system, BH or no BH.

'''This moderately suggests that the'''
::k dA / 2pi = dQ = T dS
'''which supports our suspicion that k and A are functions of T and S, respectively. Given the Hawking radiation relation, T = k/2*pi, we get'''
::S = A/4
'''in the true theory of quantum gravity.'''

===A bit more evidence===
(1) Work cannot be extracted from isolated BH's, but work can be extracted by bringing two BH's together.  (= Work cannot be extracted from isolated systems in thermo equilibrium, but but work can be extracted by bringing two systems in equilibrium together.)  The analogy is imperfect because work can be extracted by combining two BH's at same temp, but usually one can't extract work from two systems at same temp.  This imperfection may just be due to the fact that there is potential energy between separated BHs, but not between textbook thermo systems.

(2) The proportionality constant between A and S was estimated by Bekenstein before the discovery of Hawking radiation fixed it exactly.  Basically, he considered assigning a minimum of one bit of entropy to an isolated particle and seeing how much area was added to a BH if you dropped the particle in from a distance of one Compton wavelength above the horizon.  He argued that you couldn't have dropped it from any closer to the horizon (thereby reducing arbitrarily the energy--i.e. area--added to the BH for the given amount of entropy) because of the finite-width of the wavepacket.  This is independent support (within an order of magnitude) for S=A/4.


==Summary of the Historial Literature==

'''J. D. Bekenstein, &quot;Black Holes and Entropy&quot;, Phys. Rev. D 7, 2333 (1972)''' [http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v7/i8/p2333_1]
:Bekenstein points out analogies between BH's and thermo:
::(1) BH surface area (which is proportional to the &quot;irreducible mass&quot;) never decreases. [ = Entropy never decreases]
::(2) No energy may be extracted from an isolated Schwarzchild BH, but two SBH's may be brought together to release energy (through grav. radiation), but the final composite BH must have an irreducible mass at least as large as the orginal system (M_irr^2 = M_1^2 + M_2^2). [ = No energy can be extracted from an isolated system in equilibrium at some temperature, but energy can be extracted by bringing two systems of different temperature together]
::(3) there is a BH analog of dE = TdS - PdV
::(4) more, but I haven't finished reading

'''S.W. Hawking, &quot;Particle creation by black holes&quot;, Communications in Mathematical Physics 43, 199 (1975)''' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/c4553033029k5wk6/]
:Hawking discovers Hawing radiation and derives a temperature for the BH of a given mass.  This gives the exact proportionality constant between surface area and entropy. (I haven't read this yet.)

'''J. D. Bekenstein, &quot;Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems&quot;, Phys. Rev. D 23, 287 (1980)''' [http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v23/i2/p287_1]
:Bekenstein uses BH's to establish upper bound on entropy. 

'''R. D. Sorkin, &quot;Toward a Proof of Entropy Increase in the Presence of Quantum Black Holes&quot;, Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 1885 (1986)''' [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v56/i18/p1885_1]
:Sorkin makes stronger argument that second law of thermo is preserved with quantum BH's.  (I haven't read this yet; it was mentioned in Bekenstein's popular article in Scientific American).

'''G. 't Hooft, &quot;Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity&quot;, arXiv:gr-qc/9310026 (1993)''' [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9310026]
:'t Hooft argues that the correct theory of QG should have degrees of freedom that scale with the area, not the volume.  I think this scaling feature is the precise way to state the holographic principle, not bs like &quot;the universe really exists as a hologram on a far away surface&quot; (as if that surface existed somewhere in a 3D space).  Bekenstein himself states the holographic principle as &quot;[the correct theory of QC] defined only on the 2-D boundary of [a] region completely describes the 3-D physics&quot;.  I assume he means that the fundamental 2-surface (which exista a priori to the 3-surface of our experience) has the same topology as the boundary of the 3-surface of our experience.

'''L. Susskind, &quot;The World as a Hologram&quot;, J. Math. Phys. 36, 6377 (1995)''' [http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/36/6377/1]
Susskind connects this to string theory.  Although I don't think you or I care much about the implications for string theory, this is considered an important paper, and I think it had some good discussion at the beginning independent of strings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Revising and Editing Documents=

==Why Revise?==

Revising is an important aspect of the writing process in any context. No matter how well you follow the reader centered approach while drafting, improvements can always be made during the revising process.

'''Revising''' is essential to be a successful writer.  When writing, the most influential writers know it is important to follow a reader-centered approach when drafting a document used for communication, especially in the common workplace. ''Revising'' one's documents allows for an increase in the usability and persuasiveness of the document.  However, one must note what ''revising'' a document consists of, because it is such an important process in the development of a successful document.  There are specific procedures and policies required in the revision of a document.

==Revision Versus Editing==


Editing is the process of making superficial changes to a document or rearranging what is already there. In comparison, revising is the process of making major changes in the document like adding new text or entire sections. '''In revising you can change the way you present the material. Revising is more time consuming compared to editing because it involves more critical thinking and less common sense.''' --[[User:Nardi82|Nardi82]] ([[User talk:Nardi82|talk]]) 19:22, 30 April 2010 (UTC)
 


&lt;u&gt;'''Examples of Editing'''&lt;/u&gt;

*Correcting misspelled words
*Rephrasing confusing sentences
*Adding commas, periods, etc.


&lt;u&gt;'''Examples of Revising'''&lt;/u&gt;

*Modifying a thesis statement
*Adding sections with supporting evidence
*Adding graphics to make topics easier to understand
*Deleting paragraphs that are redundant or off topic


It is useful to think of editing and revising as two separate topics, although they are sometimes done simultaneously. It is easy for writers to go off on a tangent and revise a part of the draft in the middle of editing. This is not necessarily a bad thing but you must remember to then edit that new section you have just created. When this is done it is easy to accidentally skip over a section in your editing process.

==Revising Your Own Draft==



There are ''five guidelines'' to consider when revising your own draft.  

'''1. Check from your reader's point of view.''' Don't focus on punctuation, grammar, or spelling, but concentrate on your objectives. What do you want your readers to think about when they read your draft? How do you want them to feel? After establishing what your objectives are, read your draft slowly while considering what your reader's reactions may be towards your draft. What are some of the things your readers might change? Was your draft a persuasive document? Were your objectives clear? Is the information helpful to your readers? Consider all these questions. Try and read it as if you were reading it for the first time. Does it still make scene to you even if with no prior background information? Pretend you were ten years old, is it in a language that is so simple that a ten year old could understand it?

'''2. Check from your employer's point of view.''' When you are in a work environment, you should consider what your employer may think of your document. Questions you should ask yourself are:
* Will it cause any conflicts within the organizations? 
* Am I making promises on behalf of the organizations?
* Am I complying with the policies within the organization?
* Am I answering the questions asked of me?
* Are my solutions ethical and will only represent the company in a positive manner?

'''3. Distance yourself from your draft.''' Give yourself time before you re-read your document, let time pass. Read it the next day and see how you feel about it with a fresh mind. Read the document aloud, it will help you find parts that do not make any sense. When you struggle through a sentence that usually means it is not flowing correctly.  If it does not make sense to you, it won't make sense to your readers. 

'''4. Read your draft more than once, changing your focus each time.''' Read your document at least twice, once for persuasion and meaning and the second for mechanics. Focusing on one thing at a time will help you revise your documents better. However, when creating a meaningful document revision is key. Re-reading it only twice will not suffice, there is no such thing as overall perfection, but you can make your document perfect to you. 

'''5. Take advantage of computer aids to help detect problems.''' There are many computer programs that offer aids of some kind to help you check your drafts. These aids consist of: spelling,grammar, and style checkers. They help bring your attention to possible errors within your document. If the grammar or style checkers are flagging things you feel are correct, check online to see what the rule is and see if there really is an error or if the computer is wrong. 

==Some Questions to Consider While Editing or Revising Your Draft==

It is important to keep a few key questions in mind as you revise and edit your draft. If you keep them in mind as you go through your draft you will be more likely to catch problems and fix them to make the document more usable.


'''1. What is your reader going to gain by reading your document?'''
*If you keep in mind what the reader is looking for as they read your document you will be able to focus on those points and emphasize them more than the less pertinent information. If you find certain information will be unimportant to your audience then do not include it.

'''2. How will your reader's organization benefit from this document?'''
*Similar to focusing on the reader's benefit, focusing on the organization's benefit as a whole will help you to emphasize important information to the goals and success of the organization.

'''3. Do you use appropriate tone throughout the document?'''
*It is important to maintain a consistent tone throughout the paper. Choose a tone that is appropriate for you and your reader's expertise and position and stick with it. As you read through your document make sure you do not change your tone at all because if you do it will make you sound either unprofessional or pretentious.

'''4. Do you use the active voice and avoid the passive voice in your writing?'''
* Using an active voice in your communication will help you keep the subject and the actor in your sentences together. Doing this will not only sound better and flow more smoothly but it will allow the actor that is performing the subject in the sentence to take credit for it. Consider the following examples:
                 

&lt;u&gt;Poorly written sentence:&lt;/u&gt; Updates to the company website will be conducted by our lead computer technician.

&lt;u&gt;Properly written sentence:&lt;/u&gt; Our lead computer technician will conduct the updates to our company website.


*Notice that in the first sentence the '''subject''' ''updating the company website'' is mentioned before the '''actor''' who will be performing them ''the lead technician''. The second sentence corrects this by telling the reader who will be performing the subject in the sentence first.

'''5. Do you keep related words together to avoid confusion?'''
* Always look for sentences that separate related words as this can be very confusing for readers. By reading carefully through drafts you should be able to spot out these problems. Consider this example:


&lt;u&gt;Poorly written sentence:&lt;/u&gt;Washers are used to bolt two pieces of wood together, which are doughnut shaped pieces of metal.

&lt;u&gt;Properly written sentence:&lt;/u&gt;Washers, which are doughnut shaped pieces of metal, are used when bolting two pieces of wood together.


*Notice that the second sentence makes it clear that the washer is the doughnut shaped piece of metal and that it is used in the process of bolting two pieces of wood together.

'''6. Are your sentences concise?'''
* In a work setting readers are in a hurry and the last thing they want to do is read a paragraph of information that could have been said in one sentence. Wordy sentences take more time to read, cause confusion for your main point, and what information you are presenting to your audience is important to your argument. 

==Key Actions of Revising==


There are '''three main actions''' involved in revising a document.  Keep in mind that these three actions are usually done together while revising, but it is still important to consider them as ''separate actions'' when looking at the big picture.

'''1. Identify improvements that could be made in your draft through a''' ''reader's'' '''perspective.''' With this action, you read through your document with the perspective of someone who will be be reading your document when it is completed.  Consider these criteria when revising:'' will your readers find the document useful or helpful to them? Is it a persuasive document? Is the purpose for writing your document being met when reading through it with the perspective of your audience?

''
'''2. Decide what improvements could be made to your draft.''' In a work setting, more than likely you will be pressured with deadlines and other responsibilities that need to be taken care of. It is important to use the time you have for revisions wisely. Take a look at your draft and identify the most important improvements that need to be made and which ones will produce the ''greatest'' improvements in the time you have available.

'''3. Make the changes you feel are important.'''

There are two methods that are used the most in the workplace in regards to making improvements to a document.  These are:

*'''Checking''' Personally examining your draft carefully, looking for any errors or discrepancies that appear.

*'''Reviewing''' Refer to people who would not otherwise be part of the audience your document is targeting.  Ask them if they feel your document is persuasive enough and that they understand it. Also, have them check the draft's usability.

==Checking Your Draft==


Use these five easy points to make sure you know what to look for while checking over your draft. The last thing you want to do is to submit an unprofessional document with errors in it to your colleagues and superiors. 


'''1. Distance yourself from your work to gain the perspective of other readers.'''
*Remember it is easy to miss errors in your work because you know the way you want it to sound and sometimes you read it that way too.

'''2. Read as if you are your intended audience.'''
*Take their level of expertise into consideration
*Be persuasive
*Consider their time constraints

'''3. Consider your document from your employer's perspective.'''
*Remember that you are always representing your employer even in interoffice communications
*Do not put words in others mouths or make promises on behalf or other employees or your employer
*Make sure the document is appropriate and in the company's preferred format 

'''4. Read your draft from the standpoint of those outside the company whom it may affect.'''
*Again, consider who the audience is and if there is damaging information to any of the organization's stakeholders in the document 

'''5. Read through your draft multiple times.'''
*With each pass through the draft try to focus on different issues each time
*Make sure that you catch any errors that you or your word processor may have missed during editing

==Reviewing Your Draft Checklist==


Use these three points as a checklist as you are reviewing your draft.


'''1. Prepare yourself for the review.'''
* What is the objective of the review? Read through your document several times, each time focusing on a different aspect of editing. For example, during the first read-through focus on spelling and grammar, during the second read focus on eliminating passive voice and so on.
* What are the objectives of communications? Keeping the objectives of the communication in mind helps you to locate and eliminate wordy sentences and paragraphs. 


'''2. Giving comments and suggestions.'''
* Identify revisions that are most important. It is always best to focus on major problems first to get them out of the way. This is especially important when time is short.
* Give reasons for the revisions. It is always helpful when looking back at revisions to know the logic behind making them.


'''3. Use computer software to help.'''
* Computer software can help you to catch little errors like poor spelling and grammar but do not count on them too much. Remember that computer software only considers spelling and not proper word usage. Spell check is a good first step but reading through the document several times yourself is the best comprehensive method.

==Documenting References==
Documenting your sources of information is ethical and makes your document more valid to readers.

'''Choosing Your Documentation Style'''

In writing at work or in school you are expected to acknowledge your secondary sources. These may include readings, interviews, web sites, lectures, and other print and non-print materials. It is important to document sources correctly and accurately to avoid plagiarism. You are expected to cite sources when directly quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing another author's material. There are seemingly countless documentation styles used in writing today and it can be overwhelming to choose one for writers. The important thing is to choose the one that works the best and stick to it for consistency. There are two widely used styles of documenting sources; the author-page system and the author-year system.


*&lt;u&gt;Author-page System:&lt;/u&gt;The author-page system is used by the Modern Language Association (MLA). This style requires the author's last name and the page number the information was taken from to be included in parentheses after its use. ''For example:'' It is common for birds of prey to make large nests high up in hard wood trees (Nestor 204).


*&lt;u&gt;Author-year System:&lt;/u&gt;The author-year system is commonly used by the American Psychological Association (APA). This style requires the author's last name and the year of publication of the original work in the citation. ''For example:'' During World War II the job opportunities for women expanded greatly (Milkman 1998).


In each style a detailed works cited page or bibliography is included for readers to reference. This page should give readers all the information necessary to locate the exact document you used in your citation should they want additional information or to check source credibility. More information on this complex subject can be found at [http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Documentation.html The Writing Center Handbook]

===[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657955/?tool=pmcentrez  Mass spectrometry based targeted protein quantification: methods and applications]===

[[Image:Triple Q.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|Cross section of triple Q]]

===Main Focus===
The main focus of the paper was a review of the methods and applications of using mass spectrometry to quantify proteins, especially those that are in a concentration of less than µg/ml concentrations, in an attempt to universalize a procedure.

===New terms===
;MALDI TOF/TOF: matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer.

;Selected reaction monitoring (SRM): method in which a specific product ion from a specific parent ion is detected.  All other ions with masses not specified in a predetermined range are filtered away leaving only ions with the mass in the range we are looking for. (source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_chromatogram#Selected_reaction_monitoring_.28SRM.29)

;Triple quadrupole: type of MS that contains a linear series of three quadrupoles.  The first and third set act as mass filters, and the second is a collision cell.  This type of MS can “filter” an ion of a known mass. (source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_mass_analyzer)

;Hydrazide: class of organic compounds that share a common functional group characterized by a N-N covalent bond with one of the constituents being an acyl group.  (source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazide)

;Biomarker: biochemical feature that can be used to measure progress of the effects of treatment or a disease.  (source http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6685)

For this summary, we will focus on protein biomarkers.  Some diseases which have protein biomarkers that show promise as a screening tool are breast cancer, Alzheimer's, leukemia, ALS, and Parkinson's &lt;ref&gt;{{Pharmaceuticaloutsourcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A series of six steps must be accomplished in order to successfully validate a biomarker or set of biomakers: discovery, qualification, verification, assay optimization, validation and commercialization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rifai | first = Nader | coauthors = et al. | title = Protein biomarker discovery and validation: the long and uncertain path to clinical utility | publisher = Nature Biotechnology | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Once a biomarker is found and accepted, it can be used to possibly predict and prevent the disease it's related to.  The summary below focuses on the quantification method of proteins in the search for and identification of protein biomarkers.  By finding ways in which to universally quantify proteins, one can search for all biomarkers in one screening rather than multiple screenings, once conclusive biomarkers are identified.

===Summary===
With the recent breakthroughs in technology, it is conceivable that is possible to have a “universal” method or approach with minimal restrictions to quantitatively assay a wide number of proteins in search of potential biomarkers.  Once a few potential biomarkers are discovered, further research can be done to confirm or refute its use in clinical applications.  Another goal is to easily accumulate multiple detections in a single measurement.  Measurements are taken by identifying synthetically stable isotopes attached to their respective proteins or peptides.  Each isotope mimics the peptide’s endogenous counterparts allowing high selectivity.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) provides us with a powerful tool to compare two different protein samples.  It can be used for comparing the proteome of a diseased sample against a normal sample at a global scale.  This is applied to a wide array of human diseases, with the hope that it will lead to identification of biomarkers or even pathogenesis of a disease.  Traditionally, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA ELISA] (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) has been the major method for the quantification of proteins with good sensitivity.  Even today, it is the “gold standard” for targeted protein quantification.  The major drawback with ELISA is the lack of availability of antibodies with high specificity.  

First attempts to determine the amount of specific proteins were done using stable isotope dilution methods and MS approximately 20 years ago, starting with atom bombardment MS and deuterium-labeled synthetic  polypeptides.  Advances in MS instrumentation has increased our ability to detect candidate proteins in complicated biological samples with high sensitivity.  To quantify the results, introduction of a stable isotope (containing &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, for example) to selected amino acids in a reference peptide sequence provides a peptide with the same physicochemical properties, that can be readily distinguished by MS from the peptide in the target tissue or fluid.  Studies have shown that full-length proteins with stable isotopes can be used in quantification of biomarkers in urine and water samples with nanomolar and picomolar level sensitivities respectively.  

There is a variety of MS platforms used for quantitative proteomics, some of which are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_mass_analyzer#Triple_quadrupoles triple quadrupole] (triple Q), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALDI-TOF#Mass_spectrometer MALDI TOF/TOF]), electrospray ionization (ESI) based on QTOF MS, and an ion trap instrument using selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode.  The most popular of the platforms above is the triple Q.  Demonstrations have shown that it can multiplex and simultaneously target more than 50 peptides for quantification in plasma in a single measurement.  For targeted quantitative analysis, coupling liquid chromatography with MALDI greatly enhances the performance of MALDI bases MS.  Some advantages of this application include the ability of the techniques to be performed in parallel with each other, it can be made a highly selective, data-driven procedure, and the preservation of the sample to some degree for repeat analysis.  This technique is also highlighted by its potential high throughput and excellent resolution.

One of the most important steps in quantification is sample preparation which greatly influences sensitivity.  One of the most common steps used is the depletion of highly abundant proteins making it easier to enhance analytical dynamic range and the detection of proteins in low concentrations.  One of the techniques performed is strong-cation exchange chromatography (SCX) which has shown to give the ability to detect peptides in the high pg/ml level, giving a 100-fold improvement over direct plasma analysis.

Post-translational modification (PTM) is an important process to understand since it is often involved in tumor progression, but can be a problem to mimic due to the complexity and structure of the sugar chains (as in glycosylation PTM).  One experiment extracted N-linked glycopeptides and de-glycosylated.  This resulted in the conversion of Asn to Asp and a difference in mass.  This was utilized to make a synthetic polypeptide to replicate an N-linked glycopeptide in its glycosylated form.  

Once of the main features of MS based quantification is for clinical applications used to identify biomarkers associated with diseases.  For example, 177 protein candidates associated with stroke and cardiovascular disease in plasma have been proposed.  Some biomarkers affiliated with stroke are S-100b, B-type neurotrophic growth factor, von Willebrand factor and monocyte chemotactic protein-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reynolds | first = Mark A. | coauthors = et al. | title = Early Biomarkers of Stroke | publisher = Clinical Chemistry | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other biomarkers have been proposed to rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer among others.  

One of the main goals of the ability to quantify proteins and peptides is for personalized medicine.  As technology advances, we will be able to create techniques that easily assemble multiples detection in a single measurement.  Biomarkers from diseases can also be multiplexed in a single assay, allowing us to possibly diagnose multiple diseases.  Ideally, a single-step preparation strategy is key, allowing for high throughput and possible an automated process, reducing the amount of human interaction and the chance of human error.

===Relevance to Proteomics Course===
The ability to quantify proteins using mass spectrometry is a great tool to compare a large number of proteins from a control sample with a test sample in search of biomarkers.  When a noticeable difference is detected, further studies can be performed on those proteins.
Major breakthroughs in MS technology give us the capability to universally approach developments to quantify a wide spectrum of proteins with little restriction.  It also gives us the ability to make more detections per measurement.  In the future, these approaches can give way to personal medicine giving us the ability to screen individuals by detecting multiple biomarkers from a single or multiple diseases.

==Phosphoproteomics==

===Introduction===
'''Phosphoproteomics''' is the branch of proteomics that deals with identification and characterization of proteins with an attached phosphate group. Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-transcriptional modification which plays an important role in signal transduction, protein function and localization. The phosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine residues is the most common in mammalian cells, whereas the phopshorylation of histidine and aspartate is rare in eukaryotes.

===Detection and characterization===
The detection and characterization of phosphoproteomics has been traditionally done with kinases, phosphatases, biochemical and genetic studies [http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/230]. More recently, antibodies, 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry are being widely used because of their ability to give specific results with high throughput. Due to the usage of mass spectrometry in phosphoprotemics analysis, there has been tremendous developments in the areas of sample preparation, instrumentation, quantitative methodology, and informatics[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810156/?tool=pubmed].

===Applications===
The phosphoproteomic analysis of cells and tissues provide insights about cell signaling , cell differentiation status , new phosphorylation motifs , kinase-substrate specificty and number and types of protein phosphorylations. Studies on cancer phosphoproteomics might provide us with prospectice biomarkers.

'''Reviewer: Richard Rodrigues'''

====Main Focus====
;:The main focus is to give an overview about Phosphoproteomic analysis using Mass Spectrometry, current applications and the future challenges for the field .

====New Terms====
;Shotgun Proteomics:  method which involves digestion of protein mixture, peptide separation by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins in the mixture. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_proteomics)
;Collisional Dissociation:  method which involves collision of an accelerated molecular ion with an inert gas molecule resulting in smaller fragments of the charged ion. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision-induced_dissociation)
;Electron-based dissociation:  method which involves capture or transfer of an electron to a charged ion to induce its fragmentation. (1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transfer_dissociation    2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture_dissociation)
;False discovery rate:  it is a ratio of number of false positives to the sum of number of false positives and number of true positives. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate)
;Phosphopeptide enrichment:  is the isolation and concentration of peptides with phosphate groups attached for further analysis via mass spectrometry. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoproteomics)

====Summary====
;:[[Image: L-Phosphoserine.png|thumb| ''L-Phosphoserine '']]	[[Image: Affinity-column-2010-09-04.png|thumb| ''Affinity column-chromatography '']] Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in signal transduction across species, with kinases and phosphatases accounting for 2–4% of eukaryotic proteomes. Application of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) technologies have allowed for phosphoprotein analysis in a wide variety of biological contexts, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional biochemical techniques. Uses of MS technology in different studies have revealed insight into the cells of whole organisms, the role of phosphorylation events in determining the fate of individual cells, the role of individual protein phosphorylation events on signaling networks within the cell, and identification of the phosphorylation events on protein substrates of various kinases. 

;:Phosphopeptide enrichment strategies like affinity-based approaches (immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC), and strong cation exchange (SCX), anti-pTyr immunoaffinity methods) and other alternate approaches (BEMA (ß-elimination/Michael addition), phosphoramidate chemistry (PAC), phosphate metal affinity chromatography (PMAC) and calcium phosphate precipitation) are currently being used inline with MS to prevent suppression of unstable phosphopeptides during ionization. The tandem MS approach involves separation of a phosphopeptide mixture by capillary liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) that generates multiple protonated gas-phase peptide cations. This process of precursor selection, dissociation, and fragment ion mass analysis is iterated on analyte species as they elute from the liquid chromatography column. This MS based approach helps to identify the peptide primary sequence and position of the phosphoryl modifications. 

;:Peptide fragmentation can be achieved by collision-activated dissociation (CAD), electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). Quantitation methods like metabolic labeling, isobaric tagging, isotope tagging and isotope dilution are the widely used to produce peptides with slight differences in mass by incorporation of heavy stable isotopes. Recently, label-free approaches have also been utilized for phosphopeptide quantitation. The intensity of the mass spectral peaks is then used to determine the relative amount of the peptide in one condition versus the other. The conventional shotgun proteomics strategies applicable for phosphoproteomics involves the use of target–decoy database searching at both the peptide and protein level making possible the control of the false discovery rate (FDR) of a dataset. 

;:Various software tools are available to identify site localization (e.g. Ascore, PhosphoScore, Phosphinator and SLomo), data sharing/mining (e.g. PhosphoSitePlus, Phospho.ELM, Phosphorylation Site Database (PHOSIDA) and PhosphoPep). High-resolving power mass analysis can be used to distinguish isobaric modifications like phosphorylation and sulfonation. Ongoing developments in MS technology and related instrumentation will not only increase the large sets of phosphoproteomic data, but also increase the dynamic range and sensitivity. This will allow the detection with lower amount of samples and identification of lower-abundance phosphorylation events. Using informatics to utilize the available data and get biological insights will help in the study of phosphoproteomics.

====Relevance to a Traditional Proteomics Course====
;:The paper relates to the course of proteomics as it gives the overview of mass spectroscopy in phosphoproteomic analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Psychological profiling in team building can be a very useful tool in distinguishing personalities, traits, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of each team member. From the beginning of time, people have had to work together and because no two people are alike, not even twins, the mind and overall psychological makeup or personality of a person can be an important aspect in building effective and productive teams.

In the early 19th century, when astronomers timed the passage of stars overhead, they noticed they all came up with different results. They took these differences and made an analysis of what they called the &quot;personality&quot; of the eye. Even as far back as the mid-1800's, distinguished scholars were championing the whole person as a unit of study. From that point forward, individual psychologists began to conceptualize personality and behavior differently.

Psychological profiling is a useful tool in the selection of a team, team alignment, personal development, coaching, and the overall team development.  A team can certainly be formed without psychological profiling; however, with the power of knowing the personality and mind of each team member better, it gives the team a head start in meshing and forming the most effective team possible.


== What is Psychological Profiling? ==

Psychological profiling is the analysis of an individual or teams behavior and psychological characteristics, used especially to identify and explain the makeup of that person or the team in question.  If the organization or team can better understand the makeup, behavior, and characteristics of the members of that team, it is more likely that those paired up will behave more congenial and have more overall cohesion within the group.

Sir Francis Galton may properly be called the first practitioner of psychological testing.  It has been said that he originated mental tests, and assumed that intelligence could be measured in terms of a person's level of sensory capacity-the higher the intelligence, the higher the level of sensory discrimination. Galton also began a long line of research on mental imagery, much of which included the first extensive use of the psychological questionnaire.  Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, James Cattell, B.F. Skinner and other great minds can also be much accredited for bringing psychological profiling to not only the individual, but to the groups or teams within organizations.  

Carl Jung's theory of psychological types says each person is &quot;wired&quot; with different tendencies and preferences.  Some of us are extraverted while others are introverted, some are &quot;thinkers&quot; while others are &quot;feelers&quot;, and so on.  Carl Jung also once said, “Personality is the supreme realization of the innate idiosyncrasy of a living being.  It is an act of high courage flung in the face of life, the absolute affirmation of all that constitutes the individual, the most successful adaptation to the universal condition of existence coupled with the greatest possible freedom for self-determination.”  In order for the team to understand the individual, the individual must also understand themselves.

Personality is often said to be the major makeup of an individual person or team’s make-up.  A contemporary definition for personality is offered by Carver and Scheier (Professors of Psychology):  “Personality is a dynamic organization, inside the person, of psychophysical systems that create a person’s characteristic patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings.”  Important aspects of the psychological or personality makeup may be:


*Dynamic Organization: suggests ongoing readjustments, adaptation to experience, continual upgrading and maintaining Personality doesn’t just lie there.  It has process and it’s organized. 
*Inside the Person: suggests internal storage of patterns, supporting the notion that personality influences behaviors, etc. 
*Psychophysical systems: suggests that the physical is also involved in ‘who we are’
*Characteristic Patterns: implies that consistency/continuity which are uniquely identifying of an individual 
*Behavior, Thoughts, and Feelings: indicates that personality includes a wide range of psychological experience/manifestation:  that personality is displayed in MANY ways.


Carver &amp; Scheier  also suggest that the word personality “conveys a sense of consistency, internal causality, and personal distinctiveness”.  This issue of “personal distinctiveness” is very important.  There are certain universal characteristics of the human race and particular features of individuals. We all for example experience stress and the elevated pressure that goes with it.  The real key is this though -  Every one of us is unique too.  That is why using psychological profiling can point out much of those unique points and point the team in the right direction to play on those unique points, while also meshing with the similar characteristics.


== Types of Psychological Profiling ==

There are many types or ways an organization can perform psychological profiling in building and sustaining teams.  Actual tests or questionnaires can be performed – possibly the number one way most people may think of psychological profiling.  However, there are other ways.  Psychological Profiles also known as Personality profiles can be deduced from any public information such as demographic data, internet search, media, opinions, blogs, social networking services, wikis, newsgroups, words, voice, pictures, videos, biological features, physical features, body language, forums, message boards including other methods such as statistical comparisons with peer groups. 


Factors such as how people create various usernames, emails, IM Names, the way people write, the style and method of writing, the words they use, their pictures, videos, voice, biological features, physical features, body language, their comments etc also have relevance.  This can also help to understand and estimate behavior in different social and team situations.

Relevancy of a personality profile also known as psychological profile is proportional to the accuracy of the background information you provide.  The fundamental point of profiling is comparing a subject's behavior with the behavior of others in similar circumstances who have been studied in the past.  The key to good profiling is in deducing what background effects what trait and identifying patterns. Often times what most people commonly consider to be irrelevant pieces of information could be very relevant for any trait.  It is also possible that people have a certain trait but do not act upon it due to external circumstances that make it very difficult for them to act in accordance with their natural trait. In these situations when the external circumstances are removed people revert to their natural trait.

There are no traits that are all bad or all good. Good or bad is very relative and defined according to the society one lives in or the circumstances. Certain traits in certain situations would be extremely desirable and those same traits in a different situation could be extremely undesirable. And even within the same society, concepts of good or bad may change over time, particularly if influenced by evolving societal values or expectations.

Often times people's own perceptions about their behavior, thoughts or functioning are biased by their own ideal image and experiences. Objective observers, on the other hand can provide a more unbiased assessment of these behaviors. To you your own traits, may seem perfectly normal, typical or not typical. Yet to those around you, they may seem typical, odd or abnormal. Normal is often defined by what's statistically average. Most people fall in the middle ground, the average, while others fall to one extreme or the other. And what is normal also changes over time particularly when influenced by evolving societal values or expectations.

Although there are a number of ways psychological profiling may be administered to the individual or the team as a whole, below are some major tools used by many organizations to understand the team building process better.  It is best to analyze the particular industry and business that is in need of team building and decide upon the best tool available for that organization.  One may find that not only one tool is sufficient, but may need multiple tools to understand fully and reach the goals of team building that are needed for ultimate success.  The options available specifically for teams are bolded:

|Adversity Quotient (Paul Stolz, 2000) || Similar to resilience and hardiness, the Adversity Quotient has been proposed as an indicator of capacity to withstand and thrive on challenging circumstances '''specifically related to business and the workplace.'''
|-
|Enneagram (Google search) || Personality tool based on 9 personality types.  Developed with a more deeply historical and spiritual orientation than most other similar questionnaires by some leading humanistic psychologists, including Gurdjieff, Ichazo, and Naranjo.  The types relate to the major roles that people seem to adopt and play in society.  There is no definitive Enneagram questionnaire - various free and commercial versions are available.

|Human Synergistics (Human Synergistics International, 1970's) || A thinking style / personality profiling and feedback system, plus training program, which can be completed on an individual, team and organization level to assess strengths and areas for improvement/change in individual effectiveness.
|-
|Keirsey Temperament Sorter || Similar to the MBTI, identifies 16 personality sub-types, based on dichotomous ratings on 4 main personality factors which are derived from the psychological work of Carl Jung.
|-
|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator || The MBTI is the most widely used personality assessment questionnaire, '''particularly in workplace training'''.  The MBTI identifies people as being one of 16 overall types, based on dichotomous ratings on 4 main personality factors.
|-
|Team Management Systems (Margerison &amp; McCann, 1980's) || '''Profiles the kinds of kind of roles people prefer to play in groups and teams'''.  Provides individual and '''team-levels''' of analysis.  '''Used to help improve quality of team performance.'''
|-
|360-Degree Feedback || System for gathering feedback from others about personality and work styles which makes particular use of combining observer ratings and comparing with self-ratings.
|}


These instruments are commonly used and recommended as comprehensive personality and team profiling tools.  These tools are often used by organizational consultants, managers, individual team members,  and workplace trainers to help facilitate understanding of:


*personal strengths and weaknesses 
*other team members' strengths and weaknesses 
*a team's overall strengths and weaknesses 
*an organization's overall strengths and weaknesses



== Conclusion ==

As we have discussed in this section, psychological profiling can be a very important and useful tool in team building and maintaining effective groups.  With psychological profiling being the analysis of an individual or teams behavior and psychological characteristics, used especially to identify and explain the makeup of that person or the team in question, one may better understand the dynamics or make-up of each individual and overall team better.  

It is also imperative to remember that there are many types of psychological profiling as discussed in this section, ranging from search, media, opinions, blogs, social networking services, wikis, newsgroups, words and so forth, to actual testing, questionnaires, etc.  Testing may include such options as:  DISC Management Strategies, Team Management Systems, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and so on.  These tools help to not only understand the individual and the “map” they are working on, but also how these individuals will affect the team and the overall potential of cohesiveness, productivity, and possible effectiveness.
Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of psychological testing, knowing what tool to use and when to use it, can be a major assistance to any organization and or groups/teams.  Recognize the audience being profiled and determine what is best for the purpose the organization is looking to achieve.

[[Who?]]

Who is able to learn us, to tell us, etc thing we already learned? He is Mizero

[[Why?]]

I want and I am able. Nothing can stop me to say what I want to say!

[[When?]]

March 9, 2010

[[Where?]]

No surprise, I am writing home in my residence.

[[What is this?]]

They after we receive book all we read books, we follow the media, we go and learn to school, we learn home by our parents and our friends.

Today, I have some thing to share with you my reader. Surely, I come from no where as you've the habit, when you meet a foreign person. I'm rwandese as you saw it up.

Thanks to WikiBook to allow me a place where other people can get my thoughts and experience.

I want to talk about: the '''WORLD OF TODAY'''

Rwandese leaving in France (with my disability-everyone has an identity, disability is one). I will be talking about:
* world system
* how can we clean it?

You should not say that I am from no where. January 5, 1987 Régine Nyirankamiyimana (my mother) has given birth to me. Every time we have explanation, I was overweight compared to many newborns. Birth in these conditions means medicine was what she meant at that time( this explain my disability).

&lt;big&gt;What I want to say in few words&lt;/big&gt;

Human being (evolution).&lt;br /&gt;
* Every one has a say
* How can we listen to each other?

''Acknowledgements: The meetings and staff work which facilitated the writing and compilation of this document were funded by the United Soybean Board with contributions of facilities and personnel by the University of Idaho and the US Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service; and funding for some international travelers provided by the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC) and by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).''

I don't think this constitutes a copyvio (and if it does it doesn't seem to be problematic) considering &quot;''[[w:Public domain#United States law|Works &quot;prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government as part of that person's official duties&quot; are automatically in the public domain by law.]]''&quot; that seems to cover most of those sources and the remaining seem to be highly interested in generally promoting the use of their produces. Have you tried contacting someone ( http://www.soynewuses.org/ContactUs/Default.aspx ) ? &lt;br&gt;
If you examine the source material, you will find that most of the content comes from the public institutions listed above, it seems [[w:United Soybean Board|United Soybean Board]] just compiled existing public material without any great creative input (probably it could violate the NPOV) as United Soybean Board could have selected to aggregate the public information supportive of their interests...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:26, 8 March 2010 (UTC)
:Well, the web site hosting the document appears to claim copyright over it see [http://www.aquafeed.com/disclaimer.php disclaimer], so I think that makes it the responsibility of the contributor to put up a case for their use of the material. Plus, it is not really clear from the acknowledgments you quote whether the  work was entirely produced by public servants or also people employed by other bodies. I see that in the list of authors there are Russians, Norwegians and Israelis who presumably are not US government employees. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]])
::I don't know if the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are part of the US federal government if so by the above acknowledgment it seem they were the source of the funding for those individuals work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:26, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sandalwood Trade==
The sandalwood trade was started by Kamehameha I. The people that wanted to trade were the Chinese and later the English. They traded fur, tea, rum, cocoa, guns, ammo, yams, cottons, woolens, nails,  saddles, canvases, French wines, glass, harnesses, iron pots, pans, pens, paper, ink, flour, soap, rice, hemp, and animals such as goats and pigs. The sandalwood trade ended when Kamehameha I died. The sandalwood trade started up again by Kamehameha II but with lesser control. The sandalwood trade became so popular that there was less and less sandalwood. Kamehameha II ordered his people to find more sandalwood. There was so little sandalwood that Kamehameha II promised to send sandalwood to his traders. More and more foreign people came to Hawaii and brought diseases that killed a lot of his people. Kamehameha II wrote a letter to King George (King Of England) to ask for help , and that is when the sandalwood trade ended.

==Liholiho Death==

Liholiho and Kamamalu both were going on a trip to visit George IV. The couple were going to England on the British ship. Liholiho and Kamamalu left Hawai’i on the year of 1823. While Liholiho went to England, his brother Kauikeaouli ruled the land while he was gone.   It took Liholiho and Kamamalu 6 months to reach England. When Liholiho and Kamamalu arrived to England, they stayed at a London hotel. Liholiho and Kamamalu got to watch a theater performance and a balloon ascent. A month later, Kamamalu died on July 8, 1824 and Liholiho died a week later, both of them died from measles. The English people shipped the bodies back to Hawai’i. When the Hawaiian people found out that their king died every one was very sad. The next King Kamehameha III Kauikeaouli was the third child of Kamehameha.

Does the outlined structure make sense? I'd like input on that - I don't think it does. Modules are uneven sizes &amp; difficulties, and don't seem to flow logically from one to the next. I think several need to be split as well.

:When learning to use git, I think it is important to have a good mental model of how git works, specifically the directed acyclic graph nature of the commit history. Instead of the Introduction section, I would start with a &quot;Core concepts&quot; section explaining the concept of a commit. Specifically, a commit represents a snapshot in time of the project as a whole, and how commits are related to each other in a parent child relationship. After the core concepts section, then launch into the basic commands (init, status, diff, add, commit), perhaps in a Getting Started section. --[[User:Haydenmuhl|Haydenmuhl]] ([[User talk:Haydenmuhl|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Haydenmuhl|contribs]]) 18:19, 27 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Basic introduction to the passage'''

'''Contextual notes'''

When coming in on Chapter 2 of Matthew the author skips ahead of the visit of the angel to Mary and the conception of Jesus. The end of Chapter one leads into the visit of the Magi by restating the prophecy of the messiahs coming. 

'''Structural notes'''

Chapter two is broken up into six parts:

1.	Magi arrive in Jerusalem (v.1-6)

2.	 Herod summons them (v. 7-8)

3.	 The Magi find Jesus and worship him (v.9-11),

4.	 dreams of magi and Joseph warning them (v.12-15)

5.	 Herod’s killing of the children (v.16-18)

6.	 The return to Israel then Galilee (v.19-23)


'''Chapter Synopsis'''

After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem magi from east of Judea came to Jerusalem and asked “Where is the child who was born ruler of the Jews? Was saw the star and have traveled here to worship him.” When King Herod heard them he was worried along with the rest of Jerusalem. Herod gathered all those who knew the scripture to find out where this child was to be born. They told him in Bethlehem. It was written by the prophet that out of Bethlehem the ruler over Israel will come. Herod gathered the magi and asked when the star had appeared to them then he sent them saying “Go find the child and after you have come back and tell me where he is so that I may go and worship him as well.” After this the magi left and found the star that they saw in the east and were happy. They went into the house of Mary and Joseph. When they saw the child the bowed down in worship and gave gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. After leaving the wise men were warned by God to not go back to Herod. And they returned through a different route. An angel came to Joseph in his sleep and told him to take his wife and son and flee to Egypt. They lived there until Herod was dead. When Herod realized that the magi were not coming back he sent his men out to kill all boys who were two years old and younger. After this the, prophesy that had been spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. After Herod died and angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family back to the land of Israel because those who wanted him dead had all died. On their way back Joseph heard that Archelaus was ruler after his father, Herod, had died and Joseph was scared. God told Joseph to take his family to Galilee and he did and they settled in Nazareth.

'''Paraphrase'''


1	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea while Herod was king, magi from the east came to Jerusalem asking,

2	“Where is he who is to be king of the Jews? We say his star and have come to worship.”

3	Herod heard of the Magi and what they were seeking and was afraid.

4	He gathered the chief priests and scribes and asked where the Messiah was to be born.

5	They replied “he is to be born in Bethlehem of Judea: this is what has been written by the prophet:

6	‘And you, Bethlehem, Land of Judea, are by no means least among the leaders of Judea; for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’

7	After this Herod summoned the magi to see when the star first appeared. 

8	He sent them on their way and told them “search for the child, when you find him come tell me so I may worship him as well.”

9	They went on their way and found where the star came to rest over the place where the child was.

10	When they saw the star they were filled with joy.

11	They saw the child with his mother Mary; they fell in adoration and worshiped him and gave their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12	God then warned them in a dream to not return to Herod, so the magi returned home a different way.

13	After they left and angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family and go to Egypt until it is safe.

14	Joseph woke them and they fled.

15	They stayed in Egypt until the death of Herod.

16	Herod realized he had been tricked and sent his men out to kill all boys the age of two and younger in the area of Bethlehem and around there.

17	Then Jeremiahs prophecy had been fulfilled

18	“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more.”

19	When Herod died and angel came to Joseph in Egypt and told him,

20	“Go take the child and his mother and go to Israel; those who wanted to kill him are dead.”

21	Joseph took them to the land of Israel

22	When they arrived Joseph found out Herod’s son Archelaus was ruling and was afraid and warned by God. He left for the region of Galilee

23	They lived in the city Nazareth. It fulfilled what was said “He shall be called Nazarene.”


'''Historical context of the Magi (verses 1-6)'''

The word ‘magi’ has four general meanings 

1) members of Persian priestly class; 

2) possessors of supernatural knowledge and power. 

3) Magician; and 

4) deceiver or seducer.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
through the New Testament magi means a man of wisdom, with the passage in Matthew 2 it refers to astrologers. It was later after Christian influence that we call them kings and thought of only three magi because of the three gifts.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
When there was most likely a caravan of magi and servants. The reason we have come to call them kings is because of what the gifts were. The offering of gold and precious spices is not extraordinary but does suggest that the magi who could give these gifts were of some wealth(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
we have also added that the three magi have names: Melchior, King of Persia; Gaspar, King of India; and Balthasar, King of Arabia. They are thought to be descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Yet, non of this has been provenHare, Douglas. (Interpretation6&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation a biblical commentary for teaching and preaching. XXVIII. Louisvill: John Knox Press, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). see page 80 [[http://books.google.com/books?id=NrEeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=names+for+the+nameless+in+the+new+testament&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o6PprcAqNr&amp;sig=Xq12eQFIyjw17hik31Xf6VgCRFQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uoKUS5qmNI3-sgOm8en8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=names%20for%20the%20nameless%20in%20the%20new%20testament&amp;f=false]]

'''Verse 1'''

The Bible states “magi from the east arrived…(NASB)” this gives us four possible places that they could be from: 1) Parthia; 2) Babylon; 3) Arabia; and 4) Egypt.(add citation) To narrow this down it is most likely that the magi were from Babylon because they had to have some form of Jewish thinking. This could have occurred in Arabia or Parthia but Babylon had a settled Jewish community. (Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verse 2'''

The magi were also gentiles, they knew of the coming king for the Jews; yet, did not know where he was to be born. This explains why they went to Jerusalem to look for him. Jerusalem was the big capital city where anyone who did not know would think that the king would be born. The only way that the readers would be able to conclude that the magi were Jewish would be if Matthew clearly stated so. 

'''Verses 3-6'''

This verse states that King Herod heard about the magi and what they were looking for and he was “troubled (NASB)” so he gathered his priests and scribes to find out where the child was to be born. These verses show Herod’s insecurities. This is not the first time Herod killed many people for political reasons including his own sons when he feared that they were plotting to kill him. (Marshall3&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Howard, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, and D.J. Wiseman. New Bible dictionary. 3rd ed. Downers Grove, Illinois: Intervarsity Press, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)however this story of Herod sending his men out to kill all the small boys in not recorded anywhere else the thought of a new king of the Jews is bound to bring out Herod’s worst fears and paranoia. 

'''Verse 7-8'''

	Herod “secretly called the magi” this tells us that the magi never went to ask Herod where the child was. Even though that is what most people think. He summoned them with evil intent. This also shows how cunning Herod could be. They were in private, Herod asks them when they first saw the star to find out about how old the child should be, and he tells them to go find out more i.e. where he is and covers himself by adding “so I too may come and worship him (NASB).” (citation henry online commentary) 

'''Verses 9-10'''

	The magi left Jerusalem for Bethlehem of Judea where they came to Jesus’ house and “The star that they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was (NASB).”  There has been a lot of study into what the star was that they saw in the east. In some versions of the verse the star is seen as ‘at its rising.’ Other things that have been thought of and taken into consideration are that ‘the star’ could have been a natural phenomenon. Saturn and Jupiter were in line in 7-6 B.C. and Halley’s passed in 12-11 B.C. it could also have been a supernova.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) however, this verse (9) makes these a little difficult to explain because it says that “it went before them” and “stood over” the verse must be understood either as a romantic myth growing out of the historical kernel or else as referring to something actually experienced by the magi and interpreted in terms of the leitmotif of the star that first ‘led’ them from the east to Jerusalem. The real point is that by divine guidance they were able to complete their quest and find the child.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) some have said that the magi believed it was an Angel, some Jews believe that it was the star of Jacob. We have not been able to identify the exact star and probably never will. Marshall3&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Howard, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, and D.J. Wiseman. New Bible dictionary. 3rd ed. Downers Grove, Illinois: Intervarsity Press, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verse 11'''

	At this time the magi have arrived at the house and saw the Child. Later in Verse 16 it states that Herod sent them to kill those who were two years and younger. Off of this it is safe to assume that Jesus was probably a toddler and was learning to walk, and was standing next to his mother when the magi arrived. 
The magi “fell to the ground and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. (NASB)” these, again, are some of the reasons Christians call the magi kings. They are very valuable and expensive gifts. One of the definitions of gold according to Dictionary.com is a precious yellow metallic element, highly malleable and ductile, and not subject to oxidation or corrosion. Gold is a form of currency, and could reflect Christ’s kingship(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;), frankincense is an aromatic gum resin from various Asian and African trees of the genus Boswellia, esp. B. carteri, used chiefly for burning as incense in religious or ceremonial practices, in perfumery, and in pharmaceutical and fumigating preparations. (Dictionary8&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;) and is thought to describe his deity(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). Lastly myrrh is defined as an aromatic resinous exudation from certain plants of the genus Myrrh is, esp. M. odorata, a small spiny tree: used for incense, perfume, etc. (Dictionary8&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;)and represents his suffering.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verses 12-23'''

'''Dreams/slaughter of Children/prophecies fulfilled'''

	In these next chapters there are three dreams that occur to warn the magi one to warn Joseph and the one to tell Joseph to take his family back home from Egypt. These are also the chapters where the great slaughter of young boys happens because Herod realizes that the magi were not coming back. Thus prophecies of the messiah coming out of Egypt and later Nazareth and so on come to be fulfilled. 
	
'''Verse 12'''

	This is where we first hear of God appearing and warning people through dreams, as he tells the magi “to not return to Herod” so they did not and went back via another rout. Some could speculate that the magi knew Herod was a ‘bad guy’ or would harm the boy. Herod’s reputation was pretty well known and if the magi were from a surrounding city it would be hard for them to not have heard of him. Herod probably knew of his reputation and is another reason why he added “so I too may worship him” to put the magi at ease and since he was the king of the Jews he would want to go worship the real king of the Jews.

'''Verses 13-15'''

	“An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream…(NASB)” this is the second dream that God uses to warn his people about Herod’s wrath. Joseph is told to take the child and his mother and go to the land of Egypt and to stay there until those who want Jesus dead are themselves dead. This then fulfills what was said by the prophets “out of Egypt I called my son.” The historical exodus is not prophecy about the future. How is it then that Matthew has fulfilled one? The fulfillment is central the Matthews whole perspective. The eschatological significance, of the Christ, God’s unique son. The son of God, Israel, and the Son of God, Jesus, both in Egypt of necessity and both delivered(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). Also note in Matthew the author does not call Jesus Josephs son. He is always referred to as “the Child” (New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verses 16-18'''

	At this time Matthew tells us that Herod has become aware that the magi were not coming beck. We are never told how long it took Herod and it is difficult to be able to know for sure. The author also uses this as another parallel to the story of Moses. First the escape to Egypt (unlike Moses escape from Egypt). The slaughter of young boys, with the demand coming from Herod instead of Pharaoh.(New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)The story can be interpreted and a beautiful, action, escape story. Historically Herod would not have been fooled so easy, he most likely would have sent people to follow the magi. Also Joseph, Mary, and Jesus had enough time to escape. This is when the author writes that “then what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: a voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning…” Ramah is our world, when it says that the cry heard in Ramah goes to mean the voice of the world is weeping. It is not something of comfort but a way of saying that the sadness is double. Which is understandable with Herod’s “children’s Crusade.” (Buttrick&lt;ref&gt;Buttrick, George. The Interpreters Bible. VII. Nashville, Tennessee: New York Alingdon Press, 1951. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verses 19-21'''

	After Herod died in 4 B.C.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)God sent an angel to Joseph to tell him that those who wanted to kill the child were dead. This goes back to verse 13 at the end of the message the angel said “…remain there until I tell you…” Not only did the death of Herod mean that the ‘holy family’ could return but those who had fled from Herod. Joseph is told to take them to the land of Israel which is an echo of the exodus.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also moving forward to the next dream that told them to go to Galilee is necessary to underline the exodus typology.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) when the angel says “the land of Israel” it is a pretty broad area including Galilee, and Judea, it is assumed that Joseph took this to mean to go back to Bethlehem. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)This explains why that is where they return to, and then are given further instructions in the next verse.

'''Verse 22'''

	When returning to Bethlehem they found out that Herod’s son Archelaus, he was ruler over Judea/Samaria, while his brother Antipas was ruler of Galilee, and Philip. Historically none of the sons were granted the title ‘king’ and Archelaus and Antipas tried to gain the title. Archelaus was not popular, even hated by some. Eventually in A.D. 6 He was removed from power. This is when Pontius Pilatus then took over. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) With Archelaus’ reputation it is not hard to believe that Joseph would not think it was any safer under him than it was under his father. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)It was recorded by Josephus that at the beginning of his rule Archelaus killed about three thousand Passover celebrants. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) This could have prompted the next dream that was a vague and gave direct instructions that took them to Nazareth. 

'''Verse 23'''

	Nazareth was not a big town. It is believed to only have had a maximum of 480 in the beginning of the 1st century. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)and was most likely smaller than Bethlehem. There is no talk about Nazareth in the Old Testament except for the prophecy that was to be fulfilled. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) It is most likely that Matthew took a collection of sayings from many prophets. “He shall be called a Nazorean” is not in the Old Testament or in any other form of literature.(France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)it is a good probability that this thinking came from the Hebrew word nezer which means branch and sounds somewhat like “Nazareth” this all referring to the branch of the Davidic line. Matthew would have had this all in mind (New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)however this does not explain the “he shall be called” part. In Judges the phrase “he will be a naziraios” is used which in translation could have come to the phrasing “He will be called a Nazorean” (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Word Study: “Dream”'''

	In the New Testament dreams and visions are not always clearly distinguished from one to the other. The most common word for dream in Greek is onar which is only used in Matthew.
The New Testament and Old Testament and the Greco Roman world, see dreams as the way that God chose to reveal himself. The New Testament also expresses little concern with the problem of false dreams and visions.(Freedman1&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David. The Anchor Bible Dictionary. 2. New York: Doubleday, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
The central message of the New Testament is Chris coming and God only goes to dreams as a secondary source and in revelation. (Freedman1&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David. The Anchor Bible Dictionary. 2. New York: Doubleday, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assignment Problems (AP) (also known as Allocation Problems, although they will be known as the former throughout this article) are a common form of problem. A distinguishing feature of AP is that one agent is assigned to one and only one task. Examples in real-life situations could be:

* Assigning contracts
* Assigning tasks to machinery
* Assigning agents to tasks
* Assigning Sales Personnel to Territories

&lt;br/&gt;
An example of such a problem would be three lorries, A, B and C, and three loads that need to be transported, 1, 2 and 3. An example arrangement would be A → 1, B → 2 and C → 3. This means that Lorry A transports Load 1, Lorry B transports Load 2 and Lorry C transports Load 3. 

== Balanced Problems ==

A balanced AP is one in which:

(number of agents) = (number of tasks)
{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=right width=20% 
|+ Table 1
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
|}


Consider again our lorry and load example. In this example, the number of '''agents''' (lorries) was 3 and the number of '''tasks''' (loads to be transported) is also equal to 3. Thus, it is a '''balanced problem'''. Initially, one will consider only balanced problems and how they are to be solved.

Upon expansion of the earlier problem, it was revealed that the cost for each lorry to transport each load is different. These are represented in Table 1.

&lt;br/&gt;
The manager of the fleet of lorries wishes to minimise to total cost to complete all three jobs. How would one allocate the lorries to the loads? The table of numbers given is called the ''cost matrix'' of the problem.

=== Formulation as a Linear Programming Problem ===

A Linear Programming Problem can easily be developed for AP. One would define &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; (where agent ''i'' is assigned task ''j'') where:

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;=1, when agent ''i'' is completing task ''j''
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;=0, when agent ''i'' does not complete task ''j''

Thus, one can obtain the contraints for the Linear Programming Problem by considering each agent/task in turn:

As each agent is assigned to exactly one job, we can deduce:

:for agent A: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for agent B: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for agent C: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1

Similarly, since each job is assigned to exactly one agent, one can deduce:

:for job 1: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for job 2: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for job 3: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1

If we apply this to the aforementioned example, one can see that for lorry A, it can only carry one of loads 1, 2 or 3. So, &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; could = 1, with &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; being zero, or &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, with &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; being zero, etc.

The obtain the ''objective function'' for this example, we must consider the total costs.

: For lorry A, costs will be: 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;
: For lorry B, costs will be: 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;
: For lorry C, costs will be: 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;

The means, therefore, that the objection function, ''Z'', for this example is to minimise Z where:

: Z = 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;

Finally, this means that one can conclude the LPP to be:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border:1px solid&quot;&gt;Minimise Z, where Z = 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;, subject to:
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Solution of the Balanced Assignment Problem==

An algorithm was developed by Harold Kuhn in the 1950s, and was named the Hungarian Algorithm. Its name is a reference to Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry, a pair of prominent Hungarian Mathematicians whose techniques are applied in this algorithm. 

===The Hungarian Algorithm===

For the Hungarian Algorithm to work, the assignment problem must meet the following criteria:

*Each worker must be assigned, as we previously saw, to exactly one job.
*Each job must be assigned to exactly one worker.
*In the cost matrix, a constant can be added or subtracted from all cost values in any row or column without having any effect on the optimal assignments.

There are three stages in the implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm:

*Find the opportunity cost matrix
*Test for an optimal assignment. If one can be made, use it and stop.
*If an optimal assignment cannot be made, revise the opportunity cost matrix and return to the previous step.

To demonstrate these three steps, let us consider again the lorry example:

====Finding the Opportunity Cost Matrix====

The Opportunity Cost Matrix (OCM) is essentially a modified version of our initial Cost Matrix. In order to change the Cost Matrix into the OCM, one must carry out two stages.

# Carry out '''row reduction'''
# Carry out '''column reduction'''

Row reduction is the operation in which the smallest number in each row is subtracted from every number in that row. With our earlier example:

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix

|}
{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20%

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Next, one completes the column reduction. This is the same as row reduction, only with the smallest number in each column being subtracted from each value within that column. Thus:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20%

|}

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Thus, the completed Opportunity Cost Matrix is:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20%

====Interpreting The Opportunity Cost Matrix====

Since the aim of an assignment problem is to assign exactly one agent to exactly one task, one must match each agent up to the task which best minimises overall cost. After completing the row reduction and column reduction, it is logical to assume that the values that remain in the table are the minimum possible. Similarly, since the values in the table are the cost-values, the lowest values in the table are, surely, those of lowest cost. In order to find a solution, one must select one zero from each row and one zero from each column. However, one cannot select more than one value from any row or column, as it will result in one agent/task being assigned twice, which cannot occur in an Assignment Problem.


Again, let's consider the earlier example. If we were to select one zero from each column/row without any doubles occurring, the only possible solution is (with selected costs marked by asterices):

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}


If we then assign this solution to our original cost matrix, one can see the following:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
|}

Thus, the final assignment is:

: A → 3 (cost 12)
: B → 1 (cost 10)
: C → 2 (cost 6)
: Z = 12 + 10 + 6 = 28

It is interesting to see that, despite this being the cheapest solution, it doesn't actually utilise all of the lowest values within the table.

===Optimality of a Solution===

An important issue with AP is the optimality of solution - when one obtains a solution, how can one be sure it truly is the best solution available? With the Hungarian algorithm, there is a fairly straightforward test for optimality that concerns drawing lines through the zeros in the Opportunity Cost Matrix. If the number of lines (horizontal and vertical only) is equal to the number of rows/columns, the solution obtained is optimal. If, however, the number of lines needed does not equal the number of rows/columns, the solution is not optimal, and can be improved. This is a somewhat perplexing technique, but one that is straightforward to implement and clear to interpret.

Consider the following OCM:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
It is fairly easy to see that it would require only two lines to draw through all of the zeros - one could use a horizontal line through row B, and a vertical line through column 2, for instance. 2≠3 (the number of rows/columns), thus an optimal solution cannot be made.

Consider, on the other hand, our lorry example. Is the solution that we obtained optimal?

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
One can see that, in order to strike through each zero, one would need three lines (for instance, one through column 2, one through row B and one through row A). 3 = 3, thus we have an optimal solution that cannot be improved upon.

====Revision of the Opportunity Cost Matrix====

In the event of achieving a non-optimal assignment, one must revise the OCM. There are several steps in this process:

#Check the costs uncovered by the drawn lines
#Identify the smallest uncovered value
#Subtract this value from all of the uncovered costs
#Add this value to any costs that are at the intersection of any two drawn lines

Take our non-optimal solution from earlier. The smallest uncovered value was one. Subtracting one from each uncovered value gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Adding one to the point of intersection of the two lines (in this example, one could have drawn them through row B and column 2, therefore the point of intersection is cell B2) gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Again, only two lines (this time, they must be through row A and column 3) are needed. They intersect at cell A3. The smallest uncovered value is, again, 1. So, subtracting one from each uncovered cell and adding one to cell A3 gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Finally, the minimum number of lines needed to draw through all of the zeros is 3, which is the number of rows/columns. This means any assignment made will be optimal.

==Solutions of Unbalanced Assignment Problems==

The definition of a ''balanced'' AP was one in which the number of agents was the same as the number of tasks. In reality, this is unlikely to be the case - that is, it is unlikely that one would have the same number of taxi drivers to the number of customers, for example. In the event of an unbalanced problem, one must add a '''dummy''', which is a blank/empty row, added to the Cost Matrix, in order to 'balance' the rows, for the sake of the algorithm. If one had, for instance, three agents and four tasks, one would add a '''dummy row'''. On the other hand, if one had four agents and three tasks, one would add a '''dummy task'''. This helps as it means that one agent or task will be left without a 'real' assignment, as using them would increase the total cost of the assignment.

Consider the following example:

A taxi company has four drivers (A, B, C, D), each currently at different locations. Three customers (1, 2, 3) have called the taxi company and need to be driven to their destinations. The total distance that would be travelled, by the driver, is represented in the cost matrix below:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|19
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|17
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|21
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|18
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|21
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''D'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|18
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|17
|}

The Taxi Company wishes to minimise the total distance travelled by its drivers. Find an optimal solution to this Assignment Problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Solution:

Initially, one must add a dummy column, in order to make this a 'balanced' problem. Let this column be called &quot;Row 4&quot;. Since there isn't actually a fourth customer, all of the costs in this matrix will be zero. This will mean that the otherwise most expensive taxi in the matrix will result in being assigned the dummy - in other words, it won't be used in the problem.

First, let's carry out row and column reduction:

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

As one can see, it would take only three lines (through rows A and B and column 1) to strike-through all of the zeros in the Opportunity Cost Matrix. Thus, revision is needed in order to find an optimal solution. These lines cross in cells A4 and B4. The smallest uncovered value is 3. Removing this from all of the cells covered by one line and adding it to all of the cells that are covered twice gives the following revised OCM: '''I don't have the time to fix this, but it's wrong.  In the 2nd column, subtracting 15 from 15 does not yield 4, therefore, we've already arrived at the optimal solution because 4 lines can be used to mark through the entire matrix.'''


{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20%

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B'''

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}


This time, it would take four lines to strike through all of the zeros in the OCM. This means that any solution obtained is optimal. The only possible solution is:

:A → 1
:B → 3
:C → 2
:D → 4*
:Z = 11 + 13 + 18 = 42

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Of course, customer 4 is in fact a 'dummy' - i.e., D doesn't actually transport any customer. Thus, the only three drivers needed are drivers A, B and C. Driver A will transport Passenger 1, Driver B will transport Passenger 3 and Driver C will transport Passenger 2.

==Maximisation Problems==

All of the examples that have been considered so far have been Minimisation problems - in other words, they've been ones in which the aim of the problem was to minimise a cost. Assignment problems can, however, be used for the opposite reason - to maximise a gain or a profit. Consider the example of ice-cream seller. They know that, in certain towns, they will sell more icecream than others. The day, too, changes how much ice-cream s/he sells - they only drive the van on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday (M, W and S respectively). Taking into account that the ice-cream van can only visit one town at a time, which town should the ice-cream van visit on which day, in order to maximise his/her profit.

The following cost-matrix represents the earnings (in £100s) for each town (A, B, C) on each day (M, W, S):

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|}

If one were to carry out row and column reduction, as per usual, and then to come to a solution, it would be a solution that gave the '''minimum''' profit that the ice-cream van could make. In order to find the '''maximum''' profit, we first identify the largest value in the matrix. In this case, it is 13. We then subtract each number from 13 and assign the new number to the cell the original number was in. In other words, cell A1 (of current value 10) becomes &lt;math&gt; 13 - 10 = 3 &lt;/math&gt;.

After completing this process for the whole matrix, we achieve the following:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|}

We can now carry out row and column reduction, as we usually would. This, eventually, results in the following Opportunity Cost Matrix:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}

Since the smallest number of lines that can be used to strike-through each of the zeros in this matrix is 3 (which is equal to the number of rows/columns), an '''optimal assignment''' can be made. The only possible assignment is:

:A → M
:B → S
:C → W

On the cost matrix, this gives us:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|}

This means that:

:On Monday, the van will visit town A.
:On Wednesday, the van will visit town B.
:On Saturday, the van will visit town C.

The total profit gives:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = 10 + 12 + 13 = 35&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the maximum total profit of the ice-cream van is £3500.

==About SMU-DE==

'''Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education''' was established in 2001 by the [[Sikkim Manipal University]] of Health, Medical and Technological Sciences as part of its efforts to bring education to the masses to fulfil the growing demand for professionals.
SMU is university in [[Sikkim]] which is joint venture in between Government of Sikkim &amp; [[Manipal Education]] to offer regular &amp; [[Distance education]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smude.edu.in/users/distancehome.aspx|title=Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditations/ Recognition==

The University is recognized by [[DEC]], [[UGC]], &amp; [[Ministry of HRD]] to offer program in 9 discipline. The [[Association of Indian Universities]] (AIU) recognises SMUDE conferred degrees as on par with the degrees conferred by its members.[[Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education]] provides courses in the follwoing disciplines:&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Information Technology&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Management &lt;br /&gt;
•	Commerce&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Journalism &amp; Mass Com&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Apparel &amp; Fashion Design&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Telecom technology&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Allied Health Science&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Bio Informatics &amp; Biotechnology&lt;br /&gt;
•	Hospitality &amp; Tourism &lt;br /&gt;

==EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;==

''EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the next generation learning system that fully takes advantage of modern teaching techniques to create a virtual classroom where students come together to learn from distinguished faculty and each other. EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; makes it possible for students to collaborate on team-oriented learning tasks like assignments and case studies| through audio, visual and IM aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edunxt.smude.edu.in/|title=SMU Login}}&lt;/ref&gt;


''EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;'' makes it possible for a student to self-learn, since self-motivation has always been a Distance Learning issue. Learners of the same course can, for example, chat with each other and faculty members in real time to clarify their doubts or read faculty [[blogs]] and comment on them. The concept of mentoring means faculty members will be available as guides to hold student hand through the lonely process of self-study.&lt;br /&gt;

==Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;==
To simplify technology and make it fun to study, [[SMUDE]] has introduced Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is the education buddy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smude.edu.in/edunxt|title=Eddie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is the new cute kid on the block! Goofy, amiable and lovable, he believes that being a smart team player is more important than being a hard single player. Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is always on the move and wants his studies to be flexible, convenient and accessible. He is here to tell students in their own language how they can use, have fun with and learn with EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Core 4 (C4) ==

This A2 module is the fourth and final '''core''' mathematics module in the series. C4 requires knowledge from previous core modules (such as differentials from C3), and is assessed in a single 90 minute paper consisting of approximately 7 questions. The module consists of 6 main topic areas:

'''•Partial Fractions'''
# Addition and subtraction of algebraic fractions
# Splitting of a fraction into partial fractions
# Use/revision of algebraic division for improper fractions

'''•Binomial Expansion'''
# Binomial Expansion when n is a fraction or a negative number
# Binomial Expansion for (k+...) instead of (1+...) by taking out a factor of k
# Use of partial fractions to produce the Binomial Expansion of more difficult expressions

''In this topic, earlier C2 work on the Binomial Expansion is developed to include expansions involving fractions and negative numbers. Questions often require expressing problems in partial fraction form first.'' 

'''•Co-ordinate Geometry'''
# Use of parametric equations (using the parameter t) to define co-ordinates of points on a curve and solve related problems
# Conversion of parametric equations to cartesian equations
# Use of parametric equations to find the area under a curve

''Parametric equations are introduced here, and finding relationships between x and y via a parameter t is studied.''

'''•Vectors'''

'''•Differentiation'''

'''•Integration'''

&lt;math&gt; \int \sin{kx}\ dx = - \frac{1}{k} \cos{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int \cos{kx}\ dx = \frac{1}{k} \sin{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{1}{x}\ dx = \ln{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\ dx = \ln{f(x)} + c,\ \mbox{provided}\ f(x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
''(this is usually resolved by taking the modulus of the f(x) result before we take the natural log of this)''






'''Note''': ''This book is so you can gain an alternative explanation for the concepts described and it should NOT replace your C4 textbook!''

      <comment>/* Pits */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you start any kind of online game you need to take a minute to sit down and consider some of the following questions:

#What is my game called?
#What is my target audience?
#Can I afford the cost and time of managing my own game?
#Am I good at working with people?
#What competition already exists for the game I’m going to make?
#How will my game work?

=='''It’s All In A Name'''==

A name can make or break a game. Pits of Doom isn’t anything exciting, but this is a tutorial game, not something I’ve made to produce to lots of people. Your name should be memorable, but not too hard to spell, say, or remember. Shorter names seem to work better as well, but that’s more of a personal preference.

=='''Hit the Target'''==

Many people overlook target audiences. When you design your game you need to keep in mind who actually plays your game. If your game is for young children then you don’t want a game that’s overly complex, hard to navigate through and has few images. Also take into account your audience’s familiarity with computers and the Internet. A child isn’t as likely to be able to understand complex directions or sequences whereas a hard core video game addict should have no problem navigating menus and following technical directions.

=='''Audience Tips:'''==

#Games made for ages 5-7 should have lots of pictures, big buttons, be easy to play, and have few words to keep younger children interested. There should be lots of games, puzzles, animations, and things to keep kids from getting bored. A suggestion would be using popular cartoon characters as they play the game.
#Games made for ages 8-17 should have more text, but also a lot of pictures. You want to make sure it’s easy enough for the younger players to get around and play, but hard enough to keep the interest of older players. Most games made for teenagers will automatically attract younger kids and adults at the same time.
#Adult games have more of a risk. Keeping younger players from seeing what they shouldn’t can be a hassle. One thing to keep in mind is that if younger viewers see content they shouldn’t you could be getting some very angry messages from parents of younger players. A suggestion would be using some kind of way to make sure the player is over 18, such as needing to give a money transaction to play. For an adult game you can assume they have decent computer skills and are possibly hard core gamers. Complexity and strategy and action should play big parts in these games.
#A mix of all ages is the hardest challenge. Games have to have a mix of easy play, medium play, and hard play for all age levels. You’ll have to manage keeping the attention of all age groups. This usually happens on its own if you have a really popular game, because everyone wants to play no matter what his or her age is.

=='''Carrying the Costs'''==

Games are inherently expensive. The bigger and more popular your game becomes the more it’ll cost you to keep it up and running. Are you willing to put up the expensive of domain names, servers, bandwidth, hardware upgrades, technical support, and so forth and so on? My biggest game has over 100k members and costs me over $300 a month. just in server costs. That’s over  $3,600 a year just to keep the game online. Then you have to factor in advertising, domain names, and additional expenses such as postage and letter heads and office supplies. Will you be able to carry the costs of the game’s expenses if your game isn’t generating enough revenue to support itself? These are all really important questions. Take the time to research how much it costs to buy a domain, get hosting setup, and any other additional fees you may run into before you start.

=='''Cost Solutions'''==

Just because you don’t have a big budget, don’t let that limit you!! There are several things you can do to limit your expenses.

#Limit the numbers of members who can join your game. This will reduce your bandwidth — the amount of data passed back and forth over the internet — and will encourage your members to stay active. You can even go through and delete accounts that are inactive after a certain period of time.
#Limit how many people can play online at a single time. This isn’t the best solution, but sometimes it’s a good option if your game is popular but you don’t have many people that play online at any particular time during the day.
#Don’t expand your hosting/server needs as your costs increase. If you can’t afford it, then you can’t afford it. Make your members deal with slower response times and hangups. Not great for customer service but at least they can all play.
#Don’t advertise. I know this goes against the grain, you make a new game and you really want to share it, but I’ve found word of mouth is the biggest and best form of advertising out there. The more people that know about your game the more will want to play and the higher your expenses.
#Make your game a “friends only” game. Limit it to people you know or friends of people you know. If it’s just a game you plan on making as a hobby, something to do in your spare time, this is a great alternative.

=='''I’m a People Person'''==

Even if you aren’t planning on it, your game will generate a lot of interaction among people. People will email about problems or questions or help constantly. If you’re not great with people or you can’t be bothered then you’re in for an eye opener. A website without any kind of support doesn’t do well in the big scheme of things. Take the time to evaluate yourself. Are the benefits worth the downfalls?

=='''Overtake the Competition'''==

Is your game 100% unique? Chances are that it’s not. Take a day or two to find any other site you can that’s even a little bit similar to the game you have in mind. Join them and check them out. What are features you like? What do you dislike? The more time you spend going through your competition’s setup the more you’ll generate a feel for what you want your own game to be like, what features are a given, or could be improved upon. Knowledge is power, and giving your target audience a more useful, more enjoyable game is sure to win their approval and guarantee your popularity.

=='''Liability &amp; Legal Mumbo Jumbo'''==

Terms and conditions or terms of service are a legal agreement between you and anyone who decides to play your game. In this agreement you want to make sure that anyone who uses your website cannot sue you or take you to court!!! Every game you make should have terms and conditions. If you can afford it I highly recommend that you pay a lawyer to write them for you or review what you’ve written up yourself. If not you can take use a copy of the terms and conditions I’ve drawn up for Pits of Doom at the end of this tutorial as a starting point for your own game. Listed below are some general things I would recommend thinking about or including in your terms. Please note this is not legal advice and any tips below are no substitute for getting a lawyer whose familiar with current online practices and laws.

=='''Protect Yourself:'''==
#Make sure you state that by using your website your visitor is legally tied to your Terms and Conditions. This means that they accept them as legal document.
#Make sure you remind your visitors that any changes made to your Terms and Conditions are in place immediately. You don’t want people to tell you they never agreed to your changes.
#Don’t forget to include a statement saying that your visitors can’t hold you responsible for any kinds of fees or losses as a result of using your website. This includes computer problems, buying products off your website, game fees, etc.
#If you make people pay to access your game then you should have a section describing your refund policy – even if you don’t give refunds, tell them that. A refund means you’ll give someone his or her money back. For example if someone paid you twenty dollars and asked for a refund you’d give them their twenty dollars back.
#Be extra careful to protect yourself from things members may put up on your game. Include something saying you’re not responsible for any links, explicit or harmful text/pictures, services or products displayed on the site by members, third parties (people outside members), links and advertisements.
#Remind site visitors that you’re not responsible for any information they share or give out to other members or other places found through your website.
#Mention that visitors post content on your site at their own risk. This lets them know they’re responsible for their own actions.
#Describe your cancellation of accounts. This means you write out why you can delete or ban someone’s account and for what reasons. For example, you can include that if someone cheats or breaks a rule then you can delete their account. If your visitors are paying to play you might want to tell them they can or cannot get their money back for having their account deleted or banned.
#Always have rules. Rules state what is and is not acceptable on your website. Make sure you include harassment, rude or nasty comments, server abuse, emails, etc.
#Add anything else you need that I didn’t mention. Your terms and conditions should be your lifeboat when you’re drowning. Everything you need or think you need should be on board. If you’re not sure if you should add something or not, add it. They can be as long or as short as you want, but it’s always best to be safe now instead of sorry later.

==='''Privacy Policy'''===

A privacy policy lets your members know how you’ll be using any information you ask them. For instance, if you asked a member for their address and telephone number when they joined you might have plans to call them or send them regular mail. Some people don’t like this and others are fine with it. In your privacy policy you should tell people how you plan to use the information they give you when they join your game. So in the example above you would say that if members give out their telephone number they’ll receive phone calls, and if they give out their home address they’ll receive mail. This way people know exactly what happens to the information they give you.

==='''Laws You Should Know About'''===

There are several Internet laws you should concern yourself with if your game is based in the USA. Reading them isn’t an option of whether or not you feel like it, they are a must read. If your game is based outside the USA you’ll need to research yourself to see what rules and regulations you have to comply to.

If your game allows children you need to read the COPPA act. This concerns the privacy of personal information you may gather from children under the age of 13, how it must be stored, and who can have access to it.

Whether your game allows children or not you need to read the Digital Millennium Act. This is one of the largest and most important laws that pertains to you as an Internet game. It outlines things from playing music from current artists on your website to allowing members to upload pictures, videos, and any other content. Knowing about the DMA will protect you from copyright infringement lawsuits which will become one of your biggest concerns as your members generate their own content using or interacting with your game.

Some other minor laws include the Internet Tax Freedom Act and the Communications Decency Act both of which are fairly self explanatory from their names.

=='''Business Licenses'''==

Most counties of USA states require you obtain a business license if your game is generating over x amount of revenue a year. Usually you’re charged based on your annual income and the fee’s are fairly minimal if your game is making less than $10,000 a year. You can usually get an application from your local chamber of commerce or county treasury. You will typically be charged once or twice a year.

==='''Sole Proprietor vs LLC'''===

A sole proprietor is one person who owns an entire business or service. If your game is just a hobby chances are you’ll never need anything else other than this. All revenue you make from your game must be claimed on your personal income tax and your tax return will be calculated as if it was a part of your typical salary. In most states you don’t have to report additional income unless it exceeds $5,000 but you’ll need to check your state laws to confirm that.

An LLC, or limited liability company, is the other option. It separates you from your game and removes the chance that someone can sue you as an individual. Instead they must sue the game itself which means there’s no possibility you could loose your house or car or property. If your game is making more than $5,000 a year in revenue an LLC or something similar should be in the works.

==='''Copyrights'''===

Inherently anything you make yourself is automatically copyrighted by you, even if you never file copyrighted paperwork or register a trademark. However in a legal case having a certified copyright is a must.

A copyright is easy and fairly cheap to file.  You can do it online now through the Electronic Copyright Service. It costs about $35 per copyright and takes anywhere from 6-8 weeks to have it approved. Once the copyright is approved you’ll get an official letter with a copyright identification number. Now you have a legal document verifying you hold the copyright to your game.

A copyright filed after January 1st, 1978 for a single author will last for the life of the author plus an additional 70  years. A copyright filed for joint authors will last until the life of the last surviving author plus 70 years. If you ever decide to sell your game you can easily transfer your copyright from you to the new legal owner.

==='''Trademarks'''===

These are a bit tricky. I wouldn’t ever try and register a trademark without a lawyer, there are just too many inns and outs and little things you have to know about. A trademark costs anywhere from $275 to $325 depending on the classes you register it for. As your game gets more popular a trademark will ensure you own all legal rights to name branding, products and any additional services that arise as your game grows.

The biggest problem with trademarks is trying to find a unique name. If your trademarked name sounds too much like other trademarked names it will be denied. If your trademark is spelled differently by phonetically sounds the same it will also be denied.

Trademarks are expensive but well worth it as your game expands and grows. You can file trademarks electronically at the Trademark Office.

==='''Gambling &amp; Gaming'''===

This might not seem like something you’d think about as you’re developing a game but it is something you need to be aware of. If you offer “pay for play” gaming where your members will win prizes as a result of playing your game this is considered gambling. Gambling is defined as playing a game for money or property, or betting on an uncertain outcome.

In many states gambling is illegal without a proper license. In some states it’s illegal period. If your business model is considered gambling you’ll need to make sure you can get a license for it. Then you also run into the problem of making sure that you only have members from states where you have a valid gambling license. Over the Internet this is fairly hard to do.

For instance, let’s say you have a legal gambling license in West Virginia where your business is based. Your website attracts individuals from all over the United States. Someone from Virgina signs up and starts playing your game. Almost all forms of gambling in Virginia are illegal unless sanctioned by the state itself. Now you have someone illegally gambling on your website which could lead to future complications for yourself.

So how do you get around it? Simple, you don’t. Charging money for your game cannot be tied to winning any kind of prize or property. That means you could charge members for something completely non-related to a prize you’re giving out, or allow both paying and non-paying members to have an equal chance of winning the prize. If a member doesn’t have to pay anything in order to win a prize then it’s not considered gambling.

=='''Gears &amp; Cogs'''==

Now it’s time to set your brain into motion. Write down the biggest features you want to include in your game. Then go ahead and break it down into smaller pieces. This will help you express all of your ideas before you start making anything and should increase the usability of anything you end up making.

=='''Putting It All Together — Pits of Doom'''==

Here is something I’ve thrown together to give you an idea of the thought process I went through when coming up with the Pits of Doom game.

I chose a really generic name for this game simply because it’s a tutorial on making your own online game. Here are some names I might consider if this was a game I was making as a serious revenue earner:

    Black Abyss

    Infinity Nights

    Dark Haven

The target audience for this game is boys between the ages of 12-18. That means they’re all in middle school or higher. They’re probably used to seeing shoot em up/slasher video games by this age. Most of them have a fairly high computer usage skills at this point, but some of them are young enough to struggle. That means my navigation and layout should be simple to a point, but maybe the game play can be much more complicated.

Some similar online fighting games are:

games.swirve.com/utopia/ - an online strategy game. I find this one to be way too complicated for younger players. It has some great ideas, but it’s a bit overwhelming when you go in to play for the first time.

www.elveron.com – what do you think about this one? Follow the link and ask yourself, what do I like, what don’t I like? What could be done better?

weewar.com

kdice.com

Now write down some similarities you saw. What about the differences? Things that are similar in all games are probably features you’d want to strongly consider having yourself, or to some variation. Those are things that have made these games popular.

This game isn’t ever going to go up on any of my servers except for this tutorial code, so it won’t cost me much of anything to maintain. Can’t afford the cost of having a game online but still interested in learning how to make one? No problem, all you have to do is download and install XAMPP. Now you can run the game right on your own computer at home. Once it’s installed you can setup a database and get busy. Need more help getting XAMPP up and going? Try this tutorial.

Finally, I took the time to define the features I’ll be adding to the game and broke them down:

==='''Game World'''===

Each map in the game is called a map node.

There can be an unlimited number of map nodes in the world.

==='''Map Nodes'''===

Each map node has a name, a description.

Each map node can have unlimited coordinates.

==='''Coordinates'''===

X, Y, Z value.

Has 1 object associated with it.

Wall value:

        * 0 = open, they can move to that coordinate
        * 1 = there is a wall here

Has 1 transfer node associated with it, detailing that moving to this coordinate will force the user to move to that coordinate on the new map node.

Has a level associated with it, detailing that moving to this coordinate will force the user to move up or down one level.

==='''Item Objects'''===

G = gold (random amount each time)

T = treasure

S = sword

A = armor

L = lantern

O = oil

H = shield

C = enemy creature/monster

X = pit, chance of them dying, or draining all magic, or dropping to a lower level

T = health tonic

M = magic potion

S = store where they can buy items

L = ladder, you can climb up or down to another level

==='''Characters'''===

These are owned by members.

They have a name, gender, and breed (monster, human, elf, dwarf, centaur, fairy).

When the members is online, they are always associated with an active coordinate.

They can equip items and use them to help their statistics.

The more they play the higher the character’s statistics go.

Characters can fight other characters and monsters in the game.

If a character kills another character then they get to keep all of the items the character they killed had equipped and any gold they’d collected in the past 20 minutes.

Characters can trade items with each other if they’re both on the same coordinate.

====Statistics====

Health

Speed

Intelligence

Strength

Agility

Fighting Level

Magic Level

Magic Amount – how much magic they have they can currently used

Weapon Equipped

Spell Equipped

Armor Equipped

Shield Equipped

==='''Members'''===

Has a username, login, and password.

Keeps an email to send them password information.

Keeps track of when they are online or offline so it can activate their character.

Starts off 500G

It costs 100G to create a character.

Members can trade in gold for better weapons, however they must get the character to a store first.

When a member is online all of their characters are active in the game.

Members can trade any item they have among their own characters even if they aren’t on the same coordinate.

As soon as a member logs off or closes the game window all of their characters go inactive unless they are currently being fought by another character or attacked by a monster.

==='''Mail'''===

Members can send messages to other members in the game.

==='''Messageboard'''===

Members can post on a community message board.

==='''Best of the Best'''===

Top members and characters in the game.

Oldest characters in the game.

Strongest characters in the game.

==='''Game Objective'''===

The objective of this game is to navigate around the game world and gain prestige for your characters by keeping them alive as long as possible.

The more characters you have the easier it is to explore the world but the harder it is to keep all of them alive.

Pits are one of the biggest hazards in the game, they continuously drop you to lower and lower levels. The lower you are on any map the harder the monsters are to defeat.

==='''Pits'''===

If you run into one of these you will have one of these random possibilities:

Die

Lose all your money

Lose your best item

Lose all your magic strength

Lose all your value in 1 statistics area

Have one value in your statistics areas cut in half

Be teleported to a random location on any map

Drop down to a lower level (if there is one).

==='''Monsters'''===

These are automatically generated by the game. The further down you are on any map the harder they are to defeat but the bigger the reward for killing one.

==='''Player Movement'''===

You won’t be able to tell if you’ve hit a wall, a pit, or an empty space until at least one of your players has explored the map already. That means you have to visit the entire map before you can see what the map looks like from a top down view. This makes it more exciting as you won’t know what you’ll find until you go there.

Phew! That’s a lot but this is actually a fairly straight forward and small game. I’m sure you can already think of a hundred different things you would or could add to it from what I’ve described already.

Now, you’re ready to start learning how to make this game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the best things to do if you’ve never made a game before or you don’t have much programming experience is to break things down into their most basic parts. We’ll start off making this game by doing some really really simple programming and then adding functionality until the game is complete. It doesn’t look like much now, but at the end of this tutorial you’ll be able to download a fully working version with an installation file that you can use under the GNU public license to modify and edit as you wish.

The last thing I want to mention is the teaching style I’ll be using throughout all of the lessons in this tutorial. I’m big on letting people try things on their own before I give them the answer. Pretend you’re asked to take a history test. If I was to just hand you an answer sheet with all the right bubbles filled in you’d never learn anything from the test. This is a theory I hold to. In each of the lessons in this tutorial you’ll find two versions of every file I’ve made. One file will have no code in it. That way you can try to program this game from scratch by yourself. But if that’s too daunting don’t worry. The other version of the file will have all the working code inside of it.

Even if you’re not a programmer I encourage you to try your hand at programming each lesson. I’ll go over some of the basic concepts you’ll need to complete the programming before concluding with the reasoning behind what I’ve done so far.
Lesson Concepts

==About PHP==

PHP is a server side programming language. That means any code you write on any PHP file will never be visible to anyone who goes to a file with php code on it. The benefits of this are you don’t have to worry about people stealing any code you’ve written. When someone views a PHP page, all they see is the HTML or text you’ve generated with PHP or typed onto the page yourself.

PHP files have a .php extension. A lot of people I’ve talked to take that to mean PHP files cannot display HTML or Javascript. That’s incorrect. The .php extension is the server’s way of knowing it needs to evaluate any PHP code on the file before the person requesting the page sees it.

The biggest draw back with PHP is that it’s a server side programming language. That means any time you want to make a change to what the user sees on the page they either have to refresh it, or navigate to a new page. Websites where you see changes applied immediately (google mail, wordpress, to name a few) use something called AJAX. AJAX is an asynchronous relay between a server and a user’s browser. This means they don’t have to refresh the page to see changes. If you’re interested in something like that then this tutorial is still the one for you. PHP is often used in combination with AJAX to create more dynamic web pages. However, I won’t go over any AJAX in this tutorial, so once you’re done making this game you’ll need to find some AJAX tutorials.

==Printing to the Screen==

All PHP code is delimited by a start and end php tag that looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
echo “Hello World!!”;
print “Hey there!”;
echo “&lt;b&gt;WOW!!&lt;/b&gt;”;
print “This is sooooo neat…”;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The PHP start and end tags are lot like matching HTML tags. If you don’t have any HTML experience I strongly recommend you take some of the tutorials on lissaexplains.com before you continue with the lessons here.

If you don’t have the correct start and end tags that would be one reason why someone could see your PHP code on the screen. Without the PHP tags the server doesn’t have any way to know what you’ve typed needs to be evaluated as PHP.

In the code above you’ll also see print and echo statements. It doesn’t really matter which one you use, but this is how you print something to the screen. Notice on the third print statement there is HTML in the quotation marks. There is nothing wrong with putting HTML inside of your PHP, in fact that’s one of the great things about it.

A few syntax things to keep in mind:

1. You always need matching start and end &lt;?php ?&gt; tags.

2. PHP statements always end with a semicolon ;

3. When you echo something to the screen it should be inside of single or double quotation marks

4. If you need to put quotes in your print statements then you should escape it like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
echo “And he said \”Hi Mom, how are you today?\”&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The backslash tells PHP to evaluate the quotation mark as text and not as the end of the string.

5. You won’t see an error in PHP until you go to view the page. That’s because php is only evaluated on runtime. Sometimes this is very frustrating, and you’ve probably seen error codes before. If you get an error message read it, it usually tells you what you did wrong in your code.

==Common PHP Errors &amp; Solutions==

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you forgot a ” or a ‘ somewhere. There should always be at the start and end of a string. If you have a matching pair, make sure you don’t have one too many. If you have quotes inside of your string then you need to escape them using a backslash like this: \” or \’

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘}’ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you have some kind of multi-line statement and you either forgot a bracket or having too many brackets. Brackets always come in pairs. Sometimes it mean you’re missing a semicolon at the end of the previous statement.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘”‘ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you probably forgot a parentheses before of after the DOUBLE quote. Sometimes it could also mean that you forgot to escape the double quote.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected “‘” in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you probably forgot a parentheses before of after the SINGLE quote. Sometimes it could also mean that you forgot to escape the SINGLE quote.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘;’ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means that you’re missing something before the semicolon at the end of your statement. Usually its a closing parentheses. However, it could also mean you have a semicolon in a position PHP is not expecting one to be in. That usually happens in loops.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_EXIT in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you forgot a semicolon before an exit; call

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in [file location] on line [#]'''

This usually means you forgot a semicolon or your function isn’t returning like it should be.

==Variables==

In PHP a variable is defined by a $ dollar sign. That means any word with a dollar sign in front of it will usually be evaluated for some other kind of content. The easiest way to think of a variable is to think about a jar. You can put things into a jar and take things out. You can stick a name on a jar but then decide you want to change that name later. Variables also work this way.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

//this is a comment, comments are for you
//they aren’t processed as code
//get into the habit of leaving comments for yourself so if you come back later
//you can remember what you did or what you were trying to do

$myvariable = “Hello”;
$mysecond = ” World!”;

echo $myvariable;
echo $mysecond;

print “&lt;br&gt;”;

echo “$myvariable $mysecond&lt;br&gt;”;

$myvariable = 2;

echo $myvariable;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example I have two variables. You can assign them a value using the equal sign. Variables in PHP are dynamic. That means you can assign them to one type (a string) and then reassing them to another type (an integer) without any kind of conversion. If that just went right over your head, don’t worry. All you really need to know is the syntax to assign a variable.

==If-Else Statements==

Games are all about decision making and that’s the benefit of a programming language. In order for anything to work in this game we’ll have to set it up to follow the rules and logic I briefly outlined in Lesson 1. To do this we need to respond differently based upon the choice the user playing our game makes.
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;?php

if ($_POST['button']) //someone clicked a button
{

echo “You pressed a button!”;
}
else
{
echo “You haven’t pressed a button yet. Go ahead, try it!”;
}

?&gt;
&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;
&lt;input type=”submit” name=”button” value=”Press Me!”&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example you see a .php file that has a section of PHP code and then below that it has some regular HTML. The part to pay attention to is the if-else section. Here we display a different message to the user based upon if they’ve clicked on our button or not. IF the button has been pressed, the code between the brackets { } of the if section will execute. Otherwise the code between the else brackets will execute. I’m sure you can already see the power of PHP in this one example. If you’d like more help with If-else statements and some more examples of if-else statements read my tutorial here. This covers some PHP programming concepts more in depth and gives more examples.

==Form Basics==

A form is one way to get information on what the user is doing back and forth to the server and PHP. All forms must have a start and end &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags. In order to submit any information from a form to the server you MUST have a submit button. Without a submit button you won’t be able to tell the page that the user is trying to send you data about what he/she is doing. You can see a small form in the example above. It has both the start and end form tags, as well as a button. If that looks unfamiliar to you then you really should go back to lissaexplains.com and do some catching up on your HTML skills!

==$_GET and $_POST Variables==

In order to get data from a form PHP stores two special variables for us. The variables get data depending on the type of METHOD used in the form. If you look at our example above, we use a POST method. That means all the names and values of our form are sent to the server and stored inside of the $_POST variable. That way we can pull information from those variables to see if a user clicked a certain button or link. In the example above, we’re checking to see if someone has clicked on our submit button that we’ve named button (yay for generic names!). If we’d called our submit button BOB and didn’t change the if statement to check for $_POST['BOB'] then we’d never see the words telling us we’d pressed the button. As far as PHP is concerned, we no longer have a submit button called button so there’s no way it will ever be pressed.

==Summary==

There you have it. I’ve not covered in brief (and sorry if it’s not brief enough for you — or too brief!!) all of the major concepts in the first part of the tutorial files you can download below. Again, if you’re up for the challenge, try programming this file yourself by opening the character2.php file. At the top of the page it will outline everything I’m trying to accomplish in this particular file for this lesson. If you just want to see some working code then download character.php and jump right into the next lesson.

==Game Files (click to view)==

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson2/character.txt character.php]

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson2/character2.txt character.php (no source code)]

You’ll need to copy/paste the source from one of these files and give it a .php extension for the last part of the tutorial to make sense. All of these files are viewable as .txt files so you can see the PHP code inside of them. If they were .php files you wouldn’t ever be able to see the .php code. Do you remember why?

==Lesson Reasoning==

A lot of the logic behind the game we’re going to make has to do with movement of a character around the game world. Remember there is a difference between a member and a character. A member is an actual person who will login and play this game by the time we’re done. A character is something the member will use to navigate the game. Each member can have multiple characters.

Character.php is from the point of view of one character. Each character will be faced with the option of which direction they can move — left, right, forward or back. Every time a character moves we’ll need to evaluate the move and take some action depending upon the new location they’ve moved to.

Although this file only checks for a single direction and places the “treasure” in one specific location, it’s a step in the right direction. With this file we know which direction has been selected, we can compare that direction to the new position they’ve moved to, and we can print a message on the screen indicating if the character won or lost based upon finding the treasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the last lesson we covered how to make a form, check to see if a button has been pressed, and display a message according to whether the user found the treasure or not. Now it’s time to take our very simple navigation page to the next level: random treasure location.

In our final game, the position of the treasure will be pre-determined by data in our database. However, we won’t know what position the treasure is in as the user is navigating their character around the game because this information will be loaded as they play.

In our next lesson we’re going to apply a more advanced concept to figuring out if the treasure is in the correct location. Instead of always knowing where the treasure is, we’re going to make the treasure start in a random direction each time the page is loaded. That way we have to check every time to figure out where the treasure is, and if the player will fall into a pit or not.
Lesson Concepts

==Functions==

In programming, a function is a great way to break bigger tasks into smaller more manageable pieces, or reduce the need of having to write the same piece of code over and over again. In PHP the syntax for a function is very simple:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

function myfunction ($parameter1, $parameter2)

{

echo $parameter1 . ” ” . $parameter2;
}

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is a really simple function called myfunction. It takes two parameters and simply echoes them on the screen whenever you call it. The periods you see in the echo statement are a way to concatenate or join the two variables together with a space in between them.

Calling a function is just as easy as making one. Anywhere you want myfunction to print something on the screen all you have to do is:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

echo “Hey there, here is what myfunction has to say: “;

myfunction(“Hello”, “World!”);

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you were to run this you’d see: Hey there, here is what myfunction has to say: Hello World! Not only can a function print to the screen, it can return values you can then store into variables. Let’s take a look at this function:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

function Mod5 ($number)

{

return $number % 5;
}

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This function takes any number you give it and mods it by 5. If you aren’t familiar with the modulus operator, all you need to know is that it returns the remainder from the division, and not the number you’d get if you divided $number by 5.

Now let’s see what how we’d use a function that returns a value instead of printing it on the screen:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

//declare our function
function Mod5 ($number)

{
return $number % 5;
}

if ($_POST['number']) //they’ve entered a number
{

echo “Your number is: ” . $_POST['number'] . “&lt;br/&gt;”;

$number = myfunction($_POST['number']); //we store the modulous of what they entered back into the number variable

echo “Your number % 5 is: $number”;
}
else //show them a form to enter a number

{
?&gt;

&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;

Please Enter a Number: &lt;input type=”text” name=”number”&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=”submit” name=”submit” value=”submit” /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;?php
} //don’t forget to close our ELSE statement
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example we’ve taken the number a user enters into a text box and then display the number back to them along with the remainder of that number when it’s divided by 5.

One of the great things about PHP is that it comes with a huge collection of pre-defined functions you can use when you program. You can take a look at all the functions by going to php.net. The one function I want to touch on in this lesson is the random function.

As you can probably tell, you don’t always need to know all the little specifics that go on inside of a function as long as it always gives you the results you’re expecting. The same goes with the random function. I could go into details on how it takes the current time on your computer and does a bunch of mathematical stuff to it — but that’s just plain boring!

The short of it is, the rand function takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is the lowest number you want it to generate when it runs. The second number is the highest number you want it to generate when it runs. So, if you wanted a random number between 1 and 4, including the numbers 1 and 4 you’d do this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

echo “My random number is: “ . rand(1, 4);

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

View the page with this php code. Now refresh the page. You’ll notice the number is constantly changing.

One other function you’ll need to know is the unset() function. This function is great, you pass it a variable or an object (don’t worry, we’ll get to those later) and it sets the value of that function to null. Think of it as taking a jar of cookies, opening the lid, and dumping all the cookies on the ground. That’s essentially what the unset() function does.

Congratulations, you now know how the rand and unset functions work. You’ll need both of these for this lesson!

==Sessions==

Now one of the biggest problems we run into is how to keep track of a user’s past responses. Or how to keep track of anything about the user from one page to another. That’s where sessions come in. Sessions are a way to track information about the user as they go from one page to another. Eventually we’ll be using information from the database to track a lot of the moves a user is making with their characters, but we’ll still need to know who the member is as they go from page to page. For right now, we’ll use sessions to keep track of the direction the user picked. And now, instead of letting the user continue to pick a direction after they’ve fallen into the pit we’re going to give them a game over message until they decide to reset the game and try again.

Sessions are very easy to use. They work almost exactly like the $_POST and $_GET variables you can use to access information about what someone has entered on to a page. However, there’s a few major differences:

   1. You can set the values of the $_SESSION variable
   2. Session variables remain with the user until you tell them to expire, they don’t change page by page.
   3. Session variables can be set to expire so they don’t last forever, or you can set them so they never expire and DO last forever.

Using sessions now will get you familiar with them before the programming becomes more complicated.

If you’ve done anything with cookies before then sessions will be a breeze for you. Sessions are a good alternative to cookies because if a browser has cookie functionality turned off you will still be able to keep information about a user from one page to another. If that went right over your head don’t worry, it’s not essential to this lesson.

There’s one thing you have to keep in mind about sessions. In order to use a session you have to call a special function at the top of every php page, BEFORE YOU DO ANY KIND OF OUTPUT!! This last is important. If you try to output anything before calling the session_start() function you will get an error.

Now let’s setup a simple session. Create two pages, one called welcome.php and the other called main.php. Welcome.php is an example of a web page you might see that greets you and asks you what your name is. Main.php is an example of a page you might look at after you’ve visited the welcome.php page.

In welcome.php we have this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
session_start(); //the first thing we do is start our sessions

if ($_POST['name']) //they entered their name in the form
{
$_SESSION['name'] = $_POST['name'];

//now we’re going automatically to redirect them our next page
//using a function called header() that’s built into PHP
header(“Location: main.php”);
exit;
}

?&gt;
&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;

Enter your name for our first session variable! &lt;input type=”text” name=”name” /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=”submit” name=”submit” value=”All Done!”&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, inside of main.php we’re going to put this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
session_start(); //we have to start our session again to get the data we saved before

echo “Welcome to the main menu “ . $_SESSION['name'] . “!”;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the main.php file we pull out the information we stored in the session variable for name and print it back out on the screen. Nifty! Now we know, no matter which page this user goes to from now on, as long as we call session_start() we’ll be able to access their name from the variables $_SESSION['name'].

Congratulations! You should now understand the basic concept of sessions.

==Summary==

In this lesson we learned about how to make our own function and talked about how PHP has it’s own predefined functions we can use to make our life a whole lot easier. I talked about how to make a function print something on the screen versus a function that returns a value. Functions that return a value can also be printed on the screen, but you’d have to put an echo in front of the function call to do that.

Next we talked about sessions. Sessions are a way to store data as the user moves from page to page around your website. Without sessions we wouldn’t be able to tell who was who as multiple people will eventually load this game and try to play it. Right now we’ll be using sessions to keep track of a game being over or not, but eventually we’ll only use sessions to keep track of which user a person is as they play.

==Game Files==

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson3/character_v2.txt character.php]

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson3/character2.txt character2.php (no source code)]

Note: these are text files so you can copy/paste all the source code.
Lesson Reasoning

In this lesson character.php now has the treasure starting at a random location. If the user picks the incorrect location they get a game over message instead of being able to pick a direction again. In order to play again the user has to click on a reset button to start the game all over again. I’ve introduced functions, sessions, and a more abstract checking.

Once we start pulling information from the database we won’t know anything about the character’s current location at runtime other than their x,y,z coordinates and the map they’re on. Information about items in that position will all have to be tested each time the character tries to move somewhere. By introducing the treasure in random locations we start to get into the habit of checking information about our location as we select a particular direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chorus====

The Chorus is a group of actors that together speak, sing, and dance in one body. The Chorus is part ritual part thematic device that play a much larger role in Greek Tragedy than in the other genres. One of the primary functions of the chorus is to provide atmosphere and, in some ways, underscore the tragic action. When the hero is treading upon major conflict or leading us into the rising action of the plot, the chorus, in a way, are heralders of inevitable disaster and instill a sense of fear or suspense in the audience. In some ways the Chorus can represent the audience's ideal response to the play. Nietzsche feels that the Chorus, and it's chants and songs, helped the audience better connect with the character, revealing the essence of the tragedy.

In early tragedies the Chorus was dominant. They could be used to fill time when the one main actor went off-stage to change roles or for scene changes. The Chorus could sometimes have as much as half the lines in a single show. In Aeschylus' plays, the Chorus could even serve as the protagonist or antagonist.

There is a disagreement among historians as to the actual size of the standard Chorus. Some say it started at 50, then changed to 12 with Aeschylus, then to 15 with Sophocles and Euripides. Those who say the Chorus was always as small as 12 or 15, believe that the 50 Chorus members were divided amongst the four plays with which the author was competing. This helped reduce the cost of a production. Sometimes the Chorus could be as small as three people, or there could be a second Chorus.

The Chorus usually entered with a stately march, sometimes singing. Although, they could enter from multiple directions. Onstage formation would consist of three to five member lines. While the Chorus sung and danced in unison, there could be two groups that took turns. They would exchange dialogue with the characters, sometimes as individuals. When it came to acting, the members of the Chorus would respond appropriately to the situation.

Old Comedy Chorus had 24 members and had approximately two semi-choruses. One of each gender. Chorus in comedies could have mixed genders and were more active. In dramatic form, The Chorus did not enter until after the prologue and stayed onstage for the entirety of the show.

Training of a Chorus was probably spread over the 11 months the playwright had with the Chorus before the performance. At first, it was the author who choreographed the Chorus, but as time went on this job was taken over by professionals. Some say this training was similar to that of athletes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Quantization of Energy ==

If we speak of the energy being transfered in some subatomic process as being 'quantized' we mean that it is not a continuous smooth transfer but rather it occurs in many small (discrete) steps.

The Unified Field Theory as it is being formulated here states that there is no matter in the universe, and that the little itsy bitsy jig saw puzzle pieces of matter which are said to constitute the building blocks of big matter do not actually exist. Rather the universe consists of atoms which are nothing more than little magnetic field bubbles. 'Matter' should be understood as merely an interpretation of the human brain as it interacts with energy fields.

It is because the Unified Field Theory proposes that an electromagnetic explanation must be formulated to explain the properties of the atom, and it is because the Unified Field Theory rejects 'elementary mass particles' composed of some kind of 'frozen energy' that has taken solid form, that it is required that a new theoretical understanding of the quantization of energy be formulated. According to matter based interpretations of the atom quantization of energy occurs when little particles of energy are absorbed by a charged matter particle, the electron. In the electromagnetic atom the function of an electron is merely as a 'drain hole' required to maintain the flow of current required to maintain the magnet field (since you cannot have a magnetic field without current and you never have current without generating a magnetic field - the two are inseparable). It is because the matter based interpretation of the atom considers the electron to be an 'elementary matter particle' that the role of energy absorption is assigned to this electron, for an electron is a 'negative' charged particle and therefore plays the role of the sponge that soaks up all the energy absorbed within some atom.

It is possible to begin to formulate a theory of quantization of energy in the atom without employing the services of a 'negatively charged sponge particle', such as an electron, which in the electromagnetic atom already has an assigned function, that of the drain hole attached to some faucet in the nucleus.

Now it is quite possible that falling in a gravitational field occurs in quantized discrete steps, and if we examine the interaction of the atom with its surrounding environment we can get some idea as to why this might be true.

quantize.gif quantize.gif - 4439 Bytes In the image above we can see two possible scenarios where energy exchange could take place between an atom and the surrounding field energy. The atom could absorb field energy, as on the left, where the outside field is positive and the atom is negative. As the atom absorbs energy, the inner shell of the sphere quickly takes on a positive charge with respect to the rest of the atom, while at the same time it becomes neutral with respect to the outer environment, which suggests that transfer of energy would cease, since energy is only transferred where there is a potential difference in the level of energy (a voltage differential). The voltage differential now exists within the sphere of the atom itself, and following the principle that voltage differences are never allowed to exist in an energy field without the result being a flow of current to even out the field strength, we could then expect the energy to be absorbed by means of the inner current flow within the atom, with the result being that the area at the bottom would once again be negative with respect to the outside environment, resulting in one more discrete infusion of energy, with the cycle of small step by step infusions of energy into the atom continuing until the atom is neutral with respect to the energy level of the outside environment.

With this thought in mind we could imagine that the process of falling in a gravitational field (whether the direction is up or down) assumes the form of discrete step by step oscillations, wherein the transfer of energy is quantized, and it is the fact that these oscillations occur so quickly and on such small scales that falling appears to be a smooth continuous function, when actually it was a quantized function and occurred in steps.

The same principle would apply to emissions of energy by an atom, as in the image on the right, where an atom emits energy into the outside environment, and then the thin layer around the atom emission becomes a neutral charge, which halts further emissions, until the positive spot in the external environment is pulled away from the outer shell of the atom, at which time the atom is free once again to emit energy.

No negative matter particle such as the elementary particle electron is required to explain this process of quantization of energy, since it would appear to be a charge phenomenon that is the inevitable consequence of emission and absorption between the barrier separating two non-homogeneous energy fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening an Existing SPSS Data File==
This chapter will explain how to open new and already saved data sets. Once you have SPSS open (see Chapter 2), click &quot;File&quot; → &quot;Open&quot; → “Data”:

[[File:02openingSPSS04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

After clicking the Data icon, SPSS will pull up a screen called “Open Data.”  Open Data will give you option to find your data set. This can be seen in the screen shot below:
[[File:02openingSPSS05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Browse through your directories until you find your data set, then select it and click “Open.”  Your data set should now be open:

==Opening a New Data Window==
If you'd rather enter data into a blank data file, you can create an empty SPSS data file.  To do so, once you've opened the program, click &quot;File&quot; → &quot;New&quot; → &quot;Data&quot;
[[File:03openingdatafileSPSS06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The result will be a blank or empty data file.  You can enter data in the Data View (Chapter 4) and set variable characteristics in Variable View (Chapter 5).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Differential cryptanalysis''' is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in an input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformations, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behaviour, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key.

==History==
The discovery of differential cryptanalysis is generally attributed to Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s, who published a number of attacks against various block ciphers and hash functions, including a theoretical weakness in the Data Encryption Standard (DES).  It was noted by Bamford in ''The Puzzle Palace'' that DES is surprisingly resilient to differential cryptanalysis, in the sense that even small modifications to the algorithm would make it much more susceptible.

In 1994, a member of the original IBM DES team, Don Coppersmith, published a paper stating that differential cryptanalysis was known to IBM as early as 1974, and that defending against differential cryptanalysis had been a design goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal |last = Coppersmith |first = Don |year = 1994 |month = May |title = The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks |journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume = 38 |issue = 3 |pages = 243 |url = http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/383/coppersmith.pdf |format = PDF }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to author Steven Levy, IBM had discovered differential cryptanalysis on its own, and the NSA was apparently well aware of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Levy |first = Steven |authorlink = Steven Levy |title = &quot;Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government — Saving Privacy in the Digital Age |publisher = Penguin Books |year = 2001 |isbn = 0-14-024432-8 |pages = 55–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
IBM kept some secrets, as Coppersmith explains: &quot;After discussions with NSA, it was decided that disclosure of the design considerations would reveal the technique of differential cryptanalysis, a powerful technique that could be used against many ciphers. This in turn would weaken the competitive advantage the United States enjoyed over other countries in the field of cryptography.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;/&gt;
Within IBM, differential cryptanalysis was known as the &quot;T-attack&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;/&gt;, or &quot;Tickle attack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Blaze, sci.crypt, 15 August 1996, [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/5cd14a329372cc5a?dmode=source Re: Reverse engineering and the Clipper chip&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not the solidest of cites --&gt;

While DES was designed with resistance to differential cryptanalysis in mind, other contemporary ciphers proved to be vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack.

==Attack mechanics==
Differential cryptanalysis is usually a ''chosen plaintext'' attack, meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of his choosing. The scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order 2&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; chosen plaintexts. There are, however, extensions that would allow a ''known plaintext'' or even a ''ciphertext-only'' attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant ''difference''; difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a '''differential'''. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials &lt;math&gt;(\Delta_X, \Delta_Y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_Y = S(X) \oplus S(X \oplus \Delta_X)&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from randomness. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than exhaustive search.

In the most basic form of key recovery through differential cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for a large number of plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least r-1 rounds, where r is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.

For any particular cipher, the input difference must be carefully selected if the attack is to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm's internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a ''differential characteristic''.

Since differential cryptanalysis became public knowledge, it has become a basic concern of cipher designers. New designs are expected to be accompanied by evidence that the algorithm is resistant to this attack, and many, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, have been proven secure against the attack.

In [[cryptography]], '''linear cryptanalysis''' is a general form of [[cryptanalysis]] based on finding [[affine transformation|affine]] approximations to the action of a [[cipher]]. Attacks have been developed for [[block cipher]]s and [[stream cipher]]s. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being [[differential cryptanalysis]].

The discovery is attributed to [[Mitsuru Matsui]], who first applied the technique to the [[FEAL]] cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992). Subsequently, Matsui published an attack on the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES), eventually leading to the first experimental cryptanalysis of the cipher reported in the open community (Matsui, 1993; 1994). The attack on DES is not generally practical, requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; [[known-plaintext attack|known plaintexts]].

A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple linear approximations or incorporating non-linear expressions, leading to a generalized [[partitioning cryptanalysis]]. Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs.

==Overview==
There are two parts to linear cryptanalysis. The  first is to construct linear equations relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits that have a high bias; that is, whose probabilities of holding (over the space of all possible values of their variables) are as close as possible to 0 or 1. The second is to use these linear equations in conjunction with known plaintext-ciphertext pairs to derive key bits.

===Constructing linear equations===
For the purposes of linear cryptanalysis, a linear equation expresses the equality of two expressions which consist of binary variables combined with the exclusive-or (XOR) operation. For example, the following equation, from a hypothetical cipher, states the XOR sum of the first and third plaintext bits (as in a block cipher's block) and the first ciphertext bit is equal to the second bit of the key:

&lt;math&gt;
  P_1 \oplus P_3 \oplus C_1 = K_2.
&lt;/math&gt;

In an ideal cipher, any linear equation relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits would hold with probability 1/2. Since the equations dealt with in linear cryptanalysis will vary in probability, they are more accurately referred to as linear ''approximations''.

The procedure for constructing approximations is different for each cipher. In the most basic type of block cipher, a [[substitution-permutation network]], analysis is concentrated primarily on the [[S-box]]es, the only nonlinear part of the cipher (i.e. the operation of an S-box cannot be encoded in a linear equation). For small enough S-boxes, it is possible to enumerate every possible linear equation relating the S-box's input and output bits, calculate their biases and choose the best ones. Linear approximations for S-boxes then must be combined with the cipher's other actions, such as permutation and key mixing, to arrive at linear approximations for the entire cipher. The [[piling-up lemma]] is a useful tool for this combination step. There are also techniques for iteratively improving linear approximations (Matsui 1994).

===Deriving key bits===
Having obtained a linear approximation of the form:

&lt;math&gt;
P_{i_1} \oplus P_{i_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus C_{j_1} \oplus C_{j_2} \oplus \cdots = K_{k_1} \oplus K_{k_2} \oplus \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

we can then apply a straightforward algorithm (Matsui's Algorithm 2), using known plaintext-ciphertext pairs, to guess at the values of the key bits involved in the approximation.

For each set of values of the key bits on the right-hand side (referred to as a ''partial key''), count how many times the approximation holds true over all the known plaintext-ciphertext pairs; call this count ''T''. The partial key whose ''T'' has the greatest absolute difference from half the number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs is designated as the most likely set of values for those key bits. This is because it is assumed that the correct partial key will cause the approximation to hold with a high bias. The magnitude of the bias is significant here, as opposed to the magnitude of the probability itself.

This procedure can be repeated with other linear approximations, obtaining guesses at values of key bits, until the number of unknown key bits is low enough that they can be attacked with [[brute-force attack|brute force]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stereotypes==

Stereotypes are general assumptions individuals hold against other individuals of a different socioeconomic or characteristic group.  Those who appear different than us are most generally stereotyped under another more or less fortunate grouped based primarily on image; most generally wrongfully categorized.  For instance different cultures base a lot of creditability of another country based upon what they may see in the media; this is never quite as it seems.  Where did stereotyping come from? 

==History of Stereotypes==


Prior to a discussion and analysis of stereotypes, it is important to recognize if stereotypes exist in society.  Many experts argue that stereotypes are developed at an early age influenced by family friends and social surroundings.  For example, if an individual grows up with minimal exposure to a certain minority race, then the media plays a more crucial role in shaping that individual’s perception of that minority race.  Stereotypes tend to exist when there is a limited or no mixing of different cultures within ones socioeconomic surrounding; also referred to as the unknown culture.  Some experts believe that stereotypes are “are actually a neverending chain of thoughts.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Theories (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 3.&lt;/ref&gt;    It is an inherent cultural ignorance that disposes individuals to misconceived perceptions. 

Those misconceived perceptions can have a negative and positive impact on one’s life.  Negative impacts exist where “If one group may assume the other group is deceitful and aggressive, they themselves will respond in a deceitful and aggressive manner, leading the opponent to respond in the like, thus confirming the initial group's perception creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Heidi, Beyond Intracability.Org, “Stereotypes/Characterization Frames” October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotyping can lead to those being discriminated against to feel less accepted, thereby creating an innate disruptive behavior and creating feeling of lower self-worth.  Such low emotion creates in an individual “feeling of inferiority and lower self-worth.”&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Jane, “Blue Eyes Brown Eyes Exercise”, (http://www.janeelliott.com/workshop.htm) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive impacts occur where there is an increase in moral and performance because the individual feels they are part of an accepted group. 

Stereotypes have traditionally been defined as “something conforming to a fixed or general pattern, a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group representing an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or critical judgment.”&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. “stereotype” (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-2-14&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes were first branded by Firmin Didot as a term for printing, creating a duplicate impression, original typographical impression.  However, they were later associated with pictures in people’s heads of one’s perception of what is right and what is wrong.  Stereotypes tend to be exaggerated beliefs about specific social groups or types of individuals.  We develop our stereotypes from a sense of learned perception from family, friends, religion, and the media.  These stereotypes we possess are “standardized, simplified conception of groups based from prior assumptions.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Etymology (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes have been classified into two groups: inter-group and out-group.  Inter-group stereotypes are those “where personal identity and self-esteem are derived from groups to which they belong or can identify.  They are more normal and superior.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Dynamics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, out-groups have been defined as “less attractive, outcasts or all other groups generally seen as inferior to inter-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Dynamics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes have continued to endure during the passage of time.  Stereotypes will constantly persist until people are better educated about the differences between groups and cultures. Some experts feel that stereotypes are influenced by the government and will continue to exist as we continue to “divide and conquer”.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Mohawk Native, Yahoo Answers. “Why do stereotypes continue to exist?”, (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308155312AAn3QPK) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; With the high influence that the media puts on socioeconomic cultures, stereotyping will continue to exist so far as those in less diverse geographical areas rely on what outside influences they receive regarding various cultures.  The fear of the unknown is what drives the existence of stereotypes. Stereotypes continue to be generated from individuals who fear others that are of a different race or culture, the unknown.  The fear of the unknown, also referred to as the “Non-uniformity, tends to create misunderstanding.”&lt;ref&gt;Shields, C.J., Harris, K., (2007).  “Technology Education: Three Reasons Stereotypes Persist”. Purdue University. Volume 44. Number 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, “the competitive aspect of human nature supports the innate need to prove oneself more worthy than another.   The differences between people make it easier to compare to one another.”&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Tammy. “Why racists still exist” Helium Society &amp; Lifestyle: Ethnicity and Gender. (http://www.helium.com/items/160035-why-racists-still-exist) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Until society can learn to be more tolerant of those that are different, stereotyping will continue to exist.

== Problems Caused By Stereotypes ==

A number of problems tend to develop from the assimilation of stereotypes in society. Stereotypes cause various problems that impede the proper functioning of teams. One such problem is group divisions. Demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity and gender are “easily observable and team members use them to attribute specific patterns of thought, attitudes and behaviors to themselves and others.  Some suggest that most people are attracted to, and prefer to be with, others who are demographically similar to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Darnold, Todd C., Kim A. McCarthy and Anne S. York.  “Teaming in Biotechnology Commercialisation: The Diversity-Performance Connection and How University Programmes Can Make a Difference.” Journal of Commercial Biotechnology Vol. 15, Issue 1 ( Jan 2009): 3-11.  (Darnold 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Group divisions tend to cause “harmful divisions within organizations because of the lack of coordination and support.”&lt;ref&gt;Diekmann, Kristina.  “The Power of Inter-Group Relations” Lecture.   Professor and David Eccles Faculty Fellow, Dept. of Management, University of Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem caused by stereotypes is missed opportunities. A perceiver of a situation assumes that the target possesses the same characteristics of other members of the target’s category stereotype and incorporates those attributes into his or her impression of the target.  By attributing attributes, the “perceiver places the target into a category, thereby possibly missing out on the target’s real strengths.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., Elissa L. Perry, and Loriann Roberson. “The Multiple-Category Problem: Category Activation and Inhibition in the Hiring Process.”  Academy of Management Review Vol. 32, Issue 2 (Apr. 2007): 529-548.  (Kulik 529).&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, successful managers are viewed as more similar to men than to women on attributes considered critical to effective work performance such as leadership ability, self-confidence, objectivity, forcefulness, and ambition.  Essentially, “women are not believed to possess the qualities essential for success in management positions, possibly causing companies to miss out on promoting women to important management positions.”&lt;ref&gt;Block, Caryn J., Madeline E. Heilman, Richard F. Martell and Michael C. Simon.  “Has Anything Changed? Current Characterizations of Men, Women, and Managers” Journal of Applied Psychology Vol. 74, Issue 6 (Dec. 1989): 935-943.  (Block 935).&lt;/ref&gt; The last problem caused by stereotypes is a negative impact on employees and the employee's performance. When managers who are prejudiced against certain groups allow those prejudices to influence how they treat employees, “the prejudice becomes institutionalized and affected individuals become systematically disadvantaged.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that stereotypes can have a negative impact on employee feelings and behavior, inhibiting the employee from performing to the best of his or her abilities.  Stereotypes also “make employees work harder, but not better.  In sum, when stereotypes are present, performance declines.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype threat describes the experience of a person who is aware of a stereotype about his or her identity group suggesting shortfalls in performance on the given task.  This awareness can “have a disruptive effect on performance.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Making salient negative stereotypes about both black and white athletes has the potential “to cause poorer athletic performance relative to when they perform an athletic task in a positive or neutral evaluative context.”&lt;ref&gt;Darley, J.M., C. Lynch, M. Sjomeling, and J. Stone.  “Stereotype Threat Effects on Black and White Athletic Performance” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 77 (1999): 1213-1227. (Darley 1224).&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to Identify Stereotypes in Team Members ==

Stereotypes can affect all individuals in a team.  Two common stereotype issues that individuals may succumb to are stereotype threat and social identity theory.  Stereotype threat has been defined as “A fear individuals experience when they are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype that is held about their group.&quot;  Steele and Aronson in this definition are referring to any group that an individual may identify with i.e.:  gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that cause stereotypes to affect individuals in a team.  The person must view themselves, or be viewed by others as a high performer.  The individual feels as though others in the team have high expectations for their performance.  In addition, the individual must have a strong identity with the stereotyped group. This person must also “be in a situation where others might question their abilities.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A psychological effect of stereotypes.(3 COUNTERING STEREOTYPES BY CHANGING THE RULES).&quot; Regional Review. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 2005. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The last factor is that “those individuals who are most easily affected are those who expect discrimination or who believe that a stereotype is legitimate.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotype threat can affect individuals, but it is difficult to identify.

There are several effects caused by stereotype threat. One effect can be the self-fulfilling prophecy.  The self-fulfilling prophecy exists where “Individuals identifying with a stereotyped group are so concerned that their actions will have negative implications concerning everyone in the group.  This stress can inevitably affect their performance which brings on the results they most hoped to avoid.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A psychological effect of stereotypes.(3 COUNTERING STEREOTYPES BY CHANGING THE RULES).&quot; Regional Review. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 2005. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, studies have shown that stereotyping in teams “can limit working memory and self monitoring capabilities.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common problem with stereotypes in groups is social identity theory.  The social identity theory has been defined as “Individuals gain their identity from the groups to which they perceive membership.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that are attributed to the social identity theory include “Individuals define themselves by the social groups to which they belong then they work to elevate themselves  further by drawing comparisons between their group and those not in the group.  This is called in-group vs. out-group.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect that the social identity theory has on teams is that “By classifying people as in group/out group this leads to discrimination of members of the out group.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Teams will suffer if individual team members do not treat each other with respect and accept each person’s differences.

== Managing Stereotypes ==


There are various ways to ineffectively manage stereotypes.  One ineffective way of managing stereotypes is through stereotype inhibition. While individuals who were motivated have been “shown to make fewer stereotype connections in situations in which they would otherwise activate stereotypes,”&lt;ref&gt;Frograss, Joseph P., Simon M. Laham and Kipling D. Williams. Social Motivation: Conscious and Unconscious Processes. Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; it can actually “lead to increased stereotyping, as a rebound effect leads to more increasing after stereotypes were suppressed.”&lt;ref&gt;WBodenhausen, Galen V., C. Neil Macrae and Alan B. Milne. &quot; Saying &quot;No&quot; to Unwanted Thoughts: Self-Focus and the Regulation of Mental Life.&quot; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 1998 Vol 74: 578-589.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional ineffective way of managing stereotypes is through increasing familiarity.  The Intergroup Contact Theory proposed by Gordon W. Allport in 1954 stated that interpersonal contact could reduce stereotypes.  However, contact alone is not sufficient because “individuals not conforming to stereotypes will be rejected from the category and placed in a sub category.”&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Yair. “The Contact Hypothesis Reconsidered: Effects of the Atypical Outgroup Member on the Outgroup Stereotype.” Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 1994 Vol. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety and threat levels can increase prejudice, while additional goals, such as equality among the different groups, common goals, and a lack of competition, can “lead to intergroup friendship and structured optimal contact, thereby leading to the best results.”&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, Thomas F. and Linda R. Tropp  A META-ANALYTIC TEST AND REFORMULATION OF INTERGROUP CONTACT THEORY February 2010 http://www.iq.harvard.edu/files/iqss/old/PPBW/tropp.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective methods to manage stereotypes include mental imagery, where recipients using counterstereotypic mental imagery were able to reduce implicit stereotypes.  By stopping implicit stereotypes from happening, the judgment or stereotypical behavior is avoided.  Preventing the implicit stereotypes from occurring “halts the suppressing of stereotypes which can lead to the rebound effect.”&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Irene V.; Jennifer E. Ma, and Alison P Lenton. “Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 2001 Vol 81(5): 828-841.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspective taking is an effectively proven method to manage stereotypes.  The process of taking another’s perspective to focus on situation constraints and influences are helpful in explaining their behavior without resorting to stereotypes. This helps other groups to “become part of your own in-group and leads to more positive associations with the group.”&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, Adam D, and Gordon B. Moskowitz. “Perspective-taking: Decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 2000 Vol 78(4), 708-724.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional method of effective management of stereotypes is superordinate goal.  When two groups have stereotypes towards each other, the introduction of a superordinate goal that depends on both groups for success has been shown to lead to cooperation, reduced friction, and changed attitudes toward the out-group. Friendships “were also formed with members of out-groups.”&lt;ref&gt;Muzafer Sherif, “Superordinate goals in the reduction of intergroup conflict.&quot; American Journal of Sociology, 1958: 63, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt; The last effective method is to eliminate stereotype threats.  Studies have shown that introducing negative stereotypes can lead to poor performance.  Social identities become active when stereotypes are available and apparent.  By eliminating stereotypes and introducing positive associations, overall team performance can be improved.

==Conclusion==
Stereotypes have been a part of our culture since the beginning of time.  They will continue to exist indefinitely.  The true test would be how do we continue to create a better worldly understanding of the differences between each other?  By recognizing the personal stereotypes we hold against each other and how we ourselves are being stereotyped, we can begin to understand one another and better communicate our beliefs and positions more clearly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This textbook, ''Foundations of Constructivism: A Guidebook for Educators'', is initiated as a collaborative writing project for a Webster University graduate course on the Foundations of Constructivism. 

The edition of this textbook was developed in the Spring 2010 semester. The instructor is Dr. Roy Tamashiro. The 8 graduate students in the course were the primary authors, editors, and quiz builders. 

The aim of the course was to learn ''about'' the theory, research and applications of constructivism  by ''doing'' constructivism in the course. The development of this WikiBook was the primary methodology for reading about constructivism, dialoguing about it, and applying it to other teaching / learning situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation in a Group and Team Environment ==

Motivation can be the determining factor for the level of success a team achieves.  In most cases, a successful team/group will have been motivated from start to finish.   There are some basic “laws of motivation” that need to be understood to maximize and keep a team motivated to achieve. 

==='''Laws of Motivation'''===
#&lt;u&gt;An individual has to be motivated in order to motivate others&lt;/u&gt;:  A person cannot expect to motivate others if he/she is not individually motivated.  To successfully evaluate what is needed to motivate others, it is pertinent to consider the type of person that might motivate you.  Is this the type of person that might arrive before anyone else, who is enthusiastic, positive, always has some sort of good news to pass on, is loyal to the group, and leads by example?  As a member of a group, each person cannot expect to move the other members of the group to be motivated if he/she not motivated him/herself.  If in a group dynamic, there is not a single individual that has motivation to perform or to complete the purpose of the group, that group is destined to fail.  Richard Denney states in his book, Motivate to Win, that “if you want to motivate another person, you have to be motivated yourself.”
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation requires a goal&lt;/u&gt;:  Without a specific goal in mind, it is impossible for a group or team to be motivated.  Although they might feel motivated, without a specific reason for working or something they are working towards, their motivation serves little purpose.  Richard Denney points out that although this may seem like common sense, it is common sense that is not commonly recognized.  He also points out that motivation is about striving towards the future and without a goal, there is no purpose.  As an example, consider a team sport where there is no competition or league that they can be a part of.  What motivation does the team have to practice and work as a team.  The goal that most team sports have is to be the best compared to their competition.  If there is no one to compete against, there is no reason to compete.  The motivation to perform is lost.  The goal to be the best compared to your competition is a vital component of the group or teams motivation.
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation, Once Established, Never Lasts&lt;/u&gt;:  Motivation should be an ongoing process.  It cannot be a once a year booster.  Groups must come together on a frequent basis to discuss their strengths and weaknesses and draw up plans of action and self-improvement for the future.  Conducting a 360-degree appraisal as a group can be one way to ensure that each member is staying focused and makes necessary adjustments to their behavior.  This gives each group or team member an opportunity to assess the performance and contribution of the other group or team members.   Group members may need to be trained on this process for it to be worthwhile, effective and motivational, but this investment can lead to more motivated groups.  Just because a group or team is motivated today does not mean that they will be motivated tomorrow.  It is important that groups and teams understand the power of motivation, understand themselves as individuals, how they feel and why they react the way they do.  Group or team members must understand what makes them happy or unhappy and what inspires them to do just a little bit more.  It is also important to understand what demotivates individuals and as frequently as possible try to take steps to prevent it from happening.
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation Requires Recognition&lt;/u&gt;:  People will strive harder for recognition than for almost any other single thing in life.  Consider a parents whose child brings home a picture that they have painted at school.  If that parent admires the picture, shows it to other members of the family and pins it up on the wall, they have now motivated that child and may begin to see more pictures. A genuine compliment is a form of recognition and it takes a thoughtful person to give another a compliment.  Small-minded people are unable to recognize the achievements of others.  
#&lt;u&gt;Participation Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:   It is vital to get people involved and to seek their opinions.  When working in groups or teams it is important that an environment is established that gives each group member an opportunity to express and share their ideas.  People who are listened to and are given an opportunity to actively participate, are more effective and are more motivated.  Julian Richer, founder of hi-fi retailer, Richer Sounds, says that when he started his company 100 percent of the ideas came from him.  Now, 90 percent of how the company is run, including its systems and procedures, comes from his people.  All members of his staff are required to give 20 ideas per year for improvement.  For each idea they are rewarded a minimum amount, that increases based on the value of the idea.  Every idea presented is given a response within three days indicating why the idea could not be implemented or whether further action would be taken.  The consequence of this was a steady stream of innovation, but even more important is that Richer Sounds has an incredibly high staff retention rate.  There is usually a list of people waiting for a vacancy.
#&lt;u&gt;Seeing Progression Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:  When individuals progress as a group, moving forward and achieving, they will always be more motivated.  When they are going backwards and not making progress, people are naturally less motivated.  All members of the group must learn from the past, but realize that they cannot change it.  Instead, they must turn it to their advantage and learn from it.  Learning to focus on the slightest progress, whatever it may be, allows a team to stay motivated.  This law must be used, worked on, managed and planned in order to maintain a high level of motivation.
#&lt;u&gt;Challenge Only Motivates if there is a Potential to Win&lt;/u&gt;:  If targets for results are set to high, they may actually have a de-motivating effect.  If the consensus of the group or team is that the targets are out of reach or impossible to achieve, de-motivation will be the result.  Competitions and challenges can certainly be motivating and can inspire people to greater activity.  People will rise to the occasion.  Challenge groups or teams to get something worthwhile done and nine times out of ten they will do it.  Sometimes, the work itself is a motivator, such as responsibility, challenge or a feeling of doing something worthwhile.  One can make a person’s work more challenging by giving them the biggest job they can handle and with this responsibility must come some credit of achievement when the job is done.
#&lt;u&gt;Everybody Has a Motivational Fuse&lt;/u&gt;:   Everyone can be motivated.  Everyone has a fuse, it is just a matter of knowing how to ignite it.  At some point it may not be cost-effective to continue trying to motivate a group or team to into greater activity or performance.  It is a person’s attitude to a job that makes the difference.  A person can quite emphatically state and believe that theirs is the worst job humanity has ever created.   Yet another person taking on that same job with a different attitude will say and believe it is a great job and will consider himself or herself fortunate to have it.
#&lt;u&gt;Group Belonging Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:   People want to have a sense of belonging.  The smaller the group or team, the greater the loyalty, motivation and effort.  Extra-curricular activities can be used to draw people together.
#&lt;u&gt;Inspired Leaders are Motivational&lt;/u&gt;:   This is not necessarily a manager.  Leaders are those that inspire others to action.  Leaders are willing to take risks, are continually looking for new challenges and opportunities.  People are much more likely to be motivated when there is inspired leadership.  Leaders will defend others in their group and take full responsibility for criticism.

==='''Selected Applications of the Laws of Motivation'''===
:&lt;u&gt;Motivation requires a goal&lt;/u&gt;:  One of the first steps to motivating a group is identifying the goals and purpose of the team and making them clear from the beginning.  This first step has proven true for many group leaders and members.  Managers and non-organizer team members can see success when it is used and dysfunction and failure when not used.   For example: A branch manager of an office was charged with finding ways to cut costs and run a leaner office.  As an office his team has already gone through cost cutting procedures and that process and the results were not seen well to the team.  The goal was to break the larger group into cross functional teams of three to five members and give them time to brain storm on these ideas.  Each group would have certain rules and direction.  The team leader brought the entire group together and explained what they would be doing.  He explained the plan and outlined our goals.  In this main group they discussed the reasoning behind the goals; they reviewed the most recent P&amp;L and discussed the health of the branch.  Afterwards and over the next three days the smaller breakout sessions were completed.  The overall project had great success.  They came away with many wonderful ideas for cutting costs which were implemented in their office as well as many of other offices throughout the company.  Knowing the goals and understanding, and supporting them were huge contributing factors to the success of these particular teams. In contrast members of a team where no goal is clearing identifiable are not usually as successful.  As time passes with no overall group goal nor an understanding for the goal; each group member begins to realize and push towards individual goals.  The lack of motivation towards a common goal may break the team apart and provide minimal success.&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;u&gt;Motivation, Once Established, Never Lasts&lt;/u&gt;:  The next step to motivating a group to an acceptable level of success is determining what the group as a whole and individually needs, in order to be driven during the entire process.  Beyond providing a common goal and direction; how does a group organizer determine what will motivate her/his group to succeed?  The simple fact is that in many groups; each team member may in fact require different levels or types of motivation to push them to succeed. There are two types of motivation that exist: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is motivation that is inspired by outside forces, while intrinsic motivation is motivation that is inspired from within a person. Both types of motivation are essential to success. Below you will find different types of extrinsic and intrinsic motivational factors: 
::Extrinsic Motivation. 
:::-Bonus 
:::-Peer recognition 
:::-Good grades 
:::-Rewards 

::Intrinsic Motivation. 
:::-Happiness 
:::-Personal goals, values, and morals 
:::-Willingness and eagerness to learn 
:::-Physiological, social, and self-esteem needs &lt;br&gt;

:The best idea would be to determine prior to group organization the types and levels of motivation each group member will require.  Assigning group members to teams with similar types and levels of motivation may be beneficial in the teams overall success.  This is of course based on the types of rewards or motivators the organizer is willing to provide.  If it is just going to be one reward, the same reward for the entire group, it will be extremely important to have team members who would be happy with that reward/motivator. Determining each group members’ types and levels of motivation requires the organizer to know each member.  Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators can be used to motivate the group.  One common device used to help understand a person and there by determine their motivators is personality testing.  Many managers find it difficult to find the time to spend with each group member individually to discover their motivators.  It would certainly be ideal if they could find the time as it helps put them on a more personable level; however even when they have the time they may find it uncomfortable to ask questions of a personal nature.  For this reason personality tests can be very useful.Developing understanding of personality typology, personality traits, thinking styles and learning styles theories is a very useful way to improve your knowledge of motivation and behavior of self and others, in the workplace and beyond. The more you understand about personality, the better able you are to judge what motivates people - and yourself. Some examples of easily accessible online Personality tests are:

==Motivation in Challenging Group and Team Environments==

==='''Potential causes for a poorly motivated groups and team'''=== 
:The lack of motivation or poor motivation; most often will cripple a group’s ability to succeed and or hinder its progress.  For the most part it is widely known that when a group is not motivated to perform, it will not succeed to a level of satisfaction that was previously desired.  So the question remains; why are some groups not given the motivation to succeed?  Two possible scenarios potentially explain this phenomenon: 
::1. The group leader provides the wrong type of motivation.
::2. The group is unwilling to be motivated. 
:Some type of motivation is always provided for a group to succeed.  The problem is that in several instances the methods for motivation are not correct and thus does not produce the sought after results.  The first scenario states that there are occasions when the wrong motivator is provided.  As described in the section “How to Motivate a Group;” the group leader must determine how the group needs to be motivated in order to be successful. Presuming that the group leader has successfully followed the prescribed advice and now knows what his group needs to be positively motivated; if the group fails based on motivation, what has happened?  Either the group leader disregarded his findings or he has misunderstood them.  &lt;br&gt;

:There may be situations when a group requires motivation that is unrealistic or not within the power of the group leader.  There may also be situations when a group leader is simply unwilling to motivate the group.  When he is unwilling and able; this will be a situation where the group leader may not be motivated properly and or he needs to be replaced.  On the other hand when a group requests a bonus which the leader is unable to provide; even though he is willing, this is a situation where the team may need to be dissolved or changed. &lt;br&gt;

:The second possible scenario states that the group itself is unwilling to be motivated.   Typically this will mean that either their desires are elsewhere or they no longer have faith in what they are doing.  Take the example of a business owner who earns a healthy income.  He is part of a group that provides a service at a premium.  Over time he realizes that he does not believe in the product any more.  He feels that it does not provide the value he has been promising.  As part of this team will he be effective at supporting the rest of his team members; form this point on?  The answer is it depends on what motivates him.  If he is motivated by money then, yes, he will continue to be an effective team member.  However, if he is not motivated by money than he will begin to lose interest and become very ineffective for the team.  The truth is that he may be motivated by an ethical value towards those clients he serves and therefore if the product were to change then he would be properly motivated again and would again be effective for the rest of his team.  &lt;br&gt;

:Both scenarios boil down to a leader knowing what truly motivates his group and finding a way to provide that motivation. &lt;br&gt;

=== '''Motivating a team within a negative environment'''===
:Before you are able to motivate a team who has a negative view on a project, you must first understand what caused the negative view to be held. It is best to directly talk with each team member to determine the root cause. Once it is known where the negative view comes from, actions can be taken. To begin with, the root cause should be examined.  To determine the cause, it is important to analyze the responses to questions such as:

::1. Is it an appropriate factor to have at the work environment (e.g. tight timelines)? 
::2. Is it due to a disruptive team member?
::3. Is it due to stress surrounding the project (e.g.  new procedures, difficult paperwork, etc.)? 

:Once the main factor has been examined and assessed, it is important to determine if there are additional underlying factors that can be adversely impacting team members (e.g.  no vacation in six months, new child, divorce, etc.). &lt;br&gt;


:With the main factor (and underlying factors) in hand, the negative views can be addressed head on. It is important to help shift the team’s perspective to a positive mindset. If the team is struggling against tight timelines, incentives can be put into place for when the team hits the timeline. Something as simple as a promising a launch party can successfully change the team’s dynamics. This example is a large form of recognition, but smaller forms can also be helpful in changing the team’s dynamics. &lt;br&gt;

===''' Motivating team in a Cross-Functional environment'''===
:Before learning how to motivate teams, it is best to understand what can de-motivate them. A Bnet.com&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; article provides the top ten de-motivators for team members as, “Relations with project manager, co-worker relations, remuneration, leadership, security, working conditions, the organization’s policy, team subordinate relations, personal time, title/status”. &lt;br&gt;

:Cross-functional teams can be especially difficult to motivate as each individual comes from a different group. Each group can have different goals and incentives to motivate employees. When the individuals of a cross-functional team have different goals and incentives, the results can become more individualized. In addition to different groups, cross-functional team members come from different backgrounds and ways of thinking. These differences can pull a team apart, thus de-motivating them to work together. This does not necessarily need to happen.  If differences are managed well,  they can be leveraged to make the team stronger and ultimately more motivated to perform well as a group. Furthermore, each cross-functional team will go through the four stages of a team: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It may be difficult to motivate a team during the norming and storming phases. As such, it is important to take the phase the team is at into consideration. &lt;br&gt;

:Motivating a cross-functional team, however, is possible. Rowe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; explored the motivational issues on cross-functional teams specifically focusing on the free-rider problem. Through different experiments, Rowe found that the severity of the free-rider problem in groups was severely underestimated. So not only was there an issue within the team, but it was much larger than perceived by the team. The free-rider problem can be reduced by building trust and collectivism within the team. Rowe also found that, “when properly aligned, accounting and team structures operate interactively as a powerful group framing device that helps to resolve the free-rider problem.”  By focusing more on aligning the incentives and goals of a group, a diversified team can be motivated to perform successfully. &lt;br&gt;

:One way to align the incentives and goals within a cross-functional group is to create a project scope document. This is an exercise that not only allows the team to work together to define a project, but also gets buy-in from the team on the goals of the project. The team discusses the different aspects of the project and identifies assumptions made, items that are in/out of the scope of the project, and also identifies risks and constraints on the project. At the end of the meeting, a project scope document is formed. All team members are responsible for reviewing the document and will approve the document if everything documented fits their understanding. &lt;br&gt;

==='''Conclusion'''===
:In this book, we have discussed what motivation is as what groups can do to motivate others and some of the challenges that groups face when trying to address motivation.  Motivation can take several forms.  There are also many ways to approach motivation.  It is important to evaluate the situation that you are in and then take the approach that will motivate the group to achieve the desired outcome.  Without proper motivation, groups may not achieve their full potential or accomplish the goals that they set.    Groups must work together to set goals and work to accomplish them.  Proper motivation can ensure that groups will work together and everyone will do their part to achieve the goals of the group.  &lt;br&gt;

=== Description ===

Through a detailed analysis of the literature, twelve constructs of integrated quality management strategies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Top management commitment|top management commitment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer focus|customer focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier quality management|supplier quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Design quality management|design quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Benchmarking|benchmarking]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control usage|SPC usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internal quality information usage|internal quality information usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee empowerment|employee empowerment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee training|employee training]], product quality, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier performance|supplier performance]]. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs were then empirically tested and validated. For this purpose a confirmatory factor analysis approach was used.

=== Items ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===

Welcome to &quot;Principles of Constructivism.&quot; This wikibook is a collaborative project and resource for  a Webster University graduate course with the same title. The course is an introduction to constructivist theories and their applications to curriculum and instruction. The course employs collaborative processes and learning community-based web technologies (i.e. Web 2.0 tools) so that students learn about constructivism by experiencing constructivist methodologies and technologies used in this course.  Participants build their knowledge and skills about constructivist theory and practice through collaborative writing and curriculum building using new interactive web technologies. 

=== Course Description ===
Students in this course explore the history, theory and educational applications of constructivism. The course employs collaborative processes and learning community-based web technologies: Participants have direct experience learning about constructivism by doing and participating in the constructivist methodologies used in this course.

=== Learning Outcomes ===
*Participants in this course will be able to:
**Demonstrate a working knowledge of the key principles of constructivism and constructivist theories 
**Author original articles that describe constructivist theories and their applications in the classroom 
**Adopt strategies to promote active student learning and questioning. 
**Design lessons that involve constructivist principles such as collaboration, student-centered learnng, authentic (real-world) problems and other creative thinking processes 
**Design pupil assessment strategies consistent with constructivist learning processes

===Innovative ===

This course is innovative in several ways: 

# The online component enables students from any geographic location to participate in the course without the need to visit a Webster University Classroom.
# The course uses constructivist and collaborative methodologies. The constructivist approach involves a philosophy of learning in which learners builds their knowledge on the basis of authentic (real-world) experiences and dialogue, debate, or collaboration with others. (Brown and King, 2000) 
# The effectiveness of the constructivist pedagogy versus objectivist pedagogies has been debated for centuries. However, current theory and research in learning indicate that all learning involves a self-constructing process. (Bransford, ''et al.'', 2000; Poole, 2000; Scardamalia and Bereiter, 1994) 
# The new Web 2.0 internet tools such as blogs, wikis and social networking now make constructivist, collaborative and authentic learning more practical, because these tools are structured and organized for open development of knowledge as well as open dialogue, debate and discussion. 
# The course is about constructivism, and has been designed to be taught using instructional techniques and technologies (such as blogs and wikis) that support the constructivist philosophy and pedagogy. 
# No textbook reading is required. Instead students in this course will collaboratively research, author and edit a textbook on &quot;Principles of Constructivism.&quot;

===Overview ===
Overview 

Constructivism proposes that by reflecting on our experiences and ideaologies, we construct our own understanding of the world we live in. It is through these channels that all generate their own cultural and moral values and beliefs.  The learner selects and processes  this information to make sense of the experiences he or she acquires.  Each person builds and constructs a framework of knowledge based on what they already know prior to anything new being useful to them. The philosophy of Constructivism purports the idea that how one thinks is more important than the accumulation and recyclying of information.

Dr. Seymour Papert is a mathematician and one of the early pioneers of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, he is internationally recognized as the seminal thinker about ways in which  computers can change learning. Born and educated in South Africa where he participated actively in the anti-apartheid movement, Dr. Papert pursued mathematical research at Cambridge University from 1954-1958. He then worked with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958-1963. It was this collaboration that led him to consider using mathematics in the service of understanding how children can learn and think.  Papert contended that technology should be used far more extensively in education to prey on students' inherent motivation to play (&quot;Seymour Papert&quot;, n.d.; Papert, 2005a). By adding more technology to classroom practices, Papert believed interest in science, for example, would increase substantially among learners

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory ===

Papert used Piaget's work in his development of the Logo programming language while at MIT. He created Logo as a tool to improve the way that children think and solve the  problems. A small robot called the &quot;Logo Turtle&quot; was developed and children used it to solve problems. A main purpose of the Logo Foundation research group is to strengthen the ability to learn knowledge. Papert insists a simple language or program that children can learn—like Logo—can also have advanced functionality for expert users.


===Evidence of Papert's Ideas in Today's Constructivist Practice ===

Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (1980), published by Basic Books, is a book by Seymour Papert. He proposes a unique computer-based learning environment called the Microworld. His primary belief about the Microworld's design is that it compliments the natural knowledge building mechanisms of children, known as a constructivist approach to knowing and learning. His primary implication is that Microworld learning will profoundly affect the quality of knowledge gained. This work is one of the first large-scale attempts to mediate educational computer-based technology with Piagetian-based theories of learning and knowing.

The Lego Mindstorms programmable construction set system is named after the book.

===Conclusion ===

People laughed at Seymour Papert in the sixties when he talked about children using computers as instruments for learning and for enhancing creativity. The idea of an inexpensive personal computer was then science fiction. But Papert was conducting serious research in his capacity as a professor at MIT. This research led to many firsts. It was in his laboratory that children first had the chance to use the computer to write and to make graphics. The Logo programming language was created there, as were the first children's toys with built-in computation. The Logo Foundation was created to inform people about Logo and to support them in their use of Logo-based software for learning and teaching.  
Today Papert is considered the world's foremost expert on how technology can provide new ways to learn. He has carried out educational projects on every continent, some of them in remote villages in developing countries. He is a participant in developing the most influential cutting-edge opportunities for children to participate in the digital world. He serves on the advisory boards for MaMaMedia Inc. (whose founder, Idit Harel, was once a doctoral student of his at MIT) and of the LEGO Mindstorms product line (which was named after Papert's seminal book Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas). 
Papert lives in Maine, where he has founded a small laboratory called the Learning Barn to develop methods of learning that are too far ahead of the times for large-scale implementation. He has been named distinguished professor by the University of Maine and is credited with inspiring the first initiative aimed at giving a personal computer to every student of a state. He spends a large part of his time working in the Maine Youth Center in Portland, the state's facility for teenagers convicted of serious offenses. 
Papert's contributions go beyond the field of education. He is a mathematician and is a cofounder with Marvin Minsky of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT and a founding faculty member of the MIT Media Lab, where he continues to work. Papert collaborated for many years with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

Construction set- a set of standardized pieces that allow for the construction of a variety of different models or buildings. The pieces avoid the lead time of manufacturing custom pieces, and of requiring special training or design time to construct complex systems. This makes them suitable for temporary structures, or for use as children's toys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 2: Major Contributors to Constructivist Theory: Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky'''

===Overview ===
Constructivism is a theory espousing, humans gain knowledge from their experiences, and learn in a manner influenced by these experiences. That individuals learn by their own experiences, this experiential level contributes to the subject matter to be learned. Each individual is his/her own teacher and gains more knowledge from their own life experiences. This also states an individual learns from his own set of values and mores. Constructivism is not a specific way of learning but an educational theory. Constructivism has been around as a teaching methodology for centuries. Constructivism has been popular recently through the efforts of &quot;Project Construct&quot; started in Missouri.

Jean Piaget (1896-1980) believed that children's play had an important role in constructivism and learning. His theory expounds that we learn through assimilation and accommodation. Piaget’s theory of constructivism is one of “Cognitive Constructivism”. An example was his belief that children could not reach maturation, they cannot take on certain tasks until they mature psychologically. 

Lev Vygotsky (1896 – 1934) believed that knowledge is first constructed in a social context and collaborated with other individuals or groups. This is known as “Social Constructivism”.

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory: Piaget ===
Piaget believed that intelligence was a single capacity that developed the same way in all individuals. Piaget also believed that at certain levels of understanding (age), that we became capable of expanding our learning by maturing and taking responsibilities due to being psychologically prepared. This occurs through the growing process by experiences. Piaget did not agree with traditional views of learning. He saw play as an important part of learning and this was from infancy to adulthood.

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory: Vygotsky===
The type of learning that Vygotsky viewed was one where the learners should discover their own truths about the world. He believed that instructors and learners are equally involved in the learning process. Vygotsky also believed that there is significant implications for peer collaborations. This also stressed the ideas of thought and speech being used to increase the learners ability to communicate with peers or collaborators.

===Evidence of Piaget's &amp; Vygotsky's Ideas in Today's Constructivist Practice ===
We consistently see throughout the educational arena, pieces and parts of both Piaget and Vygosky and their theories. Though many of the terminology have changed, the basic premise is still the same. We learn through our experiences. Whether in childhood as part of a continuous learning cycle from birth, or from collaborating with our peers, learning continues.

===Conclusion ===
Constructivism is a way in which we are able to learn through our own internal learning mechanism. Each person learns through his own experiences and values and all learning is based upon that schema. This is an already existing framework within the individual. What occurs is learning is based on perception and that perception is what our mind allows us to learn. Jean Piaget (1896-1980) who along with Dewey and Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) were among the first during the early part of the 1900's to espouse constructivist learning. This was also seen as &quot;Marxist learning&quot;. Other than Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) the majority of constructivist theorists were in the early part of the 20Th Century. Here in the 21st Century the idea of Constructivist Teaching is still alive.

Cognitive Constructivism - Cognitive constructivism is based on the work of Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget's theory has two major parts: an &quot;ages and stages&quot; (http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Dictionary/contents/P/piaget's_stages.html) component that predicts what children can and cannot understand at different ages, and a theory of development that describes how children develop cognitive abilities. It is the theory of development that will be the focus here because it is the major foundation for cognitive constructivist approaches to teaching and learning. 
Piaget's theory of cognitive development proposes that humans cannot be &quot;given&quot; information which they immediately understand and use. Instead, humans must &quot;construct&quot; their own knowledge. They build their knowledge through experience. Experiences enable them to create schemas (http://www.valdosta.peachnet.edu/~whuitt/psy702/cogsys/piaget.html) - mental models in their heads. These schemas are changed, enlarged, and made more sophisticated through two complimentary processes: assimilation and accommodation (http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Dictionary/contents/A/adaptation.html).

Social Constructivism - 
Social constructivism is closely related to social constructionism in the sense that people are working together to construct artifacts. However, there is an important difference: social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, while social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of their interactions in a group.

A very simple example is an object like a cup. The object can be used for many things, but its shape does suggest some 'knowledge' about carrying liquids. A more complex example is an online course - not only do the 'shapes' of the software tools indicate certain things about the way online courses should work, but the activities and texts produced within the group as a whole will help shape how each person behaves within that group. For a philosophical account of one possible social constructionist ontology, see the 'Criticism' section of Representative realism.[1]   Wikipedia

Constructionism - Constructionist learning is inspired by the constructivist theory that individual learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. However, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are also active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with experiential learning and builds on some of the ideas of Jean Piaget. Seymour Papert defined constructionism in a proposal to the National Science Foundation entitled Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education as follows: &quot;The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory of science education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.&quot;  Wikipedia
Instructionism - Instructionism refers to all of the educational theories based on the idea of the teacher teaching, usually according to a predetermined schedule, rather than on students learning from their own experiences at their own pace. This includes any form of rote learning, and most forms of book learning in actual use, as well as drill and practice. 
The scientific laboratory is a place for exploration and discovery, where the principal topic of investigation is human ignorance in whatever form it currently takes, using the sharpest tools and brightest lights that human ingenuity can bring to bear. The school laboratory is almost always a place for regimented repetition of &quot;experiments&quot; whose outcome is known in advance. Similarly, a research library is a different sort of place to explore human ignorance about other kinds of questions. Here we look for interpretations of what has previously been recorded, often by comparing differing source accounts, often by finding questions that we can attempt to answer by other means. The school library is more often a place for looking up the &quot;right&quot; answer. A textbook can be an account of the frontiers of knowledge and understanding, presenting conflicting theories and attempts to find evidence to distinguish among them, or it can be a compendium of socially approved &quot;facts&quot;.

Pragmatism - is a philosophical movement that includes those who claim that an ideology or proposition is true if it works satisfactorily, that the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it, and that unpractical ideas are to be rejected. Pragmatism, in William James' eyes, was that the truth of an idea needed to be tested to prove its validity. Pragmatism began in the late nineteenth century with Charles Sanders Peirce and his pragmatic maxim. Through the early twentieth-century it was developed further in the works of William James, John Dewey and—in a more unorthodox manner—by George Santayana. Other important aspects of pragmatism include anti-Cartesianism, radical empiricism, instrumentalism, anti-realism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, a denial of the fact-value distinction, a high regard for science, and fallibilism. Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention from the 1960s on when a new analytic school of philosophy (W. V. O. Quine and Wilfrid Sellars) put forth a revised pragmatism criticizing the logical positivism dominant in the United States and Britain since the 1930s. Richard Rorty further developed and widely publicized the concept of naturalized epistemology; his later work grew closer to continental philosophy and is considered relativistic by its critics. Contemporary pragmatism is divided into a strict analytic tradition, a more relativistic strand (in the wake of Rorty), and &quot;neo-classical&quot; pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.
Essentialism - is an educational philosophy whose adherents believe that children should learn the traditional basic subjects and that these should be learned thoroughly and rigorously. An essentialist program normally teaches children progressively, from less complex skills to more complex. An Essentialist will usually teach some set subjects similar to Reading, Writing, Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Mathematics, Science, Art, and Music. The teacher's role is to instill respect for authority, perseverance, duty, consideration, and practicality. Essentialism strives to teach students the accumulated knowledge of our civilization through core courses in the traditional academic disciplines. Essentialists aim to instill students with the &quot;essentials&quot; of academic knowledge, patriotism, and character development. This traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture.
William Bagley (1874-1946) was an important historical Essentialist. Essentialism is related to the cultural literacy movement, which advocates the teaching of a core set of knowledge common to (and assumed to be possessed by) members of a culture or society. See also E.D. Hirsch.

Maturationism - is an early childhood educational philosophy that sees the child as a growing organism and believes that the role of education is to passively support this growth rather than actively fill the child with information. 
The idea is that genetic factors play a larger role in development than environmental ones, particularly in regard to language acquisition.

Maturationism is associated with the concept of developmental stages.

Major names in maturationism:G. E. Ames

Progressivism - Progressivists believe that individuality, progress, and change are fundamental to one's education. Believing that people learn best from what they consider most relevant to their lives, progressivists center their curricula on the needs, experiences, interests, and abilities of students. Progressivist teachers try making school interesting and useful by planning lessons that provoke curiosity. In a progressivist school, students are actively learning. The students interact with one another and develop social qualities such as cooperation and tolerance for different points of view. In addition, students solve problems in the classroom similar to those they will encounter in their everyday lives. Progressivists believe that education should be a process of ongoing growth, not just a preparation for becoming an adult. An obvious example of progressivism would be our class. We are in groups a lot and we actively learn through discussion. We talk about how what we read can be incorporated into our future teaching careers. Dr. Theodore takes into account the suggestions from the previous semester's students and modifies his class accordingly. After reading John Dewey’s book and discussing his thoughts and ideas in class, one can see John Dewey's relationship to progressivism. He wanted students to learn through action and being involved in the processes that will get to the end product. He wanted the students to work on hands-on projects so learning would take place, rather than memorization. In a regular classroom students just memorize what they need to know and it goes away after the test. In Dewey’s mind, the students would have to exercise their brain by problem solving and thinking critically, resulting in learning (even though the students may not even know it!). This allows the individual's brain to develop, so as the individual grows learning becomes easier! After attending a school Dewey would have set up, a child would be ready for the real world and a lot of the everyday setbacks that an individual would experience, such as losing a button, changing a tire, making lunch, or balancing a checkbook. School would be a lot of hands-on learning, and the progression of education would not end! Foundations of Education Web home page 
Genetic Epistemology - Epistemmology is a branch of philosophy concerned with how we know thinks.   In other words, knowing about knowing. Epistemological approaches in general - what can be known? broadly materialistic categories Nihilism (hard Scepticism) is the denial that reality can be known. Scientism asserts that 20th century scientific method is the only way to understand reality  Rationalism (including soft Scepticism) says that reason or logic, assisted by the discoveries of science, is the only way to understand reality. logical and introspective empiricism rationalism (dualistic or platonic) asserts that understanding come through pre-existing knowledge - - see also How the Rationalists Construe &quot;Clear and Distinct Ideas&quot; - by Ron Bombardi - Quite technical but probably worth the effort phenomenology reducto-ad-absurdum (as proof that Reality cannot be definied) - Shunyavada is a buddhist teaching that says that Reality cannot be known by conceptual means; it differs from Hard Scepticism is that it does assert that there is a Reality that can be attained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Cryptanalysis is using Linear mathematics (such as linear algebra) to break cryptosystems.  This approach was strong against the now-obsolute cryptosystems based on Linear Shift Registers.  Modern cryptosystems like AES and RSA use non-linear elements to prevent an attack based on linear cryptanalysis.  In AES, the S-box provides non-linearity.  In RSA, modular exponentiation provides non-linearity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Differential Cryptanalysis is decrypting a cyphertext with two different potential keys and comparing the difference.  Sometimes, this can provide insight into the nature of the cryptosystem.  Modern cryptosystems like AES are designed to prevent these kinds of attacks.

The measurements look very, very strange here.  This recipe has more butter than flour (225g butter, 180g flour) - that's plainly nonsense, all other recipes I've come across (Penguin cook book, Mrs Beeton, my mother-in-law) say weight of flour should be approx 1.5 weight of butter - this much butter to flour would be way too fatty and runny.  Is there a problem with the conversions? [[Special:Contributions/212.23.14.27|212.23.14.27]] ([[User talk:212.23.14.27|talk]]) 17:28, 12 March 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">ElGamal is one of the simplest cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem. A quick reminder of the discrete logarithm problem - given &lt;math&gt;g, h \in G&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;h = g^{x}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This is a hard problem when dealing with finite sets. ElGamal has a set of public parameters which can be shared by a number of users of the system. These are referred to as the domain parameters. These parameters are:
 - &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; - a large prime of around 1024 bits (currently) such that &lt;math&gt;p - 1&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by another prime &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of around 160 bits.
 - &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; - an element of the finite field &lt;math&gt;F^{*}_{p}&lt;/math&gt; with order divisible by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;g^{(p - 1)/q} (mod p) \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The domain parameters create a public group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with a prime order &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and a generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, we create a large but finite group, and a method of ordering that group (the generator), and we know that it will contain a prime number of elements. These are the properties we are after. These parameters are public, and the security of the system depends on the public and private key pair, which we shall generate next.

The private key &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a randomly-chosen integer. The public key is &lt;math&gt;h = g^{x} (mod p)&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to encrypt a message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; we generate a random ephemeral key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and calculate:
&lt;math&gt;c_{1} = g^{k}
c_{2} = m * h^{k}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the ciphertext &lt;math&gt;c = (c_{1}, c_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to decrypt a ciphertext we compute:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}^{x}} = \frac{m * h^{k}}{g^{x * k}} = \frac{m * g^{x * k}}{g^{x * k}} = m&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see from the decryption method, the message 0 will encrypt to itself, so not a good choice of message. In addition to this, as a result of using the ephemeral key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which will change every time you can see that the same message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; will encrypt to many different ciphertexts.

Since the ciphertext is expressed as 2 integers of the same length as the message, we end up with ciphertexts being twice as large as the message they're encrypting.

|name=Gooseberry
|image=Stachelbeeren.jpg
|description=
The gooseberry is a straggling bush growing to 1-3 meters (3-10 feet) tall, the branches being thickly set with sharp spines, standing out singly or in diverging tufts of two or three from the bases of the short spurs or lateral leaf shoots. The bell-shaped flowers are produced, singly or in pairs, from the groups of rounded, deeply-crenated 3 or 5 lobed leaves. The fruit of wild gooseberries is smaller than in the cultivated varieties, but is often of good flavour; it is generally hairy, but in one variety smooth, constituting the R. uva-crispa of writers; berries' colour is usually green, but there are red variants and occasionally deep purple berries occur.
|range=The gooseberry is indigenous in Europe and western Asia, growing naturally in alpine thickets and rocky woods in the lower country, from France eastward, well into the Himalayas and peninsular India.  It is a non-native species occurring throughout most of North America.
|season=June to September
|use=Gooseberries are best known for their use in desserts such as Gooseberry Fool and Gooseberry Crumble. In some countries, like Portugal, gooseberries are very appreciated as a beverage, being mostly used mixed with soda, water or even milk.  They can be eaten raw, though many species should be cooked down to soften the spines.  They are also commonly used in making jelly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Key length is directly proportional to security.&quot;

This seems misleading to me.

First, it falls into the trap that many snake-oil companies use: download our new amazing cryptosystem, that uses 9000-bit keys!!!!

Second, it misses the fact that different types of crypto need different length keys to achieve the same level of security.  A public-key system using a 4096-bit key is not 32 times more secure than AES with a 128 bit key.

Most generally, it's taking a point about the mathematics of a brute-force search and claiming, incorrectly, that brute-force resistance is equivalent to security.  Since every system in use today uses keys large enough to make brute-force impossible, this is especially untrue.

-----------  Did you read the second and third paragraphs?  This is all covered extensively there.

The second paragraph does a good job of clarifying.  The 3rd paragraph, I don't understand what it's trying to say.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=AHI - Audio Hardware Independent=

The preferred audio application interface on AROS is AHI. Most (and hopefully all future) applications use AHI for audio playback and capturing. AHI's settings can be accessed at SYS:Prefs/AHI.

AHI provides a set of &quot;Units&quot; for applications to use for sound play back or capturing. 

After booting AROS for the first time, you have to set audio modes for AHI's Units, see next paragraph.


==AHI Units and audio modes==

After setting or changing a Unit's audio mode, hit &quot;Use&quot; to use the mode for this session, or &quot;Save&quot; to keep it permanently.


==AHI supported devices==

[table: device / playback / capture / duplex]

Applications using direct AmigaOS style device access are not affected by AHI settings. Playback volume, rate, etc. will depend on the application's settings, and may interfere with applications using AHI.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the illustration of the volume rendering technique correct?

Since the formula is recursive, and the earlier pixels are already accounted for in the B row, we shouldn't have to sum the C row, right? After all, each B already contains the blended contributions of the column before it. So the final pixel is just (Voxel value * Opacity) + (B * [1-Opacity]) = 191.4, using only values from the final column.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Much has been written about the most effective ways to form team cohesion.  The purpose of this chapter is to offer concrete ideas for team leaders on how they can develop team cohesion amongst group member in an organizational setting.  

Some of the ideas are inspired by researchers such as Patrick Lencioni, however, many of the ideas within this chapter have been compiled from the collective experiences of its authors and other research.  

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Team_Cohesion_Star.jpg]]&lt;/div&gt;

Five concrete ideas for building team cohesion will be presented including:  Appreciation, Incentive, Relevance, Performance Measurement and Interpersonal Relationships.   

A model has been created to help the reader recall these points.  The model is presented as a star with each point representing one of the five attributes fundamental to building team cohesion.  



== Appreciation ==

It has been said that there are only two types of people in the world who benefit from gratitude and sincere appreciation – men and women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Matyjevich, Wendy | title= Praise and Recognition: Positively Good for Business | url= http://www.csemag.com/article/177469-Praise_and_Recognition_Positively_Good_for_Business.php | accessdate= March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, all humans have a basic need to feel appreciated, respected and valued.  In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, esteem is recognized as a fundamental human desire which must be fulfilled in order to achieve self-actualization (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Maslow’s hierarchy of needs | work= Wikipedia | url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Esteem | accessdate= March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective team leader can utilize appreciation as an important tool to fill this esteem need for individual team members and work to create and maintain a culture of appreciation within the team to insure that a team is cohesive.

In a 2003 study by the US Department of Labor on employment, the number one reason given for why people decided to leave their jobs was a lack of appreciation.  Just as an underappreciated employee is more likely to leave a job, an underappreciated team member is more likely to leave a team.  Without feeling valued as contributors within the context of the team and its objectives, individual team members are much more apt to feel disconnected and isolated from the team.  To maintain a cohesive team, all members need to feel some degree of appreciation for their efforts.  On a group level, a team which is not esteemed and recognized for their contributions has little chance of remaining cohesive, functional and successful.

To view it in a more positive way, a team is much more likely to be unified, collaborative and ultimately successful in a culture that is built on appreciation and recognition of the contributions of each individual, as well as the unique contributions of the team.  Demonstrations of gratitude, acknowledgements of effort, words of congratulations and other actions of appreciation function as the glue which binds a successful and cohesive team together.  As the French philosopher Voltaire put it, “Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” For a team leader to succeed, he must take the unique contributions of each team member and forge them into a combined team identity, and appreciation is fundamental to this endeavor. 

===Creating a Culture of Appreciation===

Creating and maintaining a culture of appreciation within a team requires a concerted focus by the team leader (and team members) on certain behaviors and characteristics.  Below we have identified 6 guidelines related to the principle of appreciation which team leaders can use as they work on building a strong and cohesive team.  Of course this is not an exhaustive list, but it provides a strong foundation on which a culture of appreciation can be built.

====1. Praise Individuals and Teams====

:Appreciation is a principle which applies to individuals within a team and to the team itself.  For a team to be cohesive, the leader must concentrate on both areas.  Without individual recognition, a team member may feel his/her individual contributions are irrelevant, unimportant and invisible.  Without team recognition, cohesion is much more difficult to maintain, as the focus is directed away from the team’s accomplishments.  Finding a balance between team and individual appreciation is not an exact science, and may vary with the unique dynamics of a particular team.  However, both individual and team praise must be present to maximize the potential for team cohesion.

====2. Praise in Private and in Public====

:Acknowledging and recognizing accomplishments should be done both in the private and the public spheres.  Expressions of appreciation are reinforced when shown in multiple venues.  A team’s willingness to put in significant extra time to complete a project by the deadline could warrant a personal thank you to each team member by the team leader, as well as a team celebration lunch.  Going one step further, the team leader could send an e-mail to select upper management detailing the extra effort put in by the team (make sure to Cc the team members).  Of course the specific actions are limitless.  The point here is to reinforce the appreciation message and, through public and private usage, cause it to permeate throughout the different strata of the individual, team and organizational culture.

====3. Be Specific====

:Make sure you really get to know each team member so that you can tailor your appreciation message to each individual as needed.  Take time to learn about a team member’s family, hobbies and interests, preferences, and values.  This will allow you to give praise, recognition and appreciation that will be personally valuable to each team members.  In recognizing or praising a team member, do not speak in generalities.  Instead of, “great job, Amir,” the team leader could say, “Amir, your contribution to the finance meeting this morning was excellent.  I was particularly impressed with your grasp of the division’s key drivers.”  The latter statement acknowledges specific attributes and provides Amir with specific feedback on what his unique contribution was.  Similarly, appreciation at the Team level should be specific and should demonstrate the team leader’s interest in and knowledge of the team’s purpose and accomplishments.

====4. Be Sincere====

:As the cliché goes, flattery will get you nowhere.  When people get the sense that words of praise or acts of acknowledgement are not coming from the heart, trust is quickly eroded.  A team leader should never follow up a complement with a “but” or bring up a mistake that was made by the team or team member.  There is a time and place for that, and it is not during an expression of appreciation.   

====5. Frequency====

:When it comes to appreciation, more is more.  As long as the appreciation is sincere and specific, it is nearly impossible to show appreciation too much.  Whether it is a personal thank you note, a short recognition speech in front of the team or an e-mail to top management on a team’s accomplishment, appreciation must become a cultural norm.  Consistency is the key.  Just one of many ways in which a team leader can think about frequency is to create three divisions: day-to-day, informal and formal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Baudville Inc, Day-to-day Recognition White Paper | url= http://www.baudville.com/D2D_White_Paper/pdfs  | accessdate= March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciation must be demonstrated often for it to become a part of a team’s psyche.

====6. Develop an Appreciation Plan====

:With the tools above, a team leader should put pen to paper, so to speak, and develop a written appreciation plan.  This will function as a blueprint to creating and maintaining a culture of appreciation.  Ideas for the structure of this plan are many and varied.  A few examples of appreciation/recognition plans from the corporate world can be found in “Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches” by Glenn Parker, Jerry McAdams and David Zielinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parker |first= Glen |coauthors= Jerry McAdams, D. Zielinski |title= [[Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches]] |publisher= [[Jossey-Bass]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “The Carrot Principle”, by Chester Elton and Adrian Gostick also provides insights into creating a detailed recognition plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elton |first= Chester |coauthors= Adrian Gostick |title= [[The Carrot Principle]] |publisher= [[Free Press]] |year= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Whether your plan includes weekly awards, team highlights in the company newsletter, taking a team member out to lunch, all or none of the above, the plan should integrate the principles previously described: namely individual and team praise, private and public praise, being specific, being sincere and a high degree of frequency.  A written appreciation plan will provide the impetus to take the above concepts and make them a reality.

===Remarkable Results===

In a scene from the movie Remember the Titans, based on the true story of a high school football team which overcame many potentially divisive challenges and obstacles to come together and win the 1971 Virginia State Football Championship, Coach Herman Boone takes his team to the site of the United States Civil War battle of Gettysburg.  There, with a morning mist hanging over the once bloody battlefield, he delivers an impassioned plea for team unity and cohesion.  

“You listen…take a lesson from the dead,” directed Coach Boone.  “If we don’t come together, right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed…just like they were.”  

“And I don’t care if you like each other or not.  But you will respect each other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Remember the Titans]] |publisher= [[Walt Disney Pictures]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Boone then went about creating a culture of appreciation, by demanding it from his staff and his team, and living it himself.  The results were remarkable.

Each team leader faces unique challenges and obstacles to in maintaining a cohesive team. Among these challenges is creating a culture where the basic human need of appreciation is met for each team member and the team as a whole.  When a team feels appreciated and recognized, and each individual within that team feels likewise, the team is free to come together as a cohesive unit and to create, collaborate and succeed.


== Incentive ==

As we continue to explore the contributing factors to team cohesion, recognizing the importance of incentives is fundamental to team success.  While developing organizational success through incentives is a topic of much attention and misunderstanding amongst business leaders, interpreting the various factors that encourage people to perform at high levels of personal success leads to insights of how they might perform in a team setting.  As good leaders are in constant pursuit to improve the processes and successes of their projects through the use of teams, proper implementation of incentives and rewards should be emphasized and understood.

“In economics and sociology, an incentive is any factor (financial or non-financial) that enables or motivates a particular course of action.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of incentives include cash bonuses, merit increases, promotion, leadership opportunities, as well as recognition.  As it should be safe to say that everyone likes to be rewarded for their efforts or actions, Frank LaFasto states “good effort needs to be recognized.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether individuals recognize them as incentives or rewards, funneling these driving factors in a manner that increases productivity and success can be very beneficial to the team environment.  Robert Henneman notes the importance of group recognition by stating “group incentives have a stronger influence on productivity that individual incentives yielding increases of 13%, but more importantly they reinforce the concept of teamwork.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure that incentive tools are used in the most beneficial and influential manner for the team as a whole, the team leader needs to properly identify and integrate the teams objective.  As the team leader “ensures that rewards and incentives are aligned with achieving the team’s goals”, team members feel a sense of accomplishment through an association to the group process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, individual team members will achieve a higher sense of team worth through their collaboration and contribution.  By keeping rewards “fair”, LaFasto states that individual members of a team will internally channel the feelings of a reward as if it is a “burden of proof.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of reward permits individual members to identify with the teams objective and feel a sense of camaraderie through such achievement.  This in turn has an incredible sense of value that can create strong bonds of trust and commitment to team establishment.

As managers devise methods of assuring proper channels of recognition and incentive, it is important to note that financial and non-financial methods can both be equally impactful.  As Robert Henneman explains “Recognition can exert a powerful impact on an employee’s performance and may influence organizations effectiveness as much as financial incentives do.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a strong point for managers to remember as they strive to build their team members moral on an individual basis as well as on the team level.  Even though incentive and reward have a financial connotation, it is important to note the impact that simple recognition can have on a team.

One of the driving factors that contribute to the success of incentives and rewards toward developing team cohesion is the continual impact this has on the individual.  For example, if a team is given the opportunity to choose future projects and make certain decisions based on their ability to achieve success and elevated results as a team, more emphasis and importance on team interaction will be seen.  Team members that are task oriented react very responsively to opportunities or incentives that will give them more initiative or influence on future decisions.

Because of the tremendous impact that meaningful incentives have on team projects and goals, long-term behaviors begin to form with the team.  Eventually, teams are able to collaborate their individual “personal, financial, and psychological rewards to their group goals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple incentive programs that are relevant to the overall teams goals and objectives create a more focused approach to how the team members interact and respect each of their individual duties.  Whether or not each of the team members have an equitable position in the physical process at hand, each member feels a sense of placement and share of the team when recognition is given to the team as a whole.

One of the greatest effects of team incentives that provide evidence of the formation of long term team cohesion is the development of organization standards.  As more and more incentives are implemented that are in line with the individual teams objectives, there is an increase of reward and visibility within the organization as a whole.  This creates an atmosphere of creativity and success which over time develops into what is understood as organizational or team standards.  As LaFasto states “a reward should be a celebration of standards.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over long periods of time, these recognized successes which have become standards are what ultimately shape an organization’s or team’s culture.  For example, if a team is highly motivated to be the industry’s leading organization for a certain product and achieves that result and is ultimately recognized for that, a lasting expectation of highly notable success is eventually adopted.  This is one of the very reasons why incentives are very effective for not only short term projects but also for the long-term well being of the organization or team.

Through proper alignment of team objectives and motivations, team leaders have a tremendous opportunity to build team cohesion through the proper and strategic use of incentives.  Individual team members as well as the team as a whole require the recognition and reward that should be demonstrated when high levels of success are achieved and lasting standards are devised.  Whether it is a team bonus for devising a merger deal or a trophy that is presented in front of the entire organization to each of the winning team members, “excellent results must be recognized” and are developed by strategically aligned incentives that drive upward success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==

Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of leading a team of individuals is making each member of the team feel relevant.  What does this exactly mean?  Consider the following excerpt from the 1949 World War II movie 12 O’ClockHigh. The script picks up after General Savage asks Lt. Jesse Bishop how he feels about the bombing run the team had just accomplished.

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  Well sir, that's hard. I don't know how I feel. That's kind of the trouble.

:'''General Savage''':  What is?

:'''Lt. Bishop''': The whole thing sir, everything. I can't see what good we're doing with our bombing.  All the boys getting killed.  Just a handful of us, it's like we're some kind of guinea pigs, only we're not proving anything.  You've got to have confidence in something, then when you find something you've got confidence in, then everything changes.  It just doesn't make any sense. I just want out.

:'''General Savage''':  Do you think it will be any better in another group?

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  It isn't a question of that sir; I don't want to fly anymore. I want to transfer to another branch.

:'''General Savage''':  Doesn't it mean anything to you that we hit the target today with no losses?  

:'''Lt. Bishop''': Yes sir....I suppose so...in a way, but I just want out. 

:'''General Savage''':  well, that's a pretty tough request from a medal of honor man.  Sure we're guinea pigs Jesse, but there's a reason.  If we can hang on here now, one day soon somebody's gonna look up and see a solid overcast of American bombers on their way to Germany to hit the Third Reich where it lives. Maybe we won't be the ones to see it, I can't promise you that, but I can promise you that they'll be there if only we can manage to make the grade now.

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  I'd like to believe you sir. I just don't have confidence in anything anymore.&lt;ref&gt;12’O Clock High. 1949. Twentieth Century- Fox Film Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

This exchange between General Savage and Lt. Bishop illustrates what happens with many members of group or teams.  Often, members of the team feel much like Lt. Bishop when, even after achieving the desired result, can’t see what good they are doing.  In other words, they feel that the work they are doing is irrelevant to the overall goal and objective of the team or organization.  

In his book Three Signs of a Miserable Job, Patrick Lencioni cites this idea of irrelevance as being one of the main signs of a miserable job.  For our purposes, we can also say that irrelevance is a main sign of a team member feeling miserable within the group.  Lencioni states that, “everyone needs to know that their job matters, to someone. Anyone. Without seeing a connection between the work and the satisfaction of another person or group of people, an employee simply will not find lasting fulfillment. Even the most cynical employees need to know that their work matters to someone, even if it’s just the boss.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lencioni |first= Patrick |title= Three Signs of a Miserable Job |publisher= Jossey-Bass |year= 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that we’ve flushed out this idea of irrelevance, how do team leaders ensure that each one of the team members feels fulfillment in the role that they are playing within the group?  This chapter has cited other topics that lend to helping a team member feel relevant.  Ideas such as incentives and measurement can all assist in making group members feel fulfilled, however there are a few important points that team leaders must touch on to avoid feelings of irrelevance amongst team members.  

===Focus on the Goal===
Kevin Eikenberry, Chief Potential Officer of Kevin Eikenberry Group explains, “Teams don't have to be aligned with the goals of the organization. Teams can work on what they believe to be the right things. They can work diligently on creating the results they think matter. They can be completely committed to success from their perspective.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, teams operate in this manner to the extent that although the team is working towards goals they believe are important to the team, those goals may be totally opposite of the strategic goals of the company.  In the end, although the team may have accomplished much, team members fail to see how their work mattered in the grand scheme of the organization’s goals.  

The result of the team not aligning its goals with what the organization needs results in the team operating in a vacuum.  Eikenberry goes on to say, “sometimes the vacuum is caused by a far more pervasive problem - no clear organizational goals, objectives or strategies exist to align to. Leaders must create clear strategies and they must create a clear line of sight throughout the organization, so people and teams can connect their work to the important strategies of the organization.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One would think that business leaders might have an easy time in assisting teams to align its goals with the overall goals of the organization, however, many times business leaders may neglect to clarify goals to the team or simply forget to share the goals with them.  In the end, it is the responsibility of the business leaders to align the team’s goals.   The question becomes, how do leaders accomplish this task?  The following illustrates some steps that Eikenberry gives as ways to connect the team’s work to organizational goals:  

'''Start At The Beginning:''' Do not communicate the goals of the organization until those goals are set.  Changing the goal midway through the group’s work may derail the team.  Once the goals are set, communicate these goals clearly in the early stages of the team’s development.  Lastly, make sure that you clearly connect the work the team is doing to the organization goal(s).  

'''Generate Conversation:'''  The delivery method of the goal to the team is extremely important.  Do not deliver the organization’s goals in an email or a packet, but rather present the goal verbally to the team and ask for feedback from the team and how their work will fit into these goals.  

'''Get The Team’s Help:'''  Get the team’s input and give them a chance to come up with team goals and objectives that align with the organizational goals.  This will create ownership and allow for a higher level of agreement between team members. 

'''Provide a Connection:'''  Teams need someone from outside the team to act as a liaison between the team and organization.  This usually comes in the way of a team sponsor who doesn’t necessarily sit on the team but provides support and keeps the team from feeling alone. 

'''Make Them Accountable:'''  Once team goals properly align with organization goals, then it is easier to have accountability within the team.  Not only does this improve the team’s results, but can also improve overall team dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuring that the team’s goals align with organizational goals allows for team members to easily connect their work back to a larger objective.  By clearly providing this connection, team member will feel that the work that they do both as a team and as individuals make a difference far beyond just the immediate members of the team. 

===Focus on Personalities:=== 
There really isn’t just one way to resolve the issue of team member’s feelings of irrelevance or the feeling that the work they do goes unnoticed.  Perhaps, one way to solve this problem is to properly understand the many personalities that comprise the team.  There are about a million different personality tests on the internet that can be taken, of which the most popular is Myers-Briggs.  

How does understanding the personalities of team members assist team leaders in making members of the team feel relevant?  Many of us easily see personality traits in one another.  It is fairly easy for us talk about certain personality traits.  We may hear other people tell us that we are energetic or that we are sensitive, however, what do these types of personality traits mean within the context of the team?  More importantly, by completely understanding team member’s personalities, team leaders can use techniques to assist them in making the team member’s work feel relevant and valued. 

As mentioned, Myers-Briggs personality test is the most popular personality test, however, one personality profile that is useful in our context is called the SELF Quiz and can be found at http://www.nationalseminarstraining.com/selfquiz/indexHP.cfm.  By answering and scoring a series of questions, team members can find out which of the four interaction styles their personality mirrors.  The test reveals whether you are a Social, an Efficient, a Loyal, or a Factual.  A complete analysis of what each style means is provided.  The test is free and takes only minutes to complete.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= National Seminars Training: Quiz  |url= from http://www.nationalseminarstraining.com/selfquiz/indexHP.cfm |accessdate= March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most interesting information we can pull out of this is the style definition for each of the four categories.   For example, someone who falls into the Social category, according to the style definition, is motivated by opportunities and friendship.  People who fall into the Efficient category are motivated by success, control and recognition.  

These kinds of insights are important for team leaders and can assist in helping make each team member feel that their work is important and relevant to the team and the organization.  A team leader dealing with someone belonging to the Efficient category may find that giving that person control over certain aspects of the work may make that team member feel all the more relevant.  Likewise, the team leader may try to ensure that someone belonging to the Social category has enough opportunity to connect with people on the team and in the organization in order to go beyond professional relationships and form friendly relationships as well.  

The idea of analyzing team members’ personalities may be somewhat of an unconventional method of making members feel relevant within the team.  However, understanding personalities goes far beyond just understanding how individual personalities may affect team dynamics.  Personalities should be leveraged appropriately to ensure that the needs of each member are met to the best of the team leader’s capabilities.  

===Focus on individual responsibilities:===
Many times team leaders don’t have the option of choosing which members will make up the team.  Regardless, each member will have individual responsibilities within the team.  Often, team leaders may give certain responsibilities to team members according to their expertise or strengths in particular areas.  Other times, the team leader may ask a team member to be responsible for something outside of that person’s expertise in order to gain new perspectives, ideas, or insights.  

At any rate, it is important that the responsibilities given to team members allow them to feel fulfilled.  For example, a team member may not feel comfortable performing high level quantitative analysis but will still accept the responsibility.  Days later that team member may begin to feel frustrated and may feel that the work he/she is doing is subpar and therefore somewhat worthless to the team.    

The point here is that no team dynamic is the same.  Team leaders have the responsibility to ensure that individual responsibilities assigned to team members allow the individual to have the success needed in order to avoid feelings of irrelevance within the team.  

Finally, there are many ways to ensure that team members feel relevant within the team.  Aligning team members’ work to organization goals, understanding how personalities play a role, and ensuring that individual responsibilities allow for team members to feel fulfilled are just three ways that will help team leaders create feelings of relevance among team members.



== Performance Measurement ==

One element key to maintaining morale within a group is the measurement of performance.  It is not sufficient to simply measure whether or not the main task was accomplished.  There will be times that in spite of superior effort by the group and the individuals within it, they may not achieve their goal.  If a group is marked as a failure in these cases, team members are demoralized and are not inspired to participate in the future.  In addition, it is important to measure the performance of individuals within the group to motivate each group member to put forth their best effort.  Individual performance measurement will also benefit the organization as a whole in that new strengths (and weaknesses) may be discovered as the group works together.

===Determining what to measure===
To maintain morale, the factors being measured must have relevancy not only to the individuals within the group, but also to the organization to which the group belongs.  These factors will vary from group to group and from organization to organization.  The factors may be specific to the task at hand, e.g. an engineering group may be assigned to design a child safety seat which meets or exceeds government standards.  In some cases the organization may also have larger goals in mind, e.g. individuals from engineering and marketing may be assigned to accomplish a task and one of the goals the organization has, in addition to designing a safety seat, is also to  improve communication and cooperation between the departments within the organization.

In The Journal for Quality and Participation, Jack Zigon notes, “It is not always obvious what results should be measured. Most teams will use the obvious measures without asking what results they should be producing and how they will know they've done a good job. Even if you know what to measure, it is often not clear how the measurement should be done. Not everything can be easily measured with numbers, thus teams give up when faced with measuring something like &quot;creativity&quot; or &quot;user-friendliness.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Zigon, Jack |title= Team Performance Measurement |work= The Journal for Quality and Participation |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3616/is_199805/ai_n8796212/?tag=content;col1 |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performances that can be measured:===
*Achievement of objective – While this is obviously important and still needs to be measured, unfortunately in many cases it is the only element measured.
*Achievement of milestones – Since many projects are complex and may take years to complete, measuring milestones not only provides occasional motivation for members of a group but also helps track the group’s progress.
*Effort of the group as a whole – Inevitably there will be some tasks assigned to groups which are not completed, such as finding a cure for a particular disease.  To encourage future participation in other efforts or even in the same effort, management needs to, when appropriate, reward the efforts of a group.  In addition, monitoring and measuring the groups’ effort will help determine the wisdom of utilizing certain individuals or the group as a whole for future projects.
*Individual’s team contribution – Participation in team meetings, volunteering for projects, the number of ideas contributed and whether other team members believe them to a valuable part of the team are all areas that can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individual behavior - How well the individual works with other team members,  communicates in a constructive way, cooperates with other team members and participates in group discussions and decision making are important behaviors to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Group behavior – This includes running effective meetings, communicating well with each other, allowing opinions to be shared and coming to a consensus on decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding from the beginning===
It is important that from the beginning the team members understand the following:
#Their performance will be measured
#Why the measurements are important 
#Who will be measuring their performance
#How the measurements will be measured
#Which performances will be measured
#The potential rewards or consequences of the measurements, if any
#Whether any of the performances have priority over others
Having this understanding from the beginning will allow team members to recognize what, besides accomplishing the task, is important to the organization; in addition these measurements can help guide the team as they work on the task.

===Periodic check-ups===
If the task is going to take a considerable amount of time to accomplish, periodic measurements should be taken and feedback shared so that the team can have a clear understanding of their performance along the way and can make adjustments as necessary.  It will also give team members a formal method to bring up concerns.  An additional benefit is that team members can be encouraged throughout the process and will be reminded that how they are performing their task is a matter of on-going interest to the organization.  

===Feedback system===
Jack Zigon also emphasized the importance of creating a feedback system.  The system consists of the documents and procedures used to collect and summarize the data.  He suggests the following steps to design the feedback system:
#Decide what data to collect for each performance standard. The data should be relevant to the standard and specific enough to allow the team to know what was right and wrong compared with the standard. 
#Decide which source the feedback should come from. Possibilities include the job itself, a team member, the team leader, or other people who receive the team's work.
#Decide whether all data or just a sample should be collected. Collect all the data if the measure is very critical and needs to be tracked each time it occurs, or if the accomplishment is performed infrequently. Sample the performance if the accomplishment is performed so frequently that it is not practical to collect all data. 
#Determine when to collect the data. When possible, collect it immediately after completing the work. 
#Determine who should collect the data. When possible the team should collect the data unless gathering the data disrupts the work flow and takes too much time or the completed work is seen only by another person. 
#Determine who, other than the team, needs to receive the data. 
#Review existing reports for possible use as feedback reports. They can be used if the information is relevant to the standard, is specific enough, is frequent enough to be of value, and is not cluttered with useless information. 
#If possible, modify existing reports to meet the criteria. 
#Create your own feedback tables or graphs where necessary. 
#Decide whether it would be of value to summarize the data. If the data covers a short period of time daily, for example-summarizing is probably appropriate. 
#Create the forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Zigon, Jack |title= Team Performance Measurement |work= The Journal for Quality and Participation |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3616/is_199805/ai_n8796212/?tag=content;col1 |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When group members have a clear vision of not only what they are to accomplish but also the importance of their individual contribution and how that will be measured, it will help unify and motivate them throughout the experience.  It also helps management recognize the importance of the individual within the organization.  A common understanding among team members and by management of what is expected helps facilitate the fulfillment of those expectations and aids in the accomplishment of their goals.



== Interpersonal Relationships ==

Groups can be a very effective tool in solving problems and accomplishing tasks. The combined intellects, efforts and creativeness of a group of individuals provides a better outcome than could come from one individual or even from the same individuals working solo on the same tasks. The combination leads to more satisfying outcomes and efficient work.

However groups and teams have their drawbacks. Effectively aligning the differing views of the members of the group can lead to disagreements and has the potential for conflict. It is therefore important to encourage the positive aspects while eliminating the negative aspects of a team in the workplace environment. This section looks at how to increase the positive while mitigating the negative aspects of the interpersonal relationships.

===What are Interpersonal Relationships?===
A team, in the business context, is a group of people that have been placed together to complete a task or solve a problem. They share a common purpose and are interdependent on the other members of the team. The interdependence of the members of the team creates interpersonal relationships. An interpersonal relationship is an association between two or more people.

===How are Interpersonal Relationships Beneficial?===
One of the greatest assets that a group or team can have is good interpersonal relationships with each other.  A team that feels comfortable working together can have an energy that creates a positive environment and work ethic that can lift a team, making it more effective. This positive environment can make team members work harder, more efficiently and more productively.
Teams that work well together have been shown to be more effective. In fact, how well teams achieve goals is directly related to how effective the team is at working together. “Healthy team relationships are characteristic of unusually successful teams.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, interpersonal conflict is the most destructive force to a team’s success. A team that cannot work effectively together will not work effectively at all. 

There have been arguments that a team does not have to have a good interpersonal relationship in order to be effective. But consider the fact that a team in which the members rely on and trust each other is not putting forth additional effort to manage conflict, hurt, and bias or trying to guess what the “opposition” is doing. They are able to focus their efforts more effectively. Time and energy are directed at the common goal and not at resolving conflicts within the group dynamic. They are all able to put forth 100% of their efforts to the project at hand, confident in the fact that each member is doing the same, not worrying about what the other participants may be thinking or doing. 

Just imagine two different working scenarios. In the first one, those involved in their particular project are energized and excited about coming in to work.  They enjoy the association and sense of accomplishment from working within their group. The other group members despise getting up in the morning knowing they have to come in to work.  They hate what they do and those that they work with.

It’s pretty obvious which group is going to be more effective at completing their project.

===Interpersonal Conflict===
Whenever you put a group of individuals together there is the potential for conflict. These interpersonal conflicts tend to arise due to personal differences between individuals. This conflict is damaging to the team and their environment. It degrades the effectiveness of achieving the highest outcomes. A team is made up of individuals. Each individual has their own thoughts, ideas, and personality. Consequently, these don’t always align, nor should they. A team made up of clones, would destroy the whole purpose of putting a group of individuals together in the first place. A team is not formed for the sole purpose that “many hands make light work,” but because they each have skills and talents specific to the individual. Therefore, each member adds to the group in a different way.

As organizations change their structures to be flatter, the team has become the predominant entity within the company. Teams are used to complete projects, solve problems and many other functions within the organization. However the team structure creates an environment in which managers rely on peer relationships to accomplish tasks. In groups where team members have a similar objective and where there is a friendly atmosphere, especially if they have been working in conjunction for a while, the team will work well together and there will be fewer conflicts. “Inevitably, though, no matter how harmonious the group or how structured the organization, conflicts are bound to occur. Some conflicts may feel unproductive, even destructive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cartwright |first= Talula |title= [[Managing Conflict with Peers]] |publisher= [[Center for Creative Leadership]] |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You can take a group of skilled, intelligent and competent individuals and put them together and their success in a group will come down to whether or not they can work together. The amount of brain power, skill and potential to solve problems will matter little if they cannot work in harmony. If contention, feelings of spite, betrayal, or disloyalty arise than it will undermine the work of each individual to the point that nothing can be accomplished. For this very reason one of the most important tools that a team must have is a good working relationship.

Going into a group environment and believing that conflict will never occur is naive. Team leaders and team members should be mindful that conflict ''does'' and ''will'' arise. The goal is to effectively resolve the conflict and get the team back to working effectively.

Team members should never ignore conflict within the group when it surfaces. They should not just hope that it will go away or resolve itself. They must not assume that if they don't bring the problem up that the group can still function without resolving the issues at hand. Problems that are ignored and continue to fester will just cause ineffectiveness in the team. A problem that is ignored may also explode at a most inconvenient time and destroy the group altogether. Conflicts, especially interpersonal conflicts, need to be dealt with as soon as they are discovered, in an appropriate manner, so that the team can get back to work and effectively meet its goals.

There are generally considered two types of conflicts that arise in a group. The first is task conflict and the second is relationship conflict. Task conflict is described as disagreements on how to proceed, or a disagreement on what tasks should be preformed to meet the end goal. Relationship conflicts are personal issues that arise between members. They revolve around personal disagreements or dislikes between individuals in a team and rarely have much to do with the actual project.

Task conflicts are generally beneficial. These conflicts may be discussions on “how to improve a process, make the product better, provide a better service, or improve client relationships.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of conflicts are considered productive and discussions on such topics generally lead to the most constructive outcomes. “What usually results from productive conflicts are better, new, or different solutions to the concerns and issues the conflicting parties are having.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If task conflicts are not monitored and mediated by a team leader, these conflicts can become relationship conflicts. Care must be taken to ensure that task conflicts remain about the issues and don’t become personal. Relationship conflicts arise from a disagreement or conflict involving “personality, work style, or differences in beliefs or values.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Crawley described business conflict within a team as “a condition between or among workers whose jobs are interdependent, who feel angry, who perceive the other(s) as being at fault, and who act in ways that cause a business problem.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawley |first= John |title= [[Constructive Conflict management]] |publisher= [[Pfeiffer &amp; Company]] |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes a workplace conflict as containing each of the same following elements:
#They are interdependent
#They blame each other
#They are angry
#Their behavior is causing a business problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawley |first= John |title= [[Constructive Conflict management]] |publisher= [[Pfeiffer &amp; Company]] |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gary Topchik, in his First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building, states that when team members become “critical of another team member’s actions, behaviors, or appearance, this is unproductive conflict that must be resolved very quickly. If not, the team will become self-destructive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What can you do?===
It is improbable that anyone will go through their life without having to deal with conflict in one form or another. The same can be said of a team; eventually every member of a team will face a disagreement, differences or conflict. So the question is what to do.
“The productive resolution of conflict usually strengthens relationships, whereas destructive confrontation, e.g., blaming, name calling, usually destroys relationships, or at the very least, detracts from their satisfaction and usefulness. Thus it is very important how you confront the conflict once you have decided to do so.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bercovitch |first= Jacob |title= [[Resolving Interpersonal Conflict]] |publisher= [[The American University]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In When Teams Work Best, the authors describe first the questions and then the answers to “building and sustaining collaborative team relationships.”  They begin by describing the “four underlying characteristics of good relations”  as:
#They are constructive
#They are productive
#They embrace mutual understanding
#They are constructively self-correcting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Next they offer four questions that “form the basis for assessing the degree to which an interaction contributes to building a good relationship.” 
#Did we have a constructive conversation?
#Was the conversation productive enough to make a difference?
#Did we understand and appreciate each other’s perspective?
#Did we both commit to making improvements?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Which leads to what they call the CONNECT model.&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''	Commit to the relationship&lt;br&gt;
'''O'''	Optimize Safety&lt;br&gt;
'''N'''	Narrow the discussion to one issue&lt;br&gt;
'''N'''	Neutralize defensiveness&lt;br&gt;
'''E'''	Explain and echo each perspective&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''	Change one behavior each&lt;br&gt;
'''T'''	Track it!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*The relationship we have with this supplier is essentially 'evergreen'.
*It is assumed that renewal of agreements in this relationship will occur.
*The parties make plans not only for terms of current purchases, but also for the continuance of the relationship.

'''Function machine''' is a popular metaphor for visualizing input and output of a procedure, or the idea of a function, and related notions. It is accessible to toddlers, yet is robust enough to be taken to college-level work.

== History and Known Uses ==
...

== What is Being Visualized ==
* Input and output
* Function

== Visualization Techniques ==
The basic visual metaphor is a machine that &quot;does something&quot; to objects that enter into one of its openings, and exit through another. In this form, it immediately supports:
* Input and output
* Inverse functions (&quot;machine working backwards&quot;)
* Domain and range (&quot;what can go into the machine and what can come out&quot;)

Extensions of the metaphor include:
* Iteration and cycles(&quot;a tube connecting the output of the machine to the input&quot;)
* Multi-variable functions (&quot;many input openings&quot;)
* Composition of functions (&quot;two or more machines attached together&quot;)

==The Theorem==

[[File:Rtriangle.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|A right-angle triangle]]  

In a right triangle (''right-angled triangle'') the longest side is always furthest away from the right angle.  It is called the '''hypotenuse'''.  The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated from the lengths of the two other sides.  In the diagram, ''c'' is the hypotenuse and we can calculate it from ''a'' and ''b''.  

This is a statement of the '''Pythagorean Theorem''' or '''Pythagoras' Theorem''' - as an equation relating the lengths of the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'':&lt;ref name=Sally0&gt;

|isbn=0821844032 |year=2007 |publisher=American Mathematical Society Bookstore}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a^2 + b^2 = c^2\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' represents the length of the hypotenuse, and ''a'' and ''b'' represent the lengths of the other two sides.

This only works for right triangles!

{{clear}}

For the right angle triangle with corners labelled by A,B,C as shown, the following says the same thing:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}^2 + \overline{AC}^2 = \overline{AB}^2&lt;/math&gt;

All we've done here is just use a different notation for the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.

===Geometrical Interpretation===
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').]]
We can also show this equation with a diagram, as on the right, where each side of a right angle triangle has a square attached to it.  This is the geometrical interpretation of the Pythagorean theorem, looking at the theorem as a theorem about areas.  The areas of the smaller squares add up to the area of the larger square.

In terms of areas, the Pythagorean Theorem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two ways of talking about the Pythagorean theorem amount to exactly the same thing, since the area of a square is just the length of one side squared.

==History of the Theorem==
[[File:Pythagoras-Münz.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Pythagoras, depicted on a 3rd-century coin]]
The Pythagorean theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who by tradition is credited with its discovery and proof,&lt;ref name=Allman2&gt;

{{cite book |title=Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid |author=George Johnston Allman |page=26 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-gYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |publisher=Hodges, Figgis, &amp; Co |year=1889 |quote=The discovery of the law of three squares, commonly called the &quot;theorem of Pythagoras&quot; is attributed to him by&amp;nbsp;– amongst others&amp;nbsp;– Vitruvius, Diogenes Laertius, Proclus, and Plutarch ... |edition=Reprinted by Kessinger Publishing LLC 2005 |isbn=143260662X}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heath144&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Heath|1921|loc= Vol I, p. 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him. There is much evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula.&lt;ref name=Neugebauer&gt;

That notion is pretty much laid to rest by {{cite journal |author=Eleanor Robson |title=Words and Pictures: New Light on Plimpton 322  |year=2002 |doi= 10.2307/2695324|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2695324 |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=105–120 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |ref=harv}} See also [http://www.dma.ulpgc.es/profesores/pacheco/Robson.pdf pdf file].

==Three Worked Examples==

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;b&gt;In a ''right'' triangle&lt;br/&gt;
The square of the hypotenuse &lt;br/&gt;
is equal to &lt;br/&gt;
the sum of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;/b&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 1}}
An often used example for the Pythagorean Theorem is a right triangle in which &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b=4&lt;/math&gt; 
because the numbers come out particularly nicely:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 a^2 + b^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 3^2 + 4^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
   9 + 16  &amp; = &amp; 25
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c^2=25&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=\sqrt{25}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=5&lt;/math&gt;
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 2}}
Another often used example is a right triangle in which the two remaining angles are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and both &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b=1&lt;/math&gt;.
This time the answer doesn't come out as a whole number:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 a^2 + b^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 1^2 + 1^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
   1 + 1  &amp; = &amp; 2
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c^2=2&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and we can stop here, or else give the answer as a decimal.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c\approx 1.414&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; symbol means 'approximately'.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 3}}
One more example a right triangle in which the shorter sides are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p=11&lt;/math&gt; cm and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q=7&lt;/math&gt; cm.  

What's this about &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q&lt;/math&gt;?  It really doesn't matter what letter we use to name the lengths of the sides as long as we are consistent.  The formula in the blue box still holds.  In this case we could call the hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r&lt;/math&gt;, and so we have &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p^2+q^2=r^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 p^2 + q^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 11^2 + 7^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
  121 + 49  &amp; = &amp; 170
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r^2=170&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r=\sqrt{170}&lt;/math&gt; cm

and giving the answer as a decimal.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r\approx 13.04&lt;/math&gt; cm

===Does the answer make sense?===

It's worth checking the answer makes some kind of sense.  If the short sides are 11&amp;nbsp;cm and 7&amp;nbsp;cm is it reasonable that the long side is about 13&amp;nbsp;cm?  Yes, it is.  If you'd got an answer of 20&amp;nbsp;cm (or 170&amp;nbsp;cm) it would be unreasonable.  The two other sides won't stretch that far.  Or if the answer were 11&amp;nbsp;cm or less than you'd know that you hadn't got the length of the hypotenuse, the longest side.  We're OK here with this answer of 13.04&amp;nbsp;cm, which we probably should round down to 13&amp;nbsp;cm.

==In 3D==
[[File:Pythagoras 3D.PNG|thumb|Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides.]]

Pythagoras' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. 

Consider the rectangular solid shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' along the floor of the rectangular solid is found from Pythagoras' theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{BD}^{\,2} = \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras' theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
or, doing it all in one step:
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is the three-dimensional expression for the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\overline{AD}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the three mutually perpendicular sides.

This one-step formula may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras' theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem.

==The Pyramid of Khafre==

{{ExampleRobox|title=An Example in 3 Dimensions}}

[[File:01 khafre north.jpg|thumb|350px|The Khafre Pyramid; 274 cubits high; base 412 x 412 cubits]]
[[File:Pyramid-Calc.svg|thumb|350px|Lines and labels for working out the length of the sloping edge '''AC''']]
This example is in three dimensions and again we have to use the Pythagorean Theorem twice.

The great pyramid of Khafre is 274 cubits high.  It has a square base and the square has sides of length 412 cubits.  What is the length of the sloping diagonal edge from a corner up to the summit?

* To answer this question we work in two stages.  See the diagram.
* The line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; is vertical and the line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is horizontal, so there is a right angle triangle with sides &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt;.  This lets us calculate the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.
* We need to be careful.  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; is 274 cubits, but &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is half the length of the side of the square, so &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 412/2 = 206&lt;/math&gt; cubits.

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

What is the length of the hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; of the triangle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle AOB&lt;/math&gt;? Well,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 \overline{AO}^2 + \overline{OB}^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 274^2 + 206^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 75,076 + 42,436  &amp; = &amp; 117,512
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}^2=117,512&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}=\sqrt{117,512}&lt;/math&gt; cubits

We've made progress, but we want the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, not the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.  

* Now we have another right angle triangle, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; with the right angle at B.  We want the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  We have just calculated &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and we know, because the base of the pyramid is a square, that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; is once again 206 cubits.  This time &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; is the hypotenuse (of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt;). So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 \overline{AB}^2 + \overline{BC}^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 \sqrt{117,512}^2 + 206^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 117,512 + 42,436  &amp; = &amp; 159,948
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}^2=159,948&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}=\sqrt{159,948}&lt;/math&gt; cubits

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}\approx 400&lt;/math&gt; cubits

{{Robox/Close}}

==Other forms==
As pointed out in the introduction, if ''c'' denotes the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, Pythagoras' theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\, &lt;/math&gt;

or, solved for ''c'':

: &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

That is what we have been doing in all the examples above.  We are using the shorter sides to work out what the length of the hypotenuse is.

If the hypotenuse ''c'' is known, and the length of one of the legs must be found, the following equations can be used:

: &lt;math&gt;b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Pythagorean equation provides a simple relation among the three sides of a right triangle so that if the lengths of any two sides are known, the length of the third side can be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ingredient}}

Safflower oil is flavorless and colorless, and nutritionally similar to sunflower oil. It is used mainly in cosmetics and as a cooking oil, in salad dressing, and for the production of margarine. It may also be taken as a nutritional supplement.

[[File:Tuerkischer safran.jpg|thumb|left|Safflower purchased at a market in Turkey]]
Safflower flowers are occasionally used in cooking as a cheaper substitute for saffron, and are thus sometimes referred to as &quot;bastard saffron.&quot;  

There are two types of safflower that produce different kinds of oil: one high in monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) and the other high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid). Currently the predominant oil market is for the former, which is lower in saturates than olive oil, for example.

{{Meteorology_TOC|show=ch12|float=right}}

==Where they form==
Tropical cyclones form in all hemispheres, although their activity is concentrated in certain areas. The ocean basins in which tropical cyclones most commonly form in are the Northern Indian, Western Pacific, Central Pacific Eastern Pacific, Northern Atlantic, Southern Pacific, Australian Region, and Southwestern Indian. Elsewhere, storms are rare; for example, only two officially-recognized TCs have formed in the Southern Atlantic. This storm occurred in March 2004 and struck Brazil and offshore Brazil in March 2010. Dubbed Catarina, its wind speeds reached 100 miles per hour, or 155 kilometers per hour; the latter was dubbed Anita. 

===Northern Hemisphere===
The Northern Indian Ocean is responsible for fueling extremely destructive and deadly tropical cyclones, including the deadliest storm worldwide. TCs in this region tend to form between April and December, and their designations vary based on their intensity. Weaker systems are dubbed &quot;depressions&quot; or &quot;deep depressions&quot;, while the most intense are known as &quot;very severe cyclonic storms&quot;. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar, causing large-scale devastation. 

The Western Pacific sees the most storms; its season runs year-round, and mature tropical cyclones here are called &quot;typhoons&quot;. Typhoons, including weaker tropical storms, may number in the dozens every year, and can grow to monstrous sizes and strengths. Typhoon Tip in 1979 holds the record for the strongest tropical cyclone in the world, bearing 1-minute sustained winds of 190 miles per hour. Its pressure sunk to 870 millibars; for comparison, the average air pressure at sea level is over 140 millibars higher. Tip struck Japan after weakening over water.

Hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific are also prolific. Hurricane season has an official boundary in this basin: May 15 to November 31. Nonetheless, storms have been known to occur outside these limits. While hurricanes often strengthen into major cyclones, they usually drift westward and dissipate at sea, causing no major harm to land. Occasionally they recurve northward and strike Mexico or even the United States, though almost always at weakened states. In October 2002, Hurricane Kenna moved ashore on the Mexican state of Nayarit, inflicting substantial damage. In the Central Pacific, hurricanes are much less common, and any storms present in this area usually enter from the Eastern Pacific. Hawaii and Johnston Atoll are the only land in the path of storms.

Storms in the Northern Atlantic, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, are also referred to as &quot;hurricanes&quot;. Each season, defined as between June 1 and November 31, contains an average of around 10 named tropical storms. However, during the 2005 season, 28 storms warranted naming. Most commonly observed in the month of September, hurricanes in the Atlantic often affect land. Among them was Hurricane Katrina, an extremely powerful and catastrophic cyclone that struck the United States in August 2005. Its impact included upwards of $80 billion in damage and approximately 1,836 fatalities.  

===Southern Hemisphere===
The Southern Hemisphere is comprised of three main tropical cyclone basins: the Southwestern Indian (west of west of 90°E), the Australian Region (between 90°E and 160°E), and the Southern Pacific (east of 160°E). The Southern Pacific cyclone season officially runs between December 1 and April 30. On average, 9 tropical cyclones form every season, of which 4.5 will intensify into severe tropical cyclones. The most intense cyclone ever recorded was named Zoe, and formed during December 2002, extending into the following year.

Cyclones in Australia tend to form between November 1 and April 30. The strongest storm ever recorded in the are was Cyclone Gwenda, which occurred during April 1999; other severe storms include cyclones Inigo, George, and Orson. 

Finally, in the Southwest Indian, the official cyclone season extends from November 15 to April 30. Storms here commonly impact Madagascar and parts of Africa.

'''Bamboo shoots''' are the edible shoots (new bamboo culms that come out of the ground) of the bamboo species ''Bambusa vulgaris'' and ''Phyllostachys edulis''. They are used in numerous Asian dishes and broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, both fresh and canned versions. 

[[File:Bamboo sprouts in basket.jpg|thumb|Whole bamboo shoots after being harvested]]

In Indonesia, they are sliced thinly to be boiled with coconut milk and spices to make a dish named ''gulai rebung''. Other recipes using bamboo shoots are ''sayur lodeh'' (mixed vegetables in coconut milk) and ''lun pia'': fried wrapped bamboo shoots  with vegetables). Note that the shoots of some species contain cyanide that need to be leached or boiled out before they can be eaten safely. Slicing the bamboo shoots thinly assists in this leaching.

Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the pith of the young shoots.

In India, bamboo shoots are part of the traditional cuisine, used in a wide variety of dishes - among which are iromba, ooti and kangshu ar eto.

In Nepal, they are used in dishes, which have been well-known in Nepal for centuries. A popular dish is Tama (fermented), with आलु (Potato), बोडी (Beans). In Vietnamese cuisine, shredded bamboo shoots are used alone or with other vegetable in many stir-fried vegetable dishes. It may also be used as the sole vegetable ingredient in pork chop soup.

In Philippine cuisine, they are called &quot;Labong&quot;.  Two most popular dish for this is the &quot;Ginataang Labong&quot; (labong with coconut milk and chilies) and &quot;Dinengdeng na Labong&quot; (labong in fish bagoong with string beans, saluyot, and tinapa).</text>

Northern Irish food is generally heavily influenced by both Irish and British cuisine - A local interpretation of Irish stew consisting of either diced steak or minced beef is regularly eaten in the province, as is Fish and chips. However there are a few exceptions that are unique to Northern Ireland and difficult to find among either. A few examples include The 'Ulster Fry'- a Northern Irish interpretation of the English breakfast that traditionally includes Wheaten and/or Soda Bread. Another is 'pasties' often available at chip shops in Northern Ireland (not to confused with Cornish pasties), which consists of a burger-like patty made from minced pork and peppered vegetables deep fried in batter. It is often served in a bap and referred to as a 'pastie bap' or simply served with chips and referred to as a 'pastie supper'. A mainstay among Northern Irish dinners is 'Champ' - Or spring onions ('scallions' as they are often known as in the 6 counties) boiled in milk and mixed in with mashed potatoes with a bit of butter, often served as a compliment to a main ingredient such as steak or pork chops.

== Global Sysop vote ==

What's with all the constant questioning of everybody who has added an 'oppose' vote for the Global Sysop proposal?  Why are these people (including myself) being harassed?  Let people have their say and move on.  I don't see lots of questions being asked of those who've voted in support of the proposal?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:15, 7 January 2010 (UTC)
:The point is they need to ''say'' why they oppose. I've been working on this series of proposals for probably a year, maybe more. It is insulting that people would not give due consideration. Asking for that is not harassment. The reason I haven't asked supporters for the same is because they are indicating agreement with the proposal - which outlines very precisely the rationale. Some have included additional reasoning, which is even better. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

==Global sysop amendment==
hello Mike. Thank you for your constructive comments on the section I added to the global sysop-vote (&quot;proposal to amend wording&quot;). You bring up a good point about granting permanent sysop-ship as well. Please see my comment in that section for further discussion. I highly appreciate your cooperation.

==Accusing==
I went through ANI regarding this individual.  If you want to look through my recent history you will see it, but since this is public I will not name names.  I was asked to stop, I have stopped the proceedings.   You can contact me at trackinfoorg at yahoo if you wish.  Nothing was solved.  My conclusion is:  Administrators will just protect their own.  We mere editors have little say.  I raised the issue not because of my stub article, but because of the obvious history this guy has.  That &quot;habit&quot; was not dealt with and in fact, was praised.

This great plan you are so heavily advocating will result in empowering more of these monsters to arbitrarily delete things--without using the procedures in place.  One powerful person's opinion outweighs the ability of another to defend their work.  That is not how consensus is achieved or how WP should work.  Power corrupts.[[User:Trackinfo|Trackinfo]] ([[User talk:Trackinfo|talk]]) 21:26, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
:We currently have a group of fewer people with more power. The proposal aims to spread it out more, and you somehow think that's a problem? &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

== GSysop ==
Just a few clarification, nothing important or urgent (you can even point me to the right pages and I'll look them over), that is missing on that discussion or I couldn't find a mention of it.&lt;br&gt;
#If the proposal was adopted what projects would qualify for criteria?
#:[[m:Global sysops/wiki set]] (with additions/removals depending upon who opts-in/-out)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
#Why was it decided for a top down approach and not rely in each of the &quot;needy&quot; projects to call for outside help, this seems would be more representative and less bureaucratic.
#:The whole point is that these projects don't really have that capacity. That's also why we're trying to provide a hopefully-sane default for inclusion, while still allowing adjustment per-wiki as needed. Furthermore, the people doing this work are largely [[m:SWMT]] members -- and that group ''is'' calling for global sysops. Vocally. The main proposers all come from that group. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
#I'm not aware on the procedures and qualifications but is this a sign that Wikimedia is creating too many projects or making it too easy to put them up without thinking on the wasting of good faith by volunteers and resources that could be better invested elsewhere?
#:No, I think the need for this reflects the maturation of the community. As we get older, we have fewer new contributors, which means fewer people countering vandalism. So, there's a need to have more people with privileged access sufficient to take up the slack. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
Personally my intuited responses to those questions is what decided my vote. I think that due to the chaos that seems to be reigning on those pages clarifying this issues would help. I also have a particular dislike on how votes/pools outside of wikibooks are coordinated in general, I know here we (sadly) do not always do it formally but we at least can keep some order, its a freak show out-there...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:21, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
:I've replied inline for most.
:I do agree, the vote has become a bit of a cesspool - I don't envy the steward to has to read everything and come to a conclusion as to what consensus exists, if any. The main issue truly is a lack of understanding. For example, people are questioning that there is even a problem with vandalism. While that is self-evident to myself, and many others who do work in that area (and so we see it day in day out), it is not so evident to many. I wish there was an easy way we could show people something to prove there is a problem that needs fixing, but that is not so easy to do - the best way is to have them join us and see for themselves as it happens. But that isn't likely to occur. Likewise, actually reading and understanding the proposal is a problem. People have been complaining that there is no restriction like &quot;vandalism only&quot; -- but that is exactly what &quot;urgent abuse&quot; refers to. We simply used that to include spam and malbots and ... so on. In fact, most complaints are actually dealt with in the proposal.

::Thanks for the info. It changed a bit my position on the subject and if the clarification is added (regarding the default opt-in, and how to get out of it) I'll remove my opposition. I still think the general approach is bad but also understand the issue with vandalism, so there is a need for balance and because you said the push for the proposal to pass is coming from projects that are affected, then it isn't my place to block it.&lt;br&gt;
::The reasons I'm still in disagree result from the creation of the function. The communities that should care for the each project will loses some control over them (or diverted form exerting it).
::Fighting vandalism also shows what fragilities exist and by reducing the need for them to take responsibility then few will decide to take a more active role on those projects (that is why I agree with some of the opinions that if there isn't enough critical mass projects should fold). Taking up bureaucratic tasks (not particularly using the tools) isn't the major motivator for people to join the project in the first place but is as important or more than only contributing content, it is also more time sensitive and requires a greater commitment. This is why I'm also discontent with abolishing of the patrolling of pages here, it provided a reason for people to understand what is going on beyond their pet projects and move from a being a simpler user to a full member of the community. Most of our promotions for the other tools came from that group of people.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:03, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

Mike,

I need some help knowing what it is that the staff of Wiki want from us regarding the copyright on this material.  I thought we just took care of this with one of the other admins. I'm not sure what exactly you took issue with regarding the link you sent, there is some similar wording but I assure you that all of the content of the document has been reviewed by attorneys and is perfectly legal for us to post in this realm, as it is owned by the Maryland State Bar Association.  A group which consists of business and COPYRIGHT attorneys and I was told that all I had to do was make the link on the first page and that would take care of the issue.  As you can see, I did link to the MSBA website, and I will properly cite any text that is determined to be derived from a government document, but please keep in mind that I am new to this and still do not have your system completely figured out yet, so I am somewhat slow in my edits.  Please feel free to call me and discuss any legal issues you have with this publication as I am an attorney and I am sure that we can clear up any concerns that the Wiki people have with our submission.

Thank you,

Bill McComas

:Probably just a coincidence that I found some matching text then - no problem. We just need you to email {{email|info|wikibooks.org}} saying that all the copyright holders release their work under the site license (cc-by-sa). I know you've done this on-wiki, but we need you to do it by email, using an email address associated with the Maryland State Bar Association. Otherwise, you could be anybody - and getting away with copyright infringement.

Thank you for your reply, I will have someone email you as soon as possible from the MSBA to confirm that this is a collaborative work created by the attorneys that are involved with the project.  I appreciate your diligence in monitoring the copyrights for wiki, and apologize if I was curt in my reply, I was just getting very frustrated with trying to comb through all of your pages to get an answer to what exactly you all wanted or needed from us to post this publication, and for someone that is not as technically literate as it appears everyone else is on this site, I was just trying to get the thing up so people could see it, and as soon as I typed something it seemed you all were mighty quick on the trigger.  I would appreciate it if we could take down the huge signs on the site that accuse us of copyright infringement in the meantime as it is defaming to our organization to accuse us without verification.  

Thank you for your help in this matter, once again, I invite you to call me with any further concerns that you may have regarding the posted publication.
Bill McComas Esq.

oh and p.s. I will work on splitting it up into smaller sections once I get the information posted, and if you could rename the publication to The Maryland Entrepreneur's Guide I would very much appreciate it.

Thanks again
:Done &amp; done. Thanks for taking care of this - there's no real rush, the text isn't going anywhere while you get someone to email us. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

Thank you for your help, I will work on the rest of the subsections, and you should be receiving the email soon from the MSBA.

== [[Special:Contributions/Jkelly952|k-12math.info]] ==

Quite a few pages have been created recently (they stand out too, in all-caps) with links to k-12math.info.  I do not see an appropriate license on that page and suspect these additions are to promote this website.  While [[User:Jkelly952|Jkelly952]] states that he is Jim Kelly, at the very least these need to have an OTRS notification, but this could be link spam. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:12, 15 February 2010 (UTC)


What is an OTRS notification? I use a .info extension because the purpose of my site is to provide information, with no distraction or screen space being taken up with advertising. And I am not sure what &quot;link spam&quot; is ? Sorry if my 68 year old mind does not fully understand - I am just trying to provide information. -- Jim Kelly [[User:Jkelly952|Jkelly952]]
:OTRS is just the way of raising a request (open ticket request system). If you read [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|here]] on Wikipedia it explains how to request copyright permission. It's easy to infer from here how you also give the permission to reuse your material. The book if created here should not have &quot;k-12math.info&quot; as the name because this is &quot;link spam&quot;. That is, it relates the name of a web site (k-12math.info) directly to Wikibooks. It is also not a sensible name for a book. For example, if you wrote a paper book about Wikibooks you wouldn't title it ''en.wikibooks.org'', you'd call it &quot;Wikibooks&quot;. Similarly you should find a more descriptive name for your text book that doesn't appear to promote your web site. You should also read the guide to structuring books here as the pages should be named in a way that links them together.

I don't see anything at [[k-12math.info]] - am I missing something? I'll look into any link additions though. @Jkelly952: you can email {{email|info|wikibooks.org}} with a release for the copyright on anything you add to Wikibooks that's been previously published elsewhere. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:10, 14 March 2010 (UTC)

[[Special:Contributions/Cro-mag rally registration code : AMAHFJDHFMAM|User:Cro-mag rally registration code : AMAHFJDHFMAM]] may appear as a problem elsewhere.

== G'day Mike ==

As a very new chap over here on wikibooks, I don't really feel that I should join in the discussion about the unblock of thekohser, which I would support, but I did think it was worth popping in here to ask about your recent request to remove your checkuser rights on this project.

I just had a bit of a chat about this on the stewards IRC channel (really to learn about how the various rights work etc.) and I thought I'd follow it up by popping in here. I'm sure you'd be aware that there's a risk of a 'fishy' appearance to your stepping down, because of the simultaneous request to remove Adrignola's rights, due to there no longer being two checkusers - and in part due to your technical ability, as a steward, to restore your checkuser rights if you felt there was an emergency (perhaps if a 'globally banned' user was active ;-) - anywhoo, I thought your take on the whole thing was worth asking for - and I think it'd probably be best to explicitly state it if you've decided not to use checkuser on this wiki under any circumstances - which I personally feel would be for the best :-) cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 06:23, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

[[file:Figaro Liquid Smoke.jpg|thumb|197px|A bottle of liquid smoke]]

'''Liquid smoke''' is a substance produced from smoke passed through water. Liquid smoke is used for both food preservation and flavouring. Liquid smoke consists of smoke produced through the controlled burning of wood chips or sawdust, condensed and then passed through water, which captures and dissolves the smoke-flavoured components in solution. This base can be condensed and modified through many methods to develop a wide range of smoke flavours.

== Uses ==

Liquid smoke is often used in the processing of bacon and hot dogs, and is one of the main flavours in the curing solution used for bacon. It is also used to flavour jerky and tofu. Liquid smoke is also used in some soft cheeses and tempeh.</text>

[[File:Modified_food_starch.JPG|thumb|right|Modified starch]]
'''Modified starch''' is a food additive which is prepared by treating starch or starch granules, causing the starch to be partially degraded. Modified starch is used as a thickening agent, stabilizer, or an emulsifier. Starches are modified for a number of reasons. Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time and cooling or freezing; to change their texture; to decrease the viscosity, or to lengthen or shorten gelatinization time. 

'''Acid-treated starch''' (E1401), usually simply called &quot;modified starch&quot;, is prepared by treating starch or starch granules with inorganic acids, breaking down the starch molecule and thus reducing the viscosity.

Other treatments may produce modified starch with different E numbers, such as alkaline-modified starch (E1402), bleached starch (E1403), oxidized starch (E1404), enzyme-treated starch, acetylated starch (E1420), and acetylated oxidized starch (E1451).

Pre-gelatinized starch is used to thicken instant desserts, allowing the food to thicken with the addition of cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.</text>

This formula was first published in Danxi Xinfa (Danxi's Experiential Therapy). Its Chinese name (虎潜丸, pinyin: hǔ qián wán) literally means &quot;Tiger Dive Pill&quot;. The herbs in this formula were typically ground into powder and made into boluses with honey for oral application.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients of Xiao Chaihu Tang are:
# Huangbai - 150g
# Zhiguiban - 120g
# Chaozhimu - 60g
# Shudihuang - 60g
# Chenpi - 60g

This formula was used for tuberculosis of the knee joint, myodystrophy, perpheral palsy, poliomyelitis sequel, and flaccidity of the lower limbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exception handling ==
There are two main ways to [[w:Exception handling|handle errors]] in code, in order to avoid to stop the program when they occur.

=== &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo&lt;/code&gt; ===
The older method used in VBA is &quot;unstructured&quot; error handling, still available via the &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo&lt;/code&gt; syntax, because it uses a [[w:Goto|Goto]] toward a label. This is still useful in certain circumstances where you wish to &lt;code&gt;Resume&lt;/code&gt; processing after handling the error. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Public Sub Main()
        On Error GoTo Label1
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Result = a / b  ' Division by zero
Label1:
        MessageBox.Show(Result)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

To avoid to define the labels, it's possible to simply ask to ignore all errors, during a certain time, and reactivate them with &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo 0&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
        On Error Resume Next
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Result = a / b
        On Error GoTo 0
        MessageBox.Show(Result)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;Try...Catch...Finally&lt;/code&gt; ===
&quot;Structure error handling&quot; is available with the newer &lt;code&gt;Try...Catch...Finally&lt;/code&gt; syntax. Various error conditions are implemented via inheritors of the base &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; class. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Public Sub Main()
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Try
            Result = a / b
        Catch ex As Exception
            MsgBox(ex.ToString)
        Finally
            MessageBox.Show(Result)
        End Try

HINT: If you wish to re-throw an exception inside a &lt;code&gt;Catch&lt;/code&gt; block, use the &lt;code&gt;Throw&lt;/code&gt; keyword without any arguments (particularly, do not use &quot;Throw ex&quot;). The Throw keyword resets the &lt;code&gt;.StackTrace&lt;/code&gt; property of the exception object if an argument is supplied. Throw, without any arguments inside a &lt;code&gt;Catch&lt;/code&gt; block will re-throw the error without resetting the &lt;code&gt;.StackTrace&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2010/03/04/too-much-reuse.aspx Eric Lippert's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Time and Space ==

A simple sentience in Loglan only defines a relationship between the arguments but says nothing about where on when the relationship holds true. Unlike some natural languages, you can chose to add time and space to a sentence in Loglan or chose to leave it out. 

The Loglan sentence, ''mi viska tu'' means ''I see you'' or '' I was seen by you'' or ''I will see you''. English forces us to add in the time; was it past, present or future? But in Loglan ''mi viska tu'' can hold true if I see you now or I have seen you or even if I will see you at some point in the future. Loglan does not force you to refer to time or space. 

Loglan treats time and space the same. That means you place a relationship in time the same way that you place it in space; you add one of three words for time and one of three words for space. Whatever you can do with time words you can do with space words. 

For time we have the following three words:

* pa

* na

* fa


For space we have the following three words:

* vi

* va

* vu


=== pa, na, and fa ===

If we want to add time into a sentence Loglan provides us with three little words to do that; ''pa'', ''na'' and ''fa''. You can add theses little words anywhere in the sentence.

The little word ''pa'' refers to the past and means ''before''.

* mi vizka tu ''pa'' - I saw you

* mi ''pa'' vizka tu - I saw you

* ''pa'' mi vizka tu - I saw you

The little word ''na'' refers to now and means ''at the instance of''.

* mi ''na'' vizka tu - I see you now

The last of the three, ''fa'', refers to the future and means ''after''.

* mi vizka tu ''fa'' - I will see you

=== vi, va and vu ===

The little words ''vi'', ''va'' and ''vu'' indicate place and work like the words for time; they go anywhere in the sentence.

The little word ''vi'' means ''here'' or ''close to this place''

* mi viska tu ''vi'' - I see you here

* mi ''vi'' viska tu - I see you here

* ''vi'' mi viska tu - I see you here

The little word ''va'' means ''over there'' or ''nearby''.

* mi vizka tu ''va'' - I saw you nearby

The last little, ''vu'' word refers to a place far away; ''over there'' or ''yonder''.

* mi vizka tu ''vu'' - I saw you far away over there

=== zi, za, and zu ===

You can add more details to the time and space words using the ''zi'', ''za'', and ''zu'' little words. 

* zi - near or very short duration

* za - soon or a short duration

* zu - long time or long duration

so,

* fazi - very short time in the future

* vuzu - a very long distance away

* naza - in a little while

The context determines how long is long and how short is short. The existence of humans on Earth is a short time in geological ages but and hour might mean a long time to wait for a bus. 

=== Other Places and Other Times ===

The use of ''vi, va, vu'' and ''pa, na, fa'' defines time and place relative to the speaker. We can use the little word ''la'' to define a place or time relative to something else if we combine it with the place and time words.

* mi vizka tu ''lena'' kinkra - I saw you at the time of the convention

* mi ''lena kinkra'' gu vizka tu - I, at the time of the convention, saw you 

* mi vizka tu ''lefa'' kinkra - I will see you at the time of the convention

* mi vizka tu ''levi'' kinkra - I saw you at the place of the convention

* mi vizka tu ''leva'' kinkra - I saw you near the place of the convention

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EOS ==

The European Organisation for Sustainability (EOS) has a two part plan for an alternative socio-economic system; a people side and a technical side. The technical side manages all the technical aspects of society such as production, transportation, education and medical. The people side manages all non-technical aspects such as morality and culture aspects. For example, televisions has a both a technical and people side. On the technical side we have the design of cameras, recording equipment and broadcasting equipment. We also have technical standards to maintain and implement. However, what the system should broadcast, the actuarial television programme content, falls within the people side. From a technical point of view an engineer would need to do the same job regardless of programming but from a people point of view some programs might have a cultural acceptance but others might not. In the plan that EOS would propose each side would have a different form of management.

At the core of EOS's proposal lies the idea of sustainable. EOS aim for a socioeconomic system that offers a good standard of living for the longest time possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== People Side ===

Non-nation centric forms an important characteristic of the proposal that EOS presents. Instead of nations, EOS argues that culture and language form important attributes and thus proposes a system based on networks of communities of about 200 people in each. Each community would link up with a number of others to form an ''urbanate'' of about 10 000 people. An ''urbanate'' forms the proposed replacement for cities and forms a building block for the government of the people side. 

EOS recommends a direct democracy for administration of the people aspects of an urnbante. In such a system, the people would elect a governing body of representatives that would suggest laws. The people would then vote the laws in or out. If a sufficient group of people wish to change an established law then they can place that before the governing council. 

Direct democracy fors a suggestion. Urbanates could implement other forms of government for people aspects as they wish. However, each urbanate must maintain a set common ground; such as basic human rights and the right to move from urbanate to urbanate. In addition, no governing council could interfere with technical aspects of society. So, for example, a governing council could decide on what TV programs to show but not the design of the equipment. 

Urbanates with similar cultures or languages could join together if they so wished and form a confederacy. A confederacy would operate as if it were a single urbanate but each composing urbanate would have the right to leave as it wished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''
- Unobtrusive measures are ways of studying social behavior whithout affecting it in the process.  Unobtrusive research is simply the methods of studying social behaviorwithout affecting it.

- There are three types of unobtrusive research:
Content Analysis
Analysis of existing statistics
Comparative and historical analysis

'''Content Analysis'''
- With content analysis you focus on the details of recorded human communications.  For example you would analyze a painting a written document, photos, films, and things like face book.

- Appropriate topics include who says what, to whom, why, how, and with what effect.

  For example, if our unit of analysis is writers, then we can use units of observation like novels written by them, chapters and paragraphs of the novels, etc.

- Variable identification and measurement in content analysis depend on clarity of the unit of analysis.    

- Content Analysis involves coding which may attend to both manifest and latent content.  The determination of latent content requires judgements by the researcher. 

- Both quantitative and qualitative techniques are appropriate for interpreting content analysis data. 

- There are four characteristics that are usually coded in '''content analysis''':
1) '''Frequency''' - a count of the number of occurrences of a word, phrase, image, etc
2) '''Direction''' - the direction in meaning of the text content (e.g. positive vs negative or active vs passive)
3) '''Intensity''' - degree or strength of a text reference
4) '''Space''' - the size of the passage, image, or other content

- Strengths of content analysis:
-Research poses little to no harm on subjects
-Time efficient, cheap
-Allows researcher to correct mistakes
-Can look at processes occurring over time
-Good reliability

- Weaknesses of content analysis:
-Limited to what the researcher is able to record
-Validity can be limited

- In content analysis we could employ any conventional sampling technique like random, systematic, stratified, or clustered sampling.  When concerning sub-sampling, sampling needs not to end with our unit of analysis. For example, if our unit of analysis is writers, then we can use units of observation like novels written by them, chapters and paragraphs of the novels, etc.



'''Analyzing Existing Statistics'''
- With analysis of existing statistics, your focus would be mainly statistics of different studies without confusing this with secondary analysis which is just obtaining a copy of somebody's data and carrying out ones own analysis.

- When analyzing existing statistics, it may be the main source of data or a supplemental source of data. Most existing statistics come from governments and large intergovernmental organizations.  When describing the units of analysis, existing statistics describe groups.  You must be aware of the ecological fallacy.  This means making assumptions regarding individuals based on characteristics of entire population.

- Whenever we base research on an analysis of data that already exists we’re limited to what exists.  The existing data do not cover exactly what we are interested in, and our measurement may not be altogether valid representations of the variables and concepts we want to make conclusions about.  Two characteristics of science are used to handle the problem of validity in analysis of existing statistics: logical reasoning and replication.

- Problems of validity in the analysis of existing statistics can often be handled through logical reasoning and replication.

- Existing statistics often have problems of reliability, so they must be used with caution.


'''Comparative and Historical Research'''
- And lastly comparative and historical research which is the examination of societies (or other social units) over time and in comparison with one another. 

-  An example of comparative and historical research is the U.S. anthropologist, Lewis Morgan, who saw a progression in societies from &quot;savagery&quot; to &quot;barbarism&quot; to &quot;civilization.&quot;  Also Robert Redfield noticed the progression from &quot;folk society&quot; to &quot;urban society.&quot;  Pitirim Sorokin however respresnts a different form of this research.  He theorizes that societal trends follow a cycle pattern between two points of view.  One he called &quot;ideational&quot; and the other &quot;sensate.&quot;  Later he developed third point of view, which he called &quot;idealistic.&quot;


- Historical research and sociology often use the same tools and datasets as history, but they have different goals. 
'''historiography''' - methodology of doing historical research
The comparative historical method was the backbone of 19th century sociology. Sociologists such as Durkheim and Weber focused in on societies and studied and categorized them during different stages of development. In the mid-twentieth century, as the United States became the center of sociological research, the comparative historical method virtually disappeared.  It has been revived in the U.S. in the past 35 years by researchers inspired by the European sociological classics.

- There are two types of sources a researcher can use when conducting historical research.
1)'''primary sources''' - physical artifacts of human societies; (ex. documents, letters, official records, personal recollections)
2)'''secondary sources''' - books and papers published by governments and historians; (ex. statistical running records)  Examples of famous studies include Durkheim’s Study of Suicide and Kentor’Consequences of Globalization.  

- The unit of analysis of existing statistics describe groups.  Means you must be aware of the ecological fallacy which involves making assumptions regarding individuals based on characteristics of entire population.      


- Although often regarded as a qualitative method, comparative and historical research can make use of quantitative techniques.

- Archives are the most important type of comparative and historical reserach because they are well maintained by reliable organizations. However, they can by biased or partially incomplete.


'''Ethics and Unobtrusive Research'''
- While the use of unobtrusive research does avoid many ethical issues that are frequently present in other techniques of data collection and analysis, potential ethical risks still exist.  For example, the use of diaries or private communications in content analysis give rise to questions of confidentiality.

- Sometimes even unobtrusive measures can raise the possibility of violating subjects privacy.

- The general principles of honest observation, analysis, and reporting apply to all research techniques.

- - '''Traditional Approaches'''
- To conduct field research of the past, primarily using materials such as letters, diaries, documents, oral histories, etc. (often these are case studies and are not necessarily comparative)

- To study different societies, using the differences and similarities to highlight macro-social theories, primarily using history books and newspapers (the facts of history themselves). Often these are studies of current history and are not necessarily truly historical.

- The actual comparative study of societies and their development over long stretches of history using a variety of resources. This produces research that is both comparative and historical.

- Coding: Procedure of turning raw data into a standardized form that can be interpreted by a machine and processed/analyzed. E.g. A processed scantron for an exam.  Coding is the process whereby raw data are transformed into standardized form suitable for machine processing and analysis.  Content analysis is essentially a coding operation.  In content analysis, communications- oral, written, or other- are coded or classified according to some conceptual framework.  Coding in content analysis involves the logic of conceptualization and operation,  as in other research methods, you must refine your conceptual frameworks and develop specific methods for observing in relation to that framework.

- Latent Content: In connection with content analysis, the underlying means of communication. E.g. In a war movie, how effective the movie depicted actual combat via the flow of the movie scenes or the general reality of how well the war was captured on a subjective interpretation.  Latent content is as used in connection with content analysis, the underlying meaning of communications, as distinguished from their manifest content.

- Manifest Content: In connection with content analysis, the actual concrete terms within human communication. E.g. In a war movie, how many times &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;shoot&quot;, or &quot;bomb&quot; is said (concrete, objective terms).  Coding the manifest content, the visible surface content, of a communication is analogous to using a standardize questionnaire. Manifest coding is more reliable than latent coding, but is generally less valid


- Archives are the most important source for this type of research. They are maintained by governments, private foundations, and some corporations and families. They are repositories of documents, letters, photos, etc. Their primary purpose is preservation, not ease of access.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The formulation of his theorem seems a little odd to me.

;Theorem 1.9
A homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis. That is, if &lt;math&gt; \langle \vec{\beta}_1,\dots,\vec{\beta}_n \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a basis of a vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1,\dots,\vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt; are (perhaps not distinct) elements of a vector space &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; then there exists a homomorphism from &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt; \vec{\beta}_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1 &lt;/math&gt;, ..., and &lt;math&gt; \vec{\beta}_n &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt;, and that homomorphism is unique.

I'd formulate it as:

;Theorem 1.9
A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is determined by its action on a basis. That is, if &lt;math&gt; \langle \vec{\beta}_1,\dots,\vec{\beta}_n \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;  is a basis of a vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1,\dots,\vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt; are the images of the base, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_i= h(\vec{\beta}_i)&lt;/math&gt;, then the image of any &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; , with:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}= \sum_i \lambda_i \vec{\beta}_i&lt;/math&gt;

is uniqely determined by:

:&lt;math&gt;h(\vec{v})= h(\sum_i \lambda_i \vec{\beta}_i)=\sum_i \lambda_i h(\vec{\beta}_i)=\sum_i \lambda_i \vec{w}_i&lt;/math&gt;

This may be read as: ''the image of a certain linear combination of the vectors of a base, is the same combination of the images of these vectors.''

[[File:Drying shrimp paste.jpg|thumb|right|Shrimp paste being dried under the sun in Hong Kong]]

'''Shrimp paste''' is a common ingredient used in Southeast Asian and Southern Chinese cuisine. It is known as '''terasi''' (also spelled ''trassi'', ''terasie'') in Indonesian.

It is made from fermented ground shrimp, sun dried and then cut into fist-sized rectangular blocks. It is not designed, nor customarily used for immediate consumption and has to be fully cooked prior to consumption since it is raw. To many unfamiliar with this condiment, the strong smell can be considered unappetizing; however, it is an essential ingredient in many curries and sauces. It is often an ingredient in dipping sauce for fish or vegetables.

==Availability==
[[Image:Trassie oedang.jpg|thumb|Trassi udang, as bought in a Dutch supermarket]]
Shrimp paste can be found in nations outside Southeast Asia in markets catering to Asian customers.  In The Netherlands, Indonesian type of shrimp paste can be found in supermarket selling Asian foodstuff such as Trassie Oedang brand. In the United States brands of Thai shrimp paste such as Pantainorasingh and Tra Chang can be found.  Shrimp pastes from other countries are also available in Asian supermarkets and through mail order. In Australia shrimp paste can be found in suburbs where most South East Asian people resides. In Europe it can be bought in the supermarket.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Being clear about why you have established the business will enable you to keep perspective as the business grows and develops and you are faced with the challenges of a growing business.


Every day in the business, there will be decisions to make about how to do business. It will be helpful to have clarity over what is most important to you about how you run your business and what your bottom lines are to ensure you continuously make decisions in line with what is important to you.

Rank the following values from 1 to 9 with 1 being the most important value to you: 

Making a living for myself and/or my family

Being the best and most well known at my business

Contributing toward a healthy, sustainable planet for future generations to inherit

Being a contribution to other people – both in my local community and elsewhere

Being a good employer – being committed to employees satisfaction, development and wellbeing and treating everyone fairly

Encouraging others to treat the environment and people with respect

Having a good balance between how much time I spend working vs other things that are important to me (family, hobbies etc)

Treating everyone I interact with fairly

All my decisions are honest and ethical

And to support me in operating this way, how do I ensure that those I work with know what is important to me and are able to integrate it into the way they do business?

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may have to work with your eXist system administrator to first enable the XSL-FO XQuery module in order for these examples to run.  This can be done by using the following steps.

== Step 1: Enable the XSLFO XQuery Module ==
Edit the conf.xml file in the $EXIST_HOME directory.  You must un-comment the xslfo module.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;module class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.xslfo.XSLFOModule&quot; uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xslfo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Step 2: Edit the extensions build.properties file == 

If your eXist was not built from source the fo module and supporting fop.jar file must also be included in your exist-modules.jar file in all production systems.  This can be done by downloading the eXist source and changing the build.properties file setting to be true.  For details please see the [http://exist.sourceforge.net/building.html eXist build instructions]

$EXIST_HOME lib/extensions/build.properties
or
$EXIST_HOME extensions/build.properties
&lt;pre&gt;
# XSL FO transformations (Uses Apache FOP)
include.module.xslfo = true
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are running release 1.4 of eXist, the Apache FOP version referenced might no longer be available. If you have a line like the following in your build-properties like this:

== Step 3: Update the path to the new XSL-FO zip file in the configuration file ==

&lt;pre&gt;
include.module.xslfo.url = http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-0.95-bin.zip
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will find that the Apache project removed the old binaries (not always best practice).

This is the new line this should be replaced with.

&lt;pre&gt;
include.module.xslfo.url = http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-1.0-bin.zip
&lt;/pre&gt;

And additionally change references to the deprecated version in $EXIST_HOME extensions/modules/build.xml to point to the newer version. E.g:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!-- Apache FOP --&gt;
		&lt;get src=&quot;${include.module.xslfo.url}&quot; dest=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot; verbose=&quot;true&quot; usetimestamp=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;unzip src=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot; dest=&quot;${top.dir}/${lib.user}&quot;&gt;
			&lt;patternset&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/build/fop.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/batik-all-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/xmlgraphics-commons-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/avalon-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;/patternset&gt;
			&lt;mapper type=&quot;flatten&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/unzip&gt;
		&lt;delete file=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Step 4 Download the new XSLFO Zip file ==

When you run a build the next time this will download the Apache FOP jar file from the Apache web site.

   cd $EXIST_HOME/extensions/modules
   ant -version
   ant prepare-libs-xslfo

Sample from build log:
&lt;pre&gt;
prepare-libs-xslfo:
     [echo] Load: true
     [echo] ------------------------------------------------------
     [echo] Downloading libraries required by the xsl-fo module
     [echo] ------------------------------------------------------
      [get] Getting: http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-1.0-bin.zip
      [get] To: C:\ws\eXist-1.4dev\extensions\modules\fop-1.0-bin.zip
      [get] ....................................................

      [get] last modified = Thu Jul 31 09:47:44 CDT 2008
    [unzip] Expanding: C:\workspace\exist\extensions\modules\fop-1.0-bin.zip in to C:\workspace\exist\lib\user
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Step 5 Verify that the new XSLFO Library is available ==
Note that in addition to the fop binary the following jar file is required by the FOP processor.

   $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/xmlgraphics-commons-1.3.1.jar

On UNIX:
  $ sudo cp -v xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar $EXIST_HOME/lib/user
  `xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar' -&gt; `/usr/local/exist/lib/user/xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar'

This can be downloaded from [http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/commons the Apache XML Graphics Commons Distribution Mirror]

== Step 6 Copy the Java files ==
Copy the jar files from $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/fop.jar and the new $EXIST-HOME/lib/extensions/exist-modules.jar on to your production systems.  Note you should make sure the source and destination systems are the same version.

If you want to have fop hyphenate your text, put the fop-hyphen.jar into $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/ and restart eXist. fo:blocks with the attribute ''hyphenate'' set to ''true'' in you fo or xsl file will be hyphenated then if you add a ''language'' attribute to the fo:page-sequence. The patterns for many languages are available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/offo/

Note that your exist-modules.jar file can then be placed on the systems that do not have the source code.  There is currently no method to use FOP without downloading the source.  Also note that you can verify that your exist-modules.jar file contains the XSLFO classes by running:

You can now check that the jar files are correctly installed in the user libraries directory:

  $ ls -l $EXIST_HOME/lib/user/*.jar
Which returns

== Build The Extensions ==

Type the following into the shell:
   $ ./build.{sh|bat} extension-modules

If the build fails with
  &quot;$EXIST_HOME/build/classes&quot; does not exist or is not a directory
, it helps to create the classes folder, afterwards build is successful:
  mkdir $EXIST_HOME/build/classes

== Verify that the jar files are in the right position ==
   $ jar tf exist-extensions.jar

Or on a windows system you can change the jar file file name to end with .zip, uncompress and check that the xslfo classes are in the exist-modules file.

Let &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; be a function on &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. The '''Laplace transform''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the integral

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The domain of &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; is all values of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that the integral exists.

== Existence ==


== Properties ==
=== Linearity ===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be functions whose Laplace transforms exist for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be constants. Then, for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{af + bg\} = a \mathcal{L}\{f\} + b \mathcal{L}\{g\}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be proved using the properties of improper integrals.

=== Shifting in ''s'' ===
If the Laplace transform &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = F(s)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{e^{at} f(t)\}(s) = F(s - a)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha + a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof.'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}\{e^{at} f(t)\}(s) &amp;{} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} f(t) dt \\
&amp;{} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt \\
&amp;{} = F(s - a)\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The technical side manages all technical aspects of a society. Groups of technical experts mange areas which they have the technical expertise to manage. Management revolves around projects composed of multi-discipline teams working locally as possible. The terms ''technate'' then refers to the overall geographical area where the managers operate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Holons and a Holonic Society ===

==== Holons ====

The concept of a holon forms one of the central ideas proposed for forming a technate/proto-technate. The word &quot;holon’’ comes from the Greek &quot;holos,'' meaning 'whole', and &quot;-on,'' meaning 'part'.  The word aptly captures the duality of entities which we can view as a single, distinct en­tities, and at the same time parts of a more comprehensive whole.   For exam­ple, a cell in your body falls under the holon category. Cell exists as a distinct, living entity; it has inputs, out­puts, and a distinct cell wall defining its interface with the rest of the world. A cell, however, consists of smaller and more fundamental parts, such as RNA, DNA, mitochondria etc. Each component can be studied as a separate entity; however, each component can be broken down further - into molecules, atoms, and ultimately to quarks. This decomposition of cells is characteristic for a holonic organisation.

We can also go the other way, and see that cells group togeth­er with other cells to become organs.  Organs, in turn, form parts of the human body.  Here, we see that holonic organisation also supports composition as well.

In addition to the part-whole characteristic, holons have a number of other characteristics:

* Each holon functions autonomously. It means that each holon carries out its own activities without the direction of oth­er holons; yet, it still forms a part of, and contributes to, the overall functioning of a larger system.

* Holons naturally form distributed systems. This comes on from the autonomous attribute.

* Each holon has a simple, singular task to perform and con­centrates exclusively on that task.  The system accomplishes larger  scale  tasks  through  the  combination of a number of holons, either through combining them together to form a large­er  holon,  or  through  cooperation  or  competition  between holons.

* Although holons function autonomously, their interaction with other holons may yield complex flows of information in order to achieve each interacting holon’s goals. Therefore, a holon must process and respond to in-bound data from exter­nal sources, as well as provide other holons with requested information.

* As holons interact, the sum of their actions could become greater than the action of the individual holon.  Some exam­ples could include ant hills, where a number of ants cooperate to construct a mound, yet no single ant would have the capa­bility to achieve the construction individually.  The construction of cities forms another example. The shapes of many of the world's cities were not the result of centralised plan­ning.  Nonetheless, the organisation and interaction of a num­ber of people and organisations has resulted in some of the most spectacular cities on Earth, such as San  Francisco,  New York, Rome, and others.

==== The Advantages of Holonic Systems ====

Holons are particularly well suited for complex and/or dis­tributed systems. Some reasons follow:

* Scalability  As each holon has the property of being au­tonomous, it can function with little or no knowledge of other holons.  Thus, we can add additional holons to the system, de­pending on the system in question, without affecting the oper­ation of the previously existing holons.  As additional holons are contributed to the system, a coherent organisation will tend to form naturally, such as a hierarchy where higher-lev­el, more abstract holons manage lower-level, more detail-ori­ented holons.  Consider, as another example, any plant or ani­mal, which starts as one cell, but which divides and grows to many cells, forming organs along the way.

* Robustness  Robustness also results from the autonomous na­ture of a holon.  Just as we can add holons, we can also re­move them without, in general, affecting the functioning of other holons or the system as a whole. For example: human body can lose many cells without even noticing it. It can even survive the loss of a substantial por­tion of the body, such as a limb.

* Simplicity of control As each holon has a simple, usually singular, task to accomplish, it only needs a simple control mechanism, which can be understood more easily when compared to a centralised control system.

==== Disadvantages of Holonic System ====

Distributed and autonomous holons, for all their advantages, also have some disadvantages compared to centralised mechanisms.

* Tragedy of the commons  The autonomous attribute can lead holons to consume shared resources without consideration for others, and end up taking more than their fair share.  This could limit the ability of other holons to work, and may even bring an end to the common resources. Example: a farmer allowing his cow to eat all the common grass, preventing other farmers from grazing their cattle.

* Losing their way  We can see another problem with the autonomous attribute. Autonomous holons could conduct activi­ties that do not contribute to the overall goal of the system. They could even conduct activities that are contrary to the overall goal.  Cancer cells would form an example of holons that have gone out of control and became a danger to the sys­tem as a whole.

The root cause of the first deficiency we can usually at­tribute to a lack of negative feedback in the holon’s opera­tion.   For example, if the farmer knew a priori of the impact the cow would have on the field, and therefore other farmers, he would take steps to alleviate the problem before it got out of hand. The farmer would need a bigger picture to achieve this in­sight. However, this leads to one possible solution, where a higher-level holon could administer lower-level holons. Not an ideal situation. It is pre­ferred that the other farmers communicate with the offending farmer, so that issues are resolved locally and quickly.

We may, however, have difficulty understanding the cause for the latter deficiency, since there is a number of issues to consider. For in­stance, simple miscommunication or misunderstanding may result in an erroneous interpretation of the holon's goal. Indeed, scientists have traced most causes of genetic defects that, in a sense, we can consider as miscommunication in genetic programming of the cell.  We could see another cause as the autonomous nature of the holon, which could deliberately decide to change its own goals.  The &quot;bait-and-switch’’ manoeuvre that con-artists and other petty criminals use exemplify this.

==== A Holonic Structure for a Future Society ====

A holonic structure represents a potentially vi­able form for future society.

As a means of allowing this organisation, EOS propose the fol­lowing holoarchy:

* 1. Individuals
* 2. Groups
* 3. Zones
* 4. Areas
* 5. Sectors
* 6. Technate

Individuals form the basic building blocks of societies, and each individual has goals and objectives as well as skills and interests.  Any social structure should take this into account. The author hopes that the holonic structure would allow people to utilise their interests and skills to achieve their own desires in such a way as to con­tribute to the whole structure.

To achieve this, individuals form interest groups, such as research, medical, and food production. Individuals who have skills and interests in common with a specific group could choose to join that group. However, not all groups would have specialised interests; some groups would have a more mixed membership.  This would depend on the size of the group and the number of members (e.g., in the case of members of NET residing in a single town).

Groups maintain goals and monitor projects. The goals of any group should be compatible with the overall goals of the technocracy. Likewise, the projects within the group should contribute, in some way, to the group and thus to the imple­mentation of technocracy.

Some projects, of course, may turn out to be too large for a single group to undertake (e.g., repairing the Golden Gate bridge or the construction of an airplane).  To deal with this, groups can form areas, where areas act in sim­ilar ways to groups.  Instead of being composed of individu­als, however, areas are comprised of groups (think of a consortium or standards organisation, like OSI, OMG, and ANSI). Areas cooperate with each other to fulfil the goals defined for each area. Those goals, like the goals of groups, are compatibile with the goals of technocracy.  And, of course, the projects run within areas will have similarity to the projects of groups in that they would also contribute to the goals of technocracy but on a larger scale.

Again, like areas, sectors form the next level up in the holoarchy and run larger projects. Areas compose sectors.

The technate forms the final layer of the holoarchy.  This layer runs large scale projects over the whole operational area of the technate and has goals in accordance with technocracy's goals.

Thus, the whole system becomes a gestalt - one composed of individual, goal orientated parts that use projects to achieve their goals.  As each part lines up with other parts in the holoarchy, through cooperation, the system achieves the over­all goals of the technate.


==== Control and Direction in the Holoarchy ====

As each group, area, or sector can act autonomously, the sys­tem has the potential to develop some problems, as noted above.  Some of the holons could end up repeating work that other holons have conducted and other holons could conduct work that does not contribute to the whole.

To prevent such problems, we propose a hierarchical structure that lays on top of the holoarchy. This overlapping structure would have the following goals:

* 1. Maintain direction of the system

* 2. Act as a communications channel to facilitate cooperation between holons

* 3. Ensure efficient utilisation of resources, thus preventing unnecessary repetition of work

The proposed structure EOS refers to as a sequence structure with a board at the top which acts to direct the whole system.  A number of functional sequences would then form under the board, with the director of each se­quence being represented on the board. For example, the structure could have functional sequences for health, research, manufacturing, mining, recycling, energy, transporta­tion and space.

Each sequence would have a sub-sequence for each sector.  So, for example, the Sequence of Research would have a number of Sector Sequences of Research below it.  Each sector sequence would then have area sub-sequences below it, and the area se­quences would have group sub-sequences below it.   Each sequence at each level would have a director.  For example, the Sequences of Research would have a Director of the Sequence of Research and the various sector research sequences would have various Directors of Sector Sequences of Research and so on for areas and groups.  We can see this as being analogous to a commercial company in present-day economic systems, where you have a Chief Technology Officer, Director of Research, with indi­vidual project directors below them.

This means that an individual would have membership both in a group and a sequence and, hopefully, will actively participate in a project.
Roles of Directors

Directors of each sequence have overall responsibility of ensuring that each holon contributes to the overall goal of technocracy.  Thus, the directors at each level have to approve each project, and can cancel a project if that project has wandered away from the goals of technocracy.  The director can also cancel a project if it is in conflict with another project; for example, if two holons attempted to do the same pro­ject.  However, once a project has started, and so long as it remains compatible with the goals of technocracy, the director has no control over the project in keeping with the autonomous nature of the holon.

Each project would have a project manager. The project manager has the administrative responsibility of running the project, including the allocation of resources, time schedule, etc. The manager runs the project without any inter­ference of the directors as long as the project remains within the goals.

For projects that involve cooperation or coordination between a number of holons, the holon director has the responsibility of ensuring communication with other holons. For example, within an area the Area Director must ensure that all holons have adequate communications in order to allow them to conduct their projects.  Thus, the sequences act as a communications channel for each holon.

==== Goals ====

Goals become the most import attribute of the above structure. Goals give direction and purpose to the system as a whole.

Technocrats have the following top level goal:

''The highest standard of living for the longest time possi­ble.''

To achieve this goal, sequences and holons may have other goals, but those other goals must contribute to the overall goal.  For example, the Sequence of Research could have the goal of conducting an energy survey and may run one or more project to achieve that goal.  However, the goal of the energy survey also contributes to the overall goal of technocracy in that it determines the kind and quantity of resources available and the energy re­quired to build a sustainable society that has a high standard of living.

Optical telescopes increase the apparent brightness and magnification of an object. Infrared telescopes look for heat signatures. There are also huge radio telescope dishes, as well as ultraviolet and x-ray telescopes that have been launched into orbit.

There are two main types of optical telescope - reflectors and refractors. Reflectors use a mirror to collect the light, whilst refractors use a lens. Generally, reflectors are better for deep sky objects whilst refractors are useful for planetary observations. Some telescopes use a combination of lenses and mirrors to use best the advantages of each.

Refractor telescopes require a large lens at the front to direct the incoming light to the lens. This lens can be made of more than one piece, and the differing refractive properties of the components serve to reduce aberration at the edge of the image. The lenses can also be coated to reduce internal reflections.

'''Catadioptrics''' are short, wide telescopes that use both mirrors and lenses. The price range is between reflectors and refractors.

Large lenses suffer from the disadvantage of sagging under their own weight. This causes the shape to become distorted and so the image will be irregular. For this reason the largest refracting telescope ever built only has a diameter of 41&quot;. All larger telescopes instead use a mirror are the primary collecting surface.

In the optical spectrum, great precision is required in crafting the lenses and mirrors used in a telescope. The standard of precision for a telescope mirror is accuracy to 1/4 the wavelength of light, an exceedingly small quantity. But even greater accuracy is generally preferred, especially for space-based telescopes. Special tools have been developed for measuring the accuracy of a telescope mirror and lens, and the procedure for finishing the surface is very exacting.

The first &quot;radio astronomer&quot; was Karl Jansky, who studied mysterious radio interference he picked up with his antenna. The signal repeated every 23 hours and 56 minutes. He finally determined that it was caused by our Milky Way Galaxy. The signal is strongest at the center of the galaxy, in the constellation Sagittarius.{{ref|jansky}}

The Very Large Array (VLA) is a radio telescope system in New Mexico.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, infrared-optimized space telescope, scheduled for launch in 2013. JWST will find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. JWST will peer through dusty clouds to see stars forming planetary systems, connecting the Milky Way to our own Solar System. JWST's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range.

JWST will have a large mirror, 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and a sunshield the size of a tennis court. Both the mirror and sunshade won't fit onto the rocket fully open, so both will fold up and open only once JWST is in outer space. JWST will reside in an orbit about 1.5 million km (1 million miles) from the Earth.

Other telescopes are capable of &quot;seeing&quot; in the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the abilities of our eyes and transforming those images to those we can use.

== Infrared Telescopes ==
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, space telescope optimized for viewing in the infrared part of the spectrum, scheduled for launch in 2018. From the NASA website: &quot;JWST will find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. JWST will peer through dusty clouds to see stars forming planetary systems, connecting the Milky Way to our own Solar System. JWST's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range.
 
JWST will have a large mirror, 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and a sunshield the size of a tennis court. Both the mirror and sunshade won't fit onto the rocket fully open, so both will fold up and open only once JWST is in outer space. JWST will reside in an orbit about 1.5 million km (1 million miles) from the Earth.&quot; http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/

== Ultraviolet Telescopes ==
Ultraviolet astronomy studies light with wavelengths just shorter than visible light.  This wavelength region turns out to be particularly useful for studying atomic emissions from hydrogen and helium, the two most common gases in space (and in the Sun, and stars, and gas giant planets).  
Ultraviolet light does not reach the Earth's surface, so ultraviolet astronomy is done from satellites in space.   Ultraviolet detectors function well on telescopes with conventional optics such as Hubble Space Telescope.   Ultraviolet images from Hubble have dramatically revealed planetary auroras on Jupiter and Saturn from magnetospheric electrons striking atomic and molecular hydrogen in auroral zones at high latitudes on the planets.
