==Introduction==
Hiragana consists of a basic set of characters: five singular vowels, 39 distinct consonant-vowel unions and one singular consonant. Additionally, を wo is included (although pronounced the same as vowel お).

These basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a dakuten marker ( ゛), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant. Hiragana beginning with an h can also add a handakuten marker ( ゜) changing the h to a p.

==Usage==
Hiragana are used to write the following:

* okurigana— inflectional endings for adjectives and verbs—such as る in 見る (miru, &quot;see&quot;) and い in 白い (shiroi, &quot;white&quot;).
* joshi —grammatical particles
* words that lack a kanji, where the kanji is obscure, difficult to typeset, or is considered too difficult to understand (as in children's books).
* furigana —phonetic renderings of kanji placed above or beside the kanji character. Furigana may aid children or nonnative speakers or clarify nonstandard, rare, or ambiguous readings.

Some lexical items that are normally written using kanji have become grammaticalized in certain contexts, where they are instead written in hiragana. For example, the root of the verb 見る (miru, &quot;see&quot;) is normally written with the kanji 見. However, when used as a suffix meaning &quot;try out&quot;, the whole verb is written in hiragana as みる, as in 食べてみる (tabetemiru, &quot;try eating [it] and see&quot;).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''P90X Workout Routines and Supplements'''



The p90x workout, which was released in 2004, has been a very successful workout plan for as many as 2 million people, who have greatly benefited from this exercise program. There are a lot of speculations and theories about how it all began, but the bottom line is that the p90x has certainly proved beneficial for millions with its new techniques and great results. Apart from the p90x toolkit, there are a lot of p90x supplements that can be used to gain added features that would definitely boost the way you look.

The program was designed as the power 90, which continuously remains to be one of the most popular modern day exercise schedules. Initially, this program was designed for those who had a certain level of fitness and wanted to take their bodies and fitness capabilities to a whole new level. This is how p90x or the power 90 extreme has evolved over the past few years.

Tony Horton, the world renowned fitness expert is the man behind the p90x. The research and development of this program is supposed to have taken a time of almost two years. According to Horton, the program which began as an experiment towards testing of the concept of 'muscle confusion' has evolved into a whole home-based workout schedule over the period of two years of its development. Muscle confusion is a science in itself. The base theory behind the concept of muscle confusing aims at shifting the exercises being performed by you at short intervals of time. By doing this, experts claim that your body doesn't get adapted to a particular workout routine and you get the maximum results every time you work on a particular muscle. This is equivalent to saying that your body doesn't adapt to a particular form of exercise, and when you repeat the excercies again, you get similar results.

Another reason why the p90x is one of the most powerful and popular home-base workout plans is that when the program was being developed, it was tested and retested under varying conditions and on various people, before a generic exercise plan was out in the form of the p90x that we know today. While experts were researching laboriously on designing the [http://www.x-fat.com P90X Nutrition Plan] exercise routines, there was another set of experts who were busy designing various p90x supplements and gears. The p90x chin-up bar is one of the most productive and practical pieces of exercise equipments, which has been an offspring of the p90x program. The pull-up bar convolved with the tremendously simple, yet powerful diet plan is the best mix you can get in the market in order to receive the results that you have always deserved.

After the initial plan was complete, it was given to a set of &quot;test cases&quot;, who were basically some people on whom the plan was going to be tested. This elite group of fitness freaks has since come to be known as 'Xplorers'. Four years after its launch, the product is still making waves in the fitness world, and hopefully, will continue to do so.</text>

      <comment>/* The Spring engine */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an engine==
Engine simply put is the core of a game. Usually game development teams make an engine which handles most of the heavy duty work like physics and 3D rendering. Physics and 3D rendering are the parts of a game that are the most CPU/GPU consuming and they are the parts that usually have the most code of the whole game. The 3D models, textures, etc are held outside of the engine.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason for this is so tweaking the game doesn't need to make huge changes in the code of the whole game. In the old times(before engines were used) there used to be big files that kept all the game content so if someone wanted to change something in the game it was a big hassle. The person had to dig inside every little line of code of the game and double-check that nothing is broken after the change. Separating models, textures and other game elements makes it much easier to maintain a game and easier for future tweaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Quake example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have probably heard of the Quake engine that was given to the public. With an engine in hands, someone is capable of changing many things(modifying) or even make a new game. From the Quake engine for example an open source game derived called Warsow(among others). What the developers of Warsow did was taking the engine and using their own models, textures and other files. They probably changed a bit the engine as well to fit in their needs. The thing is that you could yourself take the Quake engine and use your own models with it and modify it if wished. That way just by modifying a little piece of a game you make it appear as a new game.&lt;br /&gt;
That methology of &quot;game modifications&quot; is even used in the broad market. It is very often that a team develops an engine and uses the same engine for a series of different games. That way there is limited coding needed in the future games.&lt;br /&gt;

==The Spring engine==
Spring engine was built with the old game Total Annihilation in mind. That's the reason why so many different games(mods) share the same characteristics like the metal and energy resource system.

When making a game for Spring what you really are making is a modification(mod). The engine is left intact and the only thing being changed are the external parts like the map, the unit models, unit behaviours, textures, soundtracks, AI behaviour etc. The core of the game is still inside the engine so your freedom is somewhat limited.

Even with that limitation you can still change the look of a game in many ways. You could change even the metal/energy system but that would take a lot of Lua coding and thus making the game in the end a bit slower. Keep in mind that Lua is 3 times slower than C++ which is the language that Spring engine is coded in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Callouts==
Spring resources are the ones that are going to provide communication between your Lua code and the Spring engine.

The engine provides a plethora of built-in functions that you can call. These functions are called '''callouts'''.

==Callins==
Event handlers are also provided and are called '''callins'''. Callins are just functions inside your Lua code that get invoked from the engine when certain events take place. For example if a unit get's created or destroyed.

==Variables==
Variables are containers that keep values inside them. As their name suggest, their value is variable. Practically that means that you are freely to change the value of a variable in opposition to constants.

==Constants==
Constants are containers as well with only difference that their value NEVER changes. Constants are used for things that never change. Practically a constant will be used to keep the number Pi from math, the name of a player etc.

==Introduction==

sources in rom/hidds/hidd.pci

pci.hidd IS initialized as part of bootstrap of resident modules. When the pci.hidd inits, it probes the PCI bus for devices. pci.hidd is not a device driver maintainer. It maintains PCI bus only. Besides, pci.hidd is started with very high priority and thus it would be able to initialize only this drivers which has higher priority then this hidd itself. 

The pci.hidd is a collection of classes used to maintain all PCI devices available in the system. All device properties are available through appropriate OOP_Object properties and should not be changed per hand (although it is still available through six public methods of pcidriver class).



How to ask for a PCI device?

In order to query for specified PCI device, the moHidd_PCI_EnumDevices method of the main PCI class (IID_Hidd_PCI) is to be used. It takes two parameters. The first one is the pointer to struct Hook, defining the call-back function called for every PCI device that match given requirements. Second parameter (may be NULL) is pointer to struct TagItem[] defining the requirements that has to be met. Any combination of VendorID, ProductID, RevisionID, Interface, Class, Subclass, SubsystemVendorID, SubsystemID may be used (see the include/hidd/pci.h for details). If NULL is given, the call-back function will be called for every single PCI device seen by the pci class. The following code may be used to find the PCI device:

&lt;pre&gt;
/* This hook will be called for every PCI device that matches the given requirements */
AROS_UFH3(void, Callback,
    AROS_UFHA(struct Hook *,    hook,   A0),
    AROS_UFHA(OOP_Object *,     obj,    A2),
    AROS_UFHA(APTR,             msg,    A1))
{
    AROS_USERFUNC_INIT

    /* Do whatever here with the PCIDevice object stored in obj pointer */

    AROS_USERFUNC_EXIT
}

/* Hook defining our callback */
static const struct Hook PCIHook = {
    h_Entry : (APTR)Callback
};

void Query()
{
    OOP_Object *o;  /* Keep PCI class object */

    /* Get only VGA compatible video cards */
    struct TagItem tags[] = {
        { tHidd_PCI_Class,      3 },
        { tHidd_PCI_SubClass,   0 },
        { tHidd_PCI_Interface,  0 },
        { TAG_DONE, 0UL }
    };

    /* Create instance of pci class */
    o = OOP_NewObject(NULL, CLID_Hidd_PCI, NULL);
    if (o)
    {
        /* Enumerate through all PCI devices */
        HIDD_PCI_EnumDevices(o, &amp;PCIHook, NULL);
        /* Enumerate through devices that met requirements only */
        HIDD_PCI_EnumDevices(o, &amp;PCIHook, &amp;tags);

        [do whatever you want with PCI devices]

        /* Don't need PCI object anymore */
        OOP_DisposeObject(o);
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Simple, efficient, nice :)

What to do with PCI device object?

Once the pointer to pci device object is known, the PCI device may be asked for its properties, as well as some of the device properties may be changed. The Bus, Dev and Sub properties define the physical address of PCI device, as seen by the bus driver handling this device (available as Driver property). In case of PCI-to-PCI bridges (see isBridge property) , there are some additional properties available (some others, like base addresses 2 to 5 are unavailable on the other hand). Most commonly used were probably:

 aHidd_PCIDevice_Base[0..5] - PCI base addresses of given device aHidd_PCIDevice_Size[0..5] - sizes of PCI memory/IO areas aHidd_PCIDevice_Type[0..5] - type of given area.

If bit ADDRB_IO in Type property is set, the region is an IO region. Otherwise it is a memory region, which may be of prefetchable memory (bit ADDRB_PREFETCH set).

Additionally, the driver may check, whether I/O or MEM is decoded by given PCI device at all (isIO, isMEM properties), whether BusMaster has been enabled (isMaster property), whether the device does snoop PCI bus for VGA palette changes (paletteSnoop property). Finally, it is possible to check whether the device does support 66MHz PCI bus (is66MHz property).

Note, that depending on driver requirements, isIO, isMEM, isMaster and paletteSnoop properties may be also set.

All properties are obtainable through OOP_GetAttr call (sigh, we are really missing the OOP_GetAttrs(obj, struct TagItem **attributes_to_get_with_one_call)!!!) and some of them are setable through OOP_SetAttrs call (see hidd/pci.h include for details). Please also remember, that before work with attributes is done, the IID_Hidd_PCIDevice AttrBase has to be obtained (please don't forget to release it when it's not needed anymore).


PCIDriver class (user side)

One of the read-only attributes of PCIDevice class, is the PCIDriver class pointer. It points to the hardware driver which handles given PCI device object. As it will be seen later, there may be more then one driver working at the same time in the system.

The driver class has one important attribute - aHidd_PCIDriver_DirectBus. It is read-only and if it is set to TRUE, the driver handles PCI bus which is directly mapped within the CPU space. DirectBus device may be for example typical PCI bus in PC handled by native AROS. Typical indirect PCI bus will be then PCI bus handled under Linux (there is no physical direct access to the PCI devices on hosted AROS on Linux). Depending on the DirectBus property, some methods may or should be used.

While working with not DirectBus PCI driver, the HIDD_PCIDriver_MapPCI and HIDD_PCIDriver_UnmapPCI methods may be used to access memory ranges of PCI device. The first method tries to map PCI memory space to CPU memory space (using for example mmap on /dev/mem in case of Linux) so that the given PCI memory range may be accessed. UnmapPCI method frees mapping created previously with this method.

Additionally, in case of not DirectBus PCI driver, AllocPCIMem and FreePCIMem can be used in order to reserve/free memory accessible by PCI devices and aligned to the page boundary. If these methods are not implemented or there is no memory available for PCI devices, AllocPCIMem will return (APTR)-1.

In case of DirectBus devices, the above called methods are still usable. The MapPCI is then equivalent to HIDD_PCIDriver_PCItoCPU call and simply translates the address seen by PCI device to address seen by CPU. The CPUtoPCI works in other direction.



Driver creation

In order to write PCI hardware driver, one has to create class deriving from the CLID_Hidd_PCIDriver class. That simplifies the work on driver, as only few methods have to be implemented:
PCIDriver::New()

This method should add some attributes to the msg-&gt;attrList and pass the ::New message to the superclass. The aHidd_Name and aHidd_HardwareName are welcomed here. Additionally, if driver doesn't work on direct access bus, it should reset the aHidd_PCIDriver_DirectBus to FALSE (otherwise it is set to TRUE by the superclass).

Please note that in worst case (author don't want to provide aHidd_Name and aHidd_HardwareName), the implementation of ::New may be skipped.
PCIDriver::ReadConfigLong() and PCIDriver::WriteConfigLong()

These two methods HAVE TO be defined in driver class. Otherwise superclass will complain with error messages. All other methods used to access the PCI config space (Read/Write of Word/Byte) may be implemented by driver class but doesn't have to. As all methods are virtual, superclass will do the magic (it will use ReadConfigLong and WriteConfigLong methods to access words and bytes in both read and write mode).

Additionally , the MapPCI/UnmapPCI and CPUtoPCI/PCItoCPU may require rewriting (default is that in case of indirect bus they return 0xffffffff always and in case of direct bus they return the same address as given).
Adding driver class to the system

When the driver class is successfully created, it's pointer may be passed to the main pci class. It may be done in following way (assume, that cl is the pointer to freshly created driver class):

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
    struct pHidd_PCI_AddHardwareDriver msg;
    OOP_Object *pci;

    msg.driverClass = cl;
    msg.mID = OOP_GetMethodID(IID_Hidd_PCI, moHidd_PCI_AddHardwareDriver);

    pci = OOP_NewObject(NULL, CLID_Hidd_PCI, NULL);
    if (pci)
    {
        OOP_DoMethod(pci, (OOP_Msg)&amp;msg);
        OOP_DisposeObject(pci);
    }
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Done. The pci subsystem will then use the passed class pointer (note: thanks to passing class pointer directly, driver classes do not have to be public) to scan PCI bus handled with this hardware driver. From this point, PCI devices handled with newly added driver are available for any use.
Removing driver class from the system

The driver may ask PCI subsystem to be removed, using the RemHardwareDriver call. It's query may be, but doesn't have to be fulfilled. The driver will not be removed if there are any other users of PCI subsystem expect the driver wishing to be removed itself. When the RemHardwareDriver call success, the driver class may be deleted.



Why do I need this pluggable driver?

Imagine a PCI device (of any kind) which has it's own PCI bus. The device driver does know about this bus and wants to share this with other drivers (system user). Unfortunately only this specific device driver knows how to handle this additional PCI bus. When it creates a driver class which know how to talk to it and adds this driver class to pci subsystem, this PCI bus becomes part of whole system and from now on it is accessible for anyone.

First of all it uses 64bit BAR addresses and those aren't supported in PCI.hidd(or am i wrong?), if i got it right reading those PCI specs a 64bit BAR takes the next BAR's space and uses it as upper bits in 64bit address, but Aros isn't aware of that and treats the next BAR as a new BAR.

Secondly in PCI.hidd BAR size(32bit or 64bit) is checked AFTER the BAR-address is taken, so in a sense it is done backwards... as the size(32bit or 64bit) could only be checked in sizePCIBaseReg function, which should be broken up to detect the size(32bit or 64bit) and if it's IO or MEM and the used IO/MEM size.

AFAIK Amiga PCI hardware is single big (256M+ memory space used for PCI) io autoconfig device from Amiga software point of view. Zorro boards can only use interrupt levels 2 or 6 so I assume all PCI interrupts are always routed to same physical 680x0 interrupt. netbsd amiga pci driver seems to explain most of this stuff (src/sys/arch/amiga/pci)</text>

      <comment>/* Various dialects */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Brahmin Tamil''' or '''Braahmik''' is the name for a number of closely related Tamil dialects used by the Tamil Brahmin communities ('''Iyers''' and '''Iyengars''') of Tamil Nadu and in the neighbouring states.

==Various dialects==
'''Braahmik''' is the proposed name  for these dialects {{fact}}. 

The 2 dialects are :

* The Thanju style, spoken in Tamil Nadu, mainly represented by Tanjore or Thanjavur and

* The Paalu style spoken in Kerala mainly represented by Palghat or Palakkad.

There are two main differences between these two styles :

# In the words ending in ''m'' and ''n'' preceded by a vowel, the vowel is nasalised but the nasal consonants themselves are not pronounced except when followed by a word beginning with a vowel in the Thanju style. In the Paalu style the nasal consonants in these cases are always pronounced.

# There is also often a difference in the vocabulary of the two styles. To give only one example, the word for 'news' is ''samaachaaram'' in Thanju, but ''varthamaanam'' in Paalu.

Both styles of Brahmin Tamil dialects augment their vocabulary by freely borrowing from Tamil language|Tamil, Sanskrit and English language|English.

A common orthography based on the Latin alphabet has been proposed for both styles of Braahmik.{{fact}}

Short Vowels : ''a, i, u, e, o''

Long Vowels : ''aa, ii /ie, uu, ee, oo''

Diphthongs : ''ai / ei, au''

Velar Consonants : ''k, g''

Palatal Consonants : ''chee, jee''

Retroflex Consonants : ''tada, dada''

Dental Consonants : ''th, dh''

Labial Consonants : ''p, b''

Velar Nasal : ''ng''

Palatal Nasal : ''nj''

Retroflex Nasal : ''hn''

Dental or Alveolar Nasal : ''n''

Bilabial Nasal : ''m''
	
Fricatives and continuants : ''y, r, l, v, zh, hl, sz, sh, s, h, rr, z'' 

Many of these can occur as geminates : ''kk, gg, nng, nnj, hnn, mm, nn, cch, jj, tt, dd, tth, ddh, pp, bb, ll, hll, trr''

There are also aspirated stop consonants : ''kh, gh, chh, jh, t'h, d'h, thh, dhh, ph, bh''

''Idhu'' 'this, this is'. The link verb 'to be' is not used in the present tense. There is no article, definite or indefinite. 'This table' as a full sentence means 'this is a table'.

The final ''-u'' in words is pronounced as an unrounded back vowel, something between ''i'' and ''u''. 

Nouns are followed by postpositions like ''kite'' 'near', ''le'' 'in' or ''kiizhe'' 'below'. There are also compound postpostions made up of a postposition plus noun plus postposition like ''k adi le'' 'below'. The verb ''iruku'' means 'is' or 'there is'. 

Nouns are in an oblique form before a preposition. Most nouns have no special oblique form. Many have. ''Pusthahath'' is the oblique form of ''pusthaham''. Sometimes between the oblique form and the postposition a dummy particle like ''u'' or ''n'' is placed. ''Chevar'' has an oblique form ''chevath''. English words in English spelling are freely used in Braahmik.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The article 'a' or 'the' has to be understood form context.

Verbs are usually given in their imperative singular form in the dictionary.
They form their three main tenses from three different bases. Often the bases are identical. But in most other cases they are diffeent.

The verb ''iru'' 'to be' is in its imperative singular form.
Its present tense base is 'iruk'. In all three tense forms, verbs have different endings for different persons in the singular and plural numbers.

The 3 rd person singular neuter form of ''iru'' is ''iruku''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Enga'' 'our' is a possessive adjective, the final ''-a'' is often dropped when followed by a word beginning with a vowel : ''eng aam'' 'our house', When something is owned by most members of the family, ''enga'' 'our' is used instead of ''en'' 'my'. Thus 'my father, my house' is  always replaced by 'our father, our house', etc.

In Thanju, words beginning with ''i-'' or ''-e'' tend to be pronounced as ''yi-'' or ''ye-'', beginning with the semivowel or consonant ''y-'', So, in the expression ''ong aam enge iruku'', the m of aam is not pronounced and the ''aa'' is nasalised, because ''enge'' is pronounced as ''yenge'' beginning with the consonant ''y-''. In Paalu ''e-'' and ''i-'' are pronounced as such, and 
in any case the final ''-m'' and ''-n'' are always pronounced as a full nasal consonant. 

So the same expression ''ong aam enge iruku'' is pronounced differently in the two styles, although written in the same way.  

The interrogative particle ''a'' (pronounced ''aa'') turns a statement into a question. 

The Paalu 2 nd person singular verb ending ''-aay'' is replaced by ''-e'' when it is followed by the interrogative partiocle ''a''.

The simple present tense form is often equivalent to the simple present or present continuous form of English : ''padikaren'' 'I read, I am reading'

The negative form of the verb is obtained by placing the particle ''lei'' after the infinitive form of the verb.

The postposition ''ku / ki'' : ''ki'' occurs after a word ending in ''-i, -e, -ai'' or ''-ei''. ''ku'' occurs elsewhere.

'''Vocabulary'''

Verbs are given in the imperative form. The present, past and future tense bases are given in parentheses ().

'''Verb Forms:'''
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The most important forms of verbs in Braahmik are : the ''imperative form'', the ''infinitive form'', the ''present tense base'', the ''past tense base'', the ''past participle form'', the ''future tense base'' and the ''personal endings'' for the past /present and future tenses.&lt;br/&gt;

In the following tables, these forms are grouped as follows :
&lt;br/&gt;
1) Imperative – Infinitive – Past Participle
&lt;br/&gt;
2)  (Personal Endings for:) Past / Present – (and) Future 
&lt;br/&gt;
3) Imperative – Present Base – Past Base – Future Base

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Notes:''' 

(*) The future tense 3 rd p. n. ending ''-um'' is generally attached to the infinitive form after removing the ending ''-a''. 

The present tense and past tense endings also differ (''-adhu / -dhu'') in the 3 rd p. n. forms..

In the verbs in which the past tense base ends in ''-in'', the 3 rd p. n. ending is ''-thu'' (as in ''oodithu'' 'it ran') in the past tense. 

The forms ''poochu'' 'it went' and ''aachu'' 'it was over' are prominent exceptions..

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word ''rendu'' 'two' has the forms ''rend aavadhu'' (Thanju) and ''rend aamadhu''  (Paalu) as the ordinal numerical pronouns (neuter gender).&lt;br/&gt;

The corresponding numerical adjectives are respectively ''rend aavadhu'' and ''rend aamathu''.

The word ''paian'' 'boy', plural ''paszanga(hl)'', is preferred in Thanju and the word ''puhllei'' 'boy', plural ''puhlleiahl'', is preferred in Paalu.  

The expressions ''mun aale'' (Thanju) and ''min aale'' (Paalu) both mean 'before' (in time) and 'in front, forward' (in space).

The future tense base often serves as a noun, as in ''padi'' 'to read, srudy' and ''padipu'' 'reading, studies'.

The word ''aakum'', variously translatable as 'indeed,  of course, etc.' is more often used in Paalu and very rarely in Thanju. &lt;br/&gt;

Examples :&lt;br/&gt;

''Aar aakum adhu ?'' 'Who could it be ?' &lt;br/&gt;
(This meaning results while trying to guess 'who it is').&lt;br/&gt; 
It could mean 'Who the hell is it ?'&lt;br/&gt;
(This is the meaning when a peson is annoyed by the interference). 
''Naan aakum chonnen'' 'It is I who said it'.
''Enge aakum poonaa ?'' 'where indeed did they go ?' or 'Can you guess where they went ?' 
&lt;br/&gt;
The plural ending could be ''-kahl, -gahl, -hahl''  or  ''(y)ahl'' depending upon the phonetic context.
&lt;br/&gt;
The future tense form of the verb is used often to refer to habitual actions of the past sometimes extending into the present:&lt;br/&gt;

''Avaa varuvaa'' 'they will come, they used to come', ''irukum'' 'there generally is'.

The particle ''a'' or ''aa'' is often placed after a noun to convert it into an adverb.

'''Vocabulary'''

Verbs are given in the imperative form and the present, past and future bases are given in parentheses ( ).&lt;br/&gt;

Nouns and pronouns are given in their ordinary (nominative) form followed in parentheses by the oblique form and, separated by a semicolon,  by the attributive form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The verb forms ''uhlla, thangara'' and ''thaamasikara'' in the above Thanju and Paalu passages are '''present participial adjective''' forms.

The phrases containing these forms are equivalent to a relative clause in English:

''Hotel le thaamasikara puhlleiahl'' means 'the boys. who stay in a hotel' or 'the boys staying in a hotel'.

In Braahmik there is no relative clause, threre are only participial adjectival phrases that precede the head noun.

Participial adjectives can be formed from the present and past tense bases by just adding the suffix ''-a''. The future 3 rd p n form itself serves as the future adjectival participle, but that form is very rarely used in Braahmik.

A few verbs like ''iru'' 'to be', ''poo'' 'to go' or ''aa'' 'to be,  become' have these forms formed irregularly. They are listed below :

''Irukara, irundha, irukum'', ''poora / poohara, poona, poohum'' and ''aara / aahara, aana, aahum''

''Dilli ki poora vandi'' means 'the Delhi bound train' 

''Poona varsham'' means 'last year, the year that went by'

''Naan poona varsham Madras le irundha poodhu'' means 'when I was in Madras last year'

The participial adjectives are the same for all genders and numbers.

''Padikara paian, padikara paszangahl, padikara pohnnu'' all mean 'student(s)'.

''Padicha manushan, padicha pohnnu'' mean 'the educated man, the educated girl'

For the future tense, instead of using the form ending in ''-um'', the construction made up of  the infinitive of a verb plus the present adjectival participle ''poora'' is used:

''Nie padicha paadam 3 (muuhn) aavadhu, nie padika poora paadam 4 (naal) aavadhu'' means 'the lesson you studied is the 3 rd, the lesson you are going to study is the 4 th'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The verb form ''szollatum'' (formed by affixing ''-tum'' to the infinitive of a verb) means 'let me (him, her, us, them) say' 

When the interrogative particle ''a'' is placed after it, it means 'may I say?'

''Epo paath aal um'' is a phrase that means 'always, whenever (you) see', The structure is complex, with ''epo...''  and ''...um'' forming a frame meaning 'always, ever', into which a past participle plus ''aa(l)'' maning 'when / if (you)...'

The emphatic particle ''e'',  placed after the present adverbial participle form of a verb, means 'going on ...ing'.

''Avar paduthund e irupar'' means literally 'he would go on lying down',

The present participle form is obtained by affixing ''-(ki/hi)ndu'' to the past participle form of a verb, 

To get the present, past or future continuous tenses, the three finite tense forms of the verb ''iru'' 'to be' are used :

''Naan padichund irundhen'' 'I was studying'

'' Nienga naahlei ki Mumbai ki pooynd irupehl'' 'You will be on your way to Mumbai tomorrow'

''Kozhandheihahl innum thuungind irukaa'' 'The children are still sleeping'.

The particle ''o'' has many uses. One of them is 'as for ...'.
''Eng apaa k o'' 'as for my father, as far as my father is concerned'.

The perfect tenses could be formed by placing the shortened verb ''-du'' (as a suffix in its various tense forms)  attached to the refular verb: 

Szaapdu 'eat', szaaptudu 'finish eating'. The imperative,  present, past and future bases of the suffixal vern ''-du'' are”

''-du, -dar, -tu, -duv''.   

While the verb ''chaapdu, szaapdu''  'to eat' is an ordinary transitive verb, ''chaaptudu, szaaptudu'' 'finish eating, eat it up' is a ''perfective'' verb that implies a definite beginning or  definite finishing of an action. 

The phrase ''or e'' means 'one and the same' or 'innumerable, endless, extreme (and so many other equivalents depending upon the context)':

	''Or e kahleipu'' 'extreme fatigue, (being) extremely tired', ''or e kuutam'' 'a milling crowd'', ''or e chatei'' 'a single (one and the same) shirt'.

Words indicating time (as onl the calendar) can be used as adverbs without a postposition: ''thinga kezhamei'' 'Monday, on Monday. Also ''kalambara'' 'morning, in the morning'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Braahmik at one time had, like Tamil, separate auciliary verbs to give a reflexive, concessive or perfective sense to the main verb. Being a rapidly growing colloquial language, it contracted these auxiliary verbs into mere verbal suffixes to convert the main verb into a reflexive, concessive or perfective verb.
The verbs are ''kohllu'' (reflexive / concessive) contracted to ''-ko'' and ''vidu'' (perfect tense auxiliary) contracted to ''-du''.

In the following table, ordinary verbs and the corresponding  reflexive / concessive and prefective verbs are given:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border= &quot;2&quot; bgcolor = &quot;pink&quot;
|+ '''Verbs'''
! '''Ordinary''' !! '''Reflexive / concessive''' !! '''Perfective'''
|-
| poo 'go' || pooyko 'you may go' || pooydu 'go away'
|-
| vaa 'come' || vandhuko / -ho 'you may come' || vandhudu 'come away'
|-
| edu 'take' || eduthuko 'you may take' || eduthudu 'ake it away'
|-
| okaaru 'sit down' || okaandhuko / -ho 'take your seat' || okandhudu '(just) sit down (and don't get up)'
|- vei 'put, keep' || vechuko 'keep it to yourself, you may keep it' || vechudu 'keep it down (and don't touch it)'
|-
| sziri /chiri 'Laugh' || sziri- / chirichuko 'snuke, laugh in your sleeves' || sziri- / chirithudu 'burst out laughing'
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

'''Cardinal Numerals'''
&lt;br/&gt;

1 ohnnu, 2 rendu, 3 muuhnu / muunnu, 4 naalu, 5 anju, 6 aarru, 7 eezhu, 8 etu, 9 ombadhu, 10 pathu.
&lt;br/&gt;

The verb ''iru'' does work for both 'to be' and 'to have', The difference is brought out by syntax :
&lt;br/&gt;

''Avan oru kozhandhei'' 'he (is) a child'
&lt;br/&gt;

''Avan u ku oru kozhandhei iruku'' 'he has a child'
&lt;br/&gt;

''Naan pahna kaaran'' 'I am a rich man'
&lt;br/&gt;

''En kite pahnam iruku'' 'I have money'
&lt;br/&gt;

''King Midas u ku kazhudhei kaadhu'' 'King 
Midas has ass's ears'.
&lt;br/&gt;

''Enga thaathaa ku romba vayas aachu'' 'My gandfather is very old'.
&lt;br/&gt;

''Kozhandhei ki pathu vayasu'' 'The child is 10 years old'.
&lt;br/&gt;

''En kite oru pusthaham iruku'' 'I have a book'.
&lt;br/&gt;

''Ena k oru thambi irukaan'' 'I have a younger brother'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Braahmik uses English words freely, especially when discussing science subjects or when referring to modern equipment of western origin.

'''Text'''

Eng apaa varshaa varsham en birthday ki nerreia story books vaangi tharuvaa. Adh ei ellaam en shelf le ozhung a arrange pahnni vech iruken. 

Indha varsham books u ku badhil a video games vaangi thandhaa. Adh ei computer oodu disc drive le vechutu naan nerreia naazhi vehlaiaaduveen. 

On kite computer iruk a ? CD ei tharatum a ? nie vehlaiaadi pakare a ? 

Veendaam daa, eng apaa thituvaa. Pariekshei varadhu, padikahnum. 

'''English Translation:'''

My father buys me a lot of story books for my birthday every year.  I have arranged them all neatly in my shelf.

This year he bought video games instead of books. I play for a long time keeping it on the disc drive of the computer.

Do you have a computer ? Shall I give you the CD ? Would you like to try and play with it too ?

No, man, my father will scold me. The exam is coming near. I have to sudy.

'''Notes:'''
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

''Varshaa varsham'' 'every year'.

Similar expressions are :

''Maasaa maasam'' 'every month' and ''vaaraa vaaram'' 'every week'/

''Vaangi tharuvaa'' 'he (generally) buys for me'. 

''Indha varsham'' 'this year'.  vehlaiaadi pakare a ? 
&lt;br/&gt;

''Vehleiaadi paaru'' 'try to play'. The verb ''paaru'' 'to see' is used with other verbs with the meaning 'try to ...''

The interrogative particle ''a'' after a present rtense form may mean 'are you ....ing' or 'would you like to ....' .

''Veendaam daa'' 'I don't want, man'. Young equals (male) while talking to each other  use the 'tag address' ''daa'' after a verb, in the same way as the word 'chum' could be used in English. This is done more frequently in Braahmik

''Padikahnum'' '(I) have to read'. The suffix /''-hnum'' (Thanju) or ''-hnam'' (Paalu) attached to the infinitive of a verb means /have to, must'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The infinitive form of some verbs can also serve as an adjective:
 
''Nerreia'' (infinitive of ''nerrei (nerreiar, nereinj, nerreiuv)'' 'to fill up, fill to the brim'). As an adjective it means 'a lot of'

English verbs can be turned into a braahmik verb by placing the verb ''pahnnu'' after the English infinitive :

''Arrange pahnnu'' 'to arrange'

The past participle of one or more verbs followed by another verb is a common construction, often translatable by a single word in English :
 
''Vaangi thaa'' 'buy (for me), buy and give'

''Eduthu kondu vaa (eduthundu vaa), kondu vandhu thaa'' 'bring'

''Kuutindu poo'' 'accompany, escort'

''Arrange pahnni vei'' 'keep smth. arranged' (ordinary)

''Arrange pahnni vech iru'' 'keep smth arranged. (perfective) 
&lt;br/&gt;

'''Possessive Pronouns'''

Corresponding to the English possessive adjectives (mu, your, his, her, our, etc.), there are possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, ours, etc.)

In Braahmik too there are possessive pronouns corresponding to the possessive adjectives. These are given in the following table:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border = “1” bgcolor = “LimeGreen”
|+ 
|-
! Possessive &lt;br/&gt; Adhective !! English !! Possessive &lt;br/&gt; Pronoun !! English

Go to the shop, by the things in this list and come, before I go out.

If I go now, I will get them. But since I have some other work, I won't go now.

Then, when will you go ?

I will go after I return in the evening.

OK, but buy them this evening itself. Otherwise, there will be no food tomorrow. They are the important things for preparing our food.

You will not forget, will you ?

I won't forget.

'''Notes:'''

The past participle form of a verb is used to connect a number of sentences into one, the last one being the only one having a finite form of the verb :
	
	''Nie pooytu, vaanfindu vaa'' 'Go, buy and come'

Corresponding to the adverbial clause of condition, Braahmik uses a conditional form of the verb, formed by adding the suffix ''-naa(l)'' to the past tense base of the verb:

	''Poonaa(l) (= poon + aa(l))'' 'If you go',

''Irukaradhu n aale'' 'Because (I) have, because there is'.
''pooradhu k uhlle'' 'Before (I) go'
''vandhadhu k aprram'' 'after (I) come'

	These constructions are formed by placing the conjunction ''aale'' preceded by the dummy particle ''n'' or the preposition ''ku”” followed by the adverb ''uhlle'' or ''aprram'' after the '''participial noun'''.

The present and past participial nouns are formed by adding ''-dhu'' to the present and past 'participial adjectives'

* The verb forms ''maaten, maate, maataan, ... maatom, maatehl, ...maataadhu'' are negative forms in the future tenses, meaning 'I (you, he, etc.) won't (be able) to ,,,', used with the infinitive of a verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Negative Forms of Verbs:'''

The negative form of the verb common to the simple past and present is obtained by placing the negative particle ''lei'' after the infinitive form of a verb. The verb ''maaten, maate, ....'' placed after the infinitive form, acts as the future negative:

''Naan pooha lei'' 'I didn't go, I don't go, I am not going'
''Naan pooha maaten'' 'I will not go, I am not going''

'''Participial Nouns'''

Participial nouns referring to the action indicated by the verb are formed by affixing ''-adhu'' to the present or past tense bases/
The future participial noun of the same kind is obtained by placing the participial nouns ''pooradhu'' or ''poonadhu'' after the infinitive of a verb:

''Kalambra oodaradhu odambu ku nalladhu'' 'Running in the morning is good for the body'.
''Padichadhu manasu le nikahnum'' 'What was studied must be retained in the mind'.

The participial noun can also refer to the person or thing that performed the action. In this case the endings  attached to the present and past bases are:

''-an'' (m sg), ''-a(hl)'' (f sg), ''-ar'' (hon sg), ''-dhu'' (n sg), ''-vaa(hl)'' (pl) ''-adhu(ha(hl))'':

''Vandhavan, (-vahl, -dhu) yaaru ?'' 'Who is the one that came ?'

''Vandhavaahl u k ellaam szaapadu pootaa'' 'They served lunch for all who came''.

'''Text (in mixed Thanju-Paalu style):”'

Braahmik peeszara peer idhu varei India muzhuka maathram dhaan paravi irundhaa. Aanaa innei ki loohath le ellaa edathu le um avaahl ei paakalaam.

Vehli uurhahl u ku pooy irukara ivaa ellaar um e nannaa padichu avaa 'vaa subject le expert aana peer aakum.

Ivaa oru chinna community ei cheendhavaahl aanaal um, ivaa veelei szeiara ellaa fields le um ivahl oodu ozheipu romba um mecha veendia oru vishayam dhaan.

'''English Translation'''

Till now the Braahmik speakers were only spread all over India. But today we can see them all over the world. 

All of these, who have gone to outside places are well educated and are experts in their respective fields.

Therefore many of them are in many high positions.

Although these belong to a small community, their industriosness in the various fiels they wotk in is a matter to be highly appreciated.

'''Notes'''

The word ''peer'' could be vaiously translated as 'persons', 'those who', etc. : ''romba peer'' 'many, many people', ''veelei szeiara peer'' 'those who work'.
The word ''uur'' can refer to a village, town, city or country, depending upon the context. Thus ''vehli uur'' 'in another town' or simply 'abroad'/
The expression ''avaa 'vaa'' is an abbreviation of ''avaa avaa'' and this repetition of ''avaa'' has a distributive sense. Hence ''avaa 'vaa'' means 'their respective'.

'''The negative imperative'''

The negative imperative forms are obtained from the infinitive form by removing the final ''-a'' and attaching ''-aadhe, aadheum, aadhengo / aadheungo / aadhungo'':

''Indha edam szuddham aa illei. Nier inge varaadheum, ange e irum'' ' This place is not clean. (Please) don't come here, (sir), Please stay there itself'.

Aar aakum peeszaradhu ?

Chummaa thaan, romba naahl aach e on kite peeszi.

Nie chummaa onn um foon pahnna maataay, Ena ku theriaadh a on ei ?

Szeri, chummaa pahnna lei dhaan.

Apo vishayath ei chollu.

Ena ku avasaram aa pahnam veendi iruku, anupi tharuve a ?

Ethrrei veehnam, epo veehnam chollu.

Email le vevaram aa ezhudharen. Aprram anupinaa poorum.

'''English Translation'''

Who is speaking ?

It is me, Ahnnaa !

Oh, it is you ? I thought it was somebody else. Well, why did you call ?

Just like that. It is a long time since I talked to you.

You won't just call like that. Don't I know you ?

Yes, I didn't call you just for nothing.

Then tell me what's the matter.

I need some money urgently. Will you send it to me ?

Tell me how much you want and when you want it.

I shall write details in an email. It is enough if you send it after that.

OK, bye then ?

Bye, take care of your health.

You too, take care of our health. Bye !

'''Notes'''

This is apparently a conversation in Paalu, as evidenced by the words ''aakum'', ''ethrrei'' and the verb ending ''-aay''.

Here ''aakum'' has the effect of saying 'may I know'

The present participial noun ''peeszaradhu'' means '(the one) who is speaking'.

''Aar aakum peeszaradhu ?'' 'Who indeed is the one who is speaking ?' or 'May I know who is speaking ?'

'*Naan dhaan'' 'It is me of course' or 'it is me only'

The tag word of address ''ahnnaa'' meaning 'elder brother' may not be translated into English as this is an ethnic habit.

''Aar o'' 'somebody or other'.

''Szeri'' 'OK, well'

''Anupi tharuve a ?'' 'Will you (please) send it (to me) ?'. 

The interrogative form itself includes the idea of 'please'.

The verb ''tharuve'' implies 'to me'.

In ''vechudatum a'', the suffix ''-tum'' and the interrogative particle ''a'' together mean '''''may I''''' ''keep it down''. 

In informal conversation, no equivalent of 'bye', etc., is used. 'Shall I keep it down ?' or 'I shall keep it down' serves the purpose of 'bye, then ?' and 'bye'.

''Odamb ei paathuko'' 'take cre of your health' is the equivalent of 'wish you good health'.

''Chummaa onn um'' (follwoed by a negative verb) 'for nothing at all'.

The postposition ''ku'' is used with some verbs:

''Ena ku therium'' 'I know'.

''Avan u ku theriaadhu'' 'He doesn't know'.

''Ena ku veendi iruku'' 'I need'.

''Ena ku veehnam / veehnum'' 'I want'

''Ena ku veendaam / veehnaam'' 'I don't want'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Impersonal Verbs'''

Braahmik has a number of  imprsoanal verbs that have only the 3 rd person neuter singular form.  

It has usually a passive sense. The main recipient or subject of the action is a noun or pronoun with the postposition ''ku''. 

A few such verbs are given in the following table:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border = ''1''
|+ '''Impersonal Verbs'''
|-
!  '''Braahmik !! '''English'''
|-
|  theri (theriaradhu, therinjudhu, therium || to be known.
|-
|  veendi iru (iruku, irundhudhu, irukum)  || to be  needed
|-
| kaanhu (kaahnaradhu, kandudhu, kaahnum) || to be seen
|-
| pidi (pidikaradhu, pidichudhu, pidikum) || to be liked
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

There is also a defective impersonal verbal particle that has only one form:

*''veehnam, veehnum'' 'it is needed'. 

*Its negative form is ''veendaam, veehnaam'' 'it is not needed'.

*This defective verb in its abbreviated form of  ''-nham, -nhum'' and its negative form ''-hndaa(m), -hnaam'' 'it is not needed' is attached to the infinitive form of any verb, meaning 'it is necessary to' or 'it is not necessary to', translatable by the words 'must' or 'don't':

*The negative forms of the defective impersonal verbs are obtained as follows:

*The infinitive followed by the negative particle ''lei'' gives the common past and present tense form.

*For the future tense the suffix ''-aadhu'' is affixed to the infinitive after dropping the final ''-a'':

*''Ena ku theria lei''  'I cannot / could not see, didn't / don't know'.

*''Theriaadhu'' 'I will not be able to (I generally cannot) see, willl not know, I don't, as a matter of fact, know'.

*''innei ki mazhei peium a ?'' 'Willl it rain today ?'

*''Theria lei / theriaadhu'' 'I don't know' 

*''Maapahlei ki sweets pidikaadhu'' 'The bridegroom doesn't like sweets'.

'''English Translation'''

Going on sleeping early in the morning is wrong.

As for pulling the blanket round you even after you are awake and go on sleeping,  it is a wrong that is much worse than that.

It must be like this : We got up quickly, brushed the teeth, washed the face, came and sat down and meditated for some time with closed eyes, and then began to attend to our work vigorously.

If (we are) students, (we) should read once the lesson done yesterday and should read the lesson to be done today two or three times until (we) understand it. 

We should repeat to ourselves what we read.. If (we) falter during recapitulation, (we) should read (it) once again.

If we study like this, it is possible to make progress in (our) studies.

'''Notes'''

*Most of the sentences in this passage are peculiar to Braahmik and are not as in English.
*In the first sentence, the expression ''thuungind e irukaradhu'' 'going on sleeping' is a participial noun phrase functioning as the subject and the subject complement is ''thapu'' 'wrong'. 
*The copula 'is' is not expressed in the present tense.
*In the last sentence ''Ipdi padich a, padipu le epo um e mun eerralaam'' 'if studied like this, it is possible to make progress in studies.', no subject is overtly expressed, making the sentence an impersonal construction.
*The sentence, ''Chat na ezhundhirundhom, pal ei theechom, muunj alambindom, vandh okaandhu konja neeram kanh ei muudindu dhhyaanam pahnninom. apram szuru szurup a veelei ei gavanichom innu irukahnam'', 'We did this, we did that, etc., etc., it should be like that', is a very special style of talking, to give corrective instructions to someone. The real meaning is 'You should do this, you should do that, etc.', without the tag statement 'it should be like that.
*The link verb ''iru'' 'to be' is expressed in the past and the future, though not in the present tense :
*A statement like ''naan padikara paian'' 'I am a student' is in the present tense with no copula.
*But, in the past tense ''naan padikara paian a irundhen'' 'I was a student', there is the copula ''irundhen'' presnt. At the same time, the subject complement is changed into an 'adverb' by placing the 'adverbialising paticle' ''a'' or ''aa''.
*When the past participle is used in place of a finite past tense, no subject need be mentioned, as in ''padikara paian a irundh a'' 'if  (I, you, he, she, it) were a student'.
*A sentence, in which the finite verb has an impersonal suffix like ''-hnim, -(l)aam'' is an impersonal sentence , to which a subject has to be supplied in the *English translation, depending upon the context.  
*''Rendu dhadavei muujnu dhdavei, rendu muuhnu dhadavei'' 'Two or three times'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* The use of the particle ''e'' as ''avan irukaan e'' 'as for him', ''nie iruke e'' 'as for you; oh, you, you', ''adhu iruk e'' 'that one, oh God; as far as that is concerned', has no parallel in English.

* Degrees of comparison are  expressed by using the expression ''ei vida'' followed by an adjective like ''peria, chinna'' 'great(er), small(er)':

* ''idhu adh ei vida peria thapu'' 'this is a greater mistake than that'.
 
* ''Nie en ei vida oyaram'' 'you are taller than I', where ''oyaram'' 'height' is a noun.

* Onomotopoetic words followed by ''innu, na, nu'' give rise to adverbs:

* ''Chat na'' 'quickly, suddenly', ''pahlich nu'' 'dazzlingly', ''mazha mazha nu'' 'sloppily' ''O nu, oo nu'' 'loudly' as in ''kozhandhei oo nu azhudhudhu'' 'the child cried loudly'.

* When giving strong advice to children or when admonishing subordinates, instead of  'you should do this, you should do that', a construction that translates  'we did this, we did that, it should be like that' is used :

* ''poonom, vandhom innu irukanham'' 'you should go quickly and come back quickly'.

* The particle ''a'' has several meanings, depending on context:

* It converts a statement into a question : ''nie padiche a, illei a ?''  'did you study or not ?'

* Placed after any word in a question, it emphasises that word in the question : ''idh ei nie a ezhudhine ?'' 'is it you who wrote this ?'

* The particle ''a'' converts a noun into an adverb : Indhy puu azhah a iruku'' 'this flower is beautiful'. (''a'' is an abbreviation of ''aaha'', infinitive of the verb ''aa'' to become).

* The particle ''a'' (abbr. of  ''aaha'') is used with the  link verb in the past and future tenses : ''Eng apaa vaadhiaar'' 'my father is a teacher', ''avar vadhiaar a irundhaar'' 'he was a teacher'.

* The particle ''a / aal'' is a conditional clause or phrase marker: ''nie kadei ki poon a, saamaan vangindu vaa.” 'If you go to the shop, buy (and bring) the things'. ''Nie padikara paian a irundh a.'' 'If you are a student'.

* Further numerals : 11 padhin ohnnu / onnu, 12 pannendu / pandhrendu, 13 padhi muuynu / muunnu, 14 padhi naalu, 15 padjin anju, 16 padhin aarru, 17 padhin eezhu, 18 padhin etu, 19 path ombadhu, 20 iruvadhu.

* When giving expression to an approximate number, one may say :

* ''ohnn o rend o'' or ''ohnnu rendu'' 'one or two'.  
''En kite pathu padhin anju ruubaay iruku'', 'I have 10 or 15 rupees with me'.

      <comment>/* Units */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Units==
Each unit in the game has a corresponding so called '''unit definition file'''. All unit defintion files can be found in the &quot;units&quot; folder of a mod. Each unit definition file is practically just a text file that holds information about a specific unit.&lt;br /&gt;
For example in the BA mod there is a file called &quot;armcom.fbi&quot; in the ''units'' folder that hols all the information for the arm commander. If this file is deleted then the arm commander won't be able to appear in the game.&lt;br /&gt;
This file is necessary for the unit because this file is what the engine uses to define a unit. With defining a unit we just mean some way so the engine knows that there should be this specific unit in the game and an explanation of how it should look and its general behaviour. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what the unit definition file does is that it keeps all information regarding a unit. The most necessary information kept in the file is the line that links the unit with the 3d model. A unit without a 3d model cannot exist.&lt;br /&gt; 
That line looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;

 objectName=ARMCOM;

&lt;br /&gt;
This informs the engine that the 3d model has the name &quot;ARMCOM&quot;. Keep in mind that names are not case sensitive and don't need the format extension of the file.&lt;br /&gt;
In the above example the file armcom.3do is linked to the unit. That file as all 3d models are found in the folder Objects3d of the mod.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Analysis ===

We have observed that CSPADE found many trivial sequences from user behaviour. For example, it has found many unitary sequences, such as  &lt;{design}&gt;, &lt;{ajax}&gt;, &lt;{css}&gt;, among others. These unitary sequences are really frequently used, but they may not be useful in the particular application, which is Tag Recommendation.

Furthermore, other trivial sequences were found, such as &lt;{design}.{design}&gt; and &lt;{webdesign},{design}&gt;. These sequences indicates that the same users tend to bookmarks pages in the same subject subsequently. However, some interesting patters were also found. We can cite &lt;{library},{books}&gt;, &lt;{javascript},{ajax}&gt; and &lt;{video},{youtube}&gt;.

We can also observe that many frequent patterns are related to ''design'', ''art'' and ''web_development''. These tags are also the most popular tags in the whole Delicious system, as can be seen [http://delicious.com/tag here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an enzyme, which catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. Usually, the typical RNA polymerase is well known that are catalyzes the transcription of mature RNA from a DNA template.

===Virus===
The most famous RdRP in a virus is the polio virus 3Dpol. The virus is made up of RNA which enters the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The RNA is able to act as a template for complementary RNA synthesis. The complementary strand of the RNA is able to act as a template, in order to produce new viral genomes which are packaged and prepare to lyse from the cell transfer to other cells for more infection. This method of replication there is no DNA; therefore the replication is rapidly.However, the downside is that there is no 'back-up' DNA copy.

There is several eukaryotes that have RdRPs, and the RdRPs are involved in RNA interference; these amplify microRNAs and small temporal RNAs. Also, they produce double-stranded RNA from using the small interfering RNAs as primers. The RdRPs are used in the defense mechanisms, but it can be usurped by RNA viruses for their benefit.

====Polio Virus====
The first interaction for the polio virus is with a host cell; it consists two materials: binding to a specific cell surface protein, and the poliovirus receptor (PVR). The PVR, is a cell surface sialylated glycoprotein, and is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (is a loop in the stucture of the protein that is a Ig domain). Therefore, PVR has three Ig loops that are on the outside of the cell. The loops begins with the most farthest of the cell surface. In loop 1, the polio virus binds to it receptor, which the receptor molecule binds on the virus particle.

The poliovirus genome is made of positive sense single stranded RNA that encodes a polyprotein of aa's in the range of 2100-2400. Both ends of the genome are modified; in the 5' end is modify by a covalently attached basic protein VPg which consist of 23 aa's, and the 3' end by polyadenylation. In a series of cleavages, viral proteases cleave themselves out and break down the polyprotein into 10 separate gene products involved in replication and packaging. 

The viral proteases 2A cleaves the p220 subunit of the cap binding complex; therefore, they make host cell from the mRNA unrecognizable to ribosomes. The 2A protease abrogates most of the host cell's own protein synthesis. Viral mRNA depends on a 5' UTR that contains an internal ribosome entry site; serves as a ribosome docking site to the subunits of ribosomes. 

[[Image: RDR Polio.jpg|right|thumb|The Structure of RDR in Polio]]Replication occurs entirely in the cytoplasm. In addition, they serve as a template for protein synthesis, the positive sense strand genome is utilized as a template for the synthesis negative sense strands. On the other hand, the host cells has a lack of necessities to replicate RNA. Poliovirus uses a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to produce RNA molecules of the opposite polarity. Viral protein VPg covalently attached to uridine, which serves as the primer. The first round of replication produces a single antisense molecule. The antisense template is used to produce copies of the original genome, which they are packaged into viral capsids before it gets release. 

The virus has been translated to its own RNA, so it produce the necessary proteins, and the virus genome is replicated. However, the virus needs to package the newly synthesized RNA molecules inside capsids, and must need the RNA packaged in order the virus is completed. The capsid proteins self-assemble into an immature capsid that has a structure of which proteins were needed, but the final form of the virus is not finished to cleaved. The mature poliovirus capsid has icosahedral symmetry, and have 60 copies of viral capsid proteins that are VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The viral RNA enters the incomplete capsid and is secured inside when the viral proteases make the final cleavages. Once the genomes have been packaged into mature virions, the virus particles await the cell's lysis in order to be released. As many as 100,000 virions can be released from a single infected cell.  
  
There is a conformational changes in the capsid, because there was a binding in the virus with the receptor. VP4, an internal capsid protein detaches from the capsid. The capsid swells and the poliovirus genome is susceptible to degradation. When VP1 is released, the genome is released onto the cytoplasm of the cell. The viral entry strategy is very inefficient; only 1% of the viruses initiate an infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Clustering is a useful technique for grouping data points such that points within a single group/cluster have similar characteristics ( or are close to each other), while points in different groups are dissimilar.

We describe the ROCK (RObust Clustering using linKs) clustering algorithm which belongs to the class of agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms.

== Technique/Algorithm ==

=== Algorithm === 

The steps involved in clustering using ROCK are described in the following figure. After drawing a random sample from the database, a hierarchical clustering algorithm that employs links is applied to the sampled points. Finally, the clusters involving only the sampled points are used to assign the remaining data points on disk to the appropriate clusters. In the following subsections, we first describe the steps performed by ROCK in greater detail.

[[File:rock1.png]]

==== Clustering Algorithm ==== 
ROCK`s hierarchical clustering algorithm is presented in the following figure. It accepts as input the set S of N sampled points to be clustred (that are drawn randomly from the original data set), and the number of desired clusters k. The procedure begins by computing the number of links between pairs of points in Step 1. Initially, each point is separate cluster. For each cluster i, we build a local heap q[i] and maintain the heap during the execution of the algorithm. q[i] contains every cluster j such that link[i,j] is non-zero. The clusters j in q[i] are ordered in the decreasing order of the goodness measure with respect to i, g(i,j).

In addition to the local heaps q[i] for each cluster i, the algorithm also maintains an additional global heap Q that contains all the clusters. Furthermore, the clusters in Q are ordered in the decreasing order of their best goodness measures. Thus, g(j,max(q[j])) is used to order the various clusters j in Q, where max(q[j]), the max element in q[j], is the best cluster to merge with cluster j.
At each step, the max cluster j in Q and the max cluster q[j] are the best pair
of clusters to be merged.

[[File:rock2.png]]

==== Computation of Links ==== 

For every point, after computing a list of its neighbors, the algorithm considers all pairs of its neighbors. For each pair, the point contributes one link. If the process is repeated for every point and the link count is incremented for each pair of neighbors, then at the end, the link counts for all pairs of points will be tained. If Mi is the size of the neighbor list for point i, then for point i, we have to increase the link count by one in M^2i entries. This, the complexity of the algorithm is the sum of M^2i which is O(N * Mm * Ma), where Ma and Mm are the average and maximum number of the neighbors for a point, respectively. In the worst case, the value of Mm can be n in which case the complexity of the algorithm becomes O(Ma * N^2). In practice, we expect Mm to be reasonably close to Ma and thus, for these cases, the complexity of the algorithm reduces to O(M^2a * n) on average.

[[File:rock3.png]]

=== Implementation ===
In order to use the ROCK algorithm in R, one must install &quot;CBA&quot; package. This package includes a function that performs the RockCluster process.

'''Install CBA Package'''
&lt;pre&gt;
install.packages(&quot;cba&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

''' Importing methods and algorithm'''
&lt;pre&gt;
library(&quot;cba&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Usage:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
rockCluster(x, n, beta = 1-theta, theta = 0.5, fun = &quot;dist&quot;,
funArgs = list(method=&quot;binary&quot;), debug = FALSE)
rockLink(x, beta = 0.5)
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Arguments:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
  X: a data matrix; for rockLink an object of class dist.
  n:  the number of desired clusters. 
  beta: optional distance threshold.
  theta: neighborhood parameter in the range [0,1).
  fun: distance function to use.
  funArgs: a list of named parameter argu
&lt;/pre&gt;


'''If everything goes ok, an object rockCluster is returned. This object has the following components:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
x: the data matrix or a subset of it.
cl: a factor of cluster labels.
size: a vector of cluster sizes.
beta: see above.
theta: see above.
rockLink: returns an object of class dist.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== View ===
There is one way to show the result from this algorithm. That way would be printing the object RockCluster:

&lt;pre&gt;
print(RockObject)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example ====

For an example , we will use the algorithm with the &quot;Mushroom&quot; dataset provided by the CBA package:

&lt;pre&gt;
data(&quot;Mushroom&quot;)
x &lt;- as.dummy(Mushroom[-1])
rc &lt;- rockCluster(x[sample(dim(x)[1],1000),], n=10, theta=0.8)
print(rc)
rp &lt;- predict(rc, x)
table(Mushroom$class, rp$cl)

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Output - Mushroom'''

[[File:rock4.png]]

== Case Study ==
In this section, we illustrate a case study with RockCluster:

=== Scenario ===

Historically the U.S.A elections are characterized by two major political parties. One called '''Republican Party''' generally reflecting the American conservatism in the political spectrum and the other called '''Democratic Party''' known as more &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot;.

The idea is to use an database of the United States Cogressional votes provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository and perform the RockCluster technique to separate '''Democrats''' from '''Republicans'''.
'''

=== Dataset ===
The Congressional voting dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is the United States Cogressional Voting Records in 1984. Each record corresponds to one Congress man's votes on 16 issues ( E.g., education spending, crime). All attributes are boolean with Yes (that is, 1) and No (0) values, and very few contain missing values. A classification label of Republican or Democrat is provided with each data record. The data set contains records for 168 Republicans and 267 Democrats.

=== Execution ===
'''R Code''':
&lt;pre&gt;
data(Votes)
x &lt;- as.dummy(Votes[-17])
rc &lt;- rockCluster(x, n=2, theta=0.73, debug=TRUE)
print(rc)
rf &lt;- fitted(rc)
table(Votes$Class, rf$cl)
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== Output ===

The result of printing the components of the class returned by the function application is shown below:

[[File:rock5.png]]

=== Analysis ===
[[File:rock6.png]]

As the table illustrates, ROCK and the traditional algorithm, both identify two clusters, one containing a large number of republicans and the other containing a majority of democrats. However, in the cluster for republicans found by the traditional algorithm, around 25% of the members are democrats, while with ROCK, only 12% are democrats. The improvement in the quality of clustering can be attributed to the usage of links by ROCK.

==Usage==
    optimsimplex.computefv(this = NULL, fun = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.compsomefv(this = NULL, fun = NULL, indices = NULL, data = NULL)

==Arguments==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| ''this'' || The current simplex object, containing the nbve x n matrix of vertice coordinates (i.e. x element), where n is the dimension of the space and nbve the number of vertices.
|-
| ''fun'' || The function to compute at vertices. The function is expected to have the following input and output arguments: &lt;br/&gt;
    myfunction &lt;- function(x, this){
    ...
    return(list(f=f,this=this))
    }
where x is a row vector and this a user-defined data, i.e. the data argument.
|-
| ''data'' || A user-defined data passed to the function. If data is provided, it is passed to the callback function both as an input and output argument. data may be used if the function uses some additional parameters. It is returned as an output parameter because the function may modify the data while computing the function value. This feature may be used, for example, to count the number of times that the function has been called.
|-

|}

==Value==
''optimsimplex.computefv'' and ''optimsimplex.compsomefv'' return a list with the following elements:
: '''this''' The updated simplex object.
: '''data''' The updated user-defined data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Over the last decade, bicluster methods have become more and more popular in different ﬁelds of two way data analysis and a wide variety of algorithms and analysis methods have been published.

Biclustering is an important new technique in two way data analysis. After Cheng and Church (2000) followed the initial bicluster idea of Hartigan (1972) and started to calculate 
bicluster on microarray data, a wide range of different articles were published dealing with different kinds of algorithms and methods to preprocess and analyze the results of such methods. Comparisons of several bicluster algorithms can be found, e.g., in Madeira and Oliveira (2004) or Prelic et al. (2006).

=== Why Biclustering? ===
* Simultaneous clustering of 2 dimensions; 
* Large datasets where clustering leads to diffuse results; 
* Only parts of the data inﬂuence each other;

=== Initial Situation ===
Two-Way Dataset:
[[File:Siduiee.png]]

=== Goal ===
Finding subgroups of rows and columns which are as similar as possible to each other and as different as possible to the rest.
[[File:Saoidjfi99.png]]

==Technique/Algorithm ==

===Algorithm === 

:Sebastian Kaiser and Friedrich Leisch started to implement a comprehensive bicluster toolbox in R (R Development Core Team, 2007).
It provides a growing list of bicluster methods, together with pre-processing and visualization techniques, using S4 classes and methods (Chambers, 1998). The software is open source and freely available from R-Forge at http://R-Forge.R-project.org.

:One of the main design principles of the package is to provide the results as an entity of Biclust-Class, an S4-class containing all information needed for postprocessing of results. 
It consists of the four slots Parameters, RowxNumber, NumberxCol and Number. Slot Parameters contains parameters and algorithm used, Number the number of biclusters found. The RowxNumber and NumberxCol slots represents the biclusters that have been found. They are both logical matrices of dimension (rows of data × number of biclusters found) with a TRUE-value in RowxNumber[i,j] if row i is in bicluster j. NumberxCol is the same for the columns, but due to computational reasons, here the rows of the matrix represent the number of biclusters and the columns represent the columns of the data. So by simply calling data [ Biclust@RowxNumber[,a] * Biclust@NumberxCol[a,] ] the values of the bicluster a can be extracted.

:Objects of class Biclust-class are created using a uniform interface for all bicluster methods by calls of form biclust(x,method=BiclustMethod,...). 
This generic function takes as inputs the preprocessed data matrix x, a bicluster algorithm represented as a Biclustmethod-Class and additional arguments. In the following we give a brief description of the ﬁve algorithms already implemented in the package, subsection headings correspond to the name of the respective Biclustmethod-Class. The naming scheme is BCxxx where xxx is an abbreviation for the name of the algorithm. Some methods have been chosen because open source code from the original authors is available, others have been newly implemented to make the overall toolbox as
comprehensive as possible. Of course, there is always room for improvement, and more methods will be added to the package in the future. See also van Mechelen and Schepers (2006) for a discussion on main directions of bicluster calculation. Algorithms are described in alphabetic order and, if not stated otherwise, functions were implemented in interpreted S code.

===Implementation ===
==== Install ====
In order to use the Biclust algorithm in R, one must install Biclust package and library:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
install.packages(&quot;biclust&quot;)
library(&quot;biclust&quot;) 
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Usage ==== 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
# S4 method for signature 'matrix,BCBimax': 
biclust(x, method=BCBimax(), minr=2, minc=2, number=100)
# S4 method for signature 'matrix,BCrepBimax': 
biclust(x, method=BCrepBimax(), minr=2, minc=2, number=100, maxc=12)
&lt;/source&gt;
Where the argumets are:
* x - A logical matrix which represents the data.
* method -  Here BCBimax, to perform Bimax algorithm.
* minr - Minimum row size of resulting bicluster.
* minc - Minimum column size of resulting bicluster.
* number - Number of Bicluster to be found.
* maxc - Maximum column size of resulting bicluster.

If everything goes OK, an object Biclust is returned.

===View ===
:As we can see below, an object Biclust is returned and we can plot it or just get the final object.
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; test &lt;- matrix(rbinom(400, 50, 0.4), 20, 20)
&gt; res1 &lt;- biclust(test, method=BCCC(), delta=1.5, alpha=1, number=10)
&gt; res1

An object of class Biclust 

call:
	biclust(x = test, method = BCCC(), delta = 1.5, alpha = 1, number = 10)

Number of Clusters found:  10 

First  5  Cluster sizes:
                   BC 1 BC 2 BC 3 BC 4 BC 5
Number of Rows:    &quot;7&quot;  &quot;4&quot;  &quot;6&quot;  &quot;6&quot;  &quot;5&quot; 
Number of Columns: &quot;5&quot;  &quot;8&quot;  &quot;4&quot;  &quot;5&quot;  &quot;6&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

:We'll give some examples of plots in the &quot;Case Study&quot; session.

==Case Study ==

===Scenario ===
:As a standard example we ran all the algorithms on the BicatYeast data from Barkow et al. (2006). To do so the data has to be preprocessed and committed to the biclust function 
together with the chosen algorithm (here Xmotifs) and parameters.

===Datasets ===

'''BicatYeast'''
* Subsample of the Saccharomyces Cerevisiae organism (Yeast).
* Used to present bicluster algorithms by Barkow et al. (2006)
* Microarray data: 419 genes, 80 experiments.

===Execution ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
data(BiclustYeast)
x &lt;- discretize(Bicatyeast)
res &lt;- biclust(x, method=BCXmotifs(), alpha=0.05, number=50)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output ===
:To visualize the result you can simply call any visualization function on the result, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; parallelCoordinates( x=BicatYeast, result=res, bicluster=4)
&lt;/pre&gt;

:'''Example for parallel coordinates plot: Expression levels of conditions across their genes in the 4th bicluster in the result of'''
'''the Xmotifs algorithm.''' 
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Ajosiu99.png]]

:'''Bicluster results similarity measure with an adaptation of Jaccard index:'''
[[File:Aksiud80.png]]

===Analysis ===
:Table 1 shows the pairwise Jaccard indices of all bicluster algorithms. The Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two 
cluster results, zero means no concordance, one means that the results are identical. It can be seen that all algorithms ﬁnd very different sets of biclusters. This can be partly explained by different pre-processing steps which were necessary such that the data conform to the respective assumptions of the algorithms. 
&lt;br /&gt;
:Another important aspect is that we selected the ﬁrst algorithms to implement to get a collection of algorithms which differ from 
each other as much as possible. It is now very easy for practitioners to try various bicluster methods in R and choose the one which works best for given data set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Demand==
Demand is equal to ''desire'' plus ''ability to pay'' plus ''will to spend''.

 Demand = Desire + ability to pay + will to spend
 &lt;small&gt;Ability to pay: money/purchasing power&lt;/small&gt;

Definition of Demand: Demand for a product refers to the '''amount of it''' which will be bought '''per unit of time''' at a '''particular price'''.

[[File:Individual Demand and Market Demand.png|center]]

==Determinants (Influencing factors of Demand)==
Demand for a commodity depends upon number of factors called '''Determinants'''. The demand function can be symbolically expressed as:
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(P_{N},P_{R},I,T,E,O)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = Quantity demanded for the commodity
:P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = Price of the commodity
:P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = Price of related commodity
:I = Income of consumers
:T = Taste &amp; preferences of the consumers
:E = Expectations about the future prices
:O = Other factors

===Price of commodity (P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(P_N)&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, it is expected that with a decrease in the price of a commodity, the demand for the commodity increases and with a rise in the price of a commodity the demand decreases. That is, there is an ''inverse relation'' between them.

===Price of related commodity (P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(P_R)&lt;/math&gt;

Demand for a related commodity depends upon the P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. There are two types of related commodities, ''complimentary'' and ''substitute'':
* '''Complimentary Goods''': If two goods are ''used together'' to satisfy a want, they are said to be complimentary goods. For example: tea and sugar, automobiles and petrol, pens and ink.
:A fall in price of a commodity raises the demand for its complimentary goods. For example, the demand for petrol increases when prices of automobiles fall. It means with fall in price of ink, the demand for pens raises.

:Demand for a commodity is ''inversely related'' with price of its complimentary goods.
* '''Substitute Goods''': Those goods which can be ''used in place of one another'' are called substitute goods. For example: tea and coffee, scooter and motorcycle, etc.
:The existence of alternative goods (substitutes) to satisfy a given demand divides the total demand among the many different goods. The larger the number of substitutes, smaller will be the demand for anyone of them. For example, with an increase in the price of coffee, the demand for its substitute (tea) increases.

:Demand for commodity is ''directly related'' to the price of its substitute.

:A fall in price of a commodity results in lowered demand for its substitute, and an increase in the price of a commodity results in increase in the demand of its substitute.

===Income of Consumers (I)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(I)&lt;/math&gt;

The demand for goods also depends upon the income of consumers. With an increase in income, the consumer's purchasing power increases, because he is in now in a position to buy more goods. Consequently, the consumer's demand for goods increases.

There are three types of goods for each of which the effect of income differs:
*'''Normal Goods''': Increase in income has a ''+ve effect on the demand'' for goods. Generally, income of the people is directly related to their demand. That is when &quot;I&quot; goes up, demand for Normal goods goes up and when &quot;I&quot; falls, demand also falls. example: laptop, etc. 

:Thus there is a ''direct relationship'' between income and demand of normal goods.

*'''Necessity Goods''': For certain goods called necessities, demand is ''not related'' to income. Salt, petrol, and LPG are considered necessity goods.

:Demand for salt does not increase with the increase in income and does not decrease with the decrease in income. It means that it is ''irrespective of income''.

*'''Inferior Goods''': Goods are said to be inferior goods if its ''demand falls with increase in income'' of the consumer. Thus there is an ''inverse relationship'' between income and demand of inferior goods.

===Taste and preference of consumers (T)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(T)&lt;/math&gt;

Demand for a commodity depends upon the taste and preferences of a consumer. A change in taste and preferences affects the level of demand for various goods. Consumer's preferences may change because of changes in fashion, habits, and so on.

===Expectations about future prices (E)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(E)&lt;/math&gt;

Future prices of goods also affect their demand particularly for consumer durable goods. Since purchase of durables can be postponed or preponed more easily than those of non-durables.

If for some reason consumers expect prices of certain goods to rise in near future, they tend to demand more for it, in the present even at increasing prices.

On the other hand, if they expect prices to fall in the near future, they will demand less of it in the present.

===Other factors (O)===
&lt;math&gt;Q_{dN}=f(O)&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Size and regional distribution of population''': A rise in population leads to an increase in the number of consumers. As a result demand, increases.

:The greater the number of consumers, the greater the market demand for a commodity. Therefore, demand for a commodity is directly related to the size of the population.

:Regional distribution of a population also affects the demand.

*'''Composition of population''': 

:If there are more children, demand for goods like toys, biscuits, sweets, etc will increase.

:Similarly, if there are more old people, the demand for goods like glasses, canes, hearing aids, medicines, dentures and so on will increase.

:Predominance of young people in the population will raise demand for goods like mobile phones, clothes, hair gels and other related products.

*'''Distribution of income''': Equitable distribution of income leads to increase in demand and unequal distribution of income leads to decrease in demand.

*'''Weather and climatic conditions''': Changes in weather conditions also influence demand for a product. For example, a sudden rainfall on a hot summer day brings down the demand for ice cream and cold drinks.

*'''Taxation''': Higher taxes imposed on a commodity will lower the demand for that commodity, and vice versa.

*'''Technical progress (inventions and innovations)''': It leads to production of new attractive quality products at fair prices. Latest LCD, 3G, etc.

*'''Advertisement effects''': Preferences of customers can be affected by advertisement and publicity, leading to greater demand for a product.

==Law of Demand==
Also known as &quot;first law of purchase&quot;, explains the inverse relationship between price and demand.

 Price α {{math|{{frac|1|Demand}}}}

Statement of Law of Demand: &quot;Other things being equal (constant), as price of commodity falls, demand extends that is demand rises and as price increases, demand contracts i.e. demand decreases.&quot;

===Assumptions===
 Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = f (P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;sub&gt;cet. par&lt;/sub&gt;
 &lt;small&gt;ceteris paribus: other factors being constant&lt;/small&gt;

#Price of related commodity (P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) must remain constant.
#Income of household (I) must remain constant.
#Taste and preferences (T) must remain constant.
#Composition and size of population must remain constant.
#Distribution of income should remain constant.
#Taxation policy, National factors, Technology, etc., should remain unchanged.
#There should not be any future expectations about change in the price.

===Explanations===
The law can be explained scientifically using multiplicative model as,
*Let the average individual hypothetical demand function be:
 Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = (6-P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;cet. par&lt;/sub&gt;
*Let the number of households in the market for commodity be = 100
*Then the market demand law under multiplicative model will be:
 Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = 100 (6-P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;cet. par&lt;/sub&gt;
 Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = 600-100P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
Demand Schedule:

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#111111&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Price of commodity&lt;/br&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) $&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Quantity Demanded&lt;/br&gt;(&lt;small&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = 600-100P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;600-100=500&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;600-200=400&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;600-300=300&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;600-400=200&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;600-500=100&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As price increases from 1 $ to 5 $, Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; contracts from 500 units to 100 units and vice-versa.

Thus the schedule expresses negative/inverse relationship between price &amp; quantity demanded.

From the table it is clear that individual consumer demanding more at lower prices and less at higher prices. This can represented graphically as follows:

Graphical representation:
[[File:Demand curve.png|center]]
X and Y axis respectively represent quantity demanded and price. Demand curve slopes downward from left to right.

Demand curve is a curve derived by joining various points showing the quantity demanded and the price of a product. and it indicates consumers behavior i.e. an individual consumer demands more at lower price and less at higher price.

Thus, it indicates there is inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded cet. par. Thus the law is verified.

===Limitations of Demand Law===
Law of Demand indicates the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded of a commodity. It is generally valid in most of the situations. But there are some situations under which there may be direct relationship between price and quantity demanded of a commodity. These exceptions are known as exceptions to the law of demand.

*'''Consumer ignorance''': Consumers ignorance induce them to buy/purchase more in the costly market. Sometimes they think like high price commodity is better in the quality. Thus with the ''increase in price, demand increases''.

*'''Necessary Goods''': There are some commodities which are not necessities/necessary but have become necessities because of their constant use and fashion. For example: LPG gas, Petrol, etc. Prices of such commodities increases, ''demand does not show any tendency to contract'' and it negatives the law.

*'''Conspicuous &amp; consumption''': If consumers measure the desired ability of the utility of a commodity, solely by its price and nothing else, then they tend to buy more of the commodity at higher price and less of it at lower price. Hence, there is a ''direct relationship between price &amp; quantity demanded''. For example: Gold ornaments, Diamonds, hair paintings.

:Higher the price of the good, greater will be the prestige of the buyer in the society and vice-versa. When price falls, the commodity comes within the reach of lower class people and they tend to demand more because of demonstration effect.

*'''Speculation''': If people expect the price of good to rise in near future, they demand more even at higher price. And if they expect the price to fall in near future, they demand less of it even at lower price. Thus more quantity of goods is demanded at rising prices and less quantity of goods is demanded at falling prices. ''This seems contrary to law of demand.''

*'''Giffen Goods''': These are special type of inferior goods named after Sir Robert Giffen.
:According to him, when price of inferior goods increases, demand increases, &amp; when price falls, demand falls. So there is ''direct relationship between price and demand''.
:People increase preferences towards superior goods due to rise in their real income. This tendency is found in low class people. However if price increases beyond certain limit, naturally demand may fall as people prefer superior goods.

==Elasticity of Demand==
It refers to measure of responsiveness (elasticity) of demand to the change in any of the determinants of demand cet. par.

Elasticity of demand is a ratio of ''proportionate change in quantity demanded'' to the ''proportionate change in any of the determinants''.

Definition: It is defined as percentage of proportional change in dependent variable result to change in an independent variable.

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\mathrm{% \vartriangle Dependent  variable}}{\mathrm{% \vartriangle Independent  variable}}&lt;/math&gt;

Demand usually varies with prices, but the extent of variation is not uniform in all the cases. In some cases, variation is extremely wide and some cases it is just nominal. And sometimes it may not be responsive. 

Now to measure this responsiveness or extent of variation economists use the word &quot;elasticity&quot;. In measuring elasticity of demand two variables are there: 1) Demand 2) Determinant

&lt;math&gt;Elasticity of Demand = \frac{\mathrm{% \vartriangle in Quantity Demand}}{\mathrm{% \vartriangle in Determinants Demand}}&lt;/math&gt;

The term elasticity of demand is commonly referred as ''price elasticity of demand''. This is a loose interpretation of term.

Logically elasticity of demand should measure responsiveness of demand for a commodity to changes in the variables confined to its demand function.

 Q&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; = f (P&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, I, T, E, O)

Hence there are many kinds of elasticity of demand as it's determinants. Economist usually consider three important kinds of elasticity of demand: 1) Price 2) Income 3) Cross price elasticity

==Price elasticity==
*Responsiveness in quantity demanded of a commodity to a change in its price..
*It means change in quantity demanded as a result of change in price in commodity.
*It is the ratio of proportional change in quantity demanded to a given proportional change in its price.
*Hence it is defined as ratio of proportionate change in quantity demanded, to proportionate change in price of commodity, cet par.

&lt;math&gt;E_P = \frac{\mathrm{\Delta{Q}/Q}}{\mathrm{\Delta{P}/P}} = \frac {\Delta{Q}}{Q} \times \frac {P}{\Delta{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_P = \frac{\Delta{Q}}{\Delta{P}} \times \frac{Q}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

 Where,
 Q = Original demand
 P = Original price
 &amp;Delta;Q = Change in demand
 &amp;Delta;P = Change in price

 &amp;Delta;Q = Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = change in quantity demand measured as difference between new demand &amp; original demand
 &amp;Delta;P = P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = change in price measured as difference between new price &amp; original price

Example:
&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#111111&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Price of Apples&lt;br&gt;
    ($)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Quantity Demanded&lt;br&gt;
    (kgs)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;20&amp;nbsp; (P1)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;100&amp;nbsp; (Q1)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;21&amp;nbsp; (P2)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;96&amp;nbsp; (Q2)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;E_P = \frac{\mathrm{\Delta{Q}/Q}}{\mathrm{\Delta{P}/P}} = \frac{\Delta{Q}}{\Delta{P}} \times \frac{P}{Q} = \frac{(96-100)}{(21-20)} \times\frac{20}{100} = \frac{-4}{1} \times \frac{20}{100} = -0.8&lt;/math&gt;

Because of inverse price &amp; demand relationship, the coefficient of price elasticity of demand is usually -ve.

However economists report it as a positive number, for the sake of convenient comparison &amp; analysis. Hence -ve symbol is ignored.

In the above example elasticity of demand is less than one. Hence by using above formula numerical coefficient of price elasticity can be measured from any searched given data. Depending upon proportional change involved in data on demand &amp; price, one may obtain various numerical value of coefficient of price elasticity ranging from 0 to &amp;infin;.

===Types of Price Elasticity===
There are 5 types of price elasticity of demand:
1) '''Elastic Demand(e=1)'''::
1) '''Inelastic Demand (e=1)'''::
1) '''Unitary Elastic Demand (e=1)'''::
1) '''Perfectly Elastic Demand (e=1)'''::
1) '''Imperfectly Elastic Demand (e=1)'''::

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
''optimsimplex.new'' creates a simplex list object which contains, among other elements, a matrix of vertices and a vector of function values calculated at those vertices. The object is actually created by a secondary function based upon the value of the ''method'' argument:&lt;br/&gt;
: '''NULL''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.coords''
: '''’axes’''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.axes''
: '''’pfeffer’''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.pfeffer''
: '''’randbounds’''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.randbounds''
: '''’spendley’''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.spendley''
: '''’oriented’''' -&gt; ''optimsimplex.oriented''

==Usage==
    optimsimplex.new(coords = NULL, fun = NULL, data = NULL, method = NULL, x0 = NULL, len = NULL, deltausual = NULL, deltazero = NULL,
                     boundsmax = NULL, boundsmin = NULL, nbve = NULL, simplex0 = NULL)
    optimsimplex.coords(coords = NULL, fun = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.axes(x0 = NULL, fun = NULL, len = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.pfeffer(x0 = NULL, fun = NULL, deltausual = NULL, deltazero = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.randbounds(x0 = NULL, fun = NULL, boundsmin = NULL, boundsmax = NULL, nbve = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.spendley(x0 = NULL, fun = NULL, len = NULL, data = NULL)
    optimsimplex.oriented(simplex0 = NULL, fun = NULL, data = NULL)

==Arguments==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| ''coords'' || The matrix of point estimate coordinates in the simplex. The coords matrix is expected to be a nbve x n matrix, where n is the dimension of the space and nbve is the number of vertices in the simplex, with nbve&gt;= n+1. Only used if ''method'' is set to NULL.
|-
| ''fun'' || The function to compute at vertices. The function is expected to have the following input and output arguments:
    myfunction &lt;- function(x, this){
    ...
    return(list(f=f,this=this))
    }
where x is a row vector and this a user-defined data, i.e. the ''data'' argument.
|-
| ''data'' || A user-defined data passed to the function. If data is provided, it is passed to the callback function both as an input and output argument. ''data'' may be used if the function uses some additional parameters. It is returned as an output parameter because the function may modify the data while computing the function value. This feature may be used, for example, to count the number of times that the function has been called.
|-
| ''method'' || The method used to create the new optimsimplex object, either ’axes’, ’pfeffer’, ’randbounds’, ’spendley’ or ’oriented’.
|-
| ''x0'' || The initial point estimates, as a row vector of length n.
|-
| ''len'' || The dimension of the simplex. If length is a value, that unique length is used in all directions. If length is a vector with n values, each length is used with the corresponding direction. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’axes’ or ’spendley’.
|-
|''deltausual'' || The absolute delta for non-zero values. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’pfeffer’.
|-
| ''deltazero'' || The absolute delta for zero values. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’pfeffer’.
|-
| ''boundsmin'' || A vector of minimum bounds. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’randbounds’.
|-
| ''boundsmax'' || A vector of maximum bounds. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’randbounds’.
|-
| ''nbve'' || The total number of vertices in the simplex. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’randbounds’.
|-
| ''simplex0'' || The initial simplex. Only used if ''method'' is set to ’oriented’.
|}

==Details==
All arguments of ''optimsimplex.new'' are optional. If no input is provided, the new simplex object is empty. &lt;br/&gt;
If ''method'' is NULL, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.coords''. If ''coords'' is NULL, the simplex object is empty; otherwise, ''coords'' is used as the initial vertice coordinates in the new simplex. &lt;br/&gt;
If ''method'' is set to ’axes’, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.axes''. The initial vertice coordinates are stored in a nbve x n matrix built as follows:
     [,1]   | x0[1] ... x0[n] |   | len[1] ...   0    |
     [,.]   |  ...  ...  ...  | + |  ...   ...  ...   |
    [,nbve] | x0[1] ... x0[n] |   |   0    ... len[n] |
If ''method'' is set to ’pfeffer’, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.pfeffer'' using the Pfeffer’s method, i.e. a relative delta for non-zero values and an absolute delta for zero values. &lt;br/&gt;
If ''method'' is set to ’randbounds’, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.randbounds''. The initial vertice coordinates are stored in a nbve x n matrix consisting of the initial point estimates (on the first row) and a (nbve-1) x n matrix of randomly sampled numbers between the specified the bounds. The number of vertices ''nbve'' in the simplex is arbitrary. &lt;br/&gt;
If ''method'' is set to ’spendley’, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.spendley'' using the Spendely’s method, i.e. a regular simplex made of nbve = n+1 vertices. &lt;br/&gt;
If ''method'' is set to ’oriented’, the new simplex object is created by ''optimsimplex.oriented'' in sorted order. The new simplex has the same sigma- length of the base simplex, but is &quot;oriented&quot; depending on the function value. The created simplex may be used, as Kelley suggests, for a restart of Nelder-Mead algorithm.

==Value==
Return a list with the following elements: &lt;br/&gt;
: '''newobj''' A list with a ’type’ attribute set to ’T_SIMPLEX’ and with the following elements:
:: '''verbose''' The verbose option, controlling the amount of messages. Set to 0.

| ''data'' || A user-defined data passed to the function. If data is provided, it is passed to the callback function both as an input and output argument. ''data'' may be used if the function uses some additional parameters. It is returned as an output parameter because the function may modify the data while computing the function value. This feature may be used, for example, to count the number of times that the function has been called.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
These functions enable various calculations and checks on the current simplex:
: ''optimsimplex.center'' Compute the center of the current simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.check'' Check the consistency of the data in the current simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.deltafv'' Compute the vector of function value differences with respect to the function value at the first vertex (the lowest).
: ''optimsimplex.deltafvmax'' Compute the difference of function value between the lowest and the highest vertices. It is expected that the first vertex (''this$x[1,]'') is associated with the smallest function value and that the last vertex (''this$x[nbve,]'') is associated with the highest function value.
: ''optimsimplex.dirmat'' Compute the matrix of simplex direction, i.e. the matrix of differences of vertice coordinates with respect to the first vertex. 
: ''optimsimplex.fvmean'' Compute the mean of the function values in the current simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.fvstdev'' Compute the standard deviation of the function values in the current simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.fvvariance'' Compute the variance of the function values in the current simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.size'' Determines the size of the simplex.
: ''optimsimplex.sort'' Sort the simplex by increasing order of function value, so the smallest function is at the first vertex.
: ''optimsimplex.xbar'' Compute the center of n vertices, by excluding the vertex with index ''iexcl''. The default of ''iexcl'' is the number of vertices: in that case, if the simplex is sorted in increasing function value order, the worst vertex is excluded.

|-
| ''method'' || The method to use to compute the size of the simplex. The available methods are the following: &lt;br/&gt;
'''’sigmaplus’''' (this is the default) The sigmamplus size is the maximum 2-norm length of the vector from each vertex to the first vertex. It requires one loop over the vertices. &lt;br/&gt;
'''’sigmaminus’''' The sigmaminus size is the minimum 2-norm length of the vector from each vertex to the first vertex. It requires one loop over the vertices. &lt;br/&gt;
'''’Nash’''' The ’Nash’ size is the sum of the norm of the norm-1 length of the vector from the given vertex to the first vertex. It requires one loop over the vertices. &lt;br/&gt;
'''’diameter’''' The diameter is the maximum norm-2 length of all the edges of the simplex. It requires 2 nested loops over the vertices.
|-
| ''iexcl'' || The index of the vertex to exclude in center computation.
|}

==Value==
''optimsimplex.center'' Return a vector of length nbve, where nbve is the number of vertices in the current simplex. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.check'' Return an error message if the dimensions of the various elements of the current simplex do not match. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.deltafv'' Return a column vector of length nbve-1. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.deltafvmax'' Return a numeric scalar. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.dirmat'' Return a n x n numeric matrix, where n is the dimension of the space of the simplex. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.fvmean'' Return a numeric scalar. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.fvstdev'' Return a numeric scalar. &lt;br/&gt;
''optimsimplex.fvvariance'' Return a numeric scalar. &lt;br/&gt;

    optimsimplex.gradforward(this = NULL)

==Arguments==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| ''this'' || An simplex object
|-
| ''fun'' || The function to compute at vertices. The function is expected to have the following input and output arguments:
    myfunction &lt;- function(x, this){
    ...
    return(list(f=f,this=this))
    }
where x is a row vector and this a user-defined data, i.e. the data argument.
|-
| ''method'' || The method used to compute the simplex gradient. Two methods are available: ’forward’ and ’centered’. The ’forward’ method uses the current simplex to compute the gradient (using ''optimsimplex.dirmat'' and ''optimsimplex.deltafv''). The ’centered’ method creates an intermediate simplex and computes the average.
|-
| ''data'' || A user-defined data passed to the function. If data is provided, it is passed to the callback function both as an input and output argument. data may be used if the function uses some additional parameters. It is returned as an output parameter because the function may modify the data while computing the function value. This feature may be used, for example, to count the number of times that the function has been called.
|}

==Value==
''optimsimplex.gradientfv'' returns a list with the following elements:
: '''g''' A column vector of function gradient (with length ''this$n'').
: '''data''' The updated user-defined data.
''optimsimplex.gradcenter'' returns a list with the following elements:
: '''g''' A column vector of function gradient (with length ''this$n'').
: '''data''' The updated user-defined data.
''optimsimplex.gradforward'' returns a column vector of function gradient (with length ''this$n'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes, there will be more than one variable that needs to be solved for in an equation.  There are systems used by mathematicians to solve for these unknown quantities, which are discussed below.

== Vocabulary ==

Variable - a letter (A-Z) that takes the place of a number.

Expression - a group of numbers and variables, added, multiplied, subtracted or divided by each other &lt;center&gt;(examples include:&lt;math&gt; 2,  7x,  8x-7,  \sqrt{x} + 4 )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Equation - an expression that is equal to another expression

Coefficient - the number multiplied by a variable (the 3 in &lt;math&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt;)

== Lesson ==
There are three simple ways to solve an equation with two variables.

The number of variables in an equation corresponds to the number of equations needed to solve for the variables.

===Graphing===
The most simple way to solve for the variables is by graphing both equations and finding the point where they intersect.  This method is not incredibly accurate, unless we measure it with a ruler however, since we cannot be sure exactly where an intersection is unless we measure it.

===The substitution method===
In these, the first step is isolating one variable on one side of an equation.  After this is accomplished, the expression on the other side of the equal sign can be substituted for the variable we solved for in the first step.  Now, this second equation has only one variable.  We simplify the equation, solving for the remaining variable.  Then we plug this value back into one of the original equations and solve for the first variable.

===Elimination method===
To use the elimination method, we make the coefficients of one variable opposites of each other by multiplying or dividing both sides of the equations by the desired numbers.  Once this is accomplished, we arrange the equations so that each variable is above the same variable in the other equation.  After this, we add the coefficients of each variable to each other to produce a new equation, with only one variable (since the coefficients of one set of variables will cancel.  Then follow the steps listed under substitution to solve for the remaining variable(s).  (Refer to example 3 to see this method in action)

== Example Problems ==

===Example 1===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3x + 2 = y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;4x - 6 = 2y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* Substitute (3x + 2) for y in the second equation

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;4x - 6 = 2(3x + 2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Distribute the 2

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 4x - 6 = 6x + 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Add 6 to each side

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 4x = 6x + 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Subtract 6x from each side

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -2x = 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Divide each side by -2

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = -5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Now, plug -5 in for x in one of the original equations and solve for y:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3(-5) + 2 = y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Simplify

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -15 + 2 = y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -13 = y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So the solutions are x=-5 and y=-13
(If you graphed these lines, the intersection would be at the point (-5,-13)

=== Example 2 ===
*&lt;math&gt; 5x+3y=12&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; x - y=4&lt;/math&gt;

*Multiply the second equation by 3 on each side so that the coefficients of the y's will be 3 and -3

*&lt;math&gt; 5x+3y=12&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; 3x - 3y=12&lt;/math&gt; 

*&quot;Add&quot; the equations together using the addition method

*&lt;math&gt; 8x + 0y = 24&lt;/math&gt;

*Divide each side of the equation by 8

*&lt;math&gt; x=3&lt;/math&gt;

*Plug this 3 back into the first equation for x and solve for y

*&lt;math&gt; (3) - y = 4 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; -y = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; y = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

So, x=3 and y= -1

=== Example 3 ===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2y = 3x + 20&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;4y = 6x + 24&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Divide the equations by 2 and 4, respectively

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{3}{2}x + 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{3}{2}x + 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Substitute

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}x + 10 = \frac{3}{2}x + 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

*Subtract &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}x&lt;/math&gt; from each side

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 10 = 6 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This absurd equation is obviously false, therefore there are no solutions.  This is because the coefficients of the x were the same while in slope-intercept form, so the lines were parallel (never touching) so there are no solutions. (For a further explanation of slope-intercept form, see [[Basic_Algebra/Lines_(Linear_Functions)/Slope-Intercept_Form_of_a_Line|Slope-Intercept Form of a Line]])

NOTE: When you get and equation that is always true (3=3 or 5=5) there are infinitely many solutions.

==Practice Games==

There is a 2-variable game on the following webpage: [[http://www.crctlessons.com/equations-game.html]]

== Practice Problems ==
=== Problem 1 ===
* &lt;math&gt;y=x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y=2x - 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=3, y=5&lt;/math&gt;

=== Problem 2 ===
* &lt;math&gt;x + y = 5 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2x - y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=5, y=0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Problem 3 === 
* &lt;math&gt;4x + 6 = 2y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x + y=5&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{2}{3}, y=\frac{13}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Problem 4 ===
* &lt;math&gt;x - 2y=7&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y - x=13&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x= -33, y= -20&lt;/math&gt;

=== Problem 5 ===
* &lt;math&gt;y=2x - 1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2y + 2= 4x&lt;/math&gt;
Infinitely many solutions

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

Clustering is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups entities, from a dataset, that have high degree of similarity in a same cluster. Nowadays lots of areas are using this kind of algorithms to separate datasets into groups in a automated way, and still have a good quality result.

The clustering process is not a universal process because that are a lot of kind of groups of datasets, for some of this the kind of metric is a relevant thing, for others the entities that represent each cluster are more interesting. Like datasets groups there are a lot of kind of clustering algorithms each one tries to take advantage of a kind of group of data, so this way each one of them is more suited to a more specific kind of data.

This section will explain a little more about the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) Algorithm, showing how the algorithm works, which are its parameters and what they mean, and an example of a dataset, and of how to execute the algorithm, and the result of that execution with the dataset as input.

= The Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) Algorithm =
== Algorithm ==

The PAM algorithm was developed by Leonard Kaufman and Peter J. Rousseeuw, and this algorithm is very similar to K-means, mostly because both are partitional algorithms, in other words, both break the datasets into groups, and both works trying to minimize the error, but PAM works with Medoids, that are an entity of the dataset that represent the group in which it is inserted, and K-means works with Centroids, that are artificially created entity that represent its cluster.

The PAM algorithm partitionates a dataset of n objects into a number k of clusters, where both the dataset and the number k is an input of the algorithm. This algorithm works with a matrix of dissimilarity, where its goal is to minimize the overall dissimilarity between the representants of each cluster and its members. The algorithm uses the following model to solve the problem:
&lt;math&gt;
F(x) = \text{minimize}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n d(i, j)z_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

Subject to:
# Σ &lt;sub&gt;i=1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 , j = 1,2,...,n
# z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , i, j = 1,2,...,n
# Σ &lt;sub&gt;i=1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = k , k = number of clusters
# y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; € {0,1} , i, j = 1,2,...,n

Where F(x) is the main function to minimize, where d(i,j) is the dissimilarity measurement between the entities i and j, and z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable that ensures that only the dissimilarity between entities from the same cluster will be computed in the main function. The others expressions are constraints that have the following functions: (1.) ensures that every single entity is assigned to one cluster and only one cluster, (2.) ensures that the entity is assigned to its medoid that represent the cluster, (3.) ensures that there is a number exactly equals to k of clusters and (4.) let the decision variables assume just the values of 0 or 1.

The PAM algorithm can work over two kind of input, the first is the matrix representing every entity and the values of its variables, and the second is to work with the dissimilarity matrix directly, in the later the user can provide the dissimilarity directly as an input to the algorithm, instead of the data matrix representing the entities. Either way the algorithm reach an solution to the problem, in a general analysis the algorithm proceed this way:

'''Build phase:'''
:1. Choose k entities to become the medoids, or in case these entities were provided use the them as the medoids;
:2. Calculate the dissimilarity matrix if it was not informed;
:3. Assign every entity to its closest medoid;
'''Swap phase:'''
:4. For each cluster search if any of the entities of the cluster lower the average dissimilarity coefficient, if it does select the entity that lower the most this coefficient as the medoid for this cluster;
:5. If at least the medoid from one cluster has changed go to (3), else end the algorithm.
As was said the PAM algorithm works with a matrix of dissimilarity, and to calculate this matrix the algorithm can use two metrics the first one is the euclidean, that are the root sum-of-squares of differences, while the second one is the manhattan distance that are the sum of absolute distances.

== Implementation ==

The pseudocode of PAM algorithm is shown below:

''' Algorithm 1: PAM Algorithm '''
'''Input:''' E = {e1,e2,...en} (dataset to be clustered or matrix of dissimilarity)
::k (number of clusters)
::metric (kind of metric to use on dissimilarity matrix)
::diss (flag indicating that E is the matrix of dissimilarity or not)
'''Output:''' M = {m1,m2,...,mk} (vector of clusters medoids)
::L = {l(e) | e = 1,2,...,n} (set of cluster labels of E)
'''foreach''' m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; € M '''do'''
:m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ← e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;  € E; (e.g. random selection)
'''end'''
'''if''' diss ≠ true
:Dissimilarity ← CalculateDissimilarityMatrix(E, metric);
'''else'''
:Dissimilarity ← E;
'''end'''
'''repeat'''
:'''foreach''' e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; € E '''do'''
::l(e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) ← argminDissimilarity(e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, Dissimilarity, M);
:'''end'''
:changed ← false;
:'''foreach''' m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; € M '''do'''
::Mtmp ← SelectBestClusterMedoids(E, Dissimilarity, L);
:'''end'''
:'''if''' Mtmp ≠ M
::M ← Mtmp;
::changed ← true;
:'''end'''
until changed = true;

In the R programming language, the PAM algorithm is available in the cluster package and can be called by the following command:

 pam(x, k, diss, metric, medoids, stand, cluster.only, do.swap, keep.diss, keep.data,
 trace.lev)

Where the parameters are:

'''x:''' numerical data matrix representing the dataset entities, or can be the dissimilarity matrix, it depends on the value of the diss parameter. In case x is a data matrix each row is an entity and each column is an variable, and in this case missing values are allowed as long as every pair of entities has at least one case not missing. In case x is a dissimilarity matrix it is not allowed to have missing values.

'''k:''' number of clusters that the dataset will be partitioned where 0 &lt; k &lt; n, where n is the number of entities.

'''diss:''' logical flag, if it is TRUE x is used as the dissimilarity matrix, if it is FALSE, then x will be considered as a data matrix.

'''metric:''' an string specifying each of the two metrics will be used to calculate the dissimilarity matrix, the metric variable can be “euclidean” to use the Euclidean distance, or can be “manhattan” to use the Manhattan distance.

'''stand:''' logical flag, if it is TRUE then the measurements in x will be standardized before calculating the dissimilarities. Measurements are standardized for each column, by subtracting the column's mean value and dividing by the variable's mean absolute deviation. If x is a dissimilarity matrix then this parameter is ignored.

'''cluster.only:''' logical flag, if it is TRUE, only the clustering will be computed and returned.

'''do.swap:''' logical flag, indicates if the swap phase should happen (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

'''keep.diss:''' logical flag indicating if the dissimilarities should (TRUE) or not (FALSE) be kept in the result.

'''keep.data:''' logical flag indicating if the input data x should (TRUE) or not (FALSE) be kept in the result.

'''trace.lev:''' an numeric parameters specifying a trace level for printing diagnostics during the build and swap phase of the algorithm. Default 0 does not print anything.

The PAM algorithm return a pam object that contains the information about the result of the execution of the algorithm.

== Visualization ==
In R there are two ways of seeing the result of the PAM algorithm, the first one is to print the object that the algorithm returns, and the second one is to plot the data from the object creating a graphic of the result. The first way of visualizing the information is a bit more complicated to understand but it gives a more complete and accurate information, but the second way is a lot more easy to understand and let the user have a better view of the information and to add information that wold be relevant for him.

To view the data of the result of the execution of PAM algorithm in a textual way there are two ways one more simple that gives a more summarized information about the object, and another one that gives you a more complete information about it. In the two commands listed below the first one print the information in a summarized way, while the second one print it in a more complete way.

 print (result)
 summary (result)

The other way of visualizing the data from the result of the execution of the algorithm is using graphics and that can be done by using the following command:

 plot (result)

'''Example:'''
To show an example of use of the algorithm and a result from its execution it was used a simple dataset with few entities and few dimension, as it is shown in the table as follows:

Table 1: ''Simple dataset''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Object !! Attribute x !! Attribute y
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1
|-
| 2 || 2 || 3

| 3 || 1 || 2

|-
| 6 || 11 || 5
|-
| 7 || 10 || 6
|-
| 8 || 12 || 5
|-
| 9 || 11 || 6
|}

As we can see the data is separated in two clusters, so we will use an k = 2. The PAM algorithm can be executed as follows:

 #load the table from a file
 x &lt;- read.table(“table.txt”)
 
 #execute the pam algorithm with the dataset created for the example
 result &lt;- pam(x, 2, FALSE, &quot;euclidean&quot;)
 
 #print the results data in the screen
 summary(result)
 
 #plot a graphic showing the clusters and the medoids of each cluster
 plot(result$data, col = result$clustering)
 points(result$medoids, col = 1:2, pch = 4)

Printing the result form the execution gives you:

== Case Study ==

In this section we will see a case study using PAM.

=== Scenario ===

In this case study it was used a part of the database iris available in the R package datasets. This famous (Fisher’s or Anderson’s) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Using the data that this dataset provides us, it is natural to think of verifying if the flowers of each one of three species of iris are really similar to the others from the same specie, so in this case study it will be used the length and width of both petal and sepal to cluster the dataset into 3 groups and then verify if the clusters really match with the flowers species.

The dataset that was used into this case study consist of the following columns:

* '''Flower:''' An id of the flower;
* '''Sepal.Length:''' A numeric value of the length of the sepal in centimeters;
* '''Sepal.Width:''' A numeric value of the width of the sepal in centimeters;
* '''Petal.Length:''' A numeric value of the length of the petal in centimeters;
* '''Petal.Width:''' A numeric value of the width of the petal in centimeters;
* '''Species:''' A text identifying the specie of the flower.

=== Input Data ===

The input data is a table consisting of 50% (75 entities) of the original iris dataset that have 150 flowers and 5 attributes each. So the dataset used in this case study is represented by the following table:

Table 2: ''Sample from iris dataset''

=== Analysis ===

After the execution of the algorithm and the analysis of the data it was possible to tell that the clusters was well grouped and correlated with the species of each flower. In the data there was a total of 75 elements, 25 from ''Setosa'' species, 25 from ''Versicolor'' species and 25 from ''Virginica'' species, and the algorithm clustered the elements from ''Setosa'' as cluster 1, the ones from ''Versicolor'' as cluster 2 and the ones from ''Virginica'' as cluster 3. After verifying the results we find that from 75 elements, 66 were correctly clustered, giving an error margin of 12%—which is a very good result.

progress notes on construction of site:
11/25/10: working on creating paragraph divisions properly.
time consuming getting images for site.
did some editing today
difficulty getting italics to display; using quotes, but not displaying.
11/26/10: finally got the italics and bold working
still cannot get a numbered list to show up correctly; using #
how do you open hyperlinks in their own window?

11/27- I was looking over your page and noticed that you have the same reference several times at the bottom.  You can condense this by adding an additional tag in the ref tag.  Example- Say you cite Smith three times. The first time you cite Smith add &lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt; info&lt;/ref&gt;   The &quot;name&quot; can be whatever you want.  Then when you cite Smith again, use the same beginning ref tag with the name.  At the bottom of the page, Smith will appear once with an a,b,c (one for each time you cite them) etc next to the citation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New and emerging culture and the realities of the information age have undoubtedly made knowledge development a technologically assisted activity. E-learning is a consequence of this movement towards more flexibility, choice and outreach. The use of online teacher professional development may be the solution for many of the traditional barriers that have existed. What are your thoughts on this?

Alchemy Heels I is an alias used by none other than the infamous 15 year old kid writing this right now (or a while ago, depending on how you feel about Einstein's theory that time is relative).

= ME! =
I am Michael Sheely, which, if you haven't guessed already is an anagram for Alchemy Heels I, which is pretty nice.  Yo estoy en Estados Unidos y hablo dos lenguajes.
*Note the date and time, everyone! 11:00 on the dot of Thursday, November, 25, 2010.  I have beens auto-confirmed.  Thank you, thank you &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}
{i} = -xi&lt;/math&gt; (For all of you who were wondering)

= Wikimedia =
Now that you've finished reading that saga about me, here's my Wikipedia history.  I just finished creating my first article, all by myself.  It isn't on Wikipedia, however, it's on Wikibooks (which is an open source learning project for teaching students) and about math.  I know a lot of you will be disgusted at the mention of such a subject (math) and will close this window right now (so why am I still writing?) but I needed to create a page before I am considered an auto-confirmed user, even though the Wiki foundation was supposed to approve me days ago.  This is the first page I ever created [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Algebra/Solving_Equations/Equations_with_More_than_One_Variable]] so it's pretty sentimental for me.

= Chess =
If anyone wants to play a game of chess, edit this part of the page to show your move (r=rook n=knight b=bishop q=queen k=king p=pawn d=dark l=light)  Still your move, Ryan

= Contact Information =
I am reachable at mssheely1234567@gmail@yahoo.com
Please do not spam me {yes I realize the irony of the fact that I am posting my email in such an obscure place that the only people that would want to contact me would probably simply do so to send me a virus.  No worries, I've got a killer antivirus program that'll disarm any Trojan horses that might be thrown my way [hahahaha! I actually don't but now no one would even DARE send a virus because they think it would be pointless (except now they'll read that and decide they will send the virus, darn)]}

== Auxiliary ==
Just in case those spammers need some more emails to spam, I also use these auxiliary email accounts:
*mssheely1234567@yahoo.com
*yacadoodelsarah@yahoo.com (that was my sister's name, and she created it for me, the nonsense part in front was my first word when I was a baby, don't ask me how it happened, because I don't know).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:UpperAndLowerConvexHulls.png|thumb|Upper and lowers hulls of a set of points]]
'''Andrew's monotone chain convex hull algorithm''' constructs the [[w:Convex Hull|convex hull]] of
a set of 2-dimensional points in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; time.

It does so by first sorting the points lexicographically (first by ''x''-coordinate, and in case of a tie, by ''y''-coordinate), and then constructing upper and lower hulls of the points in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time.

An upper hull is the part of the convex hull, which is visible from the above. It runs from its rightmost point to the leftmost point in counterclockwise order. Lower hull is the remaining part of the convex hull.

== Pseudo-code ==
&lt;pre&gt;
Input: a list P of points in the plane.

Sort the points of P by x-coordinate (in case of a tie, sort by y-coordinate).

Initialize U and L as empty lists.
The lists will hold the vertices of upper and lower hulls respectively.

for i = 1, 2, ..., n:
    while L contains at least two points and the sequence of last two points
            of L and the point P[i] does not make a counter-clockwise turn:
        remove the last point from L
    append P[i] to L

for i = n, n-1, ..., 1:
    while U contains at least two points and the sequence of last two points
            of U and the point P[i] does not make a counter-clockwise turn:
        remove the last point from U
    append P[i] to U

Remove the last point of each list (it's the same as the first point of the other list).
Concatenate L and U to obtain the convex hull of P.
Points in the result will be listed in counter-clockwise order.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nikhilam Sutra stipulates subtraction of a number from the nearest power of 10 ie 10,100,1000,etc.
The powers of 10 from which the difference is calculated is called the Base. These numbers are considered to be references to find out whether given number is less or more than the Base. If the given number is 104,the nearest power of 10 is 100 and is the base. Hence the difference between the base and the number is 4,which is Positive and it is called NIKHILAM. The value of Nikhilam may be reference base, the Nikhilam of 87 is -13 and that of 113 is +13 respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Group of concepts for renewable energy where heat from the solar energy is utilized to generate energy are considered under Solar Thermal section. This is one of the most used concept for the domestic purpose and one can reach out in local market for products which are efficient and cost effective for local installation.

== Domestic Application ==

Domestic applications are such where there can be installation on each house or a building to utilize the Solar Thermal energy. These are mainly for domestic heating purpose. There are products readily available in market for heating and cooking.

=== Water Heating ===

Solar radiation can be converted into useful energy directly by using a solar collector to heat water. This can be used to provide hot water for direct use or heating. Solar heat can also be used to for room heating.

Since solar energy is available only for the about 6 hr a day there is always the need for attached energy storage with this renewable energy collectors. With solar water heater there is a thermally insulated tank which collect hot water generated during the daytime for use at appropriate time.

==== Construction ====

This section will explain in simple term what are basic components and type of constructions for water heating using solar thermal.

=== Cooking ===

Since cooking is done in day time there is usually no need to have an attached energy storage with this type of installation.

==== Construction ====

This section will explain in simple term what are basic components and type of constructions for cooking using solar thermal.

== Electricity Generation ==

Most of the commercial solar thermal implementation are for generation of electricity. The principle used in electricity generation is to have a fluid heated by solar heat. Then use the heated fluid in a turbine to generate electricity. To run a turbine the fluid needs to be heated to very high temperature and high pressure needs to be achieved. Achieving such high temperature requires a much more complicated collector.

=== Direct Solar ===

This section covers such concepts where only solar thermal energy is used to generate electricity.

=== Hybrid Solar ===

This section covers such concepts where solar thermal energy is used along with other conventional power generation plant to generate electricity. This is more convenient option for the commercial generation of electricity as the need of electricity is different in different time of day. Also hybrid installation can complement and increase the efficiency of the conventional power plant.


== Experimental ==

This section gives details of the solar thermal concepts which are more under the research or experimental stage.


=== Solar Pond ===

A solar pond is the pond of gradient salinity which traps the heat from sun.Any lake absorbs heat from the sun. Normally, heat is lost as warm water rises to the surface and cools by evaporation.  But water is a VERY poor conductor of heat and if this circulation can be stopped, the heat can be trapped in the bottom of the lake.  A salt lake, (ideally about 3m deep), managed so that the water on top is of (relatively) low salinity and the water on the bottom is of very high salinity, will not circulate to release heat because the water on the bottom is so heavy with salt it cannot rise. The deeper water gets very hot - to over 100 degrees in the right circumstances - 80 degrees is common in the tropics. In Southern Australia 60 degrees C is easily achievable - even in winter.  The main management problem is to extract heat at the right rate so the lake does not boil or 'turn over' and lose its heat. By utilizing the sun energy we make useful this storage of hot water in our various task in which the power generation is main. As a form of solar energy, the solar pond collector has major advantages. 

    The heat storage is massive, so energy can be extracted day and night - hence it is a source of 'base load' solar power  -
    no batteries or other storage needed !

    Solar ponds can have very large heat collection area at low cost.

    The major production potential is during peak electrical power demand (and price) in mid summer

    The technology and scientific principles for collection and extraction of heat and its conversion to electricity 
    are well understood and well documented in scientific papers.

    Any qualified engineer would be able to build one of these systems (being a refrigeration specialist would be 
    useful if you wanted to build a Rankine engine)

Types of Solar Ponds

There are two main categories of solar ponds: non-convecting ponds, which reduce heat loss by preventing convection from occurring within the pond; and convecting ponds, which reduce heat loss by hindering evaporation with a cover over the surface of the pond.

Non-convecting Ponds There are two main types of non-convecting ponds: salt gradient ponds and membrane ponds. A salt gradient pond has three distinct layers of brine (a mixture of salt and water) of varying concentrations. Because the density of the brine increases with salt concentration, the most concentrated layer forms at the bottom. The least concentrated layer is at the surface. The salts commonly used are sodium chloride and magnesium chloride. A dark-colored material—usually butyl rubber—lines the pond. The dark lining enhances absorption of the sun’s radiation and prevents the salt from contaminating the surrounding soil and groundwater. As sunlight enters the pond, the water and the lining absorb the solar radiation. As a result, the water near the bottom of the pond becomes warm—up to 200o F (93.3oC). Although all of the layers store some heat, the bottom layer stores the most. Even when it becomes warm, the bottom layer remains denser than the upper layers, thus inhibiting convection. Pumping the brine through an external heat exchanger or an evaporator removes the heat from this bottom layer. Another method of heat removal is to extract heat with a heat transfer fluid as it is pumped through a heat exchanger placed on the bottom of the pond. Another type of non-convecting pond, the membrane pond, inhibits convection by physically separating the layers with thin transparent membranes. As with salt gradient ponds, heat is removed from the bottom layer.

Convecting Pond A well-researched example of a convecting pond is the shallow solar pond. This pond consists of pure water enclosed in a large bag that allows convection but hinders evaporation. The bag has a blackened bottom, has foam insulation below, and two types of glazing (sheets of plastic or glass) on top. The sun heats the water in the bag during the day. At night the hot water is pumped into a large heat storage tank to minimize heat loss. Excessive heat loss when pumping the hot water to the storage tank has limited the development of shallow solar ponds. Another type of convecting pond is the deep, salt-less pond. This convecting pond differs from shallow solar ponds only in that the water need not be pumped in and out of storage. Double-glazing covers deep salt-less ponds. At night, or when solar energy is not available, placing insulation on top of the glazing reduces heat loss.
 
Solar ponds can only be economically constructed if there is an abundance of inexpensive salt, flat land, and easy access to water. Environmental factors are also important. An example is preventing soil contamination from the brine in a solar pond. For these reasons, and because of the current availability of cheap fossil fuels, solar pond development has been limited in the United States. The greatest potential market for solar ponds in this country could be in the industrial process heat sectors

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wind power has been harnessed by the human race for thousands of years. Traditionally, wind has been converted directly to mechanical power to, for example, mill grain in a windmill. Modern 'windmills' used for generating electricity are referred to as wind turbines due to their similarity to steam or gas turbines used to generate electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==
This function performs a simultaneous clustering of two matched datasets (e.g., daily local- and
large-scale atmospheric data), such that each cluster maximises the correlation between the two
datasets. This clustering is based on a mixture of canonical correlation analyses (CCAs).

== Usage ==
CCM(Nc, NS, DataA.tbc,DataS.tbc,NN, DataStation, init=&quot;block&quot;, ITmax=15, rq=0)

== Arguments ==
:* Nc Number of clusters required.

:* NS Number of locations (i.e., weather stations) for the local-scale time series.

:* DataA.tbc Dataset corresponding to the large-scale data to be clustered. This is a matrix
M*NN, whereMcorresponds to the number of large-scale locations (e.g., GCM
or RCM grid cells), and NN to the length of the time series (e.g., number of
days). Note that this matrix is used in CCM without any transformation. For
example, if a principal component analysis (PCA) has to be performed, this
must be done BEFORE entering CCM.

:* DataS.tbc Dataset corresponding to the local-scale (station) data to be clustered. This is a
matrix NS*NN. Similarly as for DataA.tbc, note that this matrix is used in CCM
without any transformation, and that if a PCA has to be performed, this must be
done BEFORE entering CCM.

:* NN Length of the time series (e.g, number od days for daily time series).

:* DataStation Local-scale (stations) dataset on which the information criterion will be calculated.
It usually is the same as DataS.tbc but can be different according to the
application (e.g., DataS.tbc is the result of a PCA) or to the goal to reach.

:* init Initializing method for the clusters. Six methods are available:
- &quot;block&quot;: Blocks initialization (the default)
- &quot;12345&quot;: Each day is alternatively allocated to a cluster (For example, if 3
clusters required, day1 goes to C1, day2 to C2, day3 to C3, day4 to C1, day5 to
C2, etc.)
- &quot;Kmeans&quot;: Initialization by the k-means algorithm
- &quot;Mixtn&quot;: Same a &quot;12345&quot; but for length 12 (instead of length 1)
- &quot;EMw&quot;: Initialization by the EM clustering algorithm applied onto the w
(i.e., large-scale) canonical variates resulting from a CCA performed between
DataA.tbc and DataS.tbc
- &quot;EMvw&quot;: Same as &quot;EMw&quot; but EM is applied onto both v (local) and w (largescale)
canonical variates.

:* ITmax Maximum number of iterations (default is 15) is the algorithm di not converge.
CWGLI 3

:* rq Value (of the local-scale variable of interest) on which the information criterion
(IC) is calculated (default is rq=0). rq can be the 90th percentile of the data. In
that case, CCM will try to find clusters for which the extremes are well discriminated.
A high IC means a good discrimination (in terms of local-scale variable)
between the clusters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structural Biochemistry Evolution and Bioinformatics Terms ==
* HOMOLOG: Two molecules are said to homologous if they have been derived from a common ancestor. Homologous molecules or homologs are divided into two classes: paralog and ortholog. Homology is often manifested by significant similarity in nucleotide or amino acid sequence and almost always manifested in three-dimensional structure. 
* PARALOG: Paralogs are homologs that are present within one species. Paralogs often differ in their detailed biochemical functions. For example, human ribonuclease, which is a digestive enzyme and angiogenin, which stimulates blood vessel growth are structurally very similar but functionally very different.
* ORTHOLOG: Orthologs are homologs that are present within different species and have very similar or identical functions. For example, human ribonuclease, which is a digestive enzyme and bovine ribonuclease, which is also a digestive enzyme, are both structurally similar and functionally similar but are present in different species. 
* SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT: Sequence alignment is a method to examine the similarity between two amino acid sequences. This method compares all possible juxtapositions of one protein structure with another and in each case recording the number of identical residues that are aligned with one another. This comparison is made by sliding one sequence past the other sequence, one amino acid at a time, and counting the number of matched residues (different scoring methods instead of identity can be used). 
* CONSERVATIVE SUBSTITUTION: A conservative substitution replaces one amino acid with another that is similar in size and chemical properties. Such conservative amino acid substitutions may have minor effects on protein structure and can thus be tolerated without compromising function. This leads to a need to find a better way to score the similarity of sequences.
* IDENTITY MATRIX: This type of matrix scores a value of 1 for every time two amino acids or DNA base pairs align, and zero at all other times. Conservation is not taken into account. 
* SUBSTITUTION MATRIX: A substitution matrix is a large scoring guide to tell you how to rank the similarity of two amino acid sequences. A large positive score corresponds to a substitution that occurs frequently. A large negative score corresponds to a substitution that occurs rarely.
* DIVERGENT EVOLUTION: In divergent evolution two similar aspects of an organism or the organisms themselves arise from a common ancestor or origin.
* CONVERGENT EVOLUTION: In convergent evolution two proteins for example that evolved independently may have converged on a similar structure to perform a similar biochemical activity. The structure for example may have been an effective solution to a biochemical problem that both species faced. The process of different evolutionary pathways that lead to the same solution is convergent evolution. For example, both birds and insects have wings but they do not share a common ancestor.
* EVOLUTIONARY TREES: Evolutionary trees are descriptive pictures in the form of a branching tree to show divergence and inheritance from a common ancestor.
* COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY: Combinatorial chemistry is the process of producing large populations of molecules en masse and selecting between them for a particular biochemical property. First you generate a diverse population, second you select members based on a certain criterion, and third reproduce the selected members to enrich the population for even better members of the population that will fulfill the criterion even better. This method is evolution in vitro or in a laboratory, and typically utilizes PCR and affinity chromatography, which is incredibly useful for better understanding molecular evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structural Biochemistry Enzyme Terms ==
* ENZYME: Enzymes are the catalysts of biological systems and are remarkable molecular devices that determine the patterns of chemical transformations. Nearly all known enzymes are proteins, have great catalytic power, and high specificity for the transition state. Enzymes do not change the thermodynamics of a reaction they just accelerate the reactions or adjust the kinetics. 
* SUBSTRATE: Enzymes are highly specific both in the type of reaction they can catalyze and in their choice of reactants. The reactants that enzymes bind with are called substrates.
* COFACTOR: Often times the catalytic activity of an enzyme is due to the presence of small molecules called cofactors. Cofactors are divided into two groups: 1) metal ions and 2) small organic molecules like vitamins called coenzymes.
* APOENZYME: An enzyme that requires a cofactor and is currently lacking its cofactor is called an apoenzyme.
* HOLOENZYME: An enzyme that is catalytically active is called a holoenzyme if that enzyme is a complete apoenzyme plus its needed cofactor. 
* COENZYME: Coenzymes are a type of cofactor and are small organic molecules like vitamins that can be either tightly or loosely bound to an enzyme. Tightly bound coenzymes are called prosthetic groups.
* PROSTHETIC GROUP: Prosthetic groups are coenzymes that are tightly bound to an enzyme. 
* TRANSITION STATE: The transition state of a chemical reaction is the intermediate stage between a substrate or reactant and the product. The transition state has a higher free energy that the initial substrate stage and the final product stage.
* FREE ENERGY OF ACTIVATION: The rate of a reaction depends on the free energy of activation or delta G of the transition state, which largely unrelated to the normal delta G of a reaction. The enzyme will help to lower this free energy of activation by helping to stabilize the transition state thereby increasing the rate of the reaction and the likelihood that products will form. 
* FREE ENERGY: Free energy is given the symbol G. The free energy difference or delta G is the determinate of whether a reaction will proceed spontaneously or will require an input of free energy to drive the reaction to completion. If delta G is negative the reaction is exergonic and spontaneous. If delta D is positive the reaction endergonic and will not proceed spontaneously. 
* ACTIVE SITE: The active site of an enzyme is the region that binds the substrate or substrates and the cofactor if present. It also contains the residues that directly participate in the making and breaking of bonds. The residues of the active site are called the catalytic groups. The active site is typically a cleft or crevice, takes up a relatively small part of the total volume of the enzyme, have unique microenvironments, and bind to substrates with weak interactions.
* INDUCED FIT: Induced fit is where the active site on an enzyme will assume a shape that is complementary to that of the substrate only after the substrate is bound. This is a dynamic recognition and is contrary to the key and lock model of enzyme-substrate binding. 
* SEQUENTIAL REACTION: In a sequential reaction all the substrates must bind to the enzyme before any product is released. Sequential reactions come in two types: 1) ordered, where the substrates bind to the enzyme in a defined sequence, and 2) random, where the order of the substrates binding and the order of the products released does not matter as long as all substrates bind before any product is released.
* KINETICS: The study of the rates of chemical reactions is called kinetics and the specific study of the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions is called enzyme kinetics. 
* DOUBLE-DISPLACEMENT REACTION: In the double displacement reaction or ping-pong reaction, one or more of the products are released before all the substrates bind to the enzyme. The key feature in a double displacement reaction is the existence of a substituted enzyme intermediate, in which the enzyme is temporarily modified.
* ALLOSTERIC ENZYME: Allosteric enzymes consist of multiple subunits and multiple active sites and do not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Allosteric enzymes instead display sigmoidal plots of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration. An example of an allosteric enzyme is hemoglobin, where the subunits act cooperatively.
* COMPETITIVE INHIBITION: Competitive inhibition is a type of reversible inhibition where an enzyme can either bind to the substrate like normal or bind to the inhibitor but cannot bind to both the substrate and the inhibitor. A competitive inhibitor diminishes the rate of catalysis by reducing the proportion of enzyme molecules bound to a substrate. This type of inhibition does not affect the rate of reaction, so the V-max does not change. However, the K-m of the reaction increases because the inhibitor is competing with the substrate for the active site. A competitive inhibitor can be overcome with an increased concentration of substrate in the system.
* UNCOMPETITIVE INHIBITION: An uncompetitive inhibitor is distinguished by the fact that the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex. After the inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, it greatly lengthens the time it takes for catalysis to occur. As a result, V-max decreases. Since the inhibitor will only bind to the enzyme-substrate complex, the K-m actually decreases. 
* NONCOMPETITIVE INHIBITION: A type of inhibition where the inhibitor binds to a site that is not the active site of an enzyme. After binding to the enzyme, the inhibitor causes a conformational change in the enzyme, hampering its ability to perform catalysis. Because of this, the V-max of the reaction decreases. Since the inhibitor does not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, K-m remains unchanged. 
* MIXED INHIBITION: In mixed inhibition a more complex pattern of inhibition is utilized where a single inhibitor both hinders the binding of a substrate and decreases the turnover number of the enzyme.
* Lock and Key – A mechanism used to explain enzymatic activity. It states that each enzyme has a shape that matches a particular substrate and that the fit is similar to that of a lock and a key. In this mechanism, the enzyme does not change shape. This mechanism has proven to be INCORRECT.
* Michaelis-Menten – A model of enzyme kinetics that specifically describes the rates of irreversible enzymatic reactions. It only applies for the steady-state phase of reactions.
* K-m – The Michaelis constant. It is also known as the affinity constant because it describes the affinity of an enzymatic active site for its substrate. The lower the affinity constant, the greater the affinity an enzyme has for its substrate. 
* Feedback inhibition – A type of inhibition in which a product of an enzymatic pathway inhibits the first enzyme of that pathway.
* Cooperative activity of active sites – A property that allows the state of one active site to affect the state of all the other active sites in an enzyme. For example, in a cooperative enzyme, the binding of substrate to one active site will make all of the other active sites more likely to bind to substrates.
* R-state – One of two states that enzymes may have. This is called the relaxed state because the active sites of the enzyme have a great affinity for their substrate.
* T-state – One of two states that enzymes may have. This is called the tense state because the active sites of the enzyme have a low affinity for their substrate.
* Isoenzymes – Isoenzymes are two enzymes that have different amino acid sequences yet perform the same function.
* Burst Phase – The burst phase of a reaction occurs near the beginning of the reaction. At this time, there is no product and a great amount of enzyme and substrate. The rate of reaction at this point is very great and Michaelis-Menten kinetics does not apply to this phase.
* Steady-State Phase – The second phase of a reaction where there is a measurable amount of product. At this point, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be applied.
*Activation Engery- A threshold that must be crossed in order to facilitate a chemical reaction. here are three ways to reach the activation energy: by raising the temperture of the system, increasing the concentration of reactions, or by using an enzyme or catalyst.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==
This function calculates the Weighted Global Probability (WGP) cost function for precipitation
occurrence. This error is supposed to be due to a misclassification (i.e., the elements should be classified according to sequence cl.check, while they are in practice allocated to the clusters according to the sequence cl.proj).

== Usage ==
WGP(cl.check, cl.proj, DataS.check)

== Arguments ==
:* cl.check Reference sequence (i.e., numerical vector) of clusters.

:* cl.proj Sequence of clusters in practice.

:* DataS.check Precipitation data time series

== Details ==
For details about this cost function, see the reference below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Classifiers are some of the most common data analysis tools. There are a lot of implemented techniques, but we may point SVM (Support Vector Machine) as one of the most powerful, especially in high-dimension data. The most well known SVM algorithm was created by Vladimir Vapnik. &lt;ref name=svm&gt;Corinna Cortes and V. Vapnik, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 1995.http://www.springerlink.com/content/k238jx04hm87j80g/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The standard SVM implementation SVM takes a input dataset and, for each given input, predicts which of two possible classes the input set belongs to. That's most common use the algorithm to predict if the input belongs to certain dichotomy, or not. Because of this characteristic, SVM is a called a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

On Machine Learning-based algorithms such as SVM, the input data has to be separated on two sets: a training set
and a test set. The difference between the training and the test set is that, on the training the examples' classes are known beforehand. The test set contains the examples that should have their classes predicted. Given a set of training examples, an SVM algorithm builds a model that predicts what are the categories of the test set's examples.

Representing the examples in a d-dimension space, the model built by the algorithm is a hyper-plan that separates the examples belonging to the dichotomy from the ones that aren't. New examples are then mapped into that space so we can predict the categories they belong, based on the side of the gap it falls on.

The technique described here is a variation of the standard SVM using penalty functions. The technique is implemented on the R-package called penalized SVM, that has smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), 'L1-norm', 'Elastic Net' ('L1-norm' and'L2-norm') and 'Elastic SCAD' (SCAD and 'L2-norm') as available penalties.

== Technique/Algorithm ==

=== Algorithm === 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\quad \; \text{Given a training dataset }(x_1,y_1),...,(x_n,y_n),\text{ where }x_i\text{ is a }d\text{-tuple of the }d\text{ input}\\&amp;\text{parameters }i\text{, and }y_i\in -1, 1\text{ where }y_1=1\text{ means }i\text{ belongs to the dichotomy, and }y_i=-1,\\&amp;\text{the opposite. The SVM divides the space by a linear boundary:}\\\\&amp;\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ f(x)=\begin{matrix}\sum_{j=1}^d w_jh_j+b\end{matrix}\\ \\&amp;\quad\ \;\text{where }w=(w_1,...,w_d)\text{ are the coefficients of the hyper-plan and }b\text{ denotes the in-}\\&amp;\text{tercept of the hyperplane. The output for an example from the test set }x_test\text{ would be}\\ &amp;y_test=sign[f(x_test)].\text{ So, the example belongs to the dichotomy if }f(x_test)&gt;0.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the best model to classify new examples is, as a matter of fact, similar to the problem of finding the optimal hyperplane. The quality of a model built by the algorithm is measured by the margin of its hyperplane. The margin is the distance between the hyperplanes wx+b = 1 and wx+b = -1,being so that the closest points to wx+b = 0, in each side of that hyperplane are crossed by the other two hyperplanes. The best hyperplanes are those with the biggest margins.

The problem of finding the optimal hyperplane with maximal margin is solved by convex optimization. Maximizing the margin can be achieved by solving:

&lt;math&gt;\min_{b,w} \sum \left[1-y_if\left(x_i\right)\right]_++\operatorname{pen}_\lambda\left(w\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The term

&lt;math&gt;pen_\lambda(w)=\lambda\begin{Vmatrix} w \end{Vmatrix}^2_2&lt;/math&gt;

for SVM implementation has the form of L2 norm ('ridge penalty'). This penalty causes the reduction of the coefficients, but not always to values greater than zero.

The quality of a model can also be measured by the error computed for the predictions on the training set. A low prediction is required, but reducing it to zero may cause a problem know as over fitting. This means that the model built classifies very well the examples on training set, but is not appropriate to classify the ones on the test set. The predictions made in this case, would usually be wrong for the new examples.

Not only the low prediction defines a model's quality. It is possible to improve it further by identifying covariates that plays important roles on discrimination and assessing their contribution to the classifier. This can be achieved by applying a feature selection method.

Feature selection methods are divided into two classes: filter and wrapper methods&lt;ref name =&quot;featureselection&quot;&gt; Blum A and Langley P, Selection of relevant features and examples in machine
learning. Artif. Intell. 1997;97:245-271.&lt;/ref&gt;. Filter methods drop irrelevant features before the model is built by the algorithm. Wrapper methods increases the prediction power by providing the selection within the optimization procedure.

The R package 'penalizedSVM'  provides some feature selection methods. One of them is the wrapper feature selection SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation). SCAD is a non-convex penalty function first proposed by Fan &lt;ref name=&quot;SCAD&quot;&gt;Fan J.,Comments on ‘Wavelets in Statistics: A Review’ by A. Antoniadis. and J. Italian Stat.Assoc. 1997;6:131-138. &lt;/ref&gt; and discussed in &lt;ref name=&quot;SCAD2&quot;&gt;Fan J.,Comments on ‘Wavelets in Statistics: A Review’ by A. Antoniadis. and J. Italian Stat.Assoc. 1997;6:131-138.&lt;/ref&gt;.On &lt;ref name=&quot;SVMSCAD&quot;&gt;Zhang HH, et al,Gene selection using support vector machines with nonconvex penalty.Bioinformatics 2006;22:88-95.&lt;/ref&gt; SVM is combined with SCAD for feature selection. The penalization term for SCAD SVM has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;pen_\lambda(w) = \textstyle \sum_{j=1}^d p_\lambda(w_j)&lt;/math&gt;

where the SCAD penalty function for each coefficient wj is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\lambda(w_j)=\begin{cases} \lambda\left\vert w_j\right\vert &amp; \text{if }\left\vert w_j\right\vert \le \lambda \\ -\frac{\left\vert w_j\right\vert^2-2a\alpha\left\vert w_j\right\vert+\lambda^2}{2(a-1)} &amp; \text{if }\left\vert w_j\right\vert \le a\lambda \\ \frac{a+1/\lambda^2}{2} &amp; \text{if }\left\vert w_j\right\vert &gt; a\lambda \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
 
with tuning parameters a &gt; 2 (in the package, a = 3.7) and λ &gt; 0. pλ (w) corresponds to a quadratic spline function with knots at λ and aλ.

For small coefficients, the SCAD has the same behavior as the L1. For large coefficients, however, the SCAD applies a constant penalty, in contrast to the L1 penalty, which increases linearly as the coefficient increases. This absolute maximum of the SCAD penalty, which is independent from the input data, decreases the possible bias for estimating large coefficients.

=== Implementation ===

The package described in this section is &lt;i&gt;penalizedSVM&lt;/i&gt;. This package provides feature selection SVM using penalty functions. The smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), 'L1-norm', 'Elastic Net' ('L1-norm' and 'L2-norm') and 'Elastic SCAD'(SCAD and 'L2-norm') penalties are available. The tuning parameters can be found using either a fixed grid or a interval search.

This package has several dependencies. The packages that need to be installed and theirs descriptions are listed below:

=== View ===
To visualize the result of the algorithm, you can use the function show, as exampled above.

== Case Study ==
In this section, we illustrate a case study with penalizedSVM:

=== Scenario ===

The objective is to tell if a picture belongs to the same category of another one selected previously. For that purpose, we use the difference between the values of those characteristics. The attributes for the data used as input represents the difference from the value of the characteristic in the picture selected and the ones we want to classify.

=== Dataset ===
The training set and the test set were generated using the commands shown below:
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; train&lt;-sim.data(n = 200, ng = 100, nsg = 10, corr=FALSE, seed=seed )
&gt; print(str(train))
List of 3
 $ x   : num [1:100, 1:200] -0.5605 2.1988 -0.0736 1.074 0.3563 ...

  ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:200] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ...
 $ seed: num 123

&gt; test&lt;-sim.data(n =20, ng = 100, nsg = 10, corr=FALSE, seed=seed+1 )
&gt; print(str(test))
List of 3
 $ x   : num [1:100, 1:20] -1.3851 -1.1036 -0.2677 0.2836 -0.0951 ...
  ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2
  .. ..$ : chr [1:100] &quot;pos1&quot; &quot;pos2&quot; &quot;pos3&quot; &quot;pos4&quot; ...
  .. ..$ : chr [1:20] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ...
 $ y   : Named num [1:20] -1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -1 ...
  ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:20] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ...
 $ seed: num 124
NULL
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Execution ===
To build the model, the following command were used:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; bounds=t(data.frame(log2lambda1=c(-10, 10)))
&gt;colnames(bounds)&lt;-c(&quot;lower&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;)
# computation intensive; for demostration reasons only for the first 100 features
# and only for 10 Iterations maxIter=10, default maxIter=700
&gt;system.time( scad&lt;- svm.fs(t(train$x)[,1:100], y=train$y, fs.method=&quot;scad&quot;, bounds=bounds,
+ cross.outer= 0, grid.search = &quot;interval&quot;, maxIter = 10,
+ inner.val.method = &quot;cv&quot;, cross.inner= 5, maxevals=500,
+ seed=seed, parms.coding = &quot;log2&quot;, show=&quot;none&quot;, verbose=FALSE ) )
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Acoustics}}


==Definition==
Streaming is a term to describe a steady time-averaged mass-flux density or velocity induced by oscillating acoustic waves in a fluid. Large amplitude sound propagation in a fluid may result in a steady motion of the fluid. This nonlinear phenomenon is known as acoustic streaming and may be theoretically described by quadratic convective terms in the governing equations of the fluid flow.

==Applications==
Acoustic streaming may be effective in enhancement of convective heat transfer, ultrasonic cleaning of contaminated surfaces, localized micro-mixing, development of micro-actuators such as micro-manipulators for small particles and micro-pumps for liquids.[[Engineering_Acoustics/Acoustic_Micro_Pumps]]

==Axial and transverse components of the streaming velocity==
Here, the velocity characteristics obtained from the analytical solution of the linear wave equation are presented. The amplitude of the axial component of the acoustic velocity field in the linear case is given as,


&lt;math&gt; (1)\   u=u_{max}sin(2\pi x/\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;


where ''u&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. The axial component ''(u&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and the transverse component ''(v&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;)'' of the streaming velocity field are,


&lt;math&gt; (2)\  u_{st}=\frac{3}{8}\frac{u_{max}^2}{c}(1-\frac{2y^2}{(H/2)^2})sin(\pi x/l)&lt;/math&gt;

==Different types of acoustic streaming==
There exist several ways to classify streaming.

''A first classification of streaming is based on the mechanism by which streaming is generated.''&lt;ref&gt;Greg Swift,&quot;Thermoacoustics: A unifying perspective for some engines and refrigerators&quot;, Condensed Matter and thermal Physics Group,Los Alamos National Laboratory, Forth edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Boundary-layer driven streaming:''' Flow driven by viscous stresses on boundaries and caused by boundary layer effects between a solid and a fluid. Boundary-layer driven streaming consists of two types of streaming which occur always together: outer and inner boundary-layer streaming.
##'''Outer boundary-layer streaming:''' Rayleigh analysed acoustic streaming when a standing wave is present between parallel plates and explained that the air motion is caused by a nonlinear second order effect. Rayleigh focussed his investigations on mean flows outside the boundary layer and his approach became since then the analytical tool for the study of acoustic streaming.&lt;ref&gt;S. Boluriaan, P. J. Morris,&quot;Acoustic streaming: from Rayleigh to today&quot;, International Journal of Aeroacoustics, 2 (3-4): 255-292, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
##'''Inner boundary-layer streaming:''' The study of inner boundary layer streaming was developed by Schlichting, who investigated an incompressible oscillating flow over a flat plate and calculated the two-dimensional streaming field inside the boundary layer. Figure 1 shows the inner and outer streaming in a channel. The length of such a cell is a quarter of the wave length.[[Image:Inner and outer streaming.jpg|center|380px|thumb|Figure 1: Schematic diagram of inner and outer streaming cells]]
# '''Jet driven streaming:''' Periodic suction and ejection of a viscous fluid through an orifice or a change in cross section. The mechanism relies on the fact that a viscous fluid behaves quite differently during the suction and ejection periods. During the suction period the flow comes from all kind of directions, whilst during the ejection period a jet is produced. In Figure 2, the outflow and inflow patterns at the transition between a small tube and open space are shown. These two outflows can be regarded as the superposition of a broadly distributed oscillating flow and a time-averaged toroidal circulation.[[Image:Inflow and outflow patterns.jpg|center|480px|thumb|Figure 2: Outflow and inflow patterns]]
#'''Gedeon streaming:''' Associated with travelling wave, as opposed to a standing wave as for the previous example. In boundary layer and jet driven streaming, there is no net mass transport. In travelling wave streaming, a non-zero net mass transport occurs due to the phase between the acoustic velocity and density. Travelling wave streaming in Stirling thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators is called Gedeon streaming or DC flow.
#'''Eckart streaming:''' Eckart streaming or 'quartz wind' is generated by the dissipation of acoustic energy in the fluid. Although Eckart was not the first to observe &quot;quartz wind&quot;, he was the first one who gave a mathematical analyses for it in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;O. V. Rudenko, S. I. Soluyan,&quot;Theoretical foundations of nonlinear acoustics&quot;, Consultants Bureau, New York and London, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;


Figure 3 shows the schematic of Gedeon, Rayleigh and Jet-driven streaming.

[[Image:gedeon, rayleigh streaming.jpg|center|480px|thumb|Figure 3: Gedeon, Rayleigh and jet-driven streaming]]


''The second classification is based on the relative magnitude of the acoustic wavelength to the characteristic length of induced vortical structures.''
# '''Fine scale:''' For the inner boundary-layer streaming (Schlichting streaming), the boundary-layer thickness is equal to the width of the vortices. So, it is part of the fine scale classification.
# '''Comparable scale:''' For outer boundary-layer streaming (Rayleigh streaming) and jet driven streaming, the wavelength and the vortex size are comparable.
# '''Large scale:''' Eckart streaming belongs to the large scale classification because the vortex length scale exceeds the acoustic wavelength.


''The third classification is based on the magnitude of the streaming velocity.'' 
# '''Slow streaming:''' Slow streaming is when the streaming velocity is considerably smaller than the magnitude of the fluid velocity. In fact, streaming can be characterized by an appropriate Reynolds number, Re&lt;sub&gt;NL&lt;/sub&gt;, which compares inertia and viscosity and determines the degree to which the streaming velocity field is distorted. The case Re&lt;sub&gt;NL&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;&lt;1 corresponds to the slow streaming.&lt;ref&gt;S. Moreau, H. Bailliet, J. Valiere,&quot;Measurements of inner and outer streaming vortices in a standing waveguide using laser doppler velocimetry&quot;, Journal of Acoustical Society of America, 123 (2): 640-647, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Fast streaming:''' Fast streaming is when the streaming velocity and fluid velocity are of the same magnitude. The case Re&lt;sub&gt;NL&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&gt;1 is referred to fast streaming or nonlinear streaming. Most types of acoustic streaming are slow, only the jet driven streaming is considered as fast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">FactoMineR is a [http://www.r-project.org/ R] package dedicated to multivariate data analysis. The main features of this package is the possibility to take into account diﬀerent types of variables (quantitative or categorical), diﬀerent types of structure on the data (a partition on the variables, a hierarchy on the variables, a partition on the individuals) and ﬁnally supplementary information (supplementary individuals and variables).  Moreover, the dimensions issued from the diﬀerent exploratory data analyses can be automatically described by quantitative and/or categorical variables. Numerous graphics are also available with various options. Finally, a graphical user interface is implemented within the Rcmdr environment in order to propose a user friendly package.

==Methods==
The methods implemented in this package are conceptually similar with respect to its main goal, for example, merge and simplify the data by reducing the dimensionality of the data set. These methods are used depending on what data are available and if the variables are quantitative (Numerous) or qualitative (categorical or nominal).

Several methods are implemented, the most classical (PCA, Correspondence Analysis, Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Multiple Factor Analysis) as well as some advanced methods (Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis, Mixed Data Analysis, Dual Multiple Factor Analysis).

For the classical ones we have the following situation-use solutions:
* Principal component analysis (PCA) when individuals are described by quantitative variables;
* Correspondence analysis (CA) when individuals are described by two categorical variables that leads to a contingency table; 
* Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) when individuals are described by categorical variables.

And for the advanced methods:
* MFA (Multiple Factorial Analysis), for which the variables of a same group may be numerical or categorical.
* HMFA (Hierarchical Multiple Factorial Analysis), an extension of MFA for which variables are structured according to a hierarchy.
* GPA (Generalized Procustean Analysis), for which variables must be continuous.


Let X be the data table of interest. In order to reduce the dimensionality, X is transformed to a new coordinate system by an orthogonal linear transformation. Let F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (resp. G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ) denotes the vector of the coordinates of the rows (resp. columns) on the axis of rank s. Those two vectors are related by the so called “transition formulae”. In the case of PCA, they can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;F_s(i) = \frac{1}{\lambda_s} \sum_{k}^{} x_{ik} m_k G_s(k) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_s(i) = \frac{1}{\lambda_s} \sum_{k}^{} x_{ik} p_k F_s(k) &lt;/math&gt;

where F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (i) denotes the coordinate of the individual i on the axis s, G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (k) the coordinate of the variable k on the axis s, λ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; the eigenvalue associated with the axis s, m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; the weight associated to the variable k, p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; the weight associated to the individual i, x&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt; the general term of the data table (row i, column k).

The transition formulae lay the foundation of our point of view and consequently set the graphical outputs at the roots of our practice. From these formulae it is crucial to analyze the scatter plots of the individuals and of the variables conjointly: an individual is at the same side as the variables for which it takes high values, and at the opposite side of the variables for which it takes low values.

===Supplementary elements===

Another important feature of the transition formulae is that they can be applied to supplementary individuals and/or variables in order to add supplementary information on the scatter plots for a better understanding of the data. In the PCA framework, let i' be a new individual, its coordinate on the axis of rank s can be easily obtained as followed: 

:&lt;math&gt;F_s(i') = \frac{1}{\lambda_s} \sum_{k}^{} x_{i'k} m_k G_s(k) &lt;/math&gt;

In the same manner, it is also easy to calculate the coordinate of a supplementary variable when the former is quantitative; in this case the supplementary variable lies in the scatter plot of the variables. When the variable is categorical, its modalities are represented by the way of a “mean individual” per modality. For each modality, the values associated with each “mean individual” are the means of each variable over the individuals endowed with this modality; in this case the supplementary variable lies in the scatter plot of the individuals.

==Implementation==
===Installation===
Load FactoMineR in your R session by writing the following line code:
     library(FactoMineR)

to Download the graphical interface of FactoMineR in your R session write the following line code (you have to be connected to internet): 
     source(&quot;http://factominer.free.fr/install-facto.r&quot;)

===Loading and using===

Load FactoMineR for each new R session by typing the following line code: 
     library(FactoMineR)

Or load FactoMineR and its GUI for each new R session by typing the following line code: 
     library(Rcmdr)

===Functions Reference===
A complete implementation reference of all fifty FactoMineR functions, with description, usage, arguments and values, can be foud [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/FactoMineR.pdf here]

==Visualization==
With the function plot, you can draw graphs and results.
Usage:
     R&gt; plot(&lt;method&gt;,&lt;what variable to color individuals from&gt;)
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Principal-correspondence-analysis-ind-small.png|Decathlon data - available with the package documentation) : supplementary variables are in blue
File:Coord-ellipses.PNG|Individuals graph (Decathlon data -  - available with the package documentation): individuals are colored from the athletics meeting
&lt;/gallery&gt;

With the graphical interface of FactoMineR, you can perform easily and intuitive tasks.
As an example, we have the interface for the PCA function:
The main window allows to choose the active variables (by default all the variables are active and the PCA can be performed). Several buttons allow to choose the supplementary quantitative or categorical variables, the supplementary individuals, the outputs to be displayed or the graphs to be plotted.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Example==

As an example, we use here a data set issued from a questionnaire about French women's work in 1974. You can load the data set [http://factominer.free.fr/classical-methods/datasets/women_work.txt here].

===Presentation of the data===

1724 women have answered several questions about women's work among which:

    * What do you think the perfect family is ?
          o Both husband and wife work
          o Husband works more than wife
          o Only husband works
    * Which activity is the best for a mother when children go to school?
          o Stay at home
          o Part-time work
          o Full-time work
    * What do you think of the following sentence: women who do not work feel cut off from the world?
          o Totally agree
          o Quite agree
          o Quite disagree
          o Totally disagree

The data set is two contingency tables which cross the answers of the first question with the two others.
To each crossing, the value given is the number of women who gave both answers. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Women work.PNG
&lt;/gallery&gt;

To load the package and the data set, write the following line code: 
     library(FactoMineR) 
     women_work=read.table(&quot;http://factominer.free.fr/classical-methods/datasets/women_work.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep=&quot;\t&quot;)

===Objectives===

The objectives of CA are quite the same as PCA's: to get a typology of rows and columns and to study the link between these two typologies.
However, the concept of similarity between rows or columns is different. Here, similarity between two rows or two columns is completely symmetric. Two rows (resp. columns) will be close to each other if they associate with the columns (resp. rows) in the same way.

We are looking for the rows (resp. columns) whose distribution is the most different from the population's. The ones which look the most or the less alike.
Each group of rows (resp. columns) is characterized by the columns (resp. rows) to which it is too much or to little associated.

===CA===
We are going to use the first three columns (corresponding to the answers to the second question) as active variables and the four last ones (corresponding to the third question) as supplementary variables. 

;Active rows and columns only

To see the scatterplots of rows and columns separately, type:
     res.ca.rows = CA(women_work[,1:3], invisible=&quot;col&quot;)
     res.ca.col = CA(women_work[,1:3], invisible=&quot;row&quot;) 

     #women_work: the data set used
     #invisible: elements we do not want to be plotted

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Correspondence-analysis-columns.PNG
File:Correspondence-analysis-rows.PNG
&lt;/gallery&gt;

On the scatterplot of the columns, we can see that the first axis opposes &quot;Stay at home&quot; and &quot;Full-time work&quot;, which means it opposes two women's profiles.
Women who answered &quot;Stay at home&quot; answered &quot;Only husband works&quot; more often than the population and &quot;Both husband and wife work&quot; less often than the population.
In the same way, women who answered &quot;Full-time work&quot; answered &quot;Only husband works&quot; less often than the population and &quot;Both husband and wife work&quot; more often than the population. The first axis orders the categories of the second question from the less to the most in favour of women's work.

We can make the same interpretation for the first axis of the row's scatterplot. The categories are sorted from the less (&quot;Only husband works&quot;) to the most (&quot;Both husband and wife work&quot;) in favour of women's work.

To have the representation of both rows and columns, type: 
     res.ca = CA(women_work[,1:3]) 
     #women_work: the data set used

&quot;Stay at home&quot; is much associated with &quot;Only husband works&quot; and little associated to the two other categories.

&quot;Both husband and wife work&quot; is associated with &quot;Full-time work&quot; and opposed to &quot;Stay at home&quot;.

;Addition of supplementary columns

We now add the columns corresponding to the third question as supplementary variables. Type: 
     res.ca = CA(women_work, col.sup=4:ncol(women_work)) 
     #women_work: the data set used
     #col.sup: vector of the indexes of the supplementary columns

&quot;Totally agree&quot; and &quot;Quite agree&quot; for &quot;Women who do not work feel cut off from the world&quot; are close to categories in favour of women's work.
&quot;Quite disagree&quot; and &quot;Totally &quot;disagree&quot; are close to categories opposed to women's work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

Cluster analysis, the organization of patterns into clusters based on similarity (or dissimilarity) measures, is an unsupervised technique widely applied to a broad range of disciplines. It has many applications in data mining, as large data sets need to be partitioned into smaller and homogeneous groups. Clustering techniques have a wide use, such as artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, economics, biology and marketing. Clustering techniques are important, and its importance increases as the amount of data and processing power of computers increases.

= clues: Nonparametric Clustering Based on Local Shrinking =

The R package clues aims to provide an estimate of the number of clusters and, at the same time, obtain a partition of data set via local shrinking. The shrinking procedure in clues is done by the mean-shift algorithm. It is also influenced by the K-nearest neighbor approach, not using kernel functions. The value K starts with a small number and increases gradually until the measure of strength, CH Index or Silhouette Index, is optimized. A major contribution of the CLUES algorithm is its ability to identify and deal with irregular elements. To help validation of the quality of the number of clusters and the clustering algorithm, five indices are available to support decision making.

== Algorithm ==

CLUES (CLUstEring based on local Shrinking) algorithm has three procedures:

# Shinking
# Partition
# Determination of optimal K

== Shrinking ==
For the shrinking procedure, the data set is calibrated in a way that pushes each data point towards its focal point, the cluster center or mode of the probability density function. The number K is chosen iteratively and, due to the robustness of the median, each data point moves to the element-wise median of the set. This median consists of its K nearest neighbors according to dissimilarity measures, either Euclidean distance or Pearson Correlation.

For this process, a stopping rule needs to be set by the user, beyond which excess iterations will not be significant in terms of accuracy. The mutual gaps in data are apparent after this shrinking procedure.

== Partitioning ==
The partition procedure uses the calibrated data obtained from shrinking. This data is used in place of the original data set. The partitioning starts by picking one arbitrary data point and replacing  it by its nearest fellow point, recording their distance. The same move is applied to this fellow point. The selection is without replacement. Once a data point is picked for replacement, it is not picked again in that run. To separate the groups, the summation of the mean distance and 1:5 times the intequartile range is introduced. Each new fellow surpass move creates a new group, with a incremented group index.

== Optimal K ==
Optimal K calculation involves optimizing the strength measure index, either CH Index or Silhouette Index. A factor ''f'' is introduced to improve the speed of computation. This factor is, by default, 0.05. Users may modify this factor, but must be aware of the large computation time associated with large factors. The choice of K has little effect on clustering result as long as it lies in a neighborhood of the optimal K. The factor 0.05 is chosen to minimize additional computation that will not substantially affect the outcome.

To strengthen the power of the calculation, we initialize K to be fn and set the size of increment K to be fn for the next iterations. We then use the calibrated data form the previous step as the new data.

= Example =

We will show an example of how to run clues using the Maronna data set. This set has 4 slightly overlapped clusters in the two-dimensional space. Each cluster contains 50 data points. The Maronna data is a simulated data set. The data are drawn from 4 bivariate normal distributions with identity covariance matrix and mean vectors μ = {(0,0), (4,0), (1,6), (5,7)}.

&lt;pre&gt;
R &gt; data(Maronna)
R &gt; maronna &lt;- Maronna$maronna
R &gt; res &lt;- clues
R &gt; res &lt;- clues(maronna, quiet = TRUE) # run clues
&lt;/pre&gt;

The results are shown below
&lt;pre&gt;
R &gt; summary(res)

Number of data points:
[1] 200

Number of variables:
[1] 2

Number of clusters:
[1] 4

Cluster sizes:

Strength method:
[1] &quot;sil&quot;

avg Silhouette:

&lt;/pre&gt;

Plotting the results, we can see, in figure 1, the four clusters found by the clues algorithm.

== Proposing new deletion process ==

I thought this up on the bus today. Basically it is a temperary deletion process which (hopefully) helps WB clean up its low-quality pages quicker. I know this is the kind of proposals the always end with no consensus; I'm just proposing on the off-chance that this gets community support.

Basically, my idea is like this:

If a book
*Has not been developed for three years (edits like anti-vandalism, adding {{tl|status}}, or removing deprecated classifications do not count)
*Has a TOC
**Which is incomplete
***AND only a module or two are partly written
**Which is complete
***AND most modules are not written; the ones that are written are incomplete
*Does not have any sort of introduction whatsoever that states the direction of book development

Then it can be put through a new deletion process. The proposer tags the book, and after 7D it gets listed at a cat. An admin, who did NOT propose the deletion, comes over and checks whether the book fits the criteria. If it does, (s)he deletes the page immediately.

I know this idea is kinda 'undeveloped', so suggestion and criticism from Wikibookians is needed to shape the proposal. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 09:58, 20 October 2010 (UTC)

:Oppose. One of our primary tasks is it is to provide and preserve any valid contribution of content in a reusable form even if the content isn't useful for a Wikibook, we should strive to find it a home. This is why our deletion policy protects stubs. The only reason to delete a stub is already covered on our policy, having no intrinsic value or the existence of a better replacement.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:27, 20 October 2010 (UTC)

::I am only proposing a way to delete books without meaningful content and which future contributors cannot improve on more quickly. Like [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Actuarial_Science|this discussion]], which was unanimous delete.

:::That project could have been improved, it provided some information. In that particular case I chose not to oppose the deletion because the content was easily reconstructed. I see that sort of RfDs as a null actions, not beneficial (as space is not an argument and the content is not in fact &quot;deleted&quot;) but also not detrimental to our project unless people start to lose valid time discussing the gray line that defines what a stub is... (Some of the characteristics you list can include valid content.)

You are describing a process that already exists. It is called &quot;[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions|speedy deletions]]&quot;. You tag a page or book with {{tlx|delete}} and it is added to [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. Any administrator can look over the work and immediately delete the work if the criteria are met. Anyone can turn a speedy deletion into a requests for deletion nomination though if there are questions or objections. Some of your past nominations at requests for deletion would of met the speedy deletions criteria for example. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:30, 20 October 2010 (UTC)
:Er... i guess so? But I don't believe books with a full TOC can be CSDed? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 09:23, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

:I sort of like your idea, but without supporting the idea of deletion... yes, I know, that makes no sense. I wish I knew how casual users (readers of books, not contributors) used Wikibooks. I would like to think they go to the main page and head to the bookshelves they are interested in, and think &quot;ah, good a book on WWII, just what I wanted to read&quot;. This way they would only come across, say, books that were at least 50% complete. This, incidentally, is why I prefer bookshelves to subjects as books appear in subjects even if they are stubs which doesn't present WB in a good light to someone who has come to read a book. I think it is more likely though that the casual reader uses the search box and therefore is likely to get presented with a selection of incomplete books, stubs, pages that aren't part of any book (we have loads of single page &quot;books&quot;) and so on. Basically a sub-standard Wikipedia. Chances are they never find our good and featured books and go away never to return. I would love some kind of way of &quot;hiding&quot; the work in progress from the casual reader which didn't involve deletion. Obviously we still want links to work in progress so the reader can become a contributor, but keep it to one side so it doesn't clutter the more complete work. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 11:37, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

::You said &quot;books appear in subjects even if they are stubs which doesn't present WB in a good light&quot;.  However, maybe you've not taken a look at the subjects lately?  The {{tl|status}} template I've been subjectively applying works with the subject pages to push more complete books to the top of those pages.  The ability to indicate completion status was one of the last few desires some people had before they were comfortable with the idea of discarding bookshelves completely. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:41, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

:::No, you are right I hadn't been to look recently... it's certainly much better, well worth all the effort you've put in, thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:28, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

:::: If you really want to hide books that are just getting started, you could customize the subject page.  A bit off topic about the deletion proposal, but if want to customize the subject page (which I hope to do someday with [[Subject:Mathematics]]) then you could hide the 0% (and possibly the 25%) books into a type of incubation page (I imagine a subpage of the given subject) that would be linked from the subject page but would not be the first list of books a random person sees.  Assuming that people are entering through the subject pages.  But much like you I often wonder how (if?) people find the books they are looking for.  I still wish there was a way that books could automatically link back to their subject pages, so people might realize we have other books on the subject they are looking at.

::::: I would recommend a [[w:Wikipedia:Pure wiki deletion system|pure wiki deletion]] system for something like this.  There is little need to hide the historical revisions of the page from future editors.   [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 15:55, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

::::: It's not usable for all books, but for books that are being developed by classes and don't rigidly follow the traditional formatting of Wikibooks books, I will sometimes only place them in [[:Category:Class projects]] until the class is done and/or the book has been finalized/cleaned up.  Then a relevant subject category is added later. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:09, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

I came across [[w:WP:PROD|WP:PROD]] (proposed deletion) and it sounds like Kayau's original proposal is similar to this.  Anyone following this discussion would be well advised to read this linked page for background information.  Currently the {{tl|query}} tag is occasionally used like this for those in-between cases, but for new pages only rather than any. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:44, 5 November 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, that process would work well here I think (I used to do the Proposed Deletion patrol at WP). It makes it clear, unlike Query, that the page is being considered for deletion and if the Prod is contested, that it'll go to RFD. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:24, 5 November 2010 (UTC)

:Actually there are several query templates, and they are by no means restricted to new pages, but you are right they do serve as the in-between cases. I believe we were thinking/looking at WP:PROD when trying to figure out how to deal with the in-between cases to begin with, but wanted to keep it minimalistic, simplistic, expandable, and allow it to better fit our particular needs. It was felt that the whole WP:PROD process was a bit too much and something similar was unlikely to have consensus here, without introducing something like it slowly where people could chose to use the templates if they wanted to and where the idea would either be adopted or sink without needing to get consensus on an exact process for it immediately. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:06, 5 November 2010 (UTC)
:The idea was to allow a PROD-like process to develop naturally on its own. If people thought it was a good idea, started using the templates, and felt there was a need to define the process than a proposal would develop naturally on its own. In the past when people have tried to propose new policies they have usually failed to gain consensus, and some of that was felt might be due to being done before having developed a need for it naturally. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:11, 5 November 2010 (UTC)
== [[Template:BookCat]] ==

Would it be correct to always replace &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with {{Tl|BookCat}} (example {{diff|text=edit|1967215}})? If it's desirable I could do it. A quick count of the last dump shows this wikitext being used &gt;6k times in the main namespace. Relatedly, is there a way to automatically determine (sub)pages that don't have said wikitext but should use the template anyways (as was mentioned [[WB:Requests for permissions/CarsracBot|here]])? --[[User:Bequw|Bequw]] ([[User talk:Bequw|talk]]) 15:11, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

:That used to be added to pages before standardizing on {{tl|BookCat}}.  It's nothing urgent to worry about as it performs the same thing as the template on mainspace pages. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:40, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

::Regarding the second question:  if a subpage (i.e., non-top-level page) in mainspace is uncategorized and not a redirect, I can't &amp;mdash;off hand&amp;mdash; think of any reason it wouldn't be right to add {{tl|BookCat}} to it.  The &quot;uncategorized&quot; part of that is needed, though, because there ''are'' some pages in mainspace that legitimately use customized means to achieve categorization effects that cannot be achieved by an explicit call to {{tl|BookCat}} (either because a different categorization is needed, or because the call to {{tl|BookCat}} needs to be indirect).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:07, 6 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Notes:'''
# When visiting Galaxies outside of the Milky Way, boosting brightness can improve your view of distant Galaxies, while within the Milky Way, lowering the brightness can improve your view of stars, planets, moons etc..
# Galaxy brightness will also respond to setting the faintest visible magnitude of stars, using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/CEL command setfaintestautomag45deg|setfaintestautomag45deg]] or [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/CEL command setvisibilitylimit|setvisibilitylimit]] commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> 
The fear of oppression by a tyrannical government is a reoccurring theme throughout the history of civilization. While it is easy to criticize foreign incidences (e.g., Nazi Germany, Socialist Italy, and Soviet Russia) due to the extremity with which their governments acted to limit the rights of their people, we often overlook the ways in which our own government has restricted some of our basic legal rights. The monitoring of voice communication through the electronic &quot;tapping&quot; of telephone lines is of particular interest, as it becomes the central point of discussion. Wiretapping has been conducted since the advent of the telephone in the late 19th century, and was ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court in 1928. Although the 1928 court case declared that wiretapping does not violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unwarranted searches and seizures, it clearly provides the government with the means to secretly monitor the populace. This same privilege is not given to the public; the Federal Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.A. 151 et seq.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000151----000-notes.html |title=United States Code: Title 47,151. Purposes of chapter; Federal Communications Commission created | LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits private citizens from intercepting and disseminating communications. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the impact that audio and video recording technology has on the the relationship between law enforcement officials and the public.

==Case Studies ==
==== Rodney King ====

Perhaps the most iconic individual associated with police brutality, the brutal beating of [[w: Rodney King | Rodney King]] serves as a macabre reminder of the deeply rooted racism that pervades some facets of American Society. In March of 1991, [[w:Rodney King| King]] and two intoxicated passengers were pursued by California State Troopers along Interstate 210. The pursuit led into a residential district, where local Los Angeles Police Officers arrived at the scene and cornered King's vehicle. The passengers were arrested without incident, but King's alleged aggressive movements towards the officers prompted a physical confrontation. King was tasered and momentarily rendered impotent. The altercation quickly digressed into a brutal beating, of which four LAPD officers took part.
The details of the incident would be largely unknown and soon forgotten if it had not been for the video shot by George Holliday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingvideo.html |title=The Holliday Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt; from his hotel window. Without sound, the true nature of the altercation is difficult to discern. Regardless, the video captures the unwarranted use of force against a perpetrator who clearly does not pose a threat. The video was continuously aired on a local TV station. The officers were deposed, but the predominantly white jury acquitted all but one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0429.html#article |title=Los Angeles Policemen Acquitted In Taped Beating}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The resulting cultural backlash was nothing short of cataclysmic. Enraged Los Angeles citizens took to the streets in the [[w: 1992 Los Angeles riots | 1992 L.A. Riots]] which resulted in 54 deaths and more than 2000 injuries. 

==== Simon Glik ====
[[File:Police vs Cameras.png|thumb|Police vs Cameras]]
On October 1, 2007, Simon Glik was walking through the Boston Common in downtown Boston when he became a witness to a drug arrest. When he saw three officers removing a plastic bag from a teenager's mouth, he mistakenly believed they were using excessive force and pulled out his cell phone to record the incident. After leaning on the officers to get a better angle and placing the phone into their peripheral vision the officers thought Simon Glik had a gun. Officers asked Simon Glik to continue doing what he was doing at a distance but after not moving away at the officers request, Officers approached him and placed him under arrest for several charges. One of which was for illegal wiretapping and seized the phone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclum.org/news/20100201.php |title=ACLU of Massachusetts: Simon Glik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/special_reports/could-making-a-cell-phone-video-get-you-arrested-20100721 |title=Could Making a Cell Phone Video Get You Arrested?}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

This arrest, like many similar cases, is based on the Massachusetts wiretapping law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 99 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter272/Section99 |title=Massechusetts Wiretapping Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Created in 1968, the law was written to protect the privacy of citizens from government officials and private detectives. This law has been commonly used to cloak police activity since the law was upheld in a case between a citizen and an officer. Michael Hyde was pulled over during a routine traffic stop when he started a hidden audio recording. The officer accused him of having drugs, searched Hyde and his passenger, and threatened jail time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.suffolk.edu/highlights/stuorgs/lawreview/documents/Skehill_Note_Final.pdf |title=Cloaking Police Misconduct in Privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hyde wanted to file harassment charges and brought the tape to the police station; instead he was arrested under Massachusetts' wiretap law. The Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld that it was illegal to record an on-duty officer, even in public, if the recording was made secretly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ma-supreme-judicial-court/1330122.html |title=Commonwealth v. Hyde}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Fortunately for Simon Glik, the charges against him were dropped in municipal court. Judge Summerville determined the recording was not made surreptitiously and therefore did not violate the Massachusetts wiretapping law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1071161&amp;srvc=rss |title=Charges against Simon Glik dropped}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that the wiretap law has been used by police to cover their activities even in public space. With the progression and ubiquity of audio recording technology, power has shifted away from police officers as they have come under constant scrutiny by the public eye. Their prevalent use of wiretap laws demonstrate that they are unhappy with this shift.

==== Anthony Graber ====
On March 5, 2010, Anthony Graber rode down Interstate 95 in Maryland on his motorcycle.  On his helmet was a mounted camera to record his ride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK5bMSyJCsg |title=Anthonry Graber Helmet-Cam Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The video from the helmet-cam shows Mr. Graber reaching speeds of upwards of 120 m.p.h. and popping wheelies in traffic.  As Mr. Graber exits I-95 and approaches a stop signal, a gray sedan pulls in front of him.  A man gets out of the sedan with handgun drawn shouting, “Get off the motorcycle!”  It is not until the man reaches Mr. Graber’s motorcycle that he identifies himself as police officer.

Anthony Graber left the scene with not only a reckless driving ticket but also a complete audio/video account of his arrest thanks to his helmet-cam.  On April 8, 2010, a month after posting this video on YouTube, Mr. Graber was arrested and charged with the felony of violating Maryland’s Wiretap Law.  Four computers from his home were seized and Mr. Graber spent 26 hours in prison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/15/AR2010061505556.html |title=Traffic stop video on YouTube sparks debate on police use of Md. wiretap laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He was put on trial with a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison.  Charges against Mr. Graber were later dismissed by Judge Emory Plitt stating, 
“Those of us who are public officials and are entrusted with the power of the state are ultimately accountable to the public. When we exercise that power in public fora, we should not expect our actions to be shielded from public observation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu-md.org/aPress/Press2010/092710_Graber.html |title=Wrongful Charges Dismissed Against Motorcyclist Prosecuted for Videotaping Encounter with Police}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;

== Social Perspectives and Impact ==
==== YouTube Effect ====
Even with the advent of cellphone cameras and pocket-sized camcorders, recording technologies would not have a significant impact if the public could not view the recordings.  As YouTube gained prominence however, information dissemination was changed forever.  In the post Cold War era, the media coined the term the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_effect#cite_note-livingston-0 ‘CNN Effect’] to describe how twenty-four hour news channels would change the conduct of nations’ foreign policy.  The belief was that this new type of “saturation coverage” would increase how meticulously news was dissected and judged.

However, the ‘CNN Effect’ pales in comparison to the modern day ‘YouTube Effect’.  No matter how many news teams are patrolling the streets for a story, they will never be as omnipresent as the general public with camera phones and camcorders.   Any civilian with such technologies can capture a newsworthy moment on film and post it on YouTube.  65,000 new videos are posted on YouTube every day&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/20/opinion/oe-naim20 |title=The 'YouTube' Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  With 34 million monthly visitors to YouTube&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, it is no wonder why videos and information can spread like wildfire.

The Anthony Graber example emphasizes the high impact factor of YouTube on social interactions.  YouTube enabled Mr. Graber to share his video with millions of visitors.  It is this traffic density that police are concerned with when considering their public image.  Even if an officer is following the correct protocol, in the eyes of an untrained civilian, any force may be considered excessive.  Thus videos on YouTube can be fuel for groups such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCITE!_Women_of_Color_Against_Violence INCITE!], EFAPO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EFAPO/ |title=Empowered Families Against Police Oppression}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or other community groups critical of police force.

==== Public Right's Groups ====
===== Photography Is Not A Crime =====
Carlos Miller is the founder of the blog “Photography Is Not A Crime”&lt;ref name=&quot;check&quot;&gt;[http://www.pixiq.com/contributors/248 &quot;Photography is Not a Crime&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The objectives of the blog are to educate amateur photographers on their legal rights and how to handle law enforcement objections to photography.

===== Copwatch Organizations =====
[[w:Copwatch | Copwatch]] organizations provide the public with searchable accounts of complaints filed against police officers. These groups also advocate the observation and documentation of police activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;check&quot;&gt;[http://www.copwatch.org/ &quot;Copwatch&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police Rights and Protection ====
While public oversight of officers is critical to preventing and reprimanding police brutality, there is fear that complete freedom for citizens to record officers can have very serious negative implications. The [[w:Fraternal Order of Police| Fraternal Order of Police]] (FOP) is the largest police union with over 325,000 members &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fop.net/ |title=Fraternal Order of Police}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The executive director of the FOP, Jim Pasco, warns that video may be edited, taken out of context, or otherwise manipulated to make officers' actions appear to be misconduct&lt;ref name=&quot;check&quot;&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2010/08/09/police-officers-dont-check-the/1 &quot;Police Officers Don't Check Their Civil Rights at the Station House Door&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;. He fears that there is no accountability for what is done to or with the videos captured by citizens. Pasco also warns of another very serious side effect, 
&quot;It has had a chilling effect on some officers who are now afraid to act for fear of retribution by video.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scrutiny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-10-15-1Avideocops15_CV_N.htm |title=For cops, citizen videos bring increased scrutiny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officials are instructed to follow a [[w: Use of force continuum | strict protocol]] for the use of force during an altercation. However, the officer's instinctual motive for self-preservation often overrides the learned standard. Faced with the anticipation of a life-threatening situation, the officer may employ excessive force to prevent an escalation of the altercation. To an observer, this may appear to be a blatant abuse of power. Constant oversight by the public can lead to officers utilizing less severe tactics and putting themselves in more dangerous scenarios. Adding additional pressures to officers' line of work should be avoided; their environment is already uncontrollable and often hostile. Some analysts believe that the continued use and spread of police activity footage will only serve to undermine police power and the public's belief in law enforcement&lt;ref name=&quot;scrutiny&quot;
 /&gt;. Regardless of opinion, it is clear that new technology has had an enormous effect on how law enforcement interacts with the public. For example, many departments are now training officers to expect to be recorded at all times&lt;ref name=&quot;scrutiny&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Justice Institute of British Columbia is Canada's largest public educator facility, with more than 150 new officers graduating from their police academy every year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jibc.ca/aboutJIBC/quickFacts.htm |title=Institute of Justice of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several officers-in-training responded to the video of the [[Lentis/Recording_Police_Activity#Anthony_Graber|Anthony Graber]] arrest on the Institute's [[w: Facebook|Facebook]] page. Macfarlane says, &quot;...video taping anything takes people out of their element and can easily distract someone from the task at hand. For a job as serious as policing its crucial that distractions be left out of a job that is already dangerous enough.&quot; Trainee Lee opines, &quot;It usually reveals one side of the story... An example might be an officer trying to apprehend a criminal using the skills that was taught but deemed excessive use of force to the general public because they do not know what the procedures and protocols are and interpret it as police brutality.&quot; Gill states, &quot;I feel videotaping police officers should be illegal because not only does it violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; it also obstructs justice, and entertains and informs the society for the wrong reasons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ja-jp.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=158440389998&amp;topic=16155 |title=Facebook of JIBC: Videotaping Police}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other trainees share the same sentiments on videotaping police; it is evident that there are strong feelings against videotaping on duty officers for their safety and continued public trust.

== Conclusion ==
The advent of mobile recording devices has fundamentally altered the relationship between law enforcement officials and the public. The legality of the issue rests upon individual state's wiretapping laws. Although such recordings provide oversight of law enforcement officers, the widespread dissemination of altered or otherwise bias accounts can result in catastrophic social backlash.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

The Kohonen Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM or SOM) is a clustering and data visualization technique based on a neural network viewpoint. As with other types of centroid-based clustering, the goal of SOM is to find a set of centroids (reference or codebook vector in SOM terminology) and to assign each object in the data set to the centroid that provides the best approximation of that object. In neural network terminology, there is one neuron associated with each centroid &lt;ref name=Pang2005&gt; Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach and Vipin Kumar. ''Introduction to Data Mining''. Addison Wesley; US ed edition. May 12, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;.

As with incremental K-means, data objects are processed one at a time and the closest centroid is updated. Unlike K-means, SOM impose a topographic ordering on the centroids and nearby centroids are also updated. The processing of points continues until some predetermined limit is reached or the centroids are not changing very much. The final output of the SOM technique is a set of centroids that implicitly define clusters. Each cluster consist of the points closest to a particular centroid &lt;ref name=Pang2005 /&gt;.

SOM is a clustering  technique that enforces neighborhood relationships on the resulting cluster centroids. Because of this, clusters that are neighbors are more related to one another than clusters that are not. Such relationships facilitate the interpretation and visualization of the clustering results. Indeed, this aspect of SOM has been exploited in many areas, such as visualizing Web documents or gene array data&lt;ref name=Pang2005 /&gt;.

= Algorithm =

A distinguishing feature of SOM is that it imposes a topographic(spacial) organization on the centroids (neurons). Figure 1 shows an example of a two-dimensional SOM in which the centroids are represented by nodes that are organized in a rectangular lattice. Each centroid is assigned a pair of coordinates(i,j). Sometimes, such a network is drawn with links between adjacent nodes, but can be misleading because the influence of one centroid on another is via a neighborhood that is defined in terms of coordinates, not links. There are many types of SOM neural networks, but it will be focus on to two-dimensional SOMs with a rectangular or hexagonal organization of the centroids.&lt;ref name=Pang2005 /&gt;

[[File:som neural network.png]]

''Figure 1: Two-dimensional 3-by-3 rectangular SOM neural network &lt;ref name=Pang2005 /&gt;.''

Even though SOM is similar to ''K-means'', there is a fundamental difference. Centroids used in SOM have a predetermined topographic ordering relationship. During the training process, SOM uses each data point to update the closest centroid and centroids that are nearby in the topographic ordering. In this way, SOM produces an ordered set of centroids for any given data set. In other words, the centroids that are close to each other in the SOM grid are more closely related to each other than to the centroids that are farther away. Because of this constraint, the centroids of a two-dimensional SOM can be viewed as lying on a two-dimensional surface that tries to fit the n-dimensional data as well as possible. The SOM centroids can also be thought of as the result of a nonlinear regression with respect to the data points.
At a high level, clustering using the SOM technique consists of the steps described in Algorithm below&lt;ref name=Pang2005 /&gt;:

 1: Initialize the centroids.
 2: '''repeat'''
 3:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Select the next object.
 4:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Determine the closest centroid to the object.
 5:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Update this centroid and the centroids that are close, i.e., in a specified neighborhood.
 6: '''until''' The centroids don't change much or a threshold is exceeded.
 7: Assign each object to its closest centroid and return the centroids and clusters.


= Implementation =

For [http://www.r-project.org/ R] (R Development Core Team 2007), three packages are available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([http://CRAN.R-project.org/ CRAN]) implementing standard SOMs &lt;ref name=Mullen2010&gt;Katharine Mullen and Ron Wehrens.''CRAN Task View: Chemometrics and Computational Physics''.2010-11-02. URL [http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ChemPhys.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The ''kohonen'' package implements self-organizing maps as well as some extensions for supervised pattern recognition and data fusion. 
* The ''som'' package provides functions for self-organizing maps.
* The ''wccsom'' package SOM networks for comparing patterns with peak shifts.
   
For this discussion the focus is on the ''kohonen'' package because it gives SOM standards features and order extensions.  The R package ''kohonen'' provides functions for self-organizing maps. It also provides two extensions that allow the use of SOMs for classification and regression tasks as well as data mining tasks. It specifically emphasizes visualisation. The basic functions are: '''som''' for the usual unsupervised form of self-organizing maps; '''xyf''' for supervised self-organizing maps and X-Y fused maps, which are useful when additional information in the form of, e.g., a class variable is available for all objects; '''bdk''', an alternative formulation called bi-directional Kohonen maps; and finally, from version 2.0.0 on, the generalisation of the '''xyf''' maps to more than two layers of information, in the function '''supersom'''. These functions can be used to define the mapping of the objects in the training set to the units of the map &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007&gt; Ron Wehrens and Lutgarde M. C. Buydens. ''Self- and super-organizing maps in r: The kohonen package''. Journal of Statistical Software, 21(5):1-19, 10 2007. URL [http://www.cran.r-project.org/].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several data sets are included in the kohonen package: the wine data from the [http://kdd.ics.uci.edu UCI Machine Learning Repository]&lt;ref name=Frank2010&gt;Frank, A. &amp; Asuncion, A. (2010). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt;, near-infrared spectra from ternary mixtures of ethanol, water and iso-propanol, measured at different temperatures described by Wülfert et al. (1998) &lt;ref name=Kok1998&gt;Wülfert F, Kok WT, Smilde AK (1998). ''Influence of Temperature on Vibration Spectra and Consequences for Multivariate Models''. Analytical Chemistry, 70, 1761–1767.&lt;/ref&gt;, and finally a set of microarray data, the yeast data from Spellman et al. (1998)&lt;ref name=Spellman1998 &gt;Spellman PT, Sherlock G, Zhang MQ, Iyer VR, Anders K, Eisen MB, Brown PO, Botstein D, Futcher B (1998). ''Comprehensive Identification of Cell Cycle-regulated Genes of the Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae by Microarray Hybridization''. Molecular Biology of the Cell, 9, 3273–3297.&lt;/ref&gt;. The wine data set contains information on a set of 177 Italian wine samples from three different grape cultivars; thirteen variables (such as concentrations of alcohol and flavonoids, but also color hue) have been measured. The yeast data are a subset of the original set containing 6178 genes, which are assumed to be related to the yeast cell cycle. The set contains 800 genes for which, using six different synchronization methods, time-dependent expressions have been measured &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

The different types of self-organizing maps can be obtained by calling the functions '''som''', '''xyf''', '''bdk''', or '''supersom''', with the appropriate data representation as the first argument(s). Several other arguments provide additional parameters, such as the map size, the number of iterations, etcetera. The object that is returned can then be used for inspection, plotting, mapping, and prediction.  Below we will show the functions available in the package.  Visualization functions will be discussed at Visualization topic &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

* '''&quot;mapping&quot;:'''  shows where objects are mapped. It needs the &quot;classif&quot; argument, and a &quot;labels&quot; or &quot;pchs&quot; argument.
* '''&quot;property&quot;:'''  properties of each unit can be calculated and shown in colour code. It can be used to visualise the similarity of one particular object to all units in the map, to show the mean similarity of all units and the objects mapped to them, etcetera. The parameter property contains the numerical values. 
* '''&quot;quality&quot;:'''  shows the mean distance of objects mapped to a unit to the codebook vector of that unit. The smaller the distances, the better the objects are represented by the codebook vectors.

= Case Study =
In this section, we illustrate a case study using package Kohonen.

== Scenario ==
The standard form of self-organizing maps is implemented in function som. To map the 177-sample wine data set to a map of five-by-four hexagonally oriented units, the som function can be used. First, we load the package (from now on, we assume the package is loaded), and then the data, which are subsequently autoscaled because of the widely different ranges (especially the proline concentration, variable 13, deviates). The fourteenth variable is a class variable and is not used in the mapping; it will be used later for visualisation purposes &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;. 

== Input data ==
As the input data we use de dataset wine that are included in the kohonen package.  The dataset containing 177 rows and thirteen columns; object vintages contains the class labels. For compatibility with older versions of the package, variable wine.classes is retained, too. These data are the results of chemical analyses of wines grown in the same region in Italy (Piedmont) but derived from three different cultivars: Nebbiolo, Barberas and Grignolino grapes. The wine from the Nebbiolo grape is called Barolo. The data contain the quantities of several constituents found in each of the three types of wines, as well as some spectroscopic variables &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

== Execution ==
The following  code can be use to create the map from the dataset. Note that first of all, you have to load the package and then load the dataset.

 &gt; library(&quot;kohonen&quot;)
 Loading required package: class
 &gt; data(&quot;wines&quot;)
 &gt; wines.sc &lt;- scale(wines)
 &gt; set.seed(7)
 &gt; wine.som &lt;- som(data = wines.sc, grid = somgrid(5, 4, &quot;hexagonal&quot;))
 &gt; plot(wine.som, main = &quot;Wine data&quot;)

== Output ==
The result is shown in Figure 9. The codebook vectors are visualized in a segments plot, which is the default plotting type. High alcohol levels, for example, are associated with wine samples projected in the bottom right corner of the map, while color intensity is largest in
the bottom left corner &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

[[File:Plot wine data.png]]

''Figure 9: A plot of the codebook vectors of the 5-by-4 mapping of the wine data &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.''

== Analysis ==
The result of the training, the wine.som object, is a list. The most important element is the codes element, which contains the codebook vectors as rows. Another element worth inspecting is changes, a vector indicating the size of the adaptions to the codebook vectors during training. This can be used to assess whether the number of iterations is sufficient &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

== Extra ==
An example using the NIR data included in the package is shown below: for every ternary mixture, we have a nearinfrared spectrum, as well as concentrations of the three chemical compounds (summing to 1). Moreover, every sample is measured at five different temperatures. The aim in the example below is to model the water content (the second of the three concentrations). Of the three chemicals, water has the largest effect on the NIR spectra. We start by loading the data and attaching the data frame so that objects spectra, composition and temperature become directly available. Parameter xweight indicates how much importance is given to X; here it is set to 0.5 (X and Y are equally important), also the default value in xyf &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

 &gt; data(&quot;nir&quot;)
 &gt; attach(nir)
 &gt; set.seed(13)
 &gt; nir.xyf &lt;- xyf(data = spectra, Y = composition[,2], xweight = 0.5, grid = somgrid(6, 6, &quot;hexagonal&quot;))
 &gt; par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
 &gt; plot(nir.xyf, type = &quot;counts&quot;, main = &quot;NIR data: counts&quot;)
 &gt; plot(nir.xyf, type = &quot;quality&quot;, main = &quot;NIR data: mapping quality&quot;)

This leads to the output shown in Figure 4. In the left plot, the background color of a unit corresponds to the number of samples mapped to that particular unit; they are reasonably spread out over the map. Four of the units are empty: no samples have been mapped to them. The right plot shows the mean distance of objects, mapped to a particular unit, to the codebook vector of that unit. A good mapping should show small distances everywhere in the map &lt;ref name=Wehrens2007/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ferritin is the cell’s storage compartment for iron. It is a protein that is found in all organisms from plants and animals to bacteria and archaea. Ferritin is present mainly in the cytoplasm of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow in mammals. The amount of ferritin within a cell varies depending on the cell’s function. [[File:Ferritin.jpg|thumb|Ferritin molecule with 3-fold and 4-fold intersections]]
&lt;br /&gt;
A molecule of ferritin protein is comprised of 24-peptide subunits. The subunits are either catalytically active H subunits or the catalytically inactive and specific to mammals, L subunits. The 24-peptide subunits form a hollow spherical shell that encases a core of iron. Channels, or small openings which allows the transportation of certain ions or molecules in and out of the ferritin protein, are formed at the intersections of the subunits. 
The intersection of three-peptide subunits forms a three-fold channel. This channel is lined with the polar amino acids, Aspartate and Glutamate. The polarity allows favorable interactions with the iron ion and water, and thus serves as the passageway for iron to enter and leave the ferritin protein. The intersection of four-peptide subunits forms a four-fold channel. It is lined with Leucine amino acids making it a non-polar passageway. Although it is unable to serve as a passageway for the transport of iron ions, it is thought to be the site of electron transport which plays a role in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the vice versa oxidation. The reduction and oxidation of Fe is important because it dictates whether the Fe will be stored in the ferritin protein or release into the cell. 

&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Cross_Cut_Ferritin.jpg|thumb|Cross-cut view of ferritin showing the iron lattice core]]
The protein molecular weight is about 445,000 and up to 4,300 atoms of Fe can be stored in the iron core. The iron is stored as ferrihydrite phosphate, [(Fe(O)(OH)8(FeOPO3H2).xH2PO4] in a crystalline solid lattice. It is known from tracer experiments that all the oxygen atoms in the ferrihydrite are derived from water, rather than O2. The lattice structure prevents the Fe (III) atoms from becoming soluble and exiting the ferritin shell. Reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) allows the iron atoms to break away from the lattice in order to be released from the ferritin. A water cage forms around the Fe(II) ion as the positively charged Fe2+ ion attracts the electronegative oxygen in H2O. The polarity of the three-fold channels allows the soluble iron to pass through the channel, thus releases the iron from the ferritin. 
&lt;br /&gt;
==Regulation==
Ferritin synthesis decreases when low iron levels are present. Conversely when high iron levels are present, ferritin synthesis increases. The interaction between RNA binding proteins and the iron responsive element (IRE) region of mRNA regulates this process. Ferritin synthesis is inhibited when the two RNA proteins bind to the “stem-loop” structure of the IRE and inhibit mRNA translation. The binding proteins are called iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). IRP1 is regulated by the presence or scarcity of iron. When there is a scarcity of iron, IRP1 has an open configuration and is able to bind to the IRE loop and repress translation. IRP2 is regulated by its degradation in the presence of iron surplus. IRP2 is present when there is no iron, so it is able to inhibit translation. When iron is present in abundance, IRP2 degrades and ferritin synthesis can take place. The ratios of IRP1 and IRP2 are tissue specific. For example. IRP1 is more dominant in the liver, kidney, intestine, and brain tissues whereas IRP2 is more abundant in pituitary and pro-B-lymphocytic cell line. 
&lt;br /&gt;
==Transferrin &amp; Mini-ferritin (Dps)==
Other iron proteins, include transferrins and mini-ferritins. Transferrins serve to transport iron as Fe(III) in the blood and other fluids. One of these has iron bound as Fe(III) by two tyrosine phenoxy groups, an aspartic acid carboxyl group, a histidine imidazole, and either HCO3- or CO32-. Mini-ferritins Dps (DNA protection during starvation) proteins are present in bacteria and archaea. They are made with 12 subunits and function oppositely from ferritin. Rather than using dioxygen to concentrate iron like ferritin, mini-ferritin usues iron to detoxify dioxide and peroxide. This process protects the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the availability of large-scale computing platforms for high-fidelity design and simulations, and instrumentation for gathering scientific as well 
as business data, increased emphasis is being placed on efficient techniques for analyzing large and extremely high-dimensional data sets. These data 
sets may comprise discrete attributes, such as those from business processes, information retrieval, and bioinformatics, as well as continuous 
attributes such as those in scientific simulations, astrophysical measurements, and engineering design.

Analysis of high-dimensional data typically takes the form of extracting correlations between data items, discovering meaningful information in data, 
clustering data items, and finding efficient representations for clustered data, classification, and event association. Since the volume (and 
dimensionality) of data is typically large, the emphasis of new algorithms must be on efficiency and scalability to large data sets. 

== Technique/Algorithm ==

In this section, we focus on  Proximus. The intended area of application is the compression of high-dimensional binary data into representative 
patterns. For instance, purchase incidence (market basket data) or term-document matrices may be preprocessed by Proximus for later association rule mining. In the next subsection, we give a brief explanation of how the algorithm works.

=== Algorithm === 

The Proximus algorithm cluster the rows of a logical matrix. The compression rate of the algorithm can be influenced by the choice of the maximum cluster radius and the minimum cluster size.

The algorithm is of a recursive partitioning type. Specifically, at each step a binary split is attempted using a local rank-one approximation of the current submatrix (row set). That is a specialization of principal components to binary data which represents a matrix as the outer product of two binary vectors. The node expansion stops if a submatrix is pure, i.e., the column (presence set) vector indicates all the rows and the Hamming distances from the row (dominant attribute set) pattern vector, or the size of the row set, are less than or equal the specified threshold. In the case the rank-one approximation does not result in a split but the radius constraint is violated, the matrix is split using a random row and the radius constraint.

The figure shows the recursive structure of proximus, where A represents the original data matrix. Each rectangular internal node is a rank-one approximation and two circular children of these nodes are the matrices that result from partitioning of parent matrix based on this approximation. Leaves of the recursion tree correspond to final decomposition. The overall decomposition is &lt;math&gt; A \approx XY^T&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt; X = [x_1, x_{01}, x_{00}]^T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y = [y_1, y_{01}, y_{00}]^T&lt;/math&gt;.



=== Implementation ===
Proximus is part of cba package. In this section you find more information about installing and using it on R Environment.

Type the following command in R console to install cba package

&lt;pre&gt;
install.packages(&quot;cba&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Type the following command in R console to load the package

&lt;pre&gt;
library(&quot;cba&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Proximus function, provided by the cba  package, might be used as follow

&lt;pre&gt;
proximus(x, max.radius = 2, min.size = 1, min.retry = 10, max.iter = 16, debug = FALSE) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

where arguments are:
&lt;pre&gt;
x: a logical matrix. 
max.radius: the maximum number of bits a member in a row set may deviate from its dominant pattern. 
min.size: the minimum split size of a row set. 
min.retry: number of retries to split a pure rank-one approximation (translates into a resampling rate). 
max.iter: the maximum number of iterations for finding a local rank-one approximation. 
debug: optional debugging output.
&lt;/pre&gt;

An object of class proximus with the following components:

&lt;pre&gt;
nr: the number of rows of the data matrix.
nc: the number of columns of the data matrix.
a: a list containing the approximations (patterns).
a$x: a vector of row (presence set) indexes.
a$y: a vector of column (dominant attribute set) indexes.
a$n: the number of ones in the approximated submatrix.
a$c: the absolute error reduction by the approximation.
max.radius: see arguments.
min.size: see arguments.
rownames: rownames of the data matrix.
colnames: colnames of the data matrix.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== View ===

There is one way to show the result from this algorithm. That way would be typing:

&lt;pre&gt;
summary(ProximusObject)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example ====

Here we have an example of proximus algorithm processing. The example is quite simple and gives an idea of how it works. Basically, a uniform logical matrix is generated. Then proximus does a rank-4 aproximattion of original logical matrix.

&lt;pre&gt;
x &lt;- rlbmat() 
pr &lt;- proximus(x, max.radius=8, debug=TRUE) 
op &lt;- par(mfrow=c(1,2), pty=&quot;s&quot;) 
lmplot(x, main=&quot;Data&quot;) 
box() 
lmplot(fitted(pr)$x, main=&quot;Approximation&quot;) 
box() 
par(op) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Output'''

[[File:Proximus2.jpg]]

== Case Study ==
In this section, we illustrate a case study with Proximus:

=== Scenario ===

In this section, we use PROXIMUS to cluster terms in hypothetical database to extract semantic information. It means, we want to know
what are the main subjects of documents.

Suppose there's a library with some documents and we want to divide these documents in categories. We can describe each document as a set of words
that occurs on that document.
 
=== Data ===

We represent the data as a binary term-document
matrix by mapping terms to rows and columns to
documents, so that a TRUE entry in the matrix indicates
the existence of a word in the corresponding document.

The table below shows 14 terms and 10 documents. Clearly, there are two groups of words: those that are related to computers and those that
are related to authors. The word love is isolated.

[[File:Proximus3.png]]

=== Execution ===
'''R Code''':
&lt;pre&gt;
x &lt;- matrix(scan(&quot;matriz.txt&quot;,what=logical(0),n = 14*10), 14, 10, byrow = TRUE)
pr &lt;- proximus(x, max.radius=8, debug = TRUE)
summary(pr)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Output ===

The result of clustering the matrix of terms and documents is shown below:

[[File:proximus4.png]]

=== Analysis ===

As you can see in the output, there's a table with the result of clustering. Clearly, there are three groups of words (each line).
The first group is related to computers. The second one is related to authors. The third group represents the isolated word love.
The column named size indicates how many words belongs to the same group. Proximus algorithm clustered the words as follows:
Group 1 (computers) = {intel, computer, software, linux, windows, Firefox, explorer, programming}
Group 2 (authors) = {kuth, shakespeare, grisham, asimov, book}
Group 3 (noise) = {love}

      <text xml:space="preserve">An obvious way of clustering larger datasets is to try and extend existing methods so that they can cope with a larger number of objects. The focus is on clustering large numbers of objects rather than a small number of objects in high dimensions. Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) suggested the CLARA (Clustering for Large Applications) algorithm for tackling large applications. CLARA extends their k-medoids approach for a large number of objects. It works by clustering a sample from the dataset and then assigns all objects in the dataset to these clusters.

;Technique To Be Discussed
This work is focused on CLARA, a technique for clustering largers datasets.

Table 1: Summary of symbols and definitions

CLARA (CLustering LARge Applications) relies on the sampling approach to handle large data sets. Instead of finding medoids for the entire data set, CLARA draws a small sample from the data set and applies the PAM algorithm to generate an optimal set of medoids for the sample. The quality of resulting medoids is measured by the average dissimilarity between every object in the entire data set D and the medoid of its cluster, defined as the following cost function:

&lt;math&gt;Cost(M,D) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n dissimilarity(O_i,rep(M,O_i))}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where M is a set of selected medoids, dissimilarity(Oi, Oj) is the dissimilarity between objects Oi and Oj, and rep(M, Oi) returns a medoid in M which is closest to Oi.

To alleviate sampling bias, CLARA repeats the sampling and clustering process a pre-defined number of times and subsequently selects as the final clustering result the set of medoids with the minimal cost. Assume q to be the number of samplings. The CLARA algorithm is detailed in Figure 1.

&lt;br /&gt;
Figure 1: Clara Algorithm

Since CLARA adopts a sampling approach, the quality of its clustering results depends greatly on the size of the sample. When the sample size is small, CLARA’s efficiency in clustering large data sets comes at the cost of clustering quality.

==Implementation==

In order to use the CLARA algorithm in R, one must install cluster package. This package includes a function that performs the CLARA process.

'''Install cluster package''' 
&lt;pre&gt;
install.packages(&quot;cluster&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Import Contents'''
&lt;pre&gt;
library(&quot;cluster&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The CLARA function, provided by the cluster package, might be used as follow:
&lt;pre&gt;
clara(x, k, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;, stand = FALSE, samples = 5, sampsize = min(n, 40 + 2 * k), trace = 0, medoids.x = TRUE, 
keep.data = medoids.x, rngR = FALSE)
&lt;/pre&gt;
where the arguments are:

* '''x:''' Data matrix or data frame, each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a variable. All variables must be numeric. Missing values (NAs) are allowed.
* '''k:''' Integer, the number of clusters. It is required that 0 &lt; k &lt; n where n is the number of observations (i.e., n = nrow(x)).
* '''metric:'''	Character string specifying the metric to be used for calculating dissimilarities between observations. The currently available options are &quot;euclidean&quot; and &quot;manhattan&quot;. Euclidean distances are root sum-of-squares of differences, and manhattan distances are the sum of absolute differences.
* '''stand:''' Logical, indicating if the measurements in x are standardized before calculating the dissimilarities. Measurements are standardized for each variable (column), by subtracting the variable's mean value and dividing by the variable's mean absolute deviation.
* '''samples:''' Integer, number of samples to be drawn from the dataset.
* '''sampsize:''' Integer, number of observations in each sample. sampsize should be higher than the number of clusters (k) and at most the number of observations (n = nrow(x)).
* '''trace:'''	Integer indicating a trace level for diagnostic output during the algorithm.
* '''medoids.x:''' Logical indicating if the medoids should be returned, identically to some rows of the input data x. If FALSE, keep.data must be false as well, and the medoid indices, i.e., row numbers of the medoids will still be returned (i.med component), and the algorithm saves space by needing one copy less of x.
* '''keep.data:''' Logical indicating if the (scaled if stand is true) data should be kept in the result. Setting this to FALSE saves memory (and hence time), but disables clusplot()ing of the result. Use medoids.x = FALSE to save even more memory.
* '''rngR:''' Logical indicating if R's random number generator should be used instead of the primitive clara()-builtin one. If true, this also means that each call to clara() returns a different result – though only slightly different in good situations.

==View==

There are actually two ways of viewing the result of a CLARA use. Both of them use the object of class ''clara'' returned by the function application.

The first way is to plot the object, creating a chart that represents the data. Thus, if there are N objects divided into K clusters, the chart must contain N points representing the objects, and those points must be colored in K different colors, each one representing a cluster set. For example, given the object ''clarax'', which is a result of the function ''clara'' application, all one has to do in order to plot the object is:

 plot(clarax)

The second way of viewing the result of a CLARA application is to simply print the components of the object of class ''clara''. For example, given the same object ''clarax'' of the previous example, one could print its components using:

 print(clarax)

'''Example'''

Suppose we have 500 objects and each object have two attributes (or features). Our goal is to group these objects into K=2 groups based on their two features. The function CLARA can be used to define the groups as follow:

&lt;pre&gt;
## generate 500 objects, divided into 2 clusters.
x &lt;- rbind(cbind(rnorm(200,0,8), rnorm(200,0,8)), cbind(rnorm(300,50,8), rnorm(300,50,8)))
## run clara
clarax &lt;- clara(x, 2)
clarax
clarax$clusinfo

## print components of clarax
print(clarax)

## plot clusters
plot(x, col = clarax$cluster)
## plot centers
points(clarax$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Result of printing components of ''clarax'':

===Analysis===

The implementation of CLARA generated three clusters, relatively homogeneous, consisting of 16, 14 and 20 countries. Analyzing the cluster means, we can relate each group with each of the three classes of states:

* The cluster formed by Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina has the highest Murder, Assault and Rape arests (per 100,00) and, not least, the largest population.

* The cluster formed by Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming has the intermediate Murder, Assault and Rape arests (per 100,00) and, not least, the largest population.

* The cluster formed by Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin has the lowest Murder, Assault and Rape arests (per 100,00) and, not least, the largest population.

Analyzing, based on [3], the states of the two extreme clusters (1,3) it was possible to verify that there is a reason for each country to be in these groups. California, although has a good Human Development Index and Median Personal Earnings rate, has the 3rd biggest Unemployment Rate in the USA, the 2nd is Michigan and the 1st is Nevada, two other states that are also in the cluster one. Connecticut has the highest Human Development Index and is on the cluster three. Wyoming has the best percentage of people with High School Diploma, and is on the cluster two. Others reasons can be verified checking this work together with [3].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Data Mining the task of finding frequent pattern in large databases is very important and has been studied in large scale in the past few years. Unfortunately, this task is computationally expensive, especially when a large number of patterns exist.

The FP-Growth Algorithm, proposed by Han in &lt;ref name=HanPei2000&gt; J. Han, H. Pei, and Y. Yin. Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation. In: Proc. Conf. on the Management of Data (SIGMOD’00, Dallas, TX). ACM Press, New York, NY, USA 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;, is an efficient and scalable method for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth, using an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed and crucial information about frequent patterns named frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree). In his study, Han proved that his method outperforms other popular methods for mining frequent patterns, e.g. the Apriori Algorithm &lt;ref name=Agrawal1994&gt; Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. 1994. Fast algorithms for mining association rules. In Proc. 1994 Int. Conf. Very Large Data Bases (VLDB’94), Santiago, Chile, pp. 487–499. &lt;/ref&gt; and the TreeProjection &lt;ref name=Agarwal2001&gt; Agarwal, R., Aggarwal, C., and Prasad, V.V.V. 2001.

This chapter describes the algorithm and some variations and discuss features of the R language and strategies to implement the algorithm to be used in the R. Next a briefly conclusion and future works are proposed.

==The algorithm==
The FP-Growth Algorithm is an alternative way to find frequent itemsets without using candidate generations, thus improving performance. For so much it uses a divide-and-conquer strategy &lt;ref name=Jiawei2006&gt; Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber, Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. 2nd edition, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;. The core of this method is the usage of a special data structure named frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree), which retains the itemset association information.

In simple words, this algorithm works as follows: first it compresses the input database creating an FP-tree instance to represent frequent items. After this first step it divides the compressed database into a set of conditional databases, each one associated with one frequent pattern. Finally, each such database is mined separately. Using this strategy, the FP-Growth reduces the search costs looking for short patterns recursively and then concatenating them in the long frequent patterns, offering good selectivity.

In large databases, it’s not possible to hold the FP-tree in the main memory. A strategy to cope with this problem is to firstly partition the database into a set of smaller databases (called projected databases), and then construct an FP-tree from each of these smaller databases.

The next subsections describe the FP-tree structure and FP-Growth Algorithm, finally an example is presented to make it easier to understand these concepts.

===FP-Tree structure===
The frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) is a compact structure that stores quantitative information about frequent patterns in a database &lt;ref name=Kumar2010 /&gt;.

Han defines the FP-tree as the tree structure defined below &lt;ref name=HanPei2000 /&gt;:

# One root labeled as “null” with a set of item-prefix subtrees as children, and a frequent-item-header table (presented in the left side of Figure 1);
# Each node in the item-prefix subtree consists of three fields:
:# Item-name: registers which item is represented by the node;
:# Count: the number of transactions represented by the portion of the path reaching the node;
:# Node-link: links to the next node in the FP-tree carrying the same item-name, or null if there is none.
# Each entry in the frequent-item-header table consists of two fields:
:# Item-name: as the same to the node;
:# Head of node-link: a pointer to the first node in the FP-tree carrying the item-name.

Additionally the frequent-item-header table can have the count support for an item. The Figure 1 below show an example of a FP-tree.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FPG_FIG_01.jpg|
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Figure 1: An example of an FP-tree from &lt;ref name=Jiawei2006&gt; Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber, Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. 2nd edition, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;.


The original algorithm to construct the FP-Tree defined by Han in &lt;ref name=HanPei2000 /&gt; is presented below in Algorithm 1.

'''''Algorithm 1: FP-tree construction'''''

:''Input'': A transaction database DB and a minimum support threshold ?.

:''Output'': FP-tree, the frequent-pattern tree of DB.

:''Method'': The FP-tree is constructed as follows.
:# Scan the transaction database DB once. Collect F, the set of frequent items, and the support of each frequent item. Sort F in support-descending order as FList, the list of frequent items.
:# Create the root of an FP-tree, T, and label it as “null”. For each transaction Trans in DB do the following:
::* Select the frequent items in Trans and sort them according to the order of FList. Let the sorted frequent-item list in Trans be [ p | P], where p is the first element and P is the remaining list. Call insert tree([ p | P], T ).
::* The function insert tree([ p | P], T ) is performed as follows. If T has a child N such that N.item-name = p.item-name, then increment N ’s count by 1; else create a new node N , with its count initialized to 1, its parent link linked to T , and its node-link linked to the nodes with the same item-name via the node-link structure. If P is nonempty, call insert tree(P, N ) recursively.


By using this algorithm, the FP-tree is constructed in two scans of the database. The first scan collects and sort the set of frequent items, and the second constructs the FP-Tree.

===FP-Growth Algorithm===
After constructing the FP-Tree it’s possible to mine it to find the complete set of frequent patterns. To accomplish this job, Han in &lt;ref name=HanPei2000 /&gt; presents a group of lemmas and properties, and thereafter describes the FP-Growth Algorithm as presented below in Algorithm 2.

'''Algorithm 2: FP-Growth'''

:''Input'': A database DB, represented by FP-tree constructed according to Algorithm 1, and a minimum support threshold ?.

:''Output'': The complete set of frequent patterns.

:''Method'': call FP-growth(FP-tree, null).

:Procedure FP-growth(Tree, a) {

::(01) if Tree contains a single prefix path  then // Mining single prefix-path FP-tree       {

:::(02)     let P be the single prefix-path part of Tree;

:::(03)     let Q be the multipath part with the top branching node replaced by a null root;

:::(04)     for each combination (denoted as ß) of the nodes in the path P do

:::(05)        generate pattern ß ∪ a with support = minimum support of nodes in ß;

:::(06)     let freq pattern set(P) be the set of patterns so generated; 

::       }

::(07) else let Q be Tree;

::(08) for each item ai in Q do { // Mining multipath FP-tree

:::(09)     generate pattern ß = ai ∪ a with support = ai .support;

:::(10)     construct ß’s conditional pattern-base and then ß’s conditional FP-tree Tree ß;

:::(11)    if Tree ß ≠ Ø then

::::(12)        call FP-growth(Tree ß , ß);

:::(13)    let  freq pattern set(Q) be the set of patterns so generated; 

::        }

::(14) return(freq pattern set(P) ∪ freq pattern set(Q) ∪ (freq pattern set(P) × freq pattern set(Q)))

:}


When the FP-tree contains a single prefix-path, the complete set of frequent patterns can be generated in three parts: the single prefix-path P, the multipath Q, and their combinations (lines 01 to 03 and 14). The resulting patterns for a single prefix path are the enumerations of its subpaths that have the minimum support (lines 04 to 06). Thereafter, the multipath Q is defined (line 03 or 07) and the resulting patterns from it are processed (lines 08 to 13). Finally, in line 14 the combined results are returned as the frequent patterns found.

===An example===
This section presents a simple example to illustrate how the previous algorithm works. The original example can be viewed in &lt;ref name=ZakiMeira&gt; M. Zaki and W. Meira Jr. Fundamentals of Data Mining Algorithms, Cambridge, 2010 (to be published) &lt;/ref&gt;.

Consider the transactions below and the minimum support as 3:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! i(t)
|-
| 1|| ABDE
|-
| 2|| BCE
|-
| 3|| ABDE
|-
| 4|| ABCE
|-
| 5|| ABCDE
|-
| 6|| BCD
|}


To build the FP-Tree, frequent items support are first calculated and sorted in decreasing order resulting in the following list: { B(6), E(5), A(4), C(4), D(4) }. Thereafter, the FP-Tree is iteratively constructed for each transaction, using the sorted list of items as shown in Figure 2.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FPG_FIG_02A.jpg|(a) Transaction 1: BEAD
File:FPG_FIG_02B.jpg|(b) Transaction 2: BEC
File:FPG_FIG_02C.jpg|(c) Transaction 3: BEAD
File:FPG_FIG_02D.jpg|(d) Transaction 4: BEAC
File:FPG_FIG_02E.jpg|(e) Transaction 5: BEACD
File:FPG_FIG_02F.jpg|(f) Transaction 6: BCD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Figure 2: Constructing the FP-Tree iteratively.


As presented in Figure 3, the initial call to FP-Growth uses the FP-Tree obtained from the Algorithm 1, presented in Figure 2 (f), to process the projected trees in recursive calls to get the frequent patterns in the transactions presented before.

Using a depth-first strategy the projected trees are determined to items D, C, A, E and B, respectively. First the projected tree for D is recursively processed, projecting trees for DA, DE and DB. In a similar manner the remaining items are processed. At the end of process the frequent itemset is: { DAE, DAEB, DAB,  DEB, CE, CEB, CB, AE, AEB, AB, EB }.

==FP-Growth Algorithm Variations==
As mentioned before, the popularity and efficiency of FP-Growth Algorithm contributes with many studies that propose variations to improve its performance &lt;ref name=CorneliaRobert /&gt; &lt;ref name=BonchiGoethals2004 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Moyaid /&gt; &lt;ref name=Gao2007 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Grahne2005&gt; Grahne, G. , &amp; Zhu, J. Fast Algorithm for frequent Itemset Mining Using FP-Trees. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineer,Vol.17,NO.10, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Gao2007 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Cornelia2003 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Bonchi2003 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Balazes2004 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Grahne2004 /&gt;. In this section some of them are briefly described.

===DynFP-Growth Algorithm===
The DynFP-Growth &lt;ref name=Cornelia2003 /&gt; &lt;ref name=CorneliaRobert /&gt;, has focused in improving the FP-Tree algorithm construction based on two observed problems:

# The resulting FP-tree is not unique for the same “logical” database;
# The process needs two complete scans of the database.

To solve the first problem Gyorödi C., et al. &lt;ref name=Cornelia2003 /&gt; proposes the usage of a support descending order together with a lexicographic order, ensuring in this way the uniqueness of the resulting FP-tree for different “logically equivalent” databases. To solve the second problem they proposed devising  a  dynamic  FP-tree  reordering  algorithm,  and  employing  this algorithm  whenever  a  “promotion”  to  a  higher  order  of  at  least  one  item  is detected.

An important feature in this approach is that it’s not necessary to rebuild the FP-Tree when the actual database is updated. It’s only needed to execute the algorithm again taking into consideration the new transactions and the stored FP-Tree.

Another adaptation proposed, because of the dynamic reordering process, is a modification in the original structures, by replacing the single linked list with a doubly linked list for linking the tree nodes to the header and adding a master-table to the same header. See &lt;ref name=Cornelia2003 /&gt; for more details.

===FP-Bonsai Algorithm===
The FP-Bonsai &lt;ref name=BonchiGoethals2004 /&gt; improve the FP-Growth performance by reducing (pruning) the FP-Tree using the ExAnte data-reduction technique &lt;ref name=Bonchi2003 /&gt;. The pruned FP-Tree was called FP-Bonsai. See &lt;ref name=BonchiGoethals2004 /&gt; for more details.

===AFOPT Algorithm===
Investigating the FP-Growth algorithm performance Liu proposed the AFOPT algorithm in &lt;ref name=Gao2007 /&gt;. This algorithm aims at improving the FP-Growth performance in four perspectives:

:* Item Search Order: when the search space is divided, all items are sorted in some order. The number of the conditional databases constructed can differ very much using different items search orders;
:* Conditional Database Representation: the traversal and construction cost of a conditional database heavily depends on its representation;
:* Conditional Database Construction Strategy: constructing every conditional database physically can be expensive affecting  the  mining cost  of  each  individual  conditional  database;
:* Tree Traversal Strategy: the traversal cost of a tree is minimal using top-down traversal strategy.

See &lt;ref name=Gao2007 /&gt; for more details.

===NONORDFP Algorithm===
The Nonordfp algorithm &lt;ref name=Balazes2004 /&gt; &lt;ref name=CorneliaRobert /&gt; was motivated by the running time and the space   required for the FP-Growth algorithm. The theoretical difference is the main data structure (FP-Tree), which is more compact and which is not needed to rebuild it for each conditional step. A compact, memory efficient representation of an FP-tree by using Trie data structure, with memory layout that allows faster traversal, faster allocation, and optionally projection was introduced. See &lt;ref name=Balazes2004 /&gt; for more details.

===FP-Growth* Algorithm===
This algorithm was proposed by Grahne et al &lt;ref name=Grahne2004 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Grahne2005 /&gt;, and is based in his conclusion about the usage of CPU time to compute frequent item sets using FP-Growth.  They observed that 80% of CPU time was used for traversing FP-Trees &lt;ref name=Moyaid /&gt;. Therefore, they used an array-based data structure combined with the FP-Tree data structure to reduce the traversal time, and incorporates several optimization techniques. See &lt;ref name=Grahne2004 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Grahne2005 /&gt; for more details.

===PPV, PrePost, and FIN Algorithm===
These three algorithms were propsed by Deng et al &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt;, and are based on three novel data structures called Node-list &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt;, N-list &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt;, and Nodeset &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; respectively for facilitating the mining process of frequent itemsets. They are based on a FP-tree with each node encoding with pre-order traversal and post-order traversal. Compared with Node-lists, N-lists and Nodesets are more efficient. This causes the efficiency of PrePost &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; and FIN &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; is higher than that of PPV  &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt;. See  &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt;  &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; for more details.

==Data Visualization in R==
Normally the data used to mine frequent item sets are stored in text files. The first step to visualize data is load it into a data-frame (an object to represent the data in R).

The function read.table could be used in the following way:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
var &lt;- read.table(fileName, fileEncoding=value, header = value, sep = value)

Where:
  • var: the R variable to receive the loaded data.
  • fileName: is a string value with the name of the file to be loaded.
  • fileEncoding: to be used when the file has no-ASCII characters.
  • header: indicates that the file has headers (T or TRUE) or not (F or FALSE).
  • sep: defines the field separator character (“,”, “;” or “\t” for example)
  • Only the filename is a mandatory parameter.
&lt;/source&gt;


Another function in R to load data is called scan. See the [http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.html R Data Import/Export Manual] for details.

The visualization of the data can be done in two ways:

:* Using the variable name (var), to list the data in a tabular presentation.
:* And summary(var), to list a summary of the data.


Example:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; data &lt;- read.table(&quot;boolean.data&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, header=T)

&gt; data
      A    B     C     D     E
1  TRUE TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
2 FALSE TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
3  TRUE TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
4  TRUE TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
5  TRUE TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
6 FALSE TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

&gt; summary(data)
     A              B               C               D               E
 Mode :logical   Mode:logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical
 FALSE:2         TRUE:6         FALSE:2         FALSE:2         FALSE:1
 TRUE :4         NA's:0         TRUE :4         TRUE :4         TRUE :5
 NA's :0                        NA's :0         NA's :0         NA's :0
&lt;/source&gt;


In the example above the data in “boolean.data”, that have a simple binary database, was loaded in the data-frame variable data. Typing the name of the variable in the command line, its content is printed, and typing the summary command the frequency occurrence of each item is printed. The summary function works differently. It depends on the type of data in the variable, see &lt;ref name=Intro2010&gt; W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith and the R Development Core Team. An Introduction to R: Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics. Version 2.11.1 (2010-05-31). &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=RLanguage2010&gt; R Development Core Team. R Language Definition. Version 2.12.0 (2010-10-15) DRAFT. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=RExtensions2010&gt; R Development Core Team. Writing R Extensions. Version 2.12.0 (2010-10-15). &lt;/ref&gt; for more details.

The functions presented previously can be useful, but to frequent item set datasets use an specific package called [https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/arules/ arules] &lt;ref name=Hahsler2010&gt; Michael Hahsler and Bettina G and Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. Introduction to arules – A computational environment for mining association rules and frequent item sets. March 2010. &lt;/ref&gt; which is better to visualize the data.

Using arules, several functions are made available:

:* read.transactions: used to load the database file into a variable.
:* inspect: used to list the transactions.
:* length: returns the number of transactions.
:* image: plots an image with all transactions in a matrix format.
:* itemFrequencyPlot: calculates the frequency of each item and plots it in a bar graphic.


Example:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; data &lt;- read.transactions(&quot;basket.data&quot;, format=&quot;basket&quot;, sep = &quot;,&quot;)

&gt; data
transactions in sparse format with
 6 transactions (rows) and
 5 items (columns)

&gt; inspect(data)
  items
1 {A,
   B,
   D,
   E}
2 {B,
   C,
   E}
3 {A,
   B,
   D,
   E}
4 {A,
   B,
   C,
   E}
5 {A,
   B,
   C,
   D,
   E}
6 {B,
   C,
   D}

&gt; length(data)
[1] 6

&gt; image(data)

&gt; itemFrequencyPlot(data, support=0.1)
&lt;/source&gt;


In this example we can see the difference in the usage of the variable name in the command line. From transactions, only the number of rows (transactions) and cols (items) are printed. The result of image(data) and itemFrequencyPlot(data, support = 0.1) are presented in the figures 4 and 5 below.

==Implementation in R==
The R &lt;ref name=Intro2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=RLanguage2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=RExtensions2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=RInstall2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Torgo2006&gt; Luís Torgo. Introdução à Programação em R. Faculdade de Economia, Universidade do Porto, Outubro de 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; provides several facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display very useful for data analysis and mining. It can be used as both a statistical library and a programming language.

As a statistical library, it provides a set of functions to summary data, matrix facilities, probability distributions, statistical models and graphical procedures.

As a programming language, it provides a set of functions, commands and methods to instantiate and manage values of different type of objects (including lists, vectors and matrices), user interaction (input and output from console), control statements (conditional and loop statements), creation of functions, calls to external resources and create packages.

This chapter isn’t accomplished to present details about R resources and will focus on the challenges to implement an algorithm using R or to be used in R. However, to better understanding the R power, some basic examples based in &lt;ref name=Torgo2006 /&gt; are presented in Appendix A.

To implement an algorithm using R, normally it would be necessary to create complex objects to represent the data structures to be processed. Also, it would be necessary to implement complex functions to process this data structures. Thinking in the specific case of implementing the FP-Growth algorithm could be very hard to represent and process an FPTree using only the R resources. Moreover, for performance reasons it could be interesting to implement the algorithm using other languages and integrate it with R. Other reasons for using other languages are to get better memory management and to use existing packages&lt;ref name=Sigal2004&gt; Sigal Blay. Calling C code from R an introduction. Dept. of Statistics and Actuarial Science Simon Fraser University, October 2004. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Two ways to integrate R with other languages are available and will be briefly presented below: creating a package and making an external call using interface functions &lt;ref name=RLanguage2010 /&gt;. Next it is presented the FP-Growth implementation used in this work and the efforts to integrate it with R. For both would be necessary to install the [http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/ RTools].

===Creating a Package===
Package is a mechanism for loading optional code implemented in other languages in R &lt;ref name=RLanguage2010 /&gt;.  The R distribution itself includes about 25 packages, and some extra packages used in this WikiBook can be listed:

:* [http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/arules/ aRules]
:* [http://cran.fiocruz.br/web/packages/arulesNBMiner/index.html arulesNBMiner]
:* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arulesSequences/index.html arulesSequences]
:* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html cluster]


To create a package it’s necessary to follow some specifications. The sources of an R package consist in a directory structure described below:

:* '''Root''': the root directory containing a DESCRIPTION file and some optional files (INDEX, NAMESPACE, configure, cleanup, LICENCE, COPYING and NEWS).
:* '''R''': contains only R code files that could be executed by the R command source(filename) to create R objects used by users. Alternatively, this directory can have a file sysdata.rda. This file has a saved image of R objects created in an execution of R console.
:* '''data''': aimed to have data files, either to be made available via lazy-loading or for loading using function data(). These data files could be from three different types: plain R code (.r or .R), tables (.tab, .txt, or .csv) or saved data from R console (.RData or .rda). Some additional compressed file can be used to table’s files.
:* '''demo''': contains scripts in pain R code (for running using function demo()) that demonstrate some of the functionality of the package
:* '''exec''': could contain additional executables the package needs, typically scripts for interpreters such as the shell, Perl, or Tcl.
:* '''inst''': its content will be copied to the installation directory after it is built and its makefile can create files to be installed. May contain all information files that intended to be viewed by end users.
:* '''man''': should contain only documentation files for the objects in the package (using an specific R documentation format). An empty man directory causes an installation error.
:* '''po''': used for files related to internalization, in other words, to translate errors and warning messages.
:* '''src''': contains the sources, headers, makevars and makefiles. The supported languages are: C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 9x, Objective C and Objective C++. It’s not possible to mix all these languages in a single package, but mix C and FORTRAN 77 or C and C++ seems to be successful. However, there ways to make usage from other packages.
:* '''tests''': used for additional package-specific test code.


Once a source package is created, it must be installed by the command line in the OS console:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
R CMD INSTALL &lt;parameters&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and installed from within R, using the command line in the R console:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&lt;parameters&gt;)
&lt;/source&gt;


See the [http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html Installation and Administration manual] &lt;ref name=RInstall2010&gt; R Development Core Team. R Installation and Administration. Version 2.12.0 (2010-10-15). &lt;/ref&gt;, for details.

After installed, the package needs to be loaded to be used, using the command line in the R console:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; library(packageName)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Making external call using interface functions===
Making external call using interface functions is a simple way to use external implementation without complies with all rules described before to create a package to R.

First the code needs to include R.h header file that comes with R installation.

To compile a source code is needs to use the compiler R at the OS command line:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; R CMD SHLIB &lt;parameters&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


Compiled code to be used in R needs to be loaded as a shared object in Unix-like OS, or as a DLL in Windows OS. To load or unload it can be used the commands in the R console:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; dyn.load(fileName)
&gt; dyn.unload(fileName)
&lt;/source&gt;


After the load, the external code can be called using some of these functions:
:* .C 
:* .Call 
:* .Fortran

===The FP-Growth Implementation===
The FP-Growth implementation used in this work was maded by [http://www.borgelt.net//fpgrowth.html Christian Borgelt] &lt;ref name=ChristianBorgelt2005&gt; Christian Borgelt. An Implementation of the FP-growth Algorithm. Workshop Open Source Data Mining Software (OSDM'05, Chicago, IL), 1-5. ACM Press, New York, NY, USA 2005. &lt;/ref&gt; a principal researcher at European Centre for Soft Computing. He also implemented the code used in [https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/arules/ arules package] &lt;ref name=Hahsler2010 /&gt; for Eclat and Apriori algorithms. The source code can be downloaded in his personal site.

As described by Borgelt &lt;ref name=ChristianBorgelt2005 /&gt; implemented two variants of the core operation of computing a projection of an FP-tree. In addition, projected FP-trees are optionally pruned by removing items that has becoming in-frequent (using FP-Bonsai &lt;ref name=BonchiGoethals2004 /&gt; approach).

The source code is divided into three main folders (packages):

:* '''fpgrowth''': contais the main file that implements the algorithm and manages the FP-Tree;
:* '''tract''': manages item sets, transactions and its reports;
:* '''util''': facilities to be used in fpgrowth and tract.


The syntax to call this implementation, from the OS command line, is:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
&gt; fpgrowth [options] infile [outfile [selfile]]
-t#      target type                              (default: s)
         (s: frequent, c: closed, m: maximal item sets)
-m#      minimum number of items per item set     (default: 1)
-n#      maximum number of items per item set     (default: no limit)
-s#      minimum support of an item set           (default: 10%)
         (positive: percentage, negative: absolute number)
-e#      additional evaluation measure            (default: none)
-d#      minimum value of add. evaluation measure (default: 10%)
-g       write output in scanable form (quote certain characters)
-H#      record header  for output                (default: &quot;&quot;)
-k#      item separator for output                (default: &quot; &quot;)
-v#      output format for item set information   (default: &quot;  (%1S)&quot;)
-q#      sort items w.r.t. their frequency        (default: 2)
         (1: ascending, -1: descending, 0: do not sort,
          2: ascending, -2: descending w.r.t. transaction size sum)
-j       use quicksort to sort the transactions   (default: heapsort)
-a#      variant of the fpgrowth algorithm to use (default: simple)
-x       do not prune with perfect extensions
-z       do not use head union tail (hut) pruning
         (only for maximal item sets, option -tm)
-b#      blank   characters                       (default: &quot; \t\r&quot;)
-f#      field   separators                       (default: &quot; \t,&quot;)
-r#      record  separators                       (default: &quot;\n&quot;)
-C#      comment characters                       (default: &quot;#&quot;)
-!       print additional option information
infile   file to read transactions from           [required]
outfile  file to write frequent item sets to      [optional]
selfile  file stating a selection of items        [optional]
&lt;/source&gt;


There are options to choose the limits of items per set, the minimum support, evaluation measure, to configure the input and output format, and so on.

A simple calling to FP-Growth, and its results, using the test1.tab example file (that comes with source code) as input file, the test1.out, and minimum support as 30%, could be made as follow:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
C:\R\exec\fpgrowth\src&gt;fpgrowth -s30 test1.tab test1.out
fpgrowth - find frequent item sets with the fpgrowth algorithm
version 4.10 (2010.10.27)        (c) 2004-2010   Christian Borgelt
reading test1.tab ... [5 item(s), 10 transaction(s)] done [0.00s].
filtering, sorting and recoding items ... [5 item(s)] done [0.00s].
reducing transactions ... [8/10 transaction(s)] done [0.00s].
writing test1.out ... [15 set(s)] done [0.00s].
&lt;/source&gt;


The presented result shows some information about Copyright and some execution data, as the number of items and transactions and the number of frequent set (21 in this example). The content of input and output files is presented below.

'''The input file content:'''

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
a b c
a d e
b c d
a b c d
b c
a b d
d e
a b c d
c d e
a b c
&lt;/source&gt;


'''The output file content:'''

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
e d  (30.0)
e  (30.0)
a c b  (40.0)
a c  (40.0)
a d b  (30.0)
a d  (40.0)
a b  (50.0)
a  (60.0)
d b c  (30.0)
d b  (40.0)
d c  (40.0)
d  (70.0)
c b  (60.0)
c  (70.0)
b  (70.0)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Calling FP-Growth from R===
As observed before, to create a package are imposed a several rules creating a standard directory structure and content to make it available an external source code. An alternative presented before is to creating a shared object, or a DLL, to be called using specific R functions (.C, .CALL, and so on).

To start a job of adapt an existing code to compose a package can be a hard job and spending too much time. An interesting approach is to iteratively create and adapt a shared object, or DLL, and make tests to validate it and after improve the adaptations in some iterations, when a satisfactory result has been done, start to work in a package version.

The intent iterations to make it available the C implementation in R are:

:1. Create a simple command line call, without parameters making only two changes in the original source (the fpgrowth.c file):
::* Rename the main function to FP-Growth with the same signature;
::* Create a function to be called from R, creating the parameters from a configuration file (containing only a string with the same syntax of the command line, broken it in an array to be used as the argument array to FP-Growth function;
:2. Compile the code project within the R compile command, including the R.h reader file and call it using R;
:3. Implement the input parameters from the R call, eliminating the usage of a configuration file, including the change to define a input file name to data-frames in R;
:4. Preparing the output in a R data-frame to be returned to R;
:5. Create the R package.


The first iteration could be done easily, without any surprise. 

Unfortunately, the second iteration, that sounds to be ease to be done either, in a practice proved to be very hard. The R compile command does not work with makefiles and the compile original code with it could not be done. After some experiments, the strategy was changed to build a library with the adapted code, without the function created to be called from R, and then create a new code containing this function and making use of the compiled library. Next, calling the new code, compiled as a DLL, from R raises execution errors. Debugging the execution, wasting several time, was detected that some compile configurations to create the library was wrong. To solving this problem, some tests are made creating an executable version to be run using OS command line until all execution errors are solved. However, solved this errors, another unexpected behavior was founded. Calling the version compiled using R command from R console the incompatible cygwin version error was rised in loading DLL function. Several experiments, changing the compilation parameters, different versions of cygwin, and so on were tried, but have no success (these tests are made only under Windows OS). So, having no success in the second iteration, the next step was compromised.

The main expected challenge in third and fourth iterations is to interface the R data types and structure with its correspondents in the C language, either to dataset input and other input parameters to be converted and used internally than to output dataset needed to be created to be returned to R. An alternative is to adapt all the code to use the data received. However, it sounds to be more complex to be done.

The fifth iteration sounds to be a bureaucratic work. Once the code has been entirely adapted and validated, create the additional directory and required content should be an easy task.

==Conclusion and Future Works==
In this chapter an efficient and scalable algorithm to mine frequent patterns in databases was presented: the FP-Growth. This algorithm uses a useful data structure, the FP-Tree, to store information about frequent patterns. Also an implementation of the algorithm was presented. Additionally, some features of R language and experiments to adapt the algorithm source code to be used in R. We could observe that the job to make this adaptation is hard, and cannot be done in short time. Unfortunately, have no time yet to conclude this adaptation.

As a future work would be interesting to better understand the implementation of external resources on R and complete the job proposed in this work, and after comparing results with other algorithms to mining frequent itemsets available in R.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter introduces the Feed-Forward Neural Network package for prediction and classification data. An artificial neural network (ANN), usually called &quot;neural network&quot; (NN), is a mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks. A neural network consists of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, and it processes information using a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network during the learning phase. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data. In this chapter will explore the use of feed-forward neural network through the package NNET{{ref|Ripley96}}{{ref|Ripley02}} created by Ridley.

== Feed-Forward Neural Network ==

A '''feedforward neural network''' is an artificial neural network where connections between the units do ''not'' form a directed cycle. This is different from recurrent neural networks.

The feedforward neural network was the first and arguably simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

== ADALINE ==

ADALINE stands for '''Ada'''ptive '''Lin'''ear '''E'''lement. It was developed by Professor Bernard Widrow and his graduate student Ted Hoff at Stanford University in 1960. It is based on the McCulloch-Pitts model and consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function.

Operation: &lt;math&gt;y_i=wx_i+b&lt;/math&gt;

Its adaptation is defined through a cost function (error metric) of the residual &lt;math&gt;e=d_i-(b+wx_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is the desired input. With the [[Mean squared error|MSE]] error metric &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2N}\sum_i^N e_i^2&lt;/math&gt; the adapted weight and bias become:
&lt;math&gt;b=\frac{\sum_i x_i^2\sum_i d_i - \sum_i x_i \sum_i x_i d_i}{N(\sum_i(x_i - \bar x)^2)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w=\frac{\sum_i(x_i - \bar x)(d_i - \bar d)}{\sum_i(x_i - \bar x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Adaline has practical applications in the controls area.  A single neuron with tap delayed inputs (the number of inputs is bounded by the lowest frequency present and the Nyquist rate) can be used to determine the higher order transfer function of a physical system via the bi-linear z-transform.  This is done as the Adaline is, functionally, an adaptive FIR filter. Like the single-layer perceptron, ADALINE has a counterpart in statistical modelling, in this case [[least squares]] [[Regression analysis|regression]].

There is an extension of the Adaline, called the Multiple Adaline (MADALINE) that consists of two or more adalines serially connected.

== NNET Package ==

The package NNET created by Ripley provides methods for using feed-forward neural networks with a single hidden layer, and for multinomial log-linear models. Specifically, this chapter of the book will be portrayed NNET method. Below is briefly described the method and parameters used.

The implementation of NNET for Feed-Forward Neural Network for R is available on [http://cran.r-project.org CRAN] and already is embbed in Environment R:

* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnet/ nnet]

== Description ==
Fit single-hidden-layer neural network, possibly with skip-layer connections.


&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;

//Usage
nnet(x, ...)

//S3 method for class 'formula':
nnet(formula, data, weights, ...,
subset, na.action, contrasts = NULL)

//Default S3 method:
nnet(x, y, weights, size, Wts, mask,
linout = FALSE, entropy = FALSE, softmax = FALSE,
censored = FALSE, skip = FALSE, rang = 0.7, decay = 0,
maxit = 100, Hess = FALSE, trace = TRUE, MaxNWts = 1000,
abstol = 1.0e-4, reltol = 1.0e-8, ...)

&lt;/source&gt;


=== Arguments ===


* '''formula''' A formula of the form class ~ x1 + x2 + ...

* '''x''' matrix or data frame of x values for examples.

* '''y''' matrix or data frame of target values for examples.

* '''weights''' (case) weights for each example – if missing defaults to 1.

* '''size''' number of units in the hidden layer. Can be zero if there are skip-layer units.

* '''data''' Data frame from which variables specified in formula are preferentially to be taken.

* '''subset''' An index vector specifying the cases to be used in the training sample. (NOTE: If given, this argument must be named.)

* '''na.action''' A function to specify the action to be taken if NAs are found. The default action is for the procedure to fail. An alternative is na.omit, which leads to rejection of cases with missing values on any required variable. (NOTE: If given, this argument must be named.)

* '''contrasts''' a list of contrasts to be used for some or all of the factors appearing as variables in the model formula.

* '''Wts''' initial parameter vector. If missing chosen at random.

* '''mask''' logical vector indicating which parameters should be optimized (default all).

* '''linout''' switch for linear output units. Default logistic output units.

* '''entropy''' switch for entropy (= maximum conditional likelihood) fitting. Default by leastsquares.

* '''softmax''' switch for softmax (log-linear model) and maximum conditional likelihood fitting. ''linout'', ''entropy'', ''softmax'' and ''censored'' are mutually exclusive.

* '''censored''' A variant on softmax, in which non-zero targets mean possible classes. Thus for ''softmax'' a row of (0, 1, 1) means one example each of classes 2 and 3, but for censored it means one example whose class is only known to be 2 or 3.

* '''skip''' switch to add skip-layer connections from input to output.

* '''rang''' Initial random weights on [-rang, rang]. Value about 0.5 unless the inputs are large, in which case it should be chosen so that rang * max(|x|) is about 1.

* '''decay''' parameter for weight decay. Default 0.

* '''maxit''' maximum number of iterations. Default 100.

* '''Hess''' If true, the Hessian of the measure of fit at the best set of weights found is returned as component Hessian.

* '''trace''' switch for tracing optimization. Default TRUE.

* '''MaxNWts''' The maximum allowable number of weights. There is no intrinsic limit in the code, but increasing MaxNWts will probably allow fits that are very slow and time-consuming.

* '''abstol''' Stop if the fit criterion falls below abstol, indicating an essentially perfect fit.

* '''reltol''' Stop if the optimizer is unable to reduce the fit criterion by a factor of at least 1 - reltol.

* '''...''' arguments passed to or from other methods.

=== Details ===
If the response in ''formula'' is a factor, an appropriate classification network is constructed; this has one output and entropy fit if the number of levels is two, and a number of outputs equal to the number of classes and a softmax output stage for more levels. If the response is not a factor, it is passed on unchanged to ''nnet.default''.

Optimization is done via the ''BFGS'' method of optim.

=== Value ===
object of class ''nnet'' or ''nnet.formula''. Mostly internal structure, but has components

* '''wts''' the best set of weights found.
* '''value''' value of fitting criterion plus weight decay term.
* '''fitted.values''' the fitted values for the training data.
* '''residuals''' the residuals for the training data.
* '''convergence''' 1 if the maximum number of iterations was reached, otherwise 0.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
'''Utilizing Example'''

//use half the iris data
library(“nnet”)

ir &lt;- rbind(iris3[,,1],iris3[,,2],iris3[,,3])
targets &lt;- class.ind( c(rep(&quot;s&quot;, 50), rep(&quot;c&quot;, 50), rep(&quot;v&quot;, 50)) )
samp &lt;- c(sample(1:50,25), sample(51:100,25), sample(101:150,25))

ir1 &lt;- nnet(ir[samp,], targets[samp,], size = 2, rang = 0.1,
decay = 5e-4, maxit = 200)

test.cl &lt;- function(true, pred) {
   true &lt;- max.col(true)
   cres &lt;- max.col(pred)
   table(true, cres)
}

test.cl(targets[-samp,], predict(ir1, ir[-samp,]))

// or
library(“nnet”)

ird &lt;- data.frame(rbind(iris3[,,1], iris3[,,2], iris3[,,3]),
species = factor(c(rep(&quot;s&quot;,50), rep(&quot;c&quot;, 50), rep(&quot;v&quot;, 50))))

ir.nn2 &lt;- nnet(species ~ ., data = ird, subset = samp, size = 2, rang = 0.1,
decay = 5e-4, maxit = 200)

table(ird$species[-samp], predict(ir.nn2, ird[-samp,], type = &quot;class&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Study Case ==
The case study is designed to illustrate just one among many possible applications of the package NNET.

== Scenario ==
Accurate diagnosis may avoid complications for patients. Desiring to establish whether a patient has breast cancer, the analysis of several factors help determine an accurate diagnosis. Thus, from the collection of data from many patients seek to infer the diagnosis of patients with satisfactory accuracy.

== Data Details ==
The data used in this case study are from a database of the [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29 UCI]{{ref|Wolberg90a}}{{ref|Wolberg90b}}{{ref|Wolberg90c}}{{ref|Mangasarian92}}. The database consists of 10 variables (9 input and 1 output) having 569 instances of records of patients diagnosed.

'''Input'''

* Clump Thickness
* Uniformity of Cell Size
* Uniformity of Cell Shape
* Marginal Adhesion
* Single Epithelial Cell Size
* Bare Nuclei
* Bland Chromatin
* Normal Nucleoli
* Mitoses

'''Output (Class)'''

* Diagnostic: Benign or Malignant

== Execution and Results ==
The implementation using the package is pretty simple. Below is the part of the training and test data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
trainingInput &lt;- read.table(&quot;trainingInput.data&quot;, sep=&quot;, &quot;, header=TRUE)
trainingOutput &lt;- read.table(&quot;trainingOutput.data&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, header=TRUE)

library(&quot;nnet&quot;)
neuralNetworkModel &lt;- nnet(trainingInput, trainingOutput, size = 19, rang = 0.1, decay = 5e-4, maxit = 2000)

neuralNetworkTest &lt;- function(true, pred) {
	true &lt;- max.col(true)
	cres &lt;- max.col(pred)
	table(true, cres)
}

neuralNetworkTest(trainingOutput, predict(neuralNetworkModel, trainingInput))
&lt;/source&gt;

As a result of the training function ''neuralNetoworkModel &lt;- nnet (...)'' has the steps of iteration and approximation of operations in accordance with the parameters set for ''rang'', ''decay'' and ''maxit''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;

  # weights:  230
  initial  value 146.391298 
  iter  10 value 14.225442
  iter  20 value 0.478782
  iter  30 value 0.149068
  iter  40 value 0.140717
  iter  50 value 0.131745
  iter  60 value 0.124368
  iter  70 value 0.116663
  …
  iter 740 value 0.086414
  iter 750 value 0.086414
  final  value 0.086414 
  converged

&lt;/source&gt;

After training, there is confusion over the matrix (''function neuralNetworkTest'') the results obtained. From the matrix it is possible to apply various metrics for information as accuracy, error, among others.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;

       cres
   true  1    2
     1  180   0
     2   0   120

&lt;/source&gt;

From this matrix, we find that the test was very successful, being that ''True Positive = (1,1), False Positive = (1,2), False Negative = (2,1) and True Negative (2,2)''.

== Analysis ==
From this case study, the neural net model obtained from data sets of patients are sufficient to provide a reliable diagnosis. But for this, the patient data must respect the reality of the model represented by the network, otherwise the ANN present a misdiagnosis. Thus, it is noted that the package NNET is convenient to use, making it accessible to various distinct audiences, which may make use of it without needing a thorough knowledge on the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organization of the book ==
We hope you will enjoy reading this book from front to back.  Material is presented in an order that builds on previously presented material, so that beginning programmers can follow a steady learning curve.  The books starts without assuming that the reader has much familiarity in programming at all, and none whatsoever in Go.  By the end of the book, we will have covered the entire language, as specified in the language reference manual, and in the process, covered many basic skills of computer programming.

For more advanced programmers, who will be inclined to skim and skip over material, the book is still organized with this reading style in mind.  Part&amp;nbsp;1 is all introductory material.  It leads you right up to the point where you can write your first Go program.  If you already have some familiarity with Go, you can probably skip this whole part.  Part&amp;nbsp;2 consists of example programs, roughly in order of increasing difficulty.  Each chapter contains one program.  It starts with a very brief description of the program, and then shows the program in its entirety.  Skim over the program and see if it is interesting or boring, too easy or too hard.  If it looks interesting, skim down through the topics presented.  Topics presented are those appearing for the ''first time''.  If you are interested in some aspect of the the program that is not listed in the topics, it has most likely been covered in a previous exercise.  Look back in the Table of Contents and see if you can spot a program where the topic is likely to appear for the first time.

Finally, an index is at the end of the book, to help you locate topics of interest.
== Sidebars ==
Sidebars throughout the book have different kinds of additional information.
{{Robox|theme=2|width=70%|title=CompSci 101}}
Notes in this style give background information of interest to people with very limited computer programming experience, or limited formal computer science education.  They provide a little more explanation in cases where they body text breezes through new terms and concepts.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{Robox|theme=1|width=70%|title=It's different for Go}}
Notes in this style address programmers skilled in other programming languages, pointing out where Go does something in a different way than they might expect.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{Robox|theme=3|width=70%|title=Concurrency}}
Notes in this style address the special issue of concurrency, or having a computer do more than one thing at a time.  Concurrency has not been been widely addressed in mainstream computing until just recently.  As such, techniques are developing rapidly and any specific technique might be new to a programmer of any level of experience.
{{Robox/Close}}
== Typographic conventions ==
&lt;pre&gt;Go source code appears in boxes like this.&lt;/pre&gt;
* ''Italic text'' is used for the first use of specialized terms, either Go terms or computer programming terms.  Of course it is also used as usual for emphasis and clarification, as needed.
* '''Bold text''' is reserved for Go keywords and other exact words of the Go language and the Go standard library.  Keywords will appear in bold the first time they are used and other times as needed for clarity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Legolas Greenleaf was the Prince of Mirkwood, as well as the lone Elf in the Fellowship of the Ring, serving as the. group's archer. He first came to prominence during the Council of Elrond, traveling with the Fellowship, and then with Aragorn and Gimli after the breaking of the Fellowship. Though there was initially friction between Legolas and Gimli because of the longtime feud between the Dwarves and the Elves, the two formed a strong friendship, doing much to reduce the tension between the two races.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gimli was the lone Dwarf member of the Fellowship of the Ring, and was known for his skill with an axe. After the breaking of the Fellowship, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli travelled together, becoming known as the Three Hunters, playing vital roles in battles such as the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The friendship that grew between Legolas and Gimli did much to heal the longtime tension between the Elves and the Dwarfs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boromir was the heir to Denethor, the ruling Steward of Gondor. Together, he and Aragorn represented Men in the Fellowship. Boromir was a mighty fighter, and extremely proud and courageous. He was also under the pressure of a kingdom constantly under attack. Boromir succumbs to the temptation of the Ring, attempting to seize it forcibly from Frodo, helping to set in motion a series of events that resulted in the breaking of the Fellowship and ultimately, his own death. Despite his crime of trying to steal the ring, Boromir made up for it by valiantly defending Merry and Pippin, at the cost of his own life, later confessing to and being forgiven by Aragorn, and was remembered as a hero by the rest of the Fellowship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Think of your favorite video game.  Perhaps you might be imagining an old computer game you played as a child or maybe you are thinking of a game you purchased just yesterday for your Xbox 360, Playstation, or other gaming system.  Whatever the case, most people have had countless experiences with video games and recollect these experiences with excitement and interest.  Today's students spend a great deal of their time outside of the classroom participating and playing video games either on a console or via the internet.  According to a recent survey conducted by the market researcher NPD group, hours spent playing video games both online and on consoles has increased 6% and 9%, respectively, since 2009 (NPD 2010).  Children over the age of 2 are spending, on average, 13 hours a week playing video games.  Others, who the NPD group classified as &quot;extreme gamers&quot; are spending upwards of 45 hours a week playing video games! 
 
While many may be shocked by such statistics, it is important for educators to realize the appeal video games have to many children, accept that gaming has become a cultural phenomenon, and take advantage of the fascination that video games can bring to the classroom.  Video games are no longer &quot;for after school hours only.&quot;  In fact, the use of video games in classrooms, as a learning or supplemental tool, has been a growing trend in recent years, specifically in the sciences.  Video gaming in the science classroom has the potential to deeply engage students, said one study, and consequently, educators should carefully consider their use in the classroom (Annetta et al 2006).

== Definition ==
Think of your favorite video game once more. Would it be useful for teaching academic content? Chances are that it is not &quot;plug-and-play&quot; ready for the classroom. The vast majority of video games are generally &quot;fun&quot; focused instead of learning centered, although this does not stop them from being educational in many aspects, as we will discus. Because of the myriad of video games available, it is important to know the basic difference between what is deemed an &quot;educational video game,&quot; and simply a &quot;video game&quot; before considering using either in a classroom environment. 

A game, according to a study in 2005 (Juul), adheres to these criteria: 
   1. A rule-based formal system
   2. Variable and quantifiable outcomes
   3. Different outcomes are assigned different values (valorization)
   4. The player exerts effort in order to influence the outcome
   5. The player feels emotionally attached to the outcome
   6. The consequences of the activity are optional and negotiable

A ''video'' game, then, is any electronically viewed and controlled object that adheres to these standards.

An ''educational'' video game, also known as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game Serious game] is defined as &quot;...designed to teach people, typically children, about a certain subject or help them learn a skill as they play.&quot; (wordiQ.com) This means that an educational video game is designed with specific learning in mind, rather than simply within the &quot;fun&quot; framework.

It is the opinion of the authors of this chapter that a third category of video games exist, which we will call &quot;Incidentally educational&quot; video games. These are video games that, when used properly, can supplement, enhance, or facilitate student learning in content or skill areas, despite not having been designed and/or marketed with education in mind. These games may be as popular as [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml World of Warcraft] (abbreviated: WOW), or as unexpected as [http://halo.xbox.com/en-us Halo], and may be used (with care) to teach content, teamwork and skills in a dynamic and engaging manner.

== History ==
Video games designed for educational use began being created around the 1970's.  The time period surrounding the 1970's and 1980's has been referred to as &quot;The Golden Age of Arcade Games&quot; and household names such as &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Pac Man&quot;, and &quot;Frogger&quot; were created during this time.  With the growing success and sophistication of computers and free-standing consoles, video games increased in popularity.  As the popularity of entertainment-based video games grew, educational video games soon started appearing in classrooms.

Perhaps one of the first educational video games, one designed with intentional educational outcomes in mind, was Oregon Trail. Developed by history teachers Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971, Oregon Trail allowed students to lead a Oxen-pulled wagon from Missouri to Oregon in a &quot;realistic&quot; journey set in the 19th Century.  In the game, students were faced with issues such as broken wagon axles, hunting for food, and having to safely cross rivers.  Students came to dread the tag-lines &quot;you have died of dysentery&quot; or &quot;Johnny has died from a snakebite,&quot; as they navigated their way along the Oregon Trail; all while intuitively learning about the perils and triumphs of Pioneer life.  The Oregon Trail was widely used in classrooms until the 1990's and has now become more of a legacy than a widely-used educational video game. The video game had five editions and many alternative games were created based on the concept of Oregon Trail.  The [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5yEIITA03I Yukon Trail] and the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrOQ-gr9yjk Amazon Trail] are two educational games similar to Oregon Trail's platform.  

While it is hard to create a definitive time line for the &quot;history of educational video games&quot;, it is important to note that video games designed for pedagogical reasons continued after Oregon Trail in most content areas, including science.  Currently, the use of video games in education is a hot topic.  With the continued advancement and sophistication of technology, educational video games have allowed students to participate in interactive and meaningful experiences while simultaneously being embedded in science content. 

In 2001, The Federation of American Scientists(FAS) began a study to analyze the benefits of technology use in science education.  From this research, the FAS initiated the Learning Science and Technology Research and Development Road Map Project.  This project was a collaborative effort of some 100 academic, governmental, and corporate professionals who sought to enhance the use of technology to transform science education.  The project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), FAS, and others including Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett Foundation, and Carnegie Corporation.  From this project, the Federation of American Scientists realized the teaching and learning potential of educational video games and embarked on a study to prove that these games could, and do, enhance student learning.  In 2004, FAS began designing and developing educational science video games and presented their findings in 2005 to the Educational Games Summit (Stegman 2010).  ''Immune Attack'' was one game created and has become widely used for immunology lessons in science courses.  (see the Educational Video Games section to learn more about ''Immune Attack''). 

Currently, there is great focus on the use of video games in the science classroom because of their ability to foster inquiry- and problem-based learning.  What has been called &quot;the serious games movement&quot; has influenced the acceptance of video games, by educators and policy makers alike, as legitimate pedagogical tools .  According to an article titled [http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/SeriousGamesIncorporatingVideo/157412 ''Serious Games:'' ''Incorporating Video Games in the Classroom''] by Leonard Annetta and colleagues, the &quot;serious games movement prompted partnerships among educators, the military, corporations, medical fields, and video game designers. This movement embraces the power of video games to attract, engage, connect, and teach game players critical content in the games’ respective focus area&quot; (Annetta et al 2006).  The article focused on the use of MEGAs (Multi-player Educational Gaming Applications) in education.  MEGAs allow students to create visual representations of themselves, commonly referred to as avatars, that can interact with other avatars (other classmates) and participate in a virtual world experience.  


The article noted that MEGAs appeal to students because:
     1) They connect students with other classmates
     2) They entertain through games, music, and videos
     3) They allow students to present themselves and their work in a virtual environment

In 2009, president Barack Obama introduced his &quot;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-education-innovate-campaign educate to innovate]&quot; campaign that focuses on enhancing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education.  On November 23, 2009 Obama addressed the issue of STEM education, highlighting his goal to increase the rank of the United States in Science and Math education by 2020.  In this address, Obama articulated the importance of science education by saying, &quot;The key to meeting these challenges -- to improving our health and well-being, to harnessing clean energy, to protecting our security, and succeeding in the global economy -- will be reaffirming and strengthening America's role as the world's engine of scientific discovery and technological innovation.  And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators.  And that's why education in math and science is so important&quot; (whitehouse.gov).  In response to Obama's Educate to Innovate campaign, Kumar Garg, a policy analyst for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), attended the annual Game Developers Conference in March of 2010 to voice the potential impact video games could have on science education.  Conference attendees--video game programmers, producers, and designers--learned about the positive impact educational video games can have on science classrooms.  According to ''Video Games and the Second Life of Science Class'', a journal article in ''Cell'', at the conference, Garg challenged game developers to show that video games and simulations can train kids to think like scientists, mathematicians, and engineers (Maxmen 2010). 

In 2010, the MacArthur Foundation established a &quot;[http://www.dmlcompetition.net/game_changers.php Game Changer]&quot; competition for individuals to create science-related video games.  The winners of this competition will receive monetary rewards &quot;as well as recognition from the game industry companies Sony and Electronic Arts&quot; (Maxmen 2010).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

'''Advantages'''

Some general advantages of video games in the classroom include: 

:- Entertainment immersed in education allows for more opportunities of enhanced motivation to occur. The term &quot;edutainment&quot; has been used numerous times in discussing educational video games.  This term was discussed in ''Video Games and Education'',a book by Harry J. Brown. 

:- Can encourage &quot;learn by doing&quot; philosophy.  As students work their way through the problems faced in game play, they can intuitively learn scientific concepts and use real-life problem solving skills in the process.

:- Allows for collaboration amongst peers in the classroom as well as other students around globe!  In certain games, players are connected to others thousands of miles away.  What a neat way to encourage working with others.

:- Educational video games have been shown to increase visual attentiveness and can enhance computer skills (if played online)...a great way to incorporate technology in the classroom!

:- Can be emotionally appealing

:- Educational video games have built in motivational strategies to encourage students to reach their goals

'''Disadvantages'''

One of the most apparent disadvantages of using video games in the classroom is the danger of using a game ineffectually. The efficacy of using a game in class is highly dependent on ''how'' it is used by the teacher.  For this reason, it is essential for the teacher to closely observe the game, with a clear educational purpose in mind, and implement its use with careful planning and monitoring.  Without clear purpose and implementation, a video game in class - even if engaging and interesting to the students - can be as useless as talking about one's summer vacation for the entire hour of a science class.  Engagement is only half of the battle in the classroom. 

Because of the need for careful observation and planning in using video games in the classroom, the cost-benefit analysis of using a video game can become unbalanced.  There are many cases where another form of media can teach or supplement content or skills with far less hassle and attention, albeit perhaps not so engaging as a video game.

Computer games can also distract from learning as it is difficult to get students to focus on content learning when playing rather than on completion and success in the game. Additionally, if the teacher is not completely familiar with the game and its agenda and connotations, there can be severe backlash in the school and community. Further, although there has been an increase in games that include female heroines, multiple gender role options and less focus on the masculinity of victory, most video games are gender and role specific in favor of male and masculinity. This kind of bias creates an environment in which students, if they wish to &quot;succeed,&quot; may need to behave within specific stereotypes - forming restrictive role playing and real world relation.

In using online cooperative games, such as World of Warcraft, or other games in which anonymous communication occurs, it is important for the teacher to prepare uniquely for the advent of online bullying and other inappropriate conversation. According to [http://gametheoryonline.com/2010/10/11/online-anonymity-internet-privacy-safety/ Game Theory], one of the most prevalent complaints about online gaming is that of &quot;curse and prejudice filled banter.&quot; (Halpin) The seduction of perceived anonymity has created a world where gamers feel comfortable shouting or typing obscenities or slurs at opponents and teammates alike. Although this kind of behavior can be combated, prevented and dealt with in many ways, it is important to consider the time and efficacy costs of dealing with these and related issues during the use of online video games in the classroom. 


Other general disadvantages of using video games in the classroom include:

:- Negative stigma.  A great deal of controversy surrounds the use of video games in the classroom as some individuals deem them as merely &quot;time wasters&quot;.

:- Main goals (learning objectives) through direct learning may be harder to achieve

:- Could be difficult to implement into the curriculum.  Certainly there is not, yet, a video game for every scientific concept, and using the ones that do exist would take some creativity and flexibility when creating lesson plans.

:- Potentially time consuming in use.  Students need time to play the game, evaluate its academic relativity, and process the important academic content learned during game play.

Currently 3 billion hours per week are spent playing online video games. According to McGonigal this current investment is “Not nearly enough game play”. She calculates that the world is expected to have and need “21 billion hours of game play a week” in order to make great accomplishments. 

According to McGonigal’s studies, there is a verity of powerful emotions evoked by playing videogames. Of these emotions include a sense of urgency for accomplishment, extreme concentration, intense focus, and high optimism. Additionally there is the emotion what McGonigal calls an “epic win”, which a feeling achieved from an outcome that is “extraordinarily positive”. An epic win occurs when a player achieves an outcome that they did not expect and pushes the imagination of what the player thought they were capable of. 

In a typical working environment, people commonly experience feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed. These feelings do not always exist while playing video games. How are these problems avoided? In video games such as World of Warcraft, tasks are designed nearly perfectly to challenge players such that the player always has the ability to achieve that goal; however, the player must also try hard, and often wait and work patiently for success. As a result of this hard work, players are trained to reattempt their failures, and to be comfortable performing sometimes tedious tasks in pursuit of a higher goal. Players also have a strong support system while they play. Gamers in World of Warcraft have hundreds of thousands of collaborators willing to help, work together, and provide constant feedback. Feedback is provided not only by other players but the game itself. This kind of communal environment also creates many situations where participants must garner conflict resolution skills in order to complete tasks involving teamwork. Many of these aspects lack in the real world and make virtual worlds seem better, and far safer in many cases, than reality. 

The World of Warcraft Wiki is the 2nd largest wiki next to Wikipedia.

There is a huge magnitude of human evolution through video games. So far people in total have spent 5.39 million years playing World of Warcraft (which is coincidentally the same time since primates stood upright). Currently the average U.S. child spends 10,000 hours playing Online games by the age of 21. This compares to 10,080 school hours from 5th grade to high school graduation (assuming perfect attendance).  According to Gladwell, after someone has put for the effort and invested 10,000 hours studying a subject, they will become virtuoso at that topic (See Gladwell’s book Outliers). What we have right now is about 500 million virtuoso gamers, and McGonigal predicts another billion in the next decade. But what are these gamers so good at? Here is what McGonigal says are their best qualities:


-	Gamers are Super-empowered, hopeful individuals.

-	Gamers have urgent optimism.

-	Gamers have a tight social fabric; respect gained from playing with people.

-	Gamers create blissful productivity.

-	Gamers are susceptible to epic meaning; the attachment to awe inspiring mission.


Currently, McGonigal is working on the online Video game titled “Evoke”. Evoke, in addition to being a video game, is actually an online course. The course last 10 weeks and each week a global issue is presented to the players. The players must then design a solution to the global issue that includes blogs, photos, videos, etc.  Players also go beyond imagining there solutions at the computer level and take personal goals to community development achievements. McGonigal’s group has plans to reward top players with traveling scholarships and mentoring opportunities. For more information, view her videos at her site: http://www.avantgame.com/

Other games created by McGonigal include an oil shortage simulation and end-of-the-world simulations.

Popular Games that follow learning aspects are: World of Warcraft, Halo, Fallout 3,

''[http://www.fas.org/immuneattack/ Immune Attack]''

Released in May of 2008, ''Immune Attack'' immerses students in a 3D environment inside the human body.  The purpose of the game is to have students save an ill patient by repairing non-functional immune cells in the body's blood vessels and connective tissue.  During game play, students &quot;intuitively learn about the various biological/immunological processes that enable macrophages and neutrophils (white blood cells) to detect and fight infections&quot; (Stegman 2010).

''[http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/fullscreen.php?game=pandemic-2 Pandemic]''

In Pandemic, (now in versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0) players create their own viruses or bacteria in attempt to wipe out the human population.  In doing so, students can learn about how viruses and bacteria are transmitted, how virulence factors enhance the lethality of disease, and how global travel can increase the speed at which humans become infected.
   
Second Life ''[http://museumvirtualworlds.org/?tag=second-life Exploratorium]''

Exploratorium is a MEGA that allows student to create their own avatar and visit a museum &quot;in which people can fly through the solar system, scan their own bodies, and change gravity so they can bounce off walls&quot; (Rothfarb 2007)  Additionally, museum visitors can watch a solar eclipse while sitting next to someone on the other side of the earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
As [[w:Stun_gun|stun guns]] and [[w:taser|tasers]] become more common among police, military, and everyday consumers, it is important to understand the interface between these devices and society.  This chapter outlines a brief, social evaluation of the developmental history of these non-lethal weapons and explains the significance of current variations.  It then examines the ongoing debate over taser/stun gun usage by looking at relevant social groups involved.  Also included is a quick look at the influence of viral videos through user sharing video channels such as [http://www.youtube.com/ Youtube], which exacerbates stigmas associated with electroshock devices.

==History==
[[File:Electric cattle prod.jpg|thumb|Early electric cattle prod]]
The first idea for using electricity in a non-lethal fashion can be traced back to 1852, from US Patent 8843&lt;ref name=&quot;patent 1&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=8843 US Patent 8843], Electric Whaling Apparatus&lt;/ref&gt; an 'Electric Whaling Apparatus.' This preceded the electric chair, after which the use of non-lethal electric devices for torture manifested in such forms as the Picana Electrica, used in Argentina in the 1930's.&lt;ref name=&quot;picana&quot;&gt;[http://humanrights.uchicago.edu/documents/Torture%20Conference/Rejali.htm Electric Torture: A Global History of a Torture Technology], Picana Electrica and other electric device evolution history&lt;/ref&gt;  The electric cattle prod, invented by John M. Burton in 1890, became widely popular in the Americas in the 1940's.&lt;ref name=&quot;picana&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;patent 2&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=zERNAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=electric+prod+pole+john+burton US Patent 427549], Electric Prod Pole&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950's, this evolved into the first stun devices for personal protection. The &quot;Electrified Stick for Postmen&quot; was a stun baton that was adapted for police use in the 1960's for prisoner and riot control.&lt;ref name=&quot;patent 3&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=clZYAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=Electrified+Stick+for+Postmen US Patent 3119554], Electrified Stick for Postmen&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970's, the first modern ranged [[w:Electroshock_weapon]] were marketed to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;picana&quot; /&gt;  The idea for a ranged shock device, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser taser], originated from the fictional novel, ''Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle'', where Mr. Swift used a rifle that fired bolts of electricity.  This inspired NASA researcher, Jack Cover.  Cover went on to invent the taser in 1972 and later formed [[w:Taser_International|TASER International]], the most common maker of electroshock weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;TI&quot;&gt;[http://www.taser.com/Pages/default.aspx Taser International], Company website&lt;/ref&gt; John Cover's patent was adapted by Nova Technologies in 1983 for the Nova XR-5000, their first non-projectile hand-held style stun gun. &lt;ref name=&quot;NovaXR5000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edelson |first=Edward |year=1985 |title=Stun Guns How dangerous? |journal=Popular Science |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=92-93 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation |doi= |url=url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oQAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |accessdate=3 February 2013|id={{ISSN|01617370}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The XR-5000 design was widely copied as the source for the compact non-projectile handheld stun gun used today.

==Model Variations==
[[File:M26 Taser.jpg|left|thumb|Standard Taser used by police and military]]
==== Stun guns vs. Tasers ====
Both are electroshock weapons that apply a non-lethal current to stimulate uncontrollable muscle function and subdue a person.  A stun gun applies a charge to the body when the two electrodes are in close proximity with the skin.  A taser propels two electrodes on conductive wires through the air when fired.  These electrodes embed themselves into the target's skin before the shock.  Counter-intuitively, it's the taser that shoots not the stun gun.

==== Concealed Versions ====

Stun guns' consumer market expanded with the evolution of a line of concealed designs.  These [[w:Self-defense#Armed| self defense weapons]] take on a whole new aspect of surprising your attacker.  These weapons are disguised as [[Lentis/Norms_of_Handheld_Device_Use|cell phones]], flash lights, pens, even lipstick tubes. This decreases the chance for a would-be attacker to anticipate a counter-attack.  It also creates a hierarchy of advantages: people may value revenge through surprise on an assailant more than the ability to preemptively dissuade attackers by displaying an obvious weapon.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

==Risks Associated with Tasers==

The high voltage associated with tasers can cause some individuals to go into cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;health risk&quot;&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20080521/taser_doctor_080521/  Canada TV], ''Tasers can cause cardiac arrest: heart specialists''&lt;/ref&gt; This has warped the public’s view since tasers can do more than subdue. They have the [[w:Robert_Dziekański_Taser_incident|potential to kill]]. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are under higher risk. Even cops and soldiers who are tased as apart of their training have filed lawsuits against taser companies citing lasting injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;cop injury&quot;&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0820taser20.html AZ Central], ''Police in 5 states sue Taser in past 2 weeks''&lt;/ref&gt; In situations in which individuals are healthy, calm, and relaxed, tasers are usually safe. However, as many viral videos on the internet present, individuals that are tased by police are never in that state.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;[http://merciad.mercyhurst.edu/content/tasers-remain-issue  Merciad], ''Tasers remain an issue''&lt;/ref&gt;  There are claims with significant evidence of [[W:Taser_safety_issues | risk of injury or death]], while others [http://media.columbiamissourian.com/multimedia/2009/03/02/media/Safety_and_Injury_profile_of_conducted_energy_weapons.pdf studies] vouch for taser safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsafety&quot;&gt;[http://media.columbiamissourian.com/multimedia/2009/03/02/media/Safety_and_Injury_profile_of_conducted_energy_weapons.pdf  Annals of Emergency Medicine], ''Safety and Injury Profile of Conducted Electrical Weapons Used By Law Enforcement Officers Against Criminal Suspects''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Groups==

====Police====

Tasers were implemented to offer [[w:police|police]] a new alternative to subdue suspects.  The goal was to reduce firearm use.  In Pittsburgh, PA, taser use increased from 274 in 2005 to 332 in 2006. The use of firearms against suspects decreased from 14 to 6 over the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittsburgh City Paper&quot;&gt;[http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid:38404/ Pittsburgh City Paper] ''Charged Debate''&lt;/ref&gt;  This is one of many examples of reduced gun use.  

Although the police intended tasers to reduce firearm use, critics disapprove of the situations in which police justify taser usage. It is possible that officers are needlessly using tasers, and are overcompensating for the decrease in gun incidents.  In Minneapolis, MN, tasers were used 232 times in 2006, a 75% increase from 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot; Minneapolis Police Department&quot;&gt;[http://static.cbslocal.com/station/wcco/news/specialreports/spucrime/07_1101_crimespu_taseraamera_taserevaluationfrommpd.pdf/ Minneapolis Police Department] ''TASERs: Evaluation and Statistical Analysis''&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that police officers no longer try alternatives such as reasoning with a suspect to defuse situations but instead use a taser as a primary means of gaining control.  

[[File:Taser celphone.jpg|thumb|Stun Gun disguised as a cellular phone]]

British police guidelines call for tasers to be used preemptively in any case in which a suspect poses a threat, even if they are unarmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;emptase&quot;&gt;[http://www.taser.org.uk/taser/preemptive-tasering-in-the-uk Taser.org.uk] ''Preemptive tasering in the UK''&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, tasers have traditionally been fired when a suspect has a weapon, but more officers are tasing individuals who are unarmed. In San Antonio, TX, from 2006 to January 2008, of 99 taser applications, police incorrectly believed the individual to be armed in 40 cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;my SA news&quot;&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/MYSA012008_01B_Tasers_2a3c3b3_html7742.html/ My San Antonio News] ''Cops hail Taser use, but critics aren't sold''&lt;/ref&gt;  Police are no longer warning individuals of use, but are surprising them instead. Supporters of electroshock weapons claim that tasers are more effective than conventional methods of gaining control of a situation, i.e., [[w:Pepper_spray|pepper spray]], [[w:Baton|batons]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;emich&quot;&gt;[http://www.emich.edu/cerns/downloads/papers/PoliceStaff/Weapons%20,%20Technology,%20and%20Equipment/Risks%20and%20Benefits%20of%20Tasers.pdf Eastern Michigan] ''Risks and Benefits of Tasers''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical Profession====

While medical professionals urge caution when using the taser, several prospective studies have failed to find any negative cardiac impact. Still, some case reports have documented a handful of associated injuries. Doctors stress the use of tasers by trained and experienced individuals and do not promote the use of tasers in any situation that does not warrant the use of otherwise extreme force.&lt;ref name=&quot;doctor&quot;&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/07/07/prsf0707.htm American Medical Association], &quot;AMA meeting: Increasing use of Tasers prompts safety review&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Civil Liberties Union====
The [[w:American Civil Liberties Union|American Civil Liberties Union]] claims that from 1999, approximately 148 people have died in the United States and Canada as a result of a taser shock. The greatest problem concerning tasers according to the ACLU is the fact that police can use them and are not subject to some form of regulation or control. They are also not limited to the number of times they use the device per suspect. &lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU&quot;&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice_prisoners-rights_drug-law-reform_immigrants-rights/unregulated-use-taser-stun-guns-th American Civil Liberties Union], &quot;Unregulated Use of Taser Stun Guns Threatens Lives, ACLU of Northern California Study Finds&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taser International and Department of Defense====
Taser International (T.I.), with its vested interest in its product, references peer-reviewed [http://www.taser.com/research/Science/Pages/default.aspx research articles] and [http://www.taser.com/research/statistics/Pages/default.aspx statistics] vouching for taser safety.  A [http://media.columbiamissourian.com/multimedia/2009/03/02/media/Safety_and_Injury_profile_of_conducted_energy_weapons.pdf recent study], advertised highly by the company, claims that &quot;99% of subjects do not experience significant injuries after conducted electrical weapon use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tsafety&quot; /&gt;  Taser International works closely with the Department of Defense as a weapons contractor.  It is in the DoD's interest for T.I. products to be viewed as safe.  T.I. has 'welcomed' [http://www.taser.com/research/Science/Documents/The_Joint_Non-Lethal_Weapons_Human_Effects_Center_of_Excellence.pdf independent studies] on taser safety sponsored by the DoD.&lt;ref name=&quot;jointstudy&quot;&gt;[http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/04/02/taser-welcomes-report-from-department-of-defense Web Pro News] ''Taser Welcomes Report from Department of Defense''&lt;/ref&gt;  The two groups will foreseeably continue their working relationship and jointly develop [http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/tasers-new-grenade-launcher-projectile-delivers-incapacitating-shock-200-feet new weapons].

====United Nations and Amnesty International====

Both the [[w:United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations]] and [[w:Amnesty International|Amnesty International]] are the largest voices to be heard speaking out against the usage of tasers. Although tasers are not as lethal as firearms, in many cases from 2001-2008, tasers have led to the deaths of 334 individuals. The groups cite the devices as a means of torture and not as a means of suppression. Both groups claim that police and other users can revert to safer alternatives with the same efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;amevidence&quot;&gt;[http://www.amnesty.ca/resource_centre/news/view.php?load=arcview&amp;article=4543&amp;c=Resource+Centre+News Amnesty International] ''Media Release
USA: Safety of Tasers questioned as death toll hits 334-mark''&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Influence of Internet Videos==
[[File:Taser rally 2.jpg|left|thumb|UCLA students protest a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Taser_incident taser incident] on November 14, 2006]]
Since the advent of the internet, social perspectives have been influenced from a variety of [[Lentis/The_Open-Source_Movement|open sources]]. One source, [http://www.youtube.com/ YouTube], which hosts user generated videos, has changed the public's perception of tasers due to the [[w:Viral Video|viral video]] phenomenon. The pervasive nature of the internet in our lives makes the propagation and popularity of these videos effective at molding people's thoughts.  [[Lentis/Recording_Police_Activity|These clips]] present tasers as contrastingly dangerous and humorous. One can hypothesize that their popularity is due to the extreme nature of how tasers are used in situations involving near death experiences or ones that make us laugh. 

===== Popular Police Cases =====

On September 17, 2007, [[w:University of Florida Taser incident|Andrew William Meyer]] was tased by police at a University of Florida forum in which John Kerry was a guest speaker. Meyer asked an inappropriate question, then resisted police who were trying to escort him off the premises. His pleas and cries for help are either comical or chilling, depending on the viewer's reaction. His catch phrase &quot;Don't tase me bro!&quot; has become a part of pop culture. This incident was caught on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bVa6jn4rpE tape] and has more than 5.25 million views. 

On May 11, 2009, [[w:Taser_safety_issues#Cardiac_arrests.2C_lawsuits_and_effectiveness|Kathryn Winkfein]] was pulled over for speeding. After she refused to cooperate, Deputy Constable Christopher Beize tasered her. Her groans as she falls on the ground are chilling due to her old age. This police dashboard-camera [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yWaE8tTlsc video] was released to the public and has more than 1 million views in total.

In contrast, fewer people have seen the video of Donald Wade Evanger &lt;ref name=&quot;East Portland News&quot;&gt;[http://eastpdxnews.com/general-news-features/carjacked-career-criminal-accused-of-stealing-car-and-groceries-at-gunpoint/ East Portland News] ''Carjacked! Career criminal accused of stealing car, and groceries, at gunpoint''&lt;/ref&gt;. In a spectator's [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDrWScZuIrs video], he is seen running, armed, on a riverbank away from police. When finally confronted by police, Evanger attempts to pull his gun, but gets tasered in the process. The video is a clear example of proper taser usage, demonstrating its life saving ability. However, this incident is only mildly interesting to the public as it does not contain any abrasive or shocking content. This video currently has around 50 thousand views in total.  
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - www.Army.mil (226).jpg|right|thumb|Military taser training]]
Both Meyer and Winkfein's encounters with the police give a one-sided view of tasers, and are famous due to their extremism. Though viral videos are not intended to influence public opinion, their usage in conjunction with authority nevertheless does.

===== Other Usage =====

There is another type of viral video that involves tasers and stun guns. They feature young adults in (usually) controlled settings. These videos depict stun guns either being used for fun or as a demonstration; they range from kids laughing as a friend is tased, to trained marines cringing in pain from the electricity surging through their body. The stunned subjects' reactions are milder than the previous videos because these videos show the effect of tasers when victims expect the shock with no heightened anxiety, stress, or emotions.

==Future Work==
Although the debate over the use of tasers is still ongoing, as can be seen by the evidence provided, the main concern over the usage of tasers and stun guns is regulation and its occurrence in the death of individuals during usage. These devices may be seen by many as a viable and more potent alternative to other forms of self defense, but only individuals who have experience and careful training with respect to the effects of this device should be entrusted with using them. Given all the social groups involved, by far the most important remain the police. The growth of the internet and other media channels has provided individuals a means to spread stories of brutality in most cases and heroism in far fewer. These channels are the greatest sources of influence to the public and with further investigation could possibly reveal more issues. Future contributions may examine studies on taser safety in more depth, as well as further research the impact of the media, [[Lentis/Social_Networks|social networks]], and [[Lentis/Wikipedia|wikipedia]] on society's perception of taser use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter discusses how to turn strings of text such as &quot;3*sin x + y&quot; into an abstract syntactic representation like Plus (Times (Number 3) (Apply &quot;sin&quot; (Variable &quot;x&quot;))) (Variable &quot;y&quot;).

We are going to use {{Haskell lib|p=base|v=latest|Text|ParserCombinators|ReadP}} throughout, so you will need to have the reference open to refer to.

== First Warmup ==

    import Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP

For a warmup, to get started on the problem, we first try an easier problem. A language where the symbols are just the letter &quot;o&quot;, a single operator &quot;&amp;&quot; and brackets. First define a data type for these trees:

    data Tree = Branch Tree Tree | Leaf deriving Show

Now a parser for leaves is defined using the ReadP library:

    leaf = do char 'o'
              return Leaf

now to define a parser for the branches, made up by &quot;&amp;&quot; operator we need to choose an associativity. That is, whether o&amp;o&amp;o should be the same as (o&amp;o)&amp;o or o&amp;(o&amp;o) - let us pick the latter.

For a first approximation we can forget about brackets, adding them in after the first &quot;milestone&quot;:

    branch = do a &lt;- leaf
                char '&amp;'
                b &lt;- tree
                return (Branch a b)
    
    tree = leaf +++ branch

It's now possible to test this out and see if it acts properly on a few inputs:

    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;o&quot;
    [(Leaf,&quot;&quot;)]
    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;o&amp;o&quot;
    [(Leaf,&quot;&amp;o&quot;),(Branch Leaf Leaf,&quot;&quot;)]
    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;o&amp;o&amp;o&quot;
    [(Leaf,&quot;&amp;o&amp;o&quot;),(Branch Leaf Leaf,&quot;&amp;o&quot;),(Branch Leaf (Branch Leaf Leaf),&quot;&quot;)]

Since that worked fine we can proceed to add support for parenthesis. Brackets are defined generally, so that we can reuse it later on

    brackets p = do char '('
                    r &lt;- p
                    char ')'
                    return r

We can now update the branch and tree parsers to support brackets:

    branch = do a &lt;- leaf +++ brackets tree
                char '&amp;'
                b &lt;- tree
                return (Branch a b)
    
    tree = leaf +++ branch +++ brackets tree

A bit of testing shows that it seems to work

    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;((o&amp;((o&amp;o)))&amp;o&amp;((o&amp;o)&amp;o)&amp;o)&quot;
    [(Branch (Branch Leaf (Branch Leaf Leaf)) (Branch Leaf (Branch (Branch (Branch Leaf Leaf) Leaf) Leaf)),&quot;&quot;)]

== Adaptation ==

This gives a good starting point for adaptation. The first modification towards the ultimate goal, which is quite easy to do, is changing the leaves from just &quot;o&quot; to any string. To do this we have change to `Leaf` to `Leaf String` in the data type and update the leaf function:

    data Tree = Branch Tree Tree | Leaf String deriving Show
    
    leaf = do s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
              return (Leaf s)

For the next adaptation we try and add a new operation &quot;|&quot; which binders weaker than &quot;&amp;&quot;. I.e. &quot;foo&amp;bar|baz&quot; should parse as &quot;(foo&amp;bar)|baz&quot;. First we need to update the data type representing syntax:

    data Operator = And | Or deriving Show
    
    data Tree = Branch Operator Tree Tree | Leaf String deriving Show

The obvious thing to do is duplicate the `branch` function and call it `andBranch` and `orBranch`, and give or precedence using the left choice operator `&lt;++`:

    andBranch = do a &lt;- leaf +++ brackets tree
                   char '&amp;'
                   b &lt;- tree
                   return (Branch And a b)
    
    orBranch = do a &lt;- leaf +++ brackets tree
                  char '|'
                  b &lt;- tree
                  return (Branch Or a b)
    
    tree = leaf +++ (orBranch &lt;++ andBranch) +++ brackets tree

This modification does not work though, if we think of an expression such as &quot;a&amp;b&amp;c&amp;d|e&amp;f&amp;g&amp;h|i&amp;j&amp;k|l&amp;m&amp;n&amp;o|p&amp;q&amp;r|s&quot; as a tree &quot;X|Y|Z|W|P|Q&quot; (which we already know how to parse!) except that the leaves are a more complicated form (but again, one we already know how to parse) then we can compose a working parser:

    andBranch = do a &lt;- leaf +++ brackets tree
                   char '&amp;'
                   b &lt;- andTree
                   return (Branch And a b)
    
    andTree = leaf +++ brackets tree +++ andBranch
    
    orBranch = do a &lt;- andTree +++ brackets tree
                  char '|'
                  b &lt;- orTree
                  return (Branch Or a b)
    
    orTree = andTree +++ brackets tree +++ orBranch
    
    tree = orTree

While this approach does work, for example:

    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;(foo&amp;bar|baz)&quot;
    [(Leaf &quot;&quot;,&quot;(foo&amp;bar|baz)&quot;),(Branch Or (Branch And (Leaf &quot;foo&quot;) (Leaf &quot;bar&quot;)) (Leaf &quot;baz&quot;),&quot;&quot;),(Branch Or (Branch And (Leaf &quot;foo&quot;) (Leaf &quot;bar&quot;)) (Leaf &quot;baz&quot;),&quot;&quot;)]
    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;(foo|bar&amp;baz)&quot;
    [(Leaf &quot;&quot;,&quot;(foo|bar&amp;baz)&quot;),(Branch Or (Leaf &quot;foo&quot;) (Branch And (Leaf &quot;bar&quot;) (Leaf &quot;baz&quot;)),&quot;&quot;),(Branch Or (Leaf &quot;foo&quot;) (Branch And (Leaf &quot;bar&quot;) (Leaf &quot;baz&quot;)),&quot;&quot;)]

it parses ambiguously, which is undesirable for efficiency reasons as well as hinting that we may have done something unnatural. Both `andTree` and `orTree` functions have `brackets tree` in them, since `orTree` contains `andTree` this is where the ambiguity creeps in. To solve it we simply delete from `orTree`.

    orTree = andTree +++ orBranch

== Structure Emerges ==

All the previous fiddling and playing has actually caused a significant portion of the structure of our final program to make its-self clear. Looking back at what was written we could quite easily extend it to add another operator, and another after that (Exercise for the reader: if it is not clear exactly how this would be done, figure it out and do it). A moments meditation suggests that we might complete this pattern and abstract it out, given an arbitrarily long list of operators

    operators = [(Or,&quot;|&quot;),(And,&quot;+&quot;)]

or perhaps

    data Operator = Add | Mul | Exp deriving Show
    
    operators = [(Add,&quot;+&quot;),(Mul,&quot;*&quot;),(Exp,&quot;^&quot;)]

the parser should be computed from it, nesting it (as we did manually in the past) so that parses happen correctly without ambiguity.

The seasoned haskell programmer will have already seen, in her minds eye, the following:

    tree = foldr (\(op,name) p -&gt;
                   let this = p +++ do a &lt;- p +++ brackets tree
                                       char name
                                       b &lt;- this
                                       return (Branch op a b)
                    in this)
                 (leaf +++ brackets tree)
                 operators

which is then tested.

    *Main&gt; readP_to_S tree &quot;(x^e*y+w^e*z^e)&quot;
    [(Leaf &quot;&quot;,&quot;(x^e*y+w^e*z^e)&quot;),(Branch Add (Branch Mul (Branch Exp (Leaf &quot;x&quot;) (Leaf &quot;e&quot;)) (Leaf &quot;y&quot;)) (Branch Mul (Branch Exp (Leaf &quot;w&quot;) (Leaf &quot;e&quot;)) (Branch Exp (Leaf &quot;z&quot;) (Leaf &quot;e&quot;))),&quot;&quot;)]

This is a good checkpoint to pause, in summary we have distilled the embryonic parser down to the following script:

    import Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP
    
    brackets p = do char '('
                    r &lt;- p
                    char ')'
                    return r
    
    data Operator = Add | Mul | Exp deriving Show
    operators = [(Add,'+'),(Mul,'*'),(Exp,'^')]
    
    data Tree = Branch Operator Tree Tree | Leaf String deriving Show
    
    leaf = do s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
              return (Leaf s)
    
    tree = foldr (\(op,name) p -&gt;
                   let this = p +++ do a &lt;- p +++ brackets tree
                                       char name
                                       b &lt;- this
                                       return (Branch op a b)
                    in this)
                 (leaf +++ brackets tree)
                 operators

== Whitespace and applicative notation ==

Since both the functional/applicative notation and ignoring whitespace depend on some of the same characters (space characters) it is a useful question to ask which should be implemented first, or whether it is not important which should be programmed first.

Considering the expression &quot;f  x&quot;, suggests that we should find how to parse whitespace before handling applicative notation, since once it has been dealt with function application should just correspond to simple juxtaposition (as intended).

There is a technical difficultly making our current parser ignore whitespace: if we were to make a `skipWhitespace` parser, and put it everywhere that whitespace could occur we would be inundated with ambiguous parses. Hence it is necessary to skip whitespace only in certain crucial places, for example we could pick the convention that whitespace is always skipped *before* reading a token. Then &quot; a + b * c &quot; would be seen by the parser chunked in the following way &quot;[ a][ +][ b][ *][ c][ ]&quot;. Which convention we choose is arbitrary, but ignoring whitespace before seems slightly neater, since it handles &quot; a&quot; without any complaints.

We define the following:

    skipWhitespace = do many (choice (map char [' ','\n']))
                        return ()

and update all the parses written before, so that they follow the new convention

    brackets p = do skipWhitespace
                    char '('
                    r &lt;- p
                    skipWhitespace
                    char ')'
                    return r
    
    leaf = do skipWhitespace
              s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
              return (Leaf s)
    
    tree = foldr (\(op,name) p -&gt;
                   let this = p +++ do a &lt;- p +++ brackets tree
                                       skipWhitespace
                                       char name
                                       b &lt;- this
                                       return (Branch op a b)
                    in this)
                 (leaf +++ brackets tree)
                 operators

In order to add applicative support clearly the syntax needs to allow for it:

    data Tree = Apply Tree Tree | Branch Operator Tree Tree | Leaf String deriving Show

This syntax tree will allow for sentences such as &quot;(x + y) foo&quot;, while this not correct other sentences like &quot;(f . g) x&quot; are commonplace in haskell - it should be the job of the type-checker to decide which is meaningful and which is not: This separation of concerns lets our problem (parsing) remain simple and homogeneous.

Our parser is essentially just two functions `leaf` and `tree` (`skipWhitespace` and `brackets` being considered &quot;library&quot; or helper functions). The function `tree` eats up all the operators it can, attaching leaves onto them as it can. While the `leaf` function could be thought of as reading in anything which doesn't have operators in it. Given this view of the program it is clear that to support applicative notation one needs to replace leaf with something that parses a chain of functional applications.

The obvious thing to try is then,

    leaf = chainl1 (do skipWhitespace
                       s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
                       return (Leaf s))
                   (return Apply)

and it is easily extended to support the &quot;commonplace&quot; compound sentences discussed earlier:

    leaf = chainl1 (brackets tree
                    +++ do skipWhitespace
                           s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
                           return (Leaf s))
                   (return Apply)

This is the problem completely solved! Our original goal is completed, one only needs to specify the operators they would like to have (in order) and write a traversal function converts the `Tree` into say mathematical expressions -- giving errors if unknown functions were used etc.

=== Making it Modular ===

The algorithms written are general enough to be useful in different circumstances, and even if they only had a single use -- if we were planning on using them in a larger program it is essential that we isolate the internals from the extenals (its interface).

&lt;code&gt;
 module Parser
  ( Tree(..), parseExpression
  ) where
 
 import Data.Maybe
 import Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP
 
 skipWhitespace = do many (choice (map char [' ','\n']))
                     return ()
 
 brackets p = do skipWhitespace
                 char '('
                 r &lt;- p
                 skipWhitespace
                 char ')'
                 return r
 
 data Tree op = Apply (Tree op) (Tree op) | Branch op (Tree op) (Tree op) | Leaf String deriving Show
 
 parseExpression operators = listToMaybe . map fst . filter (null .snd) . readP_to_S tree where
  leaf = chainl1 (brackets tree
                  +++ do skipWhitespace
                         s &lt;- many1 (choice (map char ['a'..'z']))
                         return (Leaf s))
                 (return Apply)
  tree = foldr (\(op,name) p -&gt;
                 let this = p +++ do a &lt;- p +++ brackets tree
                                     skipWhitespace
                                     char name
                                     b &lt;- this
                                     return (Branch op a b)
                  in this)
               (leaf +++ brackets tree)
               operators
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
=== What is performance? ===Performance management is the process of creating a work environment or setting in which people are enabled to perform to the best of their abilities. Performance management is a whole work system that begins when a job is defined as needed. It ends when an employee leaves your organization.

Many writers and consultants are using the term “performance management” as a substitution for the traditional appraisal system. I encourage you to think of the term in this broader work system context. A performance management system includes the following action.

== Definition of Performance Management ==
An effective performance management system aligns individual performance with the organisation's mission, vision and objectives. - American Compensation Association (1996)
== Characteristics of an ideal performance management system ==
==== Strategic Congruence ====
The strategic goals of the organisation should be linked to the goals of individuals and teams.
==== Standardization ====
If your evaluation criteria and methods are not standardized, you cannot say that you use them to hold your employees to a &quot;standard.&quot; The aspects of performance that you measure must be uniform, and you must strive to maintain a constant level of strictness. Varying your level of strictness or your methods will only lead to your employees lacking faith in their managers and in the system itself.
==== Validity and Conciseness ====
Performance management systems should only measure what is valid to the tasks at hand. Less is often more when it comes to selecting evaluation criteria. If you are evaluating customer-service representatives in a call center, do not evaluate them on their ability to operate heavy machinery.
==== Legality ====
Make sure that you are not evaluating your employees in an illegal manner. Consult an attorney before employing a questionable method of evaluation.
==== Due Process ====
As with criminal investigations, if employees receive sub-par evaluations, give them the chance to defend themselves. Make sure that management adequately informed them of expectations, that the company provided them with all necessary resources and that there is no mistake in the evaluation. Even in cases where employees are performing at an unacceptable level, allow for redemption and reform.
==== Proper Training for Evaluators ====
No performance management system can succeed when those carrying out evaluations are inadequately trained. Make sure that your evaluators fully understand the responsibilities of those whom they are evaluating. Have them work in that capacity for a short time if necessary. When possible, have those who have proven their ability to work well in that capacity perform the evaluations.
==== No Bias of Reward ====
Do not reward evaluators for finding negative or positive results, as this will skew their evaluations in either direction and lead to distrust between your employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boosting is one of the most important developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. This seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion.

== Technique/Algorithm ==

=== Algorithm === 

While boosting has evolved somewhat over the years, we describe the most commonly used version of the AdaBoost procedure (Freund and Schapire - 1996) which we call Discrete AdaBoost. This is essentially the same as AdaBoost.M1 for binary data in Freund and Schapire. Here is a concise description of AdaBoost in the two-class classification setting.We have training data &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1), ... , (x_n,y_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; a vector valued feature and &lt;math&gt;y_i = -1&lt;/math&gt; or 1. We define &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \sum_{1}^{M} c_mf_m&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a classifier producing values plus or minus 1 and &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;/math&gt; are constants; the corresponding prediction is sign &lt;math&gt;(F(x))&lt;/math&gt;. The AdaBoost trains the classifiers f_m(x) on weighted versions of the training sample, giving higher weight to cases that are currently misclassified. This is done for a sequence of weighted samples, and then the final classifier is defined to be a linear combination of the classifiers from each stage.

=== Implementation ===
Adaboost is part of ada package. In this section you find more information about installing and using it on R Environment.

Type the following commands in R console to install and load the ada package:

&lt;pre&gt;
install.packages(&quot;ada&quot;)
library(&quot;rpart&quot;)
library(&quot;ada&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The function used to execute the algorithm adaboost is:

&lt;pre&gt;
ada(x, y,test.x,test.y=NULL, loss=c(&quot;exponential&quot;,&quot;logistic&quot;), type=c(&quot;discrete&quot;, &quot;real&quot;, &quot;gentle&quot;), iter=50, nu=0.1, bag.frac=model.coef=TRUE, bag.shift=FALSE, max.iter=20, delta=10^(-10), verbose=...,na.action=na.rpart)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The arguments are:

&lt;pre&gt;
x: matrix of descriptors.

Y: vector of responses. ‘y’ may have only two unique values.

test.x: testing matrix of discriptors (optional)

test.y: vector of testing responses (optional)

loss: loss=&quot;exponential&quot;, &quot;ada&quot;,&quot;e&quot; or any variation corresponds to the default boosting
under exponential loss. loss=&quot;logistic&quot;,&quot;l2&quot;,&quot;l&quot; provides boosting under logistic
loss.

type: type of boosting algorithm to perform. “discrete” performs discrete Boosting
(default). “real” performs Real Boost. “gentle” performs Gentle Boost.

Iter: number of boosting iterations to perform. Default = 50.

Nu: shrinkage parameter for boosting, default taken as 1.

bag.frac: sampling fraction for samples taken out-of-bag. This allows one to use random
permutation which improves performance.

model.coef: flag to use stageweights in boosting. If FALSE then the procedure corresponds
to epsilon-boosting.

bag.shift: flag to determine whether the stageweights should go to one as nu goes to zero.
This only makes since if bag.frac is small. The rationale behind this parameter
is discussed in (Culp et al., 2006).

max.iter: number of iterations to perform in the newton step to determine the coeficient.

delta: tolarence for convergence of the newton step to determine the coeficient.

Verbose: print the number of iterations necessary for convergence of a coeficient.

Formula: a symbolic description of the model to be fit.

data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.

Subset: an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting
process.

na.action: a function that indicates how to process ‘NA’ values. Default=na.rpart.

...: arguments passed to rpart.control. For stumps, use rpart.control(maxdepth=1,cp=-
1,minsplit=0,xval=0). maxdepth controls the depth of trees, and cp
controls the complexity of trees. The priors should also be fixed through the
parms argument as discussed in the second reference.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Type the following command to show the result from this algorithm:

&lt;pre&gt;
summary(AdaObject)
varplot(VariableImportanceObject)
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using usage 'ada(x,y)': x data can take the form data.frame or as.matrix. y data can take form
data.frame, as.factor, as.matrix, as.array, or as.table. missing values must be removed from the data prior to execution. 

When using usage 'ada(y~.)': data must be in a data frame. Response can have factor or numeric values. missing values can be present in the descriptor data, whenever na.action is set to any option other than na.pass.

After the model is fit, 'ada' prints a summary of the function call, the method used for boosting, the number of iterations, the final confusion matrix (observed classification vs predicted classification; labels for classes are same as in response), the error for the training set, and testing, training , and kappa estimates of the appropriate number of iterations.

A summary of this information can also be obtained with the command ‘print(x)’.
Corresponding functions (Use help with summary.ada, predict.ada, . . . varplot for additional information on these commands):
summary : function to print a summary of the original function call, method used for boosting,
number of iterations, final confusion matrix, accuracy, and kappa statistic (a measure of agreement
between the observed classification and predicted classification). ‘summary’ can be used for training, testing, or validation data.

predict : function to predict the response for any data set (train, test, or validation)

plot : function to plot performance of the algorithm across boosting iterations. Default plot is
iteration number (x-axis) versus prediction error (y-axis) for the data set used to build the model. Function can also simultaneously produce an error plot for an external test set and a kappa plot for training and test sets.

pairs : function to produce pairwise plots of descriptors. Descriptors are arranged by decreasing
frequency of selection by boosting (upper left = most frequently chosen). The color of the marker in the plot represents class membership; the Size of the marker represents predicted class probability. The larger the marker, the higher the probability of classification.

varplot : plot of variables ordered by the variable importance measure (based on improvement).

addtest : add a testing data set to the ada object, therefore the testing errors only have to be
computed once.

update : add more trees to the ada object.

== Case Study ==

=== Scenario ===

A data set that contains information about compounds used in drug discovery. Specifically, this data set consists of 5631 compounds on which an in-house solubility screen (ability of a compound to dissolve in a water/solvent mixture) was performed. Based on this screen, compounds were categorized as either insoluble (n=3493) or soluble (n=2138). Then, for each compound, 72 continuous, noisy structural descriptors were computed. Of these descriptors, one contained missing values for approximately 14% (n=787) of the observations. The objective of the analysis is to model the relationship between the structural descriptors and the solubility class. The data will be called soldat.

=== Data ===
Input format:
&lt;pre&gt;
x1 a numeric vector

x18 a numeric vector
x19 a numeric vector
x20 a numeric vector
.
.
.
x72 a numeric vector with missing data
y a numeric vector
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Execution ===

&lt;pre&gt;
data(&quot;soldat&quot;)
n &lt;- nrow(soldat)
set.seed(100)
ind &lt;- sample(1:n)
trainval &lt;- ceiling(n * .5)
testval &lt;- ceiling(n * .3)
train &lt;- soldat[ind[1:trainval],]
test &lt;- soldat[ind[(trainval + 1):(trainval + testval)],]
valid &lt;- soldat[ind[(trainval + testval + 1):n],]

control &lt;- rpart.control(cp = -1, maxdepth = 14,maxcompete = 1,xval = 0)
gen1 &lt;- ada(y~., data = train, test.x = test[,-73], test.y = test[,73], type = &quot;gentle&quot;, control = control, iter = 70)
gen1 &lt;- addtest(gen1, valid[,-73], valid[,73])
summary(gen1)
varplot(gen1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Output ===
&lt;pre&gt;
Loss: exponential Method: gentle Iteration: 70
Training Results
Accuracy: 0.987 Kappa: 0.972
Testing Results
Accuracy: 0.765 Kappa: 0.487
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:VariableImportancePlot.png]]

=== Analysis ===
Testing accuracy rates are printed in the order they are entered so the accuracy on the testing
set is 0.765 and on the validation set 0.781.
For this type of early drug discovery data, the Gentle AdaBoost algorithm performs adequately
with test set accuracy of 76.5% (kappa is aproximately 0.5). In order to enhance our understanding regarding the relationship between descriptors and the response, the varplot function was employed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professional development (PD) is key to exposing teachers to new ideas, methods, and technologies.  Unfortunately, the great majority of school districts have ineffective design models for professional development.  School administrators have a great influence over professional development at their instritutions.  It is these individuals that will have to assume the role of instructional leaders and be the force that creates an effective PD model.  Effective professional development gives instructional staff the opportunity, skills, and knowledge necessary to teach children in the 21st century.

Python is a powerful, high-level, dynamic language. The version of Python used in Blender 2.5''x'' is version 3.1. If you are unfamiliar with Python, start with [http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/ this tutorial] at &lt;TT&gt;python.org&lt;/TT&gt;. If you are familiar with older (2.''x'') versions of Python, [http://docs.python.org/py3k/whatsnew/3.0.html this page] summarizes what’s new in 3.''x''.

If you are familiar with Python scripting in older versions of Blender, be aware that 2.5''x'' is completely different; the old &lt;TT&gt;Blender&lt;/TT&gt; module is gone. Much of the functionality is now available through the &lt;TT&gt;bpy&lt;/TT&gt; module, but don’t expect an exact 1:1 correspondence.

== First Steps In Blender Scripting ==

Open a new, default Blender document. If you haven’t customized your settings, there will be a Timeline window along the bottom; change this to a Python Console. Perhaps increase its height to let you see more lines at once.

To start with, let’s find out what objects are present in the document. At the “&gt;&gt;&gt;” prompt, type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
bpy.data.objects
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;bpy_collection[3], BlendData.objects&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
which isn’t actually all that informative. In fact what you have here is an ''iterator''; to see its contents, just do the usual Python thing and convert it to a list. Try entering this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list(bpy.data.objects) #or being lazy: bpy.data.objects[:]
&lt;/source&gt;
This time the response should be
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
[bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]]
&lt;/source&gt;
which shows you how to refer to the three default objects you can see in the 3D View window.

Let’s get a reference to the Cube object for more convenient access: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now let’s try querying the value of one of its attributes: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Vector((0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;Vector&lt;/TT&gt; type comes from the &lt;TT&gt;mathutils&lt;/TT&gt; module provided by Blender. But unlike &lt;TT&gt;bpy&lt;/TT&gt;, this is not automatically imported into the Python Console. So let’s bring it in for subsequent use: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import mathutils
&lt;/source&gt;
OK, now let’s try changing the location of the default Cube: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location += mathutils.Vector((1, 1, 1))
&lt;/source&gt;
(Note the doubled parentheses: &lt;TT&gt;mathutils.Vector&lt;/TT&gt; takes a ''single'' argument, which is a tuple of X, Y and Z coordinate values.)

Were you watching the 3D View when you pressed {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}? You should have seen the cube jump to a different position. To make it move again, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|UPARROW}} to bring back the above command, so you can execute it again with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. As soon as you do this, the cube will jump another step, like before. And that’s it—you’re scripting!

== The &lt;TT&gt;bpy&lt;/TT&gt; Module ==

The contents of the &lt;TT&gt;bpy&lt;/TT&gt; module are divided into several submodules (actually classes, but never mind), among which are:

* &lt;TT&gt;bpy.data&lt;/TT&gt; — This is where you find the contents of the current document.
* &lt;TT&gt;bpy.types&lt;/TT&gt; — information about the types of the objects in &lt;TT&gt;bpy.data&lt;/TT&gt;.
* &lt;TT&gt;bpy.ops&lt;/TT&gt; — ''operators'' perform the actual functions of Blender; these can be attached to hotkeys, menu items and buttons. And of course they can be invoked from a script. When you write an addon script, it will typically define new operators. Every operator must have a unique name.
* &lt;TT&gt;bpy.context&lt;/TT&gt; — contains settings like the current 3D mode, which objects are selected, and so on. Also accessible in the Console window via the global variable &lt;TT&gt;C&lt;/TT&gt;.
* &lt;TT&gt;bpy.props&lt;/TT&gt; — functions for defining ''properties''. These allow your scripts to attach custom information to a scene, that for example the user can adjust through interface elements to control the behaviour of the scripts.

== The &lt;TT&gt;mathutils&lt;/TT&gt; Module ==

The module &lt;TT&gt;mathutils&lt;/TT&gt; defines several important classes that are used heavily in the rest of the Blender API.

* &lt;TT&gt;Vector&lt;/TT&gt;: the representation of 2D or 3D coordinates.
* &lt;TT&gt;Matrix&lt;/TT&gt;: the most general way of representing any kind of linear transformation.
* &lt;TT&gt;Euler&lt;/TT&gt;: a straightforward way of representing rotations as a set of ''Euler angles'', which are simply rotation angles about the X, Y and Z axes. Prone to well-known pitfalls such as [[w:Gimbal_lock|gimbal lock]].
* &lt;TT&gt;Quaternion&lt;/TT&gt;: on the face of it, a more mathematically abstruse way of representing rotations. But in fact this has many nice properties, like absence of gimbal lock, and smoother interpolation between two arbitrary rotations. The latter is particularly important in character animation.
* &lt;TT&gt;Color&lt;/TT&gt;: a representation of RGB colours and conversion to/from HSV space (no alpha channel).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The neuron is a cell that transmits information via electrical and chemical signaling throughout the nervous system. There are many different neurons of various sizes and function. 

== Components ==
[[Image:Neuron0.jpg|thumb|Neuron Structure: 1-Dendrites, 2-Axon, 3-Node of Ranvier, 4-Axon Terminal, 5-Schwann's Cell, 6-Cell Body, 7-Nucleus]]
All the brain and nervous system are based on communication among nerve cells, known as neurons. Each neuron is like any other cell in the body. Each neuron is surrounded by a membrane and filled with liquid and has a nucleus containing its genetic material. Neurons are specialized to receive and transmit information. All of the neurons gather information either from other cells of the body or from the environment. They transmit information to other neurons and/or other kinds of cells. A typical neuron has an enlarged area, which is the cell body. The cell body contains the nucleus. Neurons have branches or nerve fibers. The branches on which information is received are known as dendrites. The dendrites are a branched structure that receives signals from other cells. Each neuron has a longer taillike structure, or axon. The axon transmits information to other cells. Axons can be branched at the tips. The axons of many kinds of neurons are surrounded by a fatty, segmented covering called the myelin sheath. The covering acts as a kind of insulation and improves the ability of axons to carry nercous system signals rapidly. A single neuron may be capable of receiving messages simultaneously on its dendrites and cell body from several thousand different cells. Most neurons usually have a soma, dendrites, axons, and a terminal button. The soma is the cell body of the neuron, and it contains the nucleus and is responsible for many of the processes of the cell.

==Classification==
	
Classification can categorize neurons based on their number of extensions from the cell body and their function:



'''Sensory neurons''' receive sensory signals from sensory organs. These signals are then sent to the central nervous system via short axons. These neurons are also called '''Pseudo-unipolar neurons''' due to their short extension that divides into two branches. One of these two branches functions as an axon, while the other functions as a dendrite.



'''motor neurons''' are neurons that control motor movements of the body. It takes commands from the cortex and sends the signal to the spinal cord, or to the spinal cord to the muscles. These neurons are also called '''multlipolar neurons''' due to its one long axon and their short dendrites extending from the cell body.



'''Interneurons''' also called, associated neurons, are neurons that interconnect various neurons within the brain or spinal chord. Majority of these neurons are seen in the brain, connecting to one another tightly. These neurons are used for relaying information and conducting signals between other neurons. Interneurons may also be called '''bipolar neurons''' due to their two main extensions. These extensions have a similar length
bipolar neurons that have two main extensions of similar lengths

Interneurons can be either efferent neurons or afferent neurons.

==Neuron Classification==
Neurons can be organized in two ways: 1) based on their anatomy and 2) based on their function in the brain. Neurons can be Pseudounipolar, bipolar, anaxonic or multipolar. Pseuounipolar neurons have a single axon and their soma are off to the side. Bipolar neurons have axons extending off both sides of the soma. Anaxonic neurons have no obvious axon but have a soma and dendrites. Multipolar neurons do not have long axons, but have extremely branched dendrites. Pseudounipolar and bipolar neurons are sensory (or afferent) neurons. Anaxonic and multipolar neurons are interneurons within the Central Nervous System. Multipolar neurons also function as efferent neurons.  

== Neuron Degradation ==
Phagoptosis of neurons in the brain is specifically detrimental due to the fact of the brains limited capacity to replace neurons. Viable neurons are phagocytosized by lipopolysaccharide or LPS. Microalgia is responsible for the eating of viable neurons, but it is also responsible for eating apoptopic neurons which may be beneficial because it may reduce debris and inflammation. Inflammation in the brain can cause microalgia to eat viable neurons, however this can be blocked by blocking phagooptic signaling. Microalgia also kills developing neurons in the protein in the cerebellum and hippocampus. 

== Synapse ==
The synapse is a junction between the terminal button of an axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron. In this junction, one neuron sends information to another neuron via electrical or chemical signaling. The process for sending information is called [[Structural Biochemistry/Action Potential|action potential]] where electrical impulses are sent down an axon of a neuron.

Also, synapse is a small gap, or commonly referred to as a connection, between two cells that allows for the first cell (the presynaptic cell) to communicate with the second cell (the postsynaptic cell) through a chemical signal. These chemical signals are called neurotransmitters, and once they are released by the presynaptic cell, they act on the postsynaptic cell through specialized protein molecules called neurotransmitter receptors. 

A synapse is a connection which allows for the transmission of nerve impulses. Synapses can be found at the points where nerve cells meet other nerve cells, and where nerve cells interface with glandular and muscular cells. In all cases, this connection allows for the one-way movement of data. The human body contains trillions of synapses, and at any given time, huge numbers of these connections are active.

==Axonal Transport==
Axons lack ribosomes and an endoplasmic reticulum and because of this, the cell body must synthesize proteins and send them through the axon via axonal transport. There are two main types of axonal transport: slow and fast. Slow axonal transport is used for moving proteins through the axon that are not used up quickly by the cell, such as enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins. Fast axonal transport is used for moving proteins down the axon that are needed much more quickly in the cell, such as organelles.

'''Microtubules and Their Role in Axonal Transport'''

Microtubules provide a crucial role in fast axonal transport systems that supply synaptic vesicles with vital chemical messengers by providing the long cells with highways for material to be transported through.  Two families of proteins, Dynein and Kinesin, are in charge of vesicle transportation through microtubules.  With Dynein being charge of retrograde transport and Kinesin being in charge of ante-retrograde transportation, their combined proportions provides the axon with variability in transport velocity as well as the potential for intentional halts in vesicle transport.


==Information Processing==
&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Neil and Reece, Jane. (2007). Biology 8th Edition.Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Co. ISBN 978-0321543257 &lt;/ref&gt;

Information processing is the brain's process of interpreting the receiving information and knowledge. There are three stages in information processing: sensory input, integration, and motor input. There are also different types of neurons in the information processing. They are sensory neurons, interneurons, motor neurons, and neurons coming out of the brain. Sensory neurons transmit information from sensors like the ears that detect stimuli like sound. Interneurons are neurons that make up most of the neurons in the brain. Motor neurons are the ones transmit signals to muscle cells so that they can contract. Lastly, neurons that come out of the brain are nerves that instigate the reaction or motor output. In addition, there are two main nervous systems that help to interpret the information. They are the central and peripheral nervous systems. Central nervous system consist of the brain and the nerve cord where the neurons that are in charge of integration are here. And the peripheral nervous system consists of neurons that receive sensory input and result in the motor output. 
[[File:Information processing system (english).svg|thumbnail|right|Information processing ]]

==Chemical Signaling==
Chemical signaling is the physical chemical interchange that takes place in the synaptic cleft.  Vesicles containing neurotransmitters are released by an incoming axon and received by receptors on opposing ends to induce a response on the recipient neuron. Chemical signaling via molecules secreted from the cells and moving through the extracellular space. Signaling molecules may also remain on cell surfaces, influencing other cells. Chemical signaling can involve small molecules (ligands) or large molecules (cell-surface signaling proteins). This signaling can be received either on the surface of cells by receptor proteins or within the interior of cells but also by receptor proteins. An example can be within-cell reception of signals is of steroid hormones. Signals also can be intentionally provided, such as is the case of hormones, or instead can be present for reasons that are not specifically for the purpose of providing a signal. The example can be carbon dioxide levels in blood.  


[[File:Synapse diagram.png|thumb|The movement of neurotransmitters in a synaptic cleft]]

==Glial Cells==
Glial cells are not neurons. They significantly outnumber neurons and are therefore vital to the role of the nervous system. It was previously thought that Glial cells merely aided with physical support within the nervous system. However, Glial cells actually electrically communicate with neurons and provide important biochemical support to them. Common types of Glial cells include 1. oligodendrocytes 2. astrocytes 3. microglia and 4. ependymal cells, all of which are found in the Central Nervous System. Glial cells found within the Peripheral Nervous System include 5.Schwann Cells and 6. satellite glial cells. 

1. Oligodendrocytes
: Oligodendrocytes are one of the types of the neuroglial cells that is mainly responsible for myelinating central axons in central nervous system. Myelination refers to the act of oligodendrocytes wrapping around the axon with myelin sheath that is made of lipid and protein. Myelination of the oligodendrocytes have crucial effects on the transmission of neural signals by increasing the speed at which action potentials are conducted along axons. This action allows the neural signal to travel long distance with short energy and time.

[[File:Astrocytes.jpg|thumb|Astrocytes stained for GFAP, with end-feet ensheathing blood vessels
]]

2. Astrocytes
: Astrocytes constitute 20-50% of the volume in most brain areas, especially in the central nervous system. It is mainly responsible for the physical and metabolic support of the brain. It has many other functions including generating numerous proteins such as N-CAM, laminin, fibronectin, growth factos as ell as cytokines, which is responsible for signaling proteins involved in the immune system.  

3. Microglia
: Microglia is one type of the neuroglial cells that is mainly responsible for acting as macrophages. Microglia takes up about 5-20% of the mammal brains that act as mediators of immune response. Microglia cells constantly move around within the central nervous systems analyzing for damaged neurons, plaques, and infectious agents.

4.Ependymal cells
: Epedymal cells aid in separating the fluid components of the Central Nervous system by creating an epithial layer and are also a source of neural stem cells. Epedymal cells in the ventricular system of the brain form capillaries that form chroid plexus in each ventricle of the each hemisphere of the brain. Chroid Plexus then produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 60-80% of CSF comes from chroid plexus and rest from extrachrodial sources. 

5.Schwann cells
: Schwann cells' functions are very similar to oligodendrocytes. They myelinate neurons within the peripheral nervous systems instead of the neurons in the central nervous system. The main difference is that schwann cells are about 100 micrometres long that only covers the portion of the axons individually whereas one oligodendrocytes can mylinate multiple axons by stretching out their dendrites. 

6. Satellite glial cells
: Satellite glial cells are a type of glial cells that ocver the exterior side of neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Satellite glial cells' functions are similar to astrocytes in the central nervous system. Although there is still ongoing research to discover the specific functions and mechanisms, it is so far discovered that the satellite glial cells supply nutrients to the peripheral neurons as well as regulating neurotransmitter by uptaking and inactivating the neurotransmitters.

==Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)==
Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) is bodily fluid that circulates around the nervous system and throughout body that is produced in choroid plexus of each ventricle system of the brain. It is commonly used for diagnostic information about the normal and pathological states of the nervous system.

Funtions of CSF:

1. It provides buoyancy and support to brain and chord that protects against rapid movements and trauma.

2. The fluid delivers nutrition for both neurons in both CNS and PNS and for other glial cells. 

3. It functions like lymphatic system and removes wastes out from the nervous system.

4. It controls homeostasis of the ionic composition of the local microenviroment of the cells of the nervous system.

5. It acts as a transport system for releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, metabolites.

6. The fluid controls H+ and CO2 concentrations (pH levels) in the CSF that may affect both pulmonary ventilation and cerebral blood flow.

7. The fluid is essential in medical fields in which it provides diagnostic information about the nervous system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Neurotransmitters == 
A neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released by a terminal button and has an excitatory or inhibitory effect on another neuron. There are many types of neurotransmitters. There are currently over 100 known agents that serve as neurotransmitters.

A '''brain circuit''' is a neurotransmitter current or neural pathway in the brain.

By mimicking a neurotransmitter's effect, '''agonist''' will enhance and increase the activity of that neurotransmitter while, on the other hand, '''antagonist''' will decreases or blocks the effects of a neurotransmitter. 

Another chemical substance calls '''inverse agonist''' is responsible for producing effects opposite to those of a particular neurotransmitter.
 
Neurotransmitters Activities:

Neurotransmitters are stored in tiny sacs at the end of the neuron and are released into the synapse as the sacs merge with the outer membrane by an electric jolt. The neurotransmitters travel across the gap to bind with receptors. The neurotransmitters are released from the receptors after the messages has been successfully absorbed by the adjacent neuron. After that, those chemical substances are either degraded or reabsorbed back to the neuron where they come from.

== What makes neurotransmitter different from other chemical signaling system?==
There are many other signaling system of chemicals such as hormones, neurohormone, and paracrine signaling. However neurotrasmitters have advantages in having a greater degree of amplification and control of the signal. It also lengthens the time of cellular integration from miliseconds to minutes and even hours. While hormones are mainly synthesized in gland, neurotransmitters are synthesized and released from neurons. Neurotrasmitters are, as far as we know, only released in response to an electrical signal. There are many mechanisms that must exist to terminate the action of the neurotrasmitters such as chemical deactivation, recapture (endocytosis), glial uptake and diffusion.

==Exocytosis of Neurotransmitters Release==

Exocytosis is a process by which vesicles release their contents. Between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, certain neurotransmitters are carried out within vesicles from presynaptic neurons are released to the synaptic cleft. In order to do so, first there is a influx of Ca++ ions takes place through voltage gated calcium channels in the presynaptic site. The calcium ions intering the cells affect the movements of the vesicles toward the active sites by dissolving some actin filaments. It also helps the fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane in the presynaptic side. As the vesicles fuse, the neurotranmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, then which binds to the corresponding recepters on the possynaptic neuron.

==Categories of Neurotransmitters==
Neurotransmitters are separated into two very broad categories based on their size: neuropeptides and small-molecule neurotransmitters.

===Neuropeptides===
Neuropeptides are generally large molecules that range from 3 to 30 amino acids and consists of over 100 peptides. They are grouped into five categories: brain/gut peptides, opioid peptides, pituitary peptides, hypothalamic releasing hormones, and everything else.  Neuropeptides are genetically coded, synthesized from mRNA as prohormones. They are mostly colocalized with and modulate effects of other neurotrasmitters rather than directly presenting the effects. There is no uptake of the NTs, but rather they are borken down by enzymes.

Neuropeptides include large molecules of opiods that include:

1. Beta-Endorphin
- made from proopiomelanocortin
- produced in pituitary gland, hypothalamus, brain stem

2. Met and Leu Enkephalin
- made from proenkephalin
- produced throughout brain and spinal cord

3. Dynorphin
- ade from prodynorphin
- produced throughout brain and spinal cord

===Small-Molecule Neurotransmitters===
Small-molecule neurotransmitters are much smaller than neuropeptides and may consist of a single amino acid or other molecule. The biogenic amines are a group within the small-molecule transmitters that consists of the catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine), serotonin, and histamine.

==== Acetylcholine ====

[[File:Acetylcholine.svg|thumb|Acetylcholine]]

===== Definition and function ===== 
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a very significant role in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acetylcholine plays a very big role in the movement of muscles in the peripheral nervous system. Acetylcholine also seems to be released in a variety of areas in the autonomic branch of the peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system, acetylcholine plays a role in plasticity, arousal, reward, attention, and REM sleep. 

=====Metabolism=====
The synthesis of acetylcholine takes place in the nerve terminals. This process requires acetyl coenzyme A (also called acetyl CoA) and choline. Acetyl CoA is synthesized from glucose during glycolysis, and choline is already present in plasma. The synthesis of acetylcholine further requires choline acetyltransferase. After the synthesis, the ACh is then loaded into synaptic vesicles and released from the presynaptic terminal to the postsynaptic cell. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE) responds to the released acetylcholine and hydrolyzes the molecules back into choline and acetyl CoA. The choline is then transported back to the presynaptic terminal and recycled to resynthesize new ACh. The cleanup of old acetylcholine is the job of acetylcholinesterase.

===== Drugs that affect release of acetylcholine ===== 
Two drugs that influence the release of acetylcholine are botulinum toxin and black widow spider venom. Botulinum toxin is produced by a bacteria called ''clostridium botulinum'' that grows in improperly canned food. Botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Black widow spider venom is produced by the black widow spider and it increases the release of acetylcholine.

====Receptors====
There are two types of receptor sites that are sensitive to acetylcholine.

1. Muscarinic Receptors
- It is named so because they are responsive to the drug muscarine. Muscarinic receptors are mostly located in the parasympathetic automic nervous system. If a drug is antimuscarnic, that means that it interferes with the role of acetylcholine in stimulating parasympathetic reations of the body. Examples are atropine and scopolamine. Atropine, when applied to the eyes, for examples, causes the pupils to dialte by inhibiting the parasympathetic tendency for the pupils to constrict.

2. Nicotinic Receptors.
- They are responsive to nicotine that are found near the end points of motor neurons where skeletal muscles are innervated as well as thourghout the cerebral cortex. Some antinicotinic drugs such as the poison curare, affect these motor neurons so dramatically that the body can become paralyzed.

====Glutamate====
[[File:Glutamic Acid.png|thumb|150px|Glutamic Acid]]
Glutamate is a key component in normal brain function. It is believed that over half the synapses that occur in the brain release glutamate as a neurotransmitter. 
It is discovered in 1907 by Kikunae Ikeda and was identified as a neurotransmitter in 1970s by Peter Usherwood,  is an excitatory relative of GABA. Excessive amount of glutamate (usually come from brain damage or a stroke) is very toxic to neurons and may results in brain cells death. Example for disease of excessive glutamate production is ALS, a degenerative neuromuscular disease.

''Characteristics of Glutamate''
1. Glutamate is an principal excitatory neurotransmitter that is biosynthesized as byproduct of glucose metabolism.
2. Excess of glutamate can be neurotoxic.
3. Glutamate has 4 receptor types:
   a. NMDA Receptor
      - NMDA is an ionotropic receptor that detects simultaneous events. 
      - The receptor is gated by comnination of voltage and ligand channels. Glutamate plus glycine binding opens channel to Ca++ for influx
      - The effect mediates learning and memory through long term potentiation that essentially deals with psychological addiction,   behavioral sensitization, and drug craving. 
   b. AMPAa Receptor
   c. Kainate
   d. AMPAb

=====Metabolism=====
The synthesis of glutamate is done locally from precursors such as glutamine, which comes from glial cells. The glutamine is released into the presynaptic terminal and synthesized into glutamate using an enzyme called glutaminase. The newly synthesized glutamate is then transported from the presynaptic terminal and across the synaptic cleft in synaptic vesicles. After release from the vesicles, the glutamate is then transported to the glial cells and converted into glutamine. This process is called the glutamate-glutamine cycle. 

[[File:GABA.svg|thumb|left|γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)]]

====GABA====
GABA (or gamma-Aminobutyric acid) is used frequently in inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system. It is most commonly found in local circuit interneurons.  

GABA is an inhibiting neurotransmitter which is best known for its ability to reduce anxiety by reducing postsynaptic activity. However, GABA's effect is not only to anxiety but has a broader influence. The GABA system is spread throughout the brain. Different types of GABA receptors seem to act in different ways which leads to the conclusion that GABA is not just one system working in only one manner but is composed of several subsystems. 
=====Metabolism===
GABA synthesis requires glucose, which metabolizes to glutamate. An enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) then converts the glutamate into GABA. GAD requires a cofactor called pyridoxal phosphate to work properly. A deficiency in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in which pyridoxal phosphate is derived from, would prevent the synthesis of GABA from glutamate. After the GABA has been released and used, the GABA is then transported to glial cells via synaptic vesicles specifically for GABA, called GATs. There, the GABA is then converted into succinate.

====Glycine==== 
Glycine is a neutral amino acid that is also distributed within the central nervous system. It is synthesized from serine using an enzyme called serine hydroxymethyltransferase and then transported to be released from the pre-synaptic terminal in synaptic vesicles called GATs. After the release of glycine, plasma membrane transporters remove it from the synaptic cleft. 

====Biogenic Amines====
[[File:Dopamine.png|thumb|Dopamine]]
[[File:Epinephrine.svg|thumb|Epinephrine]] 
The biogenic amines are sometimes classified as a separate group from the small-molecule neurotransmitters. They regulate many functions of both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Many psychiatric disorders occur because of defects in the synthesis or the pathways of the biogenic amines. There are five known biogenic amine transmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine (all together known as the catecholamines), histamine, and serotonin. The catecholamines are all synthesized from tyrosine.

=====Dopamine=====
Dopamine is most present in the corpus striatum, which plays a key role in the coordination of body movements. It is synthesized from tyrosine with the help of DOPA decarboxylase. It is then transported to the pre-synaptic terminals in synaptic vesicles called vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT).

A defect in dopamine production is a cause for Parkinson's disease. It is also involved in the reward centers of the brain, and many drugs used for abuse target the dopamine synapses in the central nervous system.
=====Prostaglandins=====
A chemical messengers that work right within the cells where they are synthesized.

'''Structure:'''It is an unsaturated carboxylic acids derived from arachidonic acid. The numerous functional groups in prostaglandin contribute to its variety functions in the body; there are 2 alkenes group (one cis and one trans), 2 alcohols, a ketone, and one acid on a 20 carbon skeleton with a five member ring. 

'''Function:'''  It stimulates inflammation process, responds to injury by producing pain or infection by producing  fever. It forms blood clots when blood vessel is damaged. Specific prostaglandins are involved with the induction of labor and reproductive processes. 

=====Norepinephrine=====
Norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is used in the locus coeruleus in the brain. It is involved in behaviors related to sleeping, attention, and feeding. The synthesis of norepinephrine requires an enzyme called dopamine-β-hydroxylase to convert dopamine to norepinephrine.

Norepinephrine is a part of the endocrine system that seems to stimulate at least two group of receptors called alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. In the central and peripheral nervsous system, several norepinephrine circuits have been identified which actively helps our body tp control heart rate, blood pressure, respiration. One of the norepinephrine circuit is associated with the emergency reactions or alarm responses. Thus, it may indirectly plays an important role in panic attacks and other disorders.
Norepinephrine is concetrated in the hypothalamus and libic system but also found throughout the brain. 
[[File: File:Norepinephrine Structure.png thumb Norepinephrine Structure |framed|Norepinephrine Structural Rendering]]

=====Epinephrine=====
Epinephrine (or adrenaline) is also found in the brain. It is the least abundant of the three catecholamines in the brain. Epinephrine is mostly located in the medulla, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus. Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase catalyzes norepinephrine to convert it to epinephrine. 

=====Histamine=====
Histamine is found in the hypothalamus and sends signals to the central nervous system. It is involved in arousal and attention as well as the vestibular system. Histamine is synthesized from the histidine

=====Serotonin=====
Serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine) is found in the pons and upper brainstem. It is involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan. 

Serotonergic pathways are a topic of interest when it comes to studies of depression and anxiety. Drugs to treat these disorders often target these pathways.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytrytamine or 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that is associated with the processing of information and coordination of movement, inhibition, restraint, assists the regulation of eating, sexual, and aggressive behaviors. There are at least 15 different serotonin receptors that play different function in our body. Several of drugs affect the serotonin system. For example, serotonin-specific inhibitors (SSRIs),which enhances serotonin's effects by preventing it from being absorbed,
are used to treat particularly anxiety, mood, and eating disorder.

Serotonin is very important to psychopathology because it may involves in different psychological disorders. Low serotonin activity will lead to aggression, suicide, impulsive overeating, excessive sexual behavior. Moreover, Its interaction with dopamine is implicated in schizophrenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Neuroscience is a science that describes the study of the nervous system. It involves studying its anatomy, chemistry, physiology, development, and functioning. It is an interdisciplinary science that involves psychology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, philosophy and medicine. It should be noted that there is a difference between neuroscience and neurobiology. Neurobiology specifically refers to the biology of the nervous system whereas neuroscience refers to the entire science (chemistry, physics, etc.) of the nervous system. Neuroscience has become a enormously popular field in the last few years; for example, the Society for Neuroscience currently has about 30,000-40,000 members, maybe more. 

== Alzheimer's Disease ==
Alzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia. It is a degenerative, terminal disease that is currently incurable. Death of neurons in the hippocampus of the brain causes memory impairment in those with Alzheimer’s disease.  As the neurons degenerate, neurofibrillary tangles develop. Neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular accumulations of hyperphosphorylataed tau. There is now evidence that a truncated p73 isoform, ΔNp73, protect the neurons against tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation. It prevents tangle formation by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, ΔNp73 protects neurons against cell death by antagonizing p53. P53 mediates programmed cell-death in a process called apoptosis. It kills neurons by inducing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. P53 over expression results in tau hyperphosphorylation in cells. The new discovery that ΔNP73 protects neurons from tau hyperphosphorylation as well as tangle formation provides insight for potential therapeutic roles of ΔNp73 inducers. Drugs can be developed to enhance the neuroprotective actions of ΔNp73.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) seems to be initiated by the dysfunctional activities of two proteinases (γ- and β-secretase) which generate a series of aggregation-prone peptides called Aβ from their substrate, amyloid precursor protein (APP).  The amount of Aβ peptides that accumulates is believed to be the main factor that induces neuronal dysfunction and death.

== Parkinson's Disease ==

Parkinson's disease is a motor disorder caused by the death of neurons in the midbrain area. These neurons are typically capable of releasing dopamine, a biogenic amide neurotransmitter, at synapses located in the basal nuclei. When the neurons are destroyed, nerve cells are no longer able to send signals that allow for communication between the substantia nigra and corpus stritatum in the brain. Lack of these signals affect the control of muscle movement. The symptoms that result include tremors in the limb or muscle, slowed movement and poor balance. Currently, little is known about the cause for the destruction of neurons and why Parkinson's disease occurs. However, molecular studies have been able to link genetics to rare cases that occur in young adults. Consequently, this has led to the belief that this disease may be inherited although there is still much controversy surrounding this discussion. Scientists are also determining whether or not defects in genes required for mitochondrial function has also been linked to and early onset of this disease.

Similar to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease is more common as people get older. For adults at age 65, around 1% are at risk for Parkinson's while at age 85, this rises to 5%. There are nearly 1 million people in the US today that suffer from Parkinson's disease. There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease. However, there are methods used to maintain the symptoms that include brain surgery, drugs that have the ability to be converted into dopamine and cross the blood brain barrieras well as deep brain stimulation. In laboratories, scientists have also experimented using rats with a similar induced condition. They place dopamine secreting neurons in the midbrain or basal nuclei that help control motor functions. Whether or not this technique would work on humans is still being researched.

The '''ZZ Method''' or '''Zbigniew Zborowski Method''' is a fast method for solving the [[w:Rubik's Cube|Rubik's Cube]] created in [[w:2006|2006]]. It consists of three different steps: EOLine (Edge Orientation Line), F2L (First Two Layers), and LL (Last Layer).

== EOLine ==
For this step, practice by putting a finger on every bad edge you see. After some practicing, try to remember where the bad edges are instead. You should check the edges during your 3-15 inspection time if you want to finish the cube quickly. A misoriented edge will be referred to as a bad edge. Look at the top and bottom faces of the cube. If you see an orange or red sticker on an edge, it's bad. If you see a green or blue sticker on an edge, look at the other sticker on it. If the other sticker is white or yellow, it's bad. Now look at the front and back faces of the middle layer. The same rules apply. If you see an orange or red sticker on an edge, it's bad. If you see a green or blue sticker on an edge, look at the other sticker on it. If the other sticker is white or yellow, it's bad.</text>

      <comment>/* Go, the language */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Go, the language ==
Go is a general purpose programming language, good for many different computing tasks.  Some of its features follow familiar paths of well established languages.  Other features though, are unique and innovative, and aimed at improving programmer productivity.  It is designed to be both easy and effective for all sizes of programming projects, from the smallest to the largest.

It is a relatively new language, being first introduced publicly in 2009.  Why could the world possibly need a new programming language in 2009?  Mostly because of some big changes recently in the world of computing, but also in a conscious effort to shape the software development process.  Go aims to relieve programmers of work that is tedious, distracting, and error-prone.

One big change in the world of computing is the ubiquity of multi-core processors.  The most popular programming languages today were designed when processors did only one thing at a time.  Go is designed from the start as a concurrent language.  The concurrency features of Go are based on well-accepted theoretical foundation, and based on experience with concurrency features other languages.  The result is a fresh treatment that is both powerful and intuitive.

Another big change is the scale of programming that exists today.  Large programs today are tens or even hundreds of thousands of lines of source code.  It turns out to take immense computer power to compile these programs.  We say that the task doesn't ''scale'' well.  That is, compiling a program twice as big doesn't just take twice as long, but often many times longer.  Go was designed to address some of the most obvious scaling issues.  The example programs in this book are small and do not highlight this feature of Go.  Once you start writing large programs of your own however, you will appreciate how quickly Go compiles, and how easily large programs can be built.

Large programs present challenges for computers, but they present even greater challenges for programmers.  Principles of object oriented programming have been explored widely in the last decade for taking on these challenges.  Some of these object oriented principles have been spectacularly successful, while others have tended to mire programmers in complexity.  Go boldly rejects certain features that many would consider standard or even essential features of object oriented programming.  Rather, it focuses on a small and carefully selected set of features.  The goal is to provide a minimal set of features that provide all the expressiveness needed for programs of any size.

== Purpose of this book ==
Teach the base language, common idioms, and elementary concurrency techniques. (I have a pretty good grasp of that. I'm less familiar with libraries, web programming, large projects, concurrency theory, etc.)
== What is covered ==
Installation. All elements of the language definition, and common idioms. Concurrency. Attention to speed and memory. Essential commands. Simple build techniques. Web resources and services. Core general purpose packages and functions from the standard library.
== Who should read this book ==
People with prerequisites of basic skills with a computer, operating system, and an editor. Beginning and novice level programmers who wish to learn Go and increase programming skills to a level where they can become productive at solving real problems. Intermediate level and experienced programmers who wish to acquire a thorough base knowledge of the Go language. Programmers with no or little experience in concurrent programming. Programmers who may be skilled in some form of concurrent programming but are interested in Go's concurrency paradigm.

Concept for audience target: Body text assumes novice level programming skill. Some sidebars offer background information for true beginners. Other sidebars are aimed at programmers skilled in specific languages point out where Go differs in some important way from what they are used to. Sidebars are labeled or somehow differentiated so the different audiences can recognize at a glance if it is of likely interest to them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors&lt;/big&gt;'''

==Overview==
2-5% of male germ cell tumors are extragonadal.

==Treatment==
*'''Multi-institutional; 2002''' (1975-96) PMID 11919246 -- &quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors of the mediastinum and retroperitoneum: results from an international analysis.&quot; (Bokemeyer C, J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr 1;20(7):1864-73.)
**Retrospective. 635 pts. 11 institutions (US, Europe). 
**341 pts (54%) primary mediastinal EGCT, 283 (45%) retroperitoneal EGCT. 83% nonseminoma, 16% seminoma. Median age 30 yrs. Treatment was platinum-based chemotherapy. 
**''Seminoma:'' Chemotherapy alone 74%, RT alone 9%, chemo + RT 17%. CR in 65%. Secondary surgical resection in 25 (24%). 5-yr PFS 88% (mediastinal) and 77% (retroperitoneal). OS 88% (both). 
**''Non-seminoma (mediastinal):'' Chemotherapy 98%. RT in &lt;1%. Favorable response (PR or CR with normal tumor markers) in 64%. 49% underwent secondary resection. PFS 44%. OS 45%.
**''Non-seminoma (retroperitoneal):'' Chemotherapy 98%. RT in &lt;1%. Localized disease in only 24%. Response rate 68%. 45% underwent secondary resection. PFS 45%. OS 62%.
**Conclusion: Outcome is inferior for pts with nonseminomatous EGCTs.

      <comment>Negative speeds in traffic jams?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Under &quot;Traditional Model (Parabolic)&quot;, the last bullit says:

&quot;The slope of the flow density curve gives speed. Rise/Run = Flow/Density = Vehicles per hour/ Vehicles per km = km / hour.&quot;

Sure, the unit is speed.  But the flow density curve has two areas (C and D) with negative slope.  Whose speed is being measured?  Because there is generally no vehicle whose speed is negative.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Happy slapping''' is a fad in which someone assaults an unwitting victim while others record the assault (commonly with a camera phone or a smartphone). 

Filming attacks seems to be common in modern bullying, and not unique to happy slapping. The core defining feature of happy slapping is an effort by the attacker to make the assault seem like a comical surprise at the victim's expense. 


When the &quot;happy slapping&quot; craze first started, it was seen amongst youngsters as harmless fun. Despite the increased level of violence, this perception sometimes persists. Often those found performing such activities will say they were just &quot;happy slapping&quot;, asserting their belief that no significant harm was caused to the victim- often contradicting empirical evidence- with the stated premise typically being that the violence had been a form of practical joke on the assailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4539913.stm |title=Does 'happy slapping' exist? |last=Akwagyiram |first=Alexis |work=BBC News |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion in Popular TV==
It is a mistake to see the phenomenon of happy slapping as purely an effect of availability of video cameras.  Popular culture, including advertising has presented it as a role model.  In the award winning &quot;You've been Tango'd&quot; advert a youth is shown being slapped on the face by a jolly orange creature, and it is presented as humorous fun&lt;ref&gt;1994 Video of slap-happy advert &quot;You Know when You've been Tangoed.  UK.  HHCL Ad agency.  (http://www.adslogans.co.uk/hof/IE006910.html)&lt;/ref&gt;.

A surgeon who had done one too many operations to fix broken jaws of children who had been 'tangoed' wrote to the advertisers behind the &quot;You've been Tango'd&quot; ad and got them to change the 'slap' to a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;100 Greatest Adverts, TV Program, ITV, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escalation==

Happy slapping can be understood to be more than mere slapping, and may include punching or even actual bodily harm. Sometimes the assault is performed with other crimes, such as mugging, and can lead to manslaughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10331547.stm | work=BBC News | title='Happy slap' youths admit killing | date=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This escalation can be further evidenced through new unhealthy, deadly ways as shown in this photo: http://www.nolubida.com/happyslappinglogohp.jpg.
==Use with video technology==

Although the concept of filming a crime is an old one, the ease and general availability of video cameras in mobile phones means that such attacks need not be planned carefully beforehand and are more easily watched and circulated for comedy purposes afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Fridrich method''' or the '''CFOP method''' (cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) is a fast method for solving the [[w:Rubik's Cube|Rubik's Cube]] created by Jessica Fridrich. It consists of four steps: Cross, F2L (First Two Layers), OLL (Orient Last Layer), and PLL (Permute Last Layer). Although it requires you to memorise many (up to 78) different algorithms, it's one of the fastest speedcubing methods.

It is recommended that you should start learning using the [[../Beginner|beginner method]] first, then use the Fridrich method once you have become proficient at that. 

== Cross ==
[[File:CFOP-Cross_solved.png|thumb|Cross solved (shown upside down)]]
The cross is done intuitively. It is usually done starting with the white colored squares. You should do it on the bottom because then it's easier to locate the other pieces. The cross is done in eight moves or less (this will take a couple days of practicing), though in over 99%of the cases it can be done in 6 moves. A tip for training is to do the cross blindfolded. This will allow you to focus on the next step, F2L while doing the cross. Make sure that the colors of the other stickers on the edges are in this order: blue, red, green, orange. Don't forget to align the centers pieces of the cube!

== First two layers (F2L) ==

The strategy here is to join a corner of the first layer with the edge that goes above it, then insert that pair. The cases for this step can all be solved intuitively if you have enough experience. The cases described below are designed to help you gain that intuition. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Rubik's Cube Fridrich Method - intuitive F2L case 1.1.1. step 4.svg|'''1''' Here, be sure to insert the pair that is already formed using U'F'UF (or FR'F'R), but not RUR', which would destroy the pair.
File:Rubik's Cube Fridrich Method - intuitive F2L case 2.1. step 0.svg|'''2''' For this one, R will join the pair, then UR' will insert it.
File:Rubik's Cube Fridrich Method - intuitive F2L case 2.2. step 1.svg|'''3''' You can &quot;hide&quot; the corner using F', then U2F will join the pair, then this becomes case 1 to the left. This differs from case 2 only by the orientation of the edge (blue is up, not orange)
File:Centizq.jpg|'''4''' This can be solved with URU'R' (join the pair) then U'F'UF (insert the pair)
File:Rubik's Cube Fridrich Method - intuitive F2L case 3.5. step 3.svg|'''5''' Here, the white side of the corner is facing up. To join the pair, UR will move the edge into a position where the corner can attach to it properly, then U will join the pair and R' will put it on the top. Now insert the pair into its slot.
File:Rubik's Cube Fridrich Method - intuitive F2L case 2.3. step 0.svg|'''6''' In cases where the pair is joined wrong, the strategy is to separate the pair and turn it into another case. If you do UF'U2, you can turn this case into case 2 above. If you do RU2R', you can turn this into case 3.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are, of course, many more cases than this, but most can be solved with the strategies above or can be reduced to one of the above cases.

==Orient last layer (OLL)==
OLL consists of 57 different algorithms. 2look OLL consists of 9 algorithms, but is easier to learn. to learn algorithms go to - http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html

=Introduction=
 
Feedback is an evaluative response about an action or process given to the original source. There are many situations in which feedback is appropriate and necessary.  Working in teams provides a variety of opportunities to give feedback to any number of recipients. It also provides an opportunity to receive feedback from others. Before giving feedback there are a variety of factors that must be considered, including:

 
•	The goal of giving feedback

•	When to give feedback

•	The recipient(s) of feedback

•	Techniques &amp; tools to ensure effective feedback

•	Response to feedback 



In the case of groups, roles and hierarchies may make peer to peer feedback more difficult.  In this case, it is even more important to make sure feedback is given in the most effective manner. 

==Common Goals of Giving Feedback==
 
The first step in giving feedback is to determine the goal or the reason for the feedback.  This will vary depending upon the situation.  Defining the goal will help shape the process.  Feedback is an educational opportunity for both the sender and the receiver.  

Feedback can be used to praise or show appreciation.  For example, it is a chance to tell the recipient that an idea he had was exceptional, that he did well in a meeting, or that his hard work has been noticed.  But feedback is not always positive. It can be a tool to educate the receiver about his negative behavior or performance, such as habitual lateness or that he has gone over budget on a project. Negative feedback is also called corrective feedback.

Improving communication is another common goal of feedback which can lead to several great benefits such as building, maintaining and testing relationships, gathering information, and keeping one’s perceptions in check.

One of the most common goals of feedback is to influence others’ behavior.  However, feedback is not a good tool for getting a person to change.  Edith Whitfield Seashore noted that “even though [interpersonal behavior] may influence future behavior, [it] doesn’t necessarily control anything. We often receive the same feedback over and over, without anything changing significantly. And we often give feedback without anyone else changing” [1].  Feedback should be used to influence others to want to start, stop, or modify a behavior. Precisely given feedback can help a person to see the effects of a behavior and empower the receiver to want to change the behavior for the better.

==When to give feedback==
 
Determining when to give feedback can be difficult, but it is usually best to give feedback in a timely manner. This is especially true of behavior or performance feedback. If a person or team completed a project as asked it is important to let them know that their effort is noticed in order to encourage the behavior to continue. On the flip side, if a person or team is exhibiting poor behavior or performance it is important to inform them of the disapproval and encourage them to improve the behavior. This is especially important in teams as the behavior and performance of one can snowball into a larger problem if it is not addressed early on.

==Recipients of feedback==

Feedback is appropriate for many different audiences such as team leader to group, team member to peer, and group to team leader. The feedback approach will differ depending upon the audience.  

Working in teams provides additional opportunities to talk with the team about its behavior, performance or goals. However, not all team feedback should be given in the audience of the team. On occasion it may be appropriate to pull a team member aside to give one on one feedback, especially if the feedback is related to that person’s negative behavior or performance. However, feedback as is relates to the group’s performance, accomplishment of goals, or cohesion should be brought up to the entire group. This ensures that all team members receive the same message, and the group can work toward solutions to the problem if necessary.

Providing performance feedback is effective in improving team performance.   But is the most effective way to administer feedback on an individual level, group level, or both?  DeShon, Kozlowski,Schmidt, Milner &amp; Wiechmann studied this issue in 2003 [3].  The groups that were given feedback aimed at the individual showed an increased individual performance within the team.  Likewise, the groups which were given feedback targeted at the team showed more successful team performance.  A third type of group was given both individual and team feedback.  The study predicted that this third group would benefit from the multilevel multiple-goal feedback and would outperform the other two types of groups. Surprisingly, this was not the case.  Results found that both groups that received a single focused type of feedback outperformed this third group type on both individual and team performance measures.  However, the study found that if the goal is to improve team performance, team feedback produces the best results.

==Positive and Negative Feedback for Teams==

Every team has members which possess unique abilities, talents and skills. If a team is fully functional, meaning that they have several team members who are able to take what they know and make their knowledge mesh together to accomplish a task or goal, they have a greater probability of success.  According to Webster’s Dictionary, positive feedback is defined as, “feedback that tends to magnify a process or increase its output.”[4] Positive feedback creates positive results, however there is a need at times to balance out positive and negative feedback.  Poor feedback can cause mutiny, feelings of low self-worth, anger or even hatred towards the task or that person. 

—The absence of feedback can cause problems among a team because of the perceived lack of recognition of hard work or special talents by the one who is supposed to give the feedback. 

—Negative feedback at least has a direction if said in the right tone and the right way. 

—Positive feedback has power to exponentially build a team, make it work with fluidity and create a synergy that other methods cannot duplicate. 

However, solely giving positive feedback can be detrimental.  In a journal article titled The Negatives of Only Focusing on Positive Feedback, it states that, “We agree that it is important for managers to appreciate their strengths and understand 	how to leverage those strengths. If they don’t, they could waste time and effort attempting to get better at leadership skills they have already mastered. They could fail to leverage core skills that would help them be more successful. But CCL’s data suggest that if managers pay attention only to their strengths, their leadership development efforts may not address what their organizations need most. This in turn could be harmful not only to individual managers but to entire organizations.”[5]

Negative feedback, or coaching, as many companies like to call it, is a necessary evil. Constructive criticism is the only way to build character, otherwise the team members might not think that they are doing anything wrong and can only do everything right. As a leader, this comes into play and is desired.

However, it is vital that that one remain objective when giving negative feedback.  Aim feedback at the behavior, not the person.  It is important to look past the differences of the recipient in order to have an honest and sincere interaction. Do not judge the person receiving the feedback.  Each person is experiencing each situation differently, and it is impossible for the giver to understand each person’s situation. Present the feedback honestly, sticking to the facts, rather than judging the person upon your perception.  

It is important to consider the matrix of the team when giving feedback. It is also important not to point out specific members of the group when giving negative feedback. That is more appropriate for an individual conversation. Focus on the behavior of the group and the changes that need to be made within the group.

Finally, when giving negative feedback, one must have good intentions on helping the person to improve. Feedback given with mal intent will not have a positive outcome. If one is unable to give feedback in a sincere manner it may be beneficial to have another respected member of the team give the feedback.

==Feedback Techniques==

Each team member should have a working knowledge of feedback techniques that can be implemented with the group in order to reach the team goals and to be productive. The following are a sample of techniques that can be used to enhance the feedback experience.
 
'''Serve the feedback like a meal'''
&lt;sup&gt;'''Serve the feedback like a meal''' &lt;/sup&gt;
How the message is delivered can often determine if the message is received properly and if it will be acted upon.  Kind words shouted at someone do not have the same positive impact as when they are spoken gently.  Ed Sykes of The Sykes Group [6] has suggested that feedback should be served to the team or individual like a great meal.  He offers five techniques for making the feedback meal more appetizing:

a.   Mentally prepare to give feedback just as you would prepare ahead of time to serve a banquet.  Review questions such as “Is the feedback important?  What do I hope to accomplish through this feedback? Who are the persons I will be giving the feedback to?  How have they taken feedback in the past? Etc.    
        	
b.  Serve each course at the appropriate time- waiting too long to serve the criticism or serving it too early can result in a lack of hunger for the team or individual receiving the meal.

c.   Start with quality ingredients like fairness, candor, and consistency.  Set positive expectations and be direct in the communication.

d. Ask for a meal review.  Get feedback on the feedback session.

e.  Use appropriate table manners.  Be gracious, respectful, and kind. Always end on a positive note.

'''Stay Positive'''
According to the UK management training firm Templeton Finn [7], there is a three step technique to giving feedback that significantly improves performance and motivation:

1.  Start the process with a few genuine, specific compliments. 

a. Be sure to use very specific and direct terms and remember that whatever you comment on you will get more of.

2.  Give the person or group one or two things they could do differently next time to make it even better.

a. Be sure to give them the correct way to do it.  If you only tell them what they did wrong, then there is still a chance that they will do it wrong again, just in a different way.  

3.  Make an overall positive comment about the person’s abilities or progress.
 
In general, stay positive and use positive terms.  There are an infinite number of wrong ways to do something so it’s much better to know how to do something the right way than to know how not to do it.  People generally feel more confident about their abilities to improve upon mistakes through positive feedback.  On the other hand people generally feel nervous and insecure when they receive feedback in a negative manner, which often leads to more mistakes.

'''CONNECT Model'''     
The Connect Model [8] is a communication process used between two members of a group that promotes a collaborative team environment by allowing discussion of conflicts in a psychologically safe environment.  Through this process each member should gain a deeper understanding of the other through giving and receiving feedback.  The method uses the following steps:    
 
C – Commit to the relationship.  Tell why you think this is worth doing and that you think the relationship is important enough to work on.
O – Optimize safety.  Let the other person know that you will do your best not to put him on the defensive.
N – Narrow the discussion to one issue.
N – Neutralize defensiveness.  Ask the person to let you know if you make them defensive.
E – Explain and echo each perspective.  Tell what you notice and the effects that you perceive.  Have the person echo what you have said and then have him tell you his perspective.
C – Change one behavior each.
T – Track it.  Pick a date to check back in with each other to see how things are going.
 
'''Red Paper / Green Paper'''
This activity will shed light upon your group’s strengths and weaknesses.  Give each group member three red slips of papers and three green slips of paper.  Have them write three things that the group is good at on the green papers and three things that the group could improve upon on the red papers.  These are written anonymously.  When finished, each member puts his papers in two piles sorted by color.  Shuffle the deck and read the negative results first.  Then read the positive results.  Only after all papers are read should the discussion start.  It is interesting to note the common themes that team members mention.

'''Survey''' 
Often this technique works well when a team leader finds it beneficial to solicit feedback from the group in an effort to improve performance.  The team leader can create a survey form with specific pertinent questions.  The group will feel safer if the survey is anonymous.  The team leader should also fill out the survey and compare his results to the group to see how “in tune” he is with his real performance.  It is common for one to think that he performs better than he actually does.  Feedback is a good reality check.

==Tools for Team members==

In the book When Teams Work Best, it states, “Good feedback is associated with a heightened sense of personal accountability, a wide range of worker satisfaction factors, and enhanced performance, especially in groups whose goals demand extensive interpersonal relationships. Because feedback is the lifeblood of growth in a team relationship, we need a set of tools that will move us closer at the end of an attempted relationship adjustment, not farther apart.”[9] The following is a sample of tools that can help improve the feedback process.

'''FeedForward'''
One new trend in the positive feedback realm is that of feedforward.  “Asking for feedforward means asking for two suggestions for the future that might help the team achieve a positive change in their selected behavior. If participants have worked together in the past, they are not allowed to give any feedback about the past. They are only allowed to give ideas for the future…feedforward helps people envision and focus on a positive future, not a failed past.”[10]
This novel idea of looking towards the future to generate ideas is another way that teams, or leaders of teams, can provide positive actions to build a positive end result. There is truth in the statement that feedback tends to cause us to look at a potentially failed past as a dissection of what was done right and what was done wrong.  However, the optimistic point of view treats feedforward as the way to grow by looking forward and making right decisions for the future.
 
'''Checklist for Positive Interactions'''
In an article by Lindsey Swinton, she states seven steps for positive feedback. They are:

1.   	No Time Like Now: Give positive feedback as close to the event as possible so the feedback doesn’t go stale.

2.   	In Public and Private: Praise in public, criticize in private.

3.   	Practice Makes Perfect: Make it a habit to praise regularly

4.   	Does the Reward Fit? : The amount of effort put in merits a reward of the same level.

5.   	No Favorites: Don’t over praise one person. Keep a mental tally of whom you praised most recently

6.   	Be Clear and Mean It: Tell the team exactly why you are praising them. Be specific.

7.   	Catch People Doing Things Right: The more you catch people doing things right, the more right things they will do! [11]

 
After reviewing these steps for positive feedback, it is clear that it takes planning and effort to make each bit of positive feedback worthwhile and meaningful for the team. Planning and execution of such feedback is worth the time preparing and thinking of who deserves it and why they are deserving of it.

'''The Johari Window Model'''
The goal of feedback within teams is to influence the team and member behavior.  Members of teams will need to have knowledge of models for feedback to implement in group settings to reach the goals set and to be productive.  The Johari Window model [12] can be used to begin to understand group dynamics and interpersonal behavior that can lead to feedback opportunities for managers and groups. (insert image)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Known to Self !! Not Known to Self
|-
| Known to Others|| Open|| Blind
|-
| Not Known to Others|| Hidden|| Unknown
|}
      
Group members share “open” information.  One group member may have “hidden” information.  The group may deal with areas of “unknown” information.  Additionally, members may create “blind” information areas when there is information or feelings observed but not shared.  Lack of information or pent up feelings can cripple a group’s success.  Feedback can help to reduce the areas of hidden, blind, and unknown information as well as to better discuss and utilize open information.  A group may choose to participate in a Johari activity and actually place adjectives in each box of the model.  This placement can then be used for members to inform interpersonal relationships and communication.

'''The Losada Line'''
The Losada Meta Learning Model [13] is one way to divide groups into high, medium and low performers by actually quantifying tiered variables of team dynamics:

●	inquiry-advocacy (how much people ask vs. talk),

●	positivity-negativity (how much people are positive vs. negative),

●	other-self (how much people are focused on others vs. on themselves),

●	connectivity(a control parameter)

●	viscosity (how the environment resists change), and

●	negativity bias (our speed of response to negative events to avoid harm).
While individual groups or group members may not be able to produce the mathematically generated computer model to determine whether they are high or low performing, these variables can be discussed and influenced through feedback.  Additionally, categories of teams could also be related to a positive/negative feedback ratio:


•         High – 5.6 P/N

•         Medium – 1.9 P/N

•         Low – 0.36 P/N


''' T-Group'''
A T-group is a model that provides participants with an opportunity to “study their own behavior when they interact within a small group.”[14]. Because of the self-disclosure and openness involved, this type of exercise may not be appropriate for regular working groups within an organization.  Best results occur in an environment such as a training group or a seminar in which the participants are strangers that will not work together in the future. The group’s work is focused on feelings, process, and feedback.  Some of the objectives that a participant can expect to come away with are an increased understanding of underlying social processes within a group, increased awareness of the effect one’s behavior has on others in the group, increased ability to give and receive feedback, and increased ability to manage conflict.

==Response to Feedback==

Generally, one feels comfortable giving positive feedback because the danger of conflict is minimal.  On the other hand, the reception of negative feedback can be much more difficult to predict. A person may receive feedback as a sign of constructive criticism. Others may receive the same feedback as a personal attack. Often time people are reluctant to give feedback because “complex interactions, especially that are unproductive, occur when we interact with people who we perceive as being very different from us.” [15]

Use common sense to increase the chance of success when giving feedback.  Be slow to speak until you are sure that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.  It is better to err on the side of caution because words cannot be taken back once they are spoken.  

What should you do if the receiver doesn’t respond in the desired manner to your feedback?  First of all, do not give up.  Change often takes time.  You must also remember that you cannot control other people, but only yourself.  

After each feedback encounter, take a few minutes to evaluate your performance.  What went well?  What can you improve?  Make a mental note on what you want to try different next time, because there will always be a next time.  A big part of giving successful feedback involves practice.    

==Examples of successful real world applications of technique==

'''Cleveland Clinic Research Experiment'''
Doctors Mariana G Hewson PHD and Margaret Little MD at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio [16] conducted a research experiment to verify the effectiveness of recommended techniques for feedback in Medical Education.  The study aimed to substantiate several recommended feedback techniques (listed in table 1). The researchers used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to measure results. 
 
They investigated “clinician teachers' personal experiences with receiving feedback in a course for improving the teaching of medical interviewing (the annual training course of the American Academy of Physician and Patient).”
 
The group of 83 course participants was comprised of 39 men and 44 women from roughly 60 different medical institutions located in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
 
At the end of the week-long course, each participant “was asked to provide a short narrative of two selected course-related feedback incidents, one of which they judged as personally helpful, and the other as personally unhelpful.”

The doctors found that the feedback techniques used  in helpful incidents often included a focus on skills along with personal styles.  The specific skills included: being able to lead a group discussion, giving feedback, setting up a role play, and handling challenging incidents.  The effective personal styles consisted of traits like being quiet, being verbally assertive, being non-threatening, being flexible, and being facilitative. 

According to Doctors Hewson and Little, the manner in which the feedback was presented to the participants &quot;strongly affected their perceptions of its helpfulness.&quot;  Techniques like &quot;giving feedback lovingly, supportively, and caringly&quot; as well as &quot;being gentle and not hitting someone over the head with his or her mistakes&quot; along with &quot;being concerned to understand the other person's position&quot; were all deemed helpful.  The researchers also noted that the &quot;participants appreciated accurate and clear feedback about particular behaviors.&quot;  The study also mentioned  that &quot;feedback that included specific suggestions for improvement was seen as very important.&quot;

Ultimately through their research Doctors Hewson and Little were able to conclude that “Feedback techniques experienced by respondents substantiate the literature-based recommendations, and corrective feedback is regarded as helpful when delivered appropriately.”

'''Bellon, Bellon &amp; Blake Study'''
Research has shown that when classroom teachers effectively use feedback techniques with children, they often have a strong positive effect on the students. Researchers have found that “Academic feedback is more strongly and consistently related to achievement than any other teaching behavior” and that “this relationship is consistent regardless of grade, socioeconomic status, race, or school setting.”  In a study by Bellon, Bellon, and Blake [17], when “feedback and corrective procedures are used, most students can attain the same level of achievement as the top 20% of students.”   

Feedback has proven to be effective when there is recognition of a common goal, evidence given of current position, and some understanding is reached between the teacher and student of how to close the gap of the desired goal and current position.

==Conclusion==

Feedback is a valuable tool that can be used to improve team performance.  It is educational for both the sender and receiver.  Feedback informs, seeks to change behavior, and improves communication.  It can be of a positive or negative nature.  Feedback works best when given in a timely manner.  Several techniques and tools were given to help in giving successful feedback.  Common sense also prevails.  It is difficult to predict the response one will receive.  Do not be discouraged if the response to your feedback is not what you were aiming for.  Remember that you cannot control others.  Evaluate your performance after each feedback session and remember that practice plays a big part in improvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''lashing''' is an arrangement of rope used to secure two or more items together in a somewhat rigid manner. Lashings are most commonly applied to timber poles, and are commonly associated with the [[scouting]] movement and with sailors.

This word usage derives from using whipcord to tie things together.

==Technique==

The structure of a lash is nearly the same with any type of lashing: to start, hold two poles in the desired end position. Start a [[Knots/Hitch knots/Timber hitch|timber hitch]] around one of the poles to secure the rope onto the pole (in the case of the stockgrower's lash, an [[Knots/Loop knots/Adjustable grip hitch|adjustable grip hitch]] or [[Knots/Loop knots/Taut-line hitch|tautline hitch]] is used, as a timber hitch can slip when the lash is opened). Start to wrap the rope around the poles (the wrap will change when different lashings are used). Once the rope is wrapped around the poles enough to be very tight, end with two timber hitches and one or two [[Knots/Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitches]].

==Types==
* [[/Square lashing/]]
* [[/Diagonal lashing/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Motivation ===
You want to build a multi-lingual concordance from parallel texts already in the TEI format (see http://www.tei-c.org/ )

=== Architecture ===

There are three steps in this example:
# preprocessing the texts to enable easier indexing, which is done in XSLT 2.0 
# querying the text to return a tei:entry (see http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html ) which is done in XQuery
# processing the tei:entry into HTML  which is done in XSLT 1.0 in the browser

In this particular example the languages in use are English and te reo Māori. It assumes that structural tags have 'n' attributes with urls pointing to the original source of the data.

=== Preprocessing the text ===

This stylesheet splits the text into words (tei:w see http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html ) and records on each a 'lemma' or normalised form of the word and the language it's in. These are re-calculated to allow indexes to be built of them. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;2.0&quot;
		xmlns=&quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;
		xmlns:tei=&quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;
		xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;!-- This is a simple stylesheet that inserts word tags around words
  (and implicitly defines what those words are) --&gt;

  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;lowernormal&quot; select=&quot;'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmaeiouaeiou'&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;upper&quot;       select=&quot;'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMĀĒĪŌŪāēīōū'&quot;/&gt;
  
  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;drop&quot; select=&quot;'{}()*'&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;punctuation&quot; select=&quot;'.:;,!?'&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;regexp&quot; select=&quot;('.:;,!?')*()&quot;/&gt;


  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;@*|node()&quot; priority=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:copy&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;@*|node()&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;text()[normalize-space()]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name='orig' select=&quot;.&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name='lang' select=&quot;$orig/ancestor::*[normalize-space(@xml:lang)][1]/@xml:lang&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:analyze-string select=&quot;.&quot; regex=&quot;[\p{{L}}\p{{N}}]+&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xsl:matching-substring&gt;

	&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;normalised&quot;&gt;
	  &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;string&quot; select=&quot;translate(.,$upper,$lowernormal)&quot;/&gt;
	  &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
	&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
	
	&lt;xsl:element name=&quot;w&quot; namespace=&quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;&gt;
	  &lt;xsl:attribute name=&quot;xml:lang&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$lang&quot;/&gt;&lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;
	  &lt;xsl:attribute name=&quot;lemma&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$normalised&quot;/&gt;&lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;
	  &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot;/&gt;
	  &lt;/xsl:element&gt;
	  
      &lt;/xsl:matching-substring&gt;
      &lt;xsl:non-matching-substring&gt;
	&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:non-matching-substring&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:analyze-string&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
    
    &lt;xsl:if test=&quot;string-length($string) &amp;gt; 0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xsl:if test=&quot;not(compare(substring($string,1,1),substring($string,2,1))=0)&quot;&gt;
	&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;substring($string,1,1)&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;string&quot; select=&quot;substring($string,2)&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Querying the text ===

The query builds a single &lt;tei:entry&gt; tag containing multiple &lt;tei:cit&gt;, one for each hit. A processing instruction is used to associate the TEI with a stylesheet.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
 
declare default element namespace &quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=application/xml process-xsl-pi=yes indent=yes&quot;; 
 
let $target := 'xml-stylesheet',
    $content := 'href=&quot;teiresults2htmlresults.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; '

return  processing-instruction {$target} {$content}, 
document {
&lt;TEI&gt;
  &lt;teiHeader&gt; 
     &lt;!-- substantial header information needs to go here to be well formed TEI --&gt;
  &lt;/teiHeader&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;div&gt; {
              let    $collection := '/db/kupu/korero',
                     $q := request:get-parameter('kupu', 'mohio'),
                     $lang := request:get-parameter('reo', 'mi'),
                     $first := request:get-parameter('kotahi', 1) cast as xs:decimal,
                     $last := 25 + $first
              return
         &lt;entry xml:lang=&quot;{$lang}&quot; n=&quot;{$last}&quot;&gt;
            &lt;form&gt;
               &lt;orth&gt;{$q}&lt;/orth&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;{
  for $word at $count in subsequence(collection($collection)//w[@lemma=$q][@xml:lang=$lang], $first,  $last)
     let $this := $word/ancestor::*[@n][1]
     let $thisid := $this/@xml:id
     let $url := $this/@n
     let $lang := $word/@xml:lang
     let $that :=
         if ( $this/@corresp )
         then (
           $this/../../*/*[concat('#',@xml:id)=$this/@corresp]
         ) else (
         &quot;no corresp&quot;
         )
     return
         &lt;cit n=&quot;{$url}&quot; corresp=&quot;#{$word/@xml:id}&quot;&gt;
           {$this}
           
           {$that}
	 &lt;/cit&gt;
   }&lt;/entry&gt;
      }        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/TEI&gt;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


===  Transformation to HTML ===

The TEI is transformed into HTML in the browser following the processing instruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
		xmlns:html=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
		xmlns:tei=&quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;
		xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;xsl:output indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;//tei:orth/text()&quot;/&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;lang&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;//tei:entry/@xml:lang&quot;/&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;@*|node()&quot; priority=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:copy&gt;

      &lt;/html:body&gt;
    &lt;/html:html&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Adaptive Technology and Who Does It Help?==

Adaptive Technology consists of a variety of tools that can help people with disabilities to perform functions in life or school that may otherwise be challenging or nearly impossible without the help from these tools.   Adaptive Technology can also be referred as assistive technology.  It often helps people with special cognitive or physical needs to make them feel more confident and comfortable with their disability and high functioning in the world around them.  With the assistance from technology, children and adults can use computers without their hands or vision.  Other forms allow those without a voice to be heard by others.  Adaptive technology can assist in other ways as well such as those who are unable to walk can be lifted by mechanical equipment.  According to The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), “any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities” is defined as adaptive technology.  In addition, those with learning disabilities may also benefit by having technology assist the weaknesses and allowing the student to use their strengths.  Adaptive technology can be used to help improve the lives of so many different people with varying needs with many benefits so it is important to consider the cost and possible drawbacks, the training needed to use such equipment, and various ways to use it in today’s classrooms.

==Disabilities Adaptive Technology is used For==
&lt;br /&gt;
Adaptive technology can be used for a variety of people with physical, cognitive or learning impairments to help the student become more independent.  These may include children with learning disabilities in math, reading, writing, listening or organization skills.  Adaptive technology allows students to reach their full potential because it provides assistance in the child’s area of weakness. For example, a child who has difficulty writing ideas on paper may use a special software program that allows the child to speak their ideas and it is converted into writing.  Again this could also be used with a child with physical limitations who may not be able to use their hands to write.   A dyslexic child benefits from opportunities to have a computer program read material to him or her for better comprehension or a blind child who cannot see the written words.
&lt;br /&gt;
Adaptive technology can also help students with physical limitations.  A child who cannot walk has several options such as walkers, wheel chairs or powered bikes or scooters.  A lift may assist transitions from a wheel chair to bed or a bathtub.  Students that may have other disabilities may not be able to provide self-care, but with the use of robotics such as electric feeding tools, students can become more independent.
&lt;br /&gt;
Some examples of specific adaptive technology used in classrooms today for students with:
&lt;br /&gt;

Blindness/Visual Impairments:
&lt;br /&gt;
Screen magnification software is available for students with low vision. The program comes with a monitor; enhanced tool bars, menus, and images; screen readers that will read to the student if necessary; and typing echo—whatever key is typed is automatically spoken to make the student sure of what they are typing.
Large button or large print keyboards will be especially helpful for students with visual impairments. They are in inexpensive way to convert normal keyboards into larger text keyboards so they will be much easier to see and many of them have one-touch internet and media buttons.
&lt;br /&gt;
For students who have visual impairments Braille Displays are available. The Braille Display is hooked up to a computer so the student with visual impairments is able to read a computer screen. The information on the screen is transferred to the Braille Display and displayed in Braille print.
&lt;br /&gt;
Braille embossers are a type of a printer you could say. A Braille embosser creates the series of dots that create Braille writing. Some of these embossers are portable so the student can take them to where every they need the embosser.
&lt;br /&gt;
There are devices for students who are unable to tell certain colors apart or who are fully color blind. These little machines are able to recognize up to one thousand seven hundred different colors. Once the device has scanned the color it announces it loud and in a clear voice what the color it. 
&lt;br /&gt;

Hearing Impairments
&lt;br /&gt;
For those students with hearing loss, sound amplifiers use Bluetooth technology to soften background noise going into hearing aides. They are very useful for lectures or one-on-one conversations and can fit into students’ pockets or backpacks.
&lt;br /&gt;

Physical disabilities
&lt;br /&gt;

A head-mounted or hands-free mouse is useful for those students who have mobility limitations and are unable to use a regular mouse. This light-weight headset goes on the student’s head like a baseball cap and the direction in which they move their head controls where on the screen the mouse goes. 
Text to Speech Software/Speech Synthesizers can be very helpful to those students that are unable to speak for themselves or have difficulty speaking. These products convert words that are typed in Microsoft Word documents into digital talking books, which are synchronized audio and text that can be heard aloud. The student(s) can type in words or phrases and have them read by the program, so they can answer questions and carry on conversations in their own words.
Speech Recognition software is very useful for students with mobility impairments. If a student is not able to work their upper body well enough to control a mouse or keyboard, they are able to say commands to the computer and the computer will do the actions for them. With this technology, students with limited mobility can actively participate in computer games and programs with no extra assistance—all they need is their voice. 
&lt;br /&gt;

Common household devices can be found in modified forms such as telephones. Telephones can be purchases with large number buttons to aid in the teacher of how to use a telephone, for students who have limited mobility and limited fine motor skills in the arms and hands.
&lt;br /&gt;

Students who are confined to a wheelchair and have to use a head mounted mouse could benefit from a mounting system for their computer. A mounting system would bring the computer to eye level for the student. This would make it easier for the student to read the computer screen and easier for the computer to track the students head movements. Portable workspaces are also available for students who are confined to a wheelchair. These workspaces are able to attach right onto the wheelchair.
&lt;br /&gt;

Autism
&lt;br /&gt;
Sensory stimulators are very good to have for students who have autism. Having these sensory stimulators in a classroom preferably in a separated room from the classroom will allow for the student to have a place to relax when stressed and unable to focus.
&lt;br /&gt;
There are devices that can hook on to a computer screen to make them a touch screen. These screens can be mounted on any type of screen to make it a touch screen. They are able to any function on the computer that you would be able to do with a mouse. These touch screens are also scratch resistant.
&lt;br /&gt;
Devices exist that hold multiple recordings. The recordings are programmed to go off at a certain time on a daily basis, for example everyday at 11:30 the recorder will say, “It is time to eat lunch.” This device will relieve stress and anxiety for students with autism are set into a daily routine that they worry constantly about what the time is. 
&lt;br /&gt;


Cognitive Disabilities
&lt;br /&gt;
Many students who are labeled as having a cognitive disability have troubles with everyday skills that everyone else takes for granted and assume everyone else knows. There are programs and resources to help students learn these life skills, and to help teachers and parents teach their students and children the life skills they will need to be successful in life.
&lt;br /&gt;
There are programs and games that teach students the meanings of road signs, and give strategies to help the students remember what the meaning of the signs are.  There are resources that teach students with cognitive disabilities how to tell time, and also resources to teach an important home life skill of cooking.
&lt;br /&gt;
There are resources and programs available to teach students money skills. There is a calculator available that allows students to add up and subtract money. You are able to add or remove one-dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. A system called touch money exists. This system has coins with dots on each coin that will stand for either one or five. The students will use the dots to count the amount of money they have.
&lt;br /&gt;
Picture books are a useful tool in the classroom for a student who is non-verbal. With the picture book the student has most everything that could be said during a school day. The student must flip to the page with the picture of what they are trying to communicate and how the teacher.
&lt;br /&gt;

Learning Disabilities 
&lt;br /&gt;
Reading Pens are assistive reading tools that are designed for students who have reading difficulties or dyslexia. They provide immediate word support to students and help them read troublesome or new words effectively and understand meanings independently. They can provide translations or definitions of unknown words and help students read with flow without giving them all the answers. 

Quick Talkers are gender-neutral solutions for students struggling with communication. There are common sense pictures located on all typed and this device can be easily carried in students’ pockets or backpacks.

==Benefits==
&lt;br /&gt;
Communication is key when it comes to learning. Some students with disabilities are not able to communicate the way their non-disabled classmates are, which makes for a frustrated student and teacher and a difficult situation. While many schools have been victims to budget cuts and less and less money, every student deserves as best a learning experience as possible. While some adaptive technology can be very expensive, there are many options for teachers and schools to give more resources to their students with disabilities. There are a wide range of adaptations that can be made to technology that is most likely already in the classroom, and many of these are simple changes. There are a variety of different companies and brand names that offer similar products, so shopping around to find the best deal is a huge advantage, especially with all the budget cuts. Many of these programs can be brought up in grants, not to mention active parents that are willing to do what they can to help their children and their schools. Not all adaptations need to be purchased—many physical therapists in the school district have the tools, knowledge, and ability necessary to create simple adaptations for their students, for no more than the cost of basic materials. Inclusive schools will benefit greatly with adaptive technology, because it is just one more way to integrate their students with disabilities with their regular education classmates. No student likes being left out of a lesson or activity, especially because of their disability. Using adaptive technology is extremely beneficial to all students in the classroom, as well as the teachers. The students can be included in the lesson with the rest of their class, and their teachers can spend less time planning adapted lessons and more time with their students.

==Drawbacks==
&lt;br /&gt;
Adaptive technology can be very beneficial for those in need, however there are also drawbacks including price, options, time and emotional investments.  Adaptive technologies have a vast range in prices.  Some are covered by insurance or schools while others come from the family’s own financial state which can be very expensive and therefore, a difficult decision to make.  There are also so many varieties and different types of adaptive technology available today that it can often be overwhelming for families to decide which type of equipment will best meet the child’s needs.  There is also a lot of time invested into researching which type of equipment to use for the child, training parents, teachers, peers and most importantly the child how to use the technology.  In addition to these challenges, there are also emotional challenges with adaptive technology.  It can be challenging, frustrating, exciting or overwhelming just to see how many options are available, the struggles the family or child may experience while adapting to the new technology or finding that it isn’t benefiting the child in ways originally expected. When using adaptive or assistive technology there is always the risk of the technology breaking. If this piece of technology breaks the student will have to do their day with out the aid of technology until their equipment is fixed. Every student who uses adaptive or assistive technology runs the risk of becoming depended on the technology. By becoming dependent on these technologies the student may not be developing their own skills to the best ability.  All of these drawbacks should be considered and presented when informing families about adaptive technology to help prevent struggles along the way so that the child and family can receive the benefits of adaptive technology.

==Teacher Training==
&lt;br /&gt;
Teachers will need to know how to help their students perform to their full potential, and for some students, this will mean teachers assess their students for the need of assistive tools and technology.  In order for students to receive assistive technology, school records need to be documented and monitored, along with completing diagnostic assessments and meetings with parents, other teachers, doctors or therapists to help find the best adaptive technology available.  Teachers will need to also re-evaluate the students progress with the new technology to be sure that the child is still benefiting from its use.   In addition to teachers knowing how to properly assess a child, they also must know what types of technology are available.  There are several online programs that offer information about adaptive technology, which teachers should continue to evaluate to know which options are available for each student.  In-services are a great way for teachers to become familiar with various topics regarding adaptive technology including legal issues, how to serve the individual student, how to evaluate the child, how the technology works and is maintained including transportation, programming, unexpected malfunctions, and how to incorporate it into the lifestyle of the student.   Teachers may also need to inform the child’s classmates about the technology and provide basic training about the technology to the class for greater approval, elimination of fears, and increased socialization in the classroom community.

==Cost==
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether the technology is being purchased by a school or family, income and cost are big factors to consider. While much of the technology available to schools today can be used for people with disabilities, like Smartboards, there are many things students need to use in school that need adaptation. Computers, for example, are vital in many classrooms today, but many students with disabilities are unable to use them. A hands-free, head-mounted mouse with a large button keyboard, for example can cost thousands. The mouse and the keyboard can cost up to ten and five times what a normal computer mouse and keyboard would cost, respectively. If a magnified screen were to be added to that, $2,000 would need to be added to the price. Machines used to create Braille for students with vision impairments can cost approximately $3,000, which is one of the reasons one would be hard-pressed to find them in many schools. Every day things like reading pens and Quick Talkers can range anywhere from $150.00 to $250.00, depending on the brand. Text to Speech software, which is becoming very popular in many schools as well as outside of schools, is less expensive, ranging from $30.00 to $3,000.00 and some websites offer free downloads.
&lt;br /&gt;
While there are many companies that specialize in creating these adaptations for technology, which can be very expensive, many Physical Therapists can create adaptation for their student for no more than the cost of the materials needed. Many factors can affect the cost of these adaptations. Things like brand name, amount of extra technology needed, and quality make up most of the differences. Not all adaptive technology has to be expensive—sometimes all it takes is a creative Physical Therapist.
&lt;br /&gt;
Although adaptive technology can be very costly there are ways to reduce this cost for your students or your child. There is federal aid available and there are grants that can be applied for. The challenge will be the process of finding these financial aids.

==Adaptive Technology and Early Childhood==
&lt;br /&gt;
The best time for children to learn how to use their adaptive technology is to introduce the child at an early age when the impairment or disability is diagnosed or noticed.   Often times, children are placed into early intervention settings in a pre-k classroom, and according to IDEA, these students should be evaluated for assistive technological needs for their free, public education which they are entitled to.  Therefore, teachers must know how to assess their students and help parents find the equipment that will meet the needs of the individual child.   Since early childhood classrooms include any age from infancy to pre-k, there is a wide range of possible needs with adaptive technology.  Adaptive technology may be used to improve interactions such as crawling, seeing or hearing, which will help the child grow at an early age into their school years for improved educational performances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Guernsey=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;A dependency of Great Britain, Guernsey’s own meter stamps did not appear until 1969. Before that date British stamps with “GUERNSEY/ CHANNEL ISLANDS” (or “CI”) in the town mark were used.
* All franks contain “Guernsey” and a map of the Channel Islands. 

'''NOTE''': Catalog values are not given for the meter stamps of Guernsey because no market appears to exist for them. Although the authors have not seen stamps in Sterling (£sd) currency, meters came into use before the change to decimal currency and no doubt exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{formatting}}
== Bridge ==
“A device used to connect two separate Ethernet networks into one extended Ethernet. Bridges only forward packets between networks that are destined for the other network. Term used by Novell to denote a computer that accepts packets at the network layer and forward them to another network.”
                
=== Why Use Bridges? ===
Bridges are important in some networks because the networks are divided into many parts geographically remote from one another. 
Something is required to join these networks so that they can become part of the whole network. Take for example a divided LAN, if there is no medium to join these separate LAN parts an enterprise may be limited in its growth potential. The bridge is one of the tools to join these LANS.

Secondly a LAN (for example Ethernet) can be limited in its transmission distance. We can eliminate this problem using bridges as repeaters, so that we can connect a geographically extensive network within the building or campus using bridges. Hence geographically challenged networks can be created using Bridges.
                                 
Third, the network administrator can control the amount of traffic going through bridges sent across the expensive network media.

Fourth, the bridge is plug and play device so there is no need to configure the bridge. And suppose any machine was taken out from the network then there is no need for the network administrator to update the bridge configuration information as bridges are self configured.

=== The MAC Bridge ===
Bridges are used to connect LANs. Therefore in determining how to transmit traffic between LANs they use a destination MAC address. Bridges push the function of network layer such as route discovery and forwarding to the data link layer. There is no conventional network layer for bridge.

The bridges can not maintain the integrity of data transmission in the case of received errors. For example suppose there is a error in one frame and that frame is not transmitted properly the bridge will not give any acknowledgement to retransmit that frame. If the bridge becomes congested the frames can be discarded to make the traffic smooth. On the other hand the bridges are easy to implement and no need to configure them.

== Types of Bridges ==
# Transparent basic bridge
# Source routing bridge
# Transparent learning bridge
# Transparent spanning bridge

=== The Transparent Basic Bridge ===
The simplest type of bridge is the transparent basic bridge. It stores the traffic until it can transmit it to the next network. The amount of time the data is stored is very brief. Traffic is sent to all ports except the port from which the bridge received the data. No conversion of traffic is performed by a bridge. In this regard, the bridge is similar to a repeater.

=== Source Routing Bridge ===
The route through the LAN internet is determined by the source (originator) of the traffic hence this bridge is called as source routing bridge. The routing information field (RIF) in the LAN frame header, contains the information of route followed by the LAN network.

The intermediate nodes that are required to receive and send the frame must be identified by the routing information. For this reason source routing requires that the user traffic should follow the path determined by the routing information field.

The frames of the source routing protocol are different from the other bridge frames because the source routing information must be contained within the frame. The architecture of the other bridges and the source routing bridges are similar.
Both uses MAC relay entity at the LAN node. Interfaces are provided through MAC relay entity and LLC.
          
The figure shown above shows the functional architecture of the source routing bridges. There are two primitives who are invoked between MAC entities and the LLC. The first is M_UNITDATA.request, and the second is M_UNITDATA.indication

The parameter in these primitives must provide the information about to create the frame (frame control), MAC address, the routing information which is used to forward the traffic through the LAN.  The frame check sequence value should be included if frame check sequence operations are to be performed. The primitive also contain a user priority parameter, a data parameter, and a service class parameter. A user parameter and a service class parameter are used only with token rings and not used for other LANs, for example Ethernet or Token bus.  
                
=== The Transparent Learning Bridge ===
The transparent bridge finds the location of user using the source and destination address. When the frame is received at the bridge it checks its source address and the destination address. The destination address is stored if it was not found in a routing table. Then the frame sent to all LAN excluding the LAN from which it came. The source address is also stored in the routing table. If another frame is arrived in which the previous source address is now its destination address then it is forwarded to that port.  

The physical topology of transparent bridges cannot allow the loops in the network. This is the restriction over transparent learning bridge.
The whole operation of this bridge is operated by the bridge processor which is responsible for routing traffic across its ports. The processor decides the destination ports of associated MAC addresses by accessing a routing database. When a frame arrives the processor will check the output port in the database on which the frame will be relayed. If the destination address is not in the database then the processor will broadcast that frame onto all ports except the port from which the frame was arrived. The bridge processor also stores the source address in the frame because this source address may be the destination address for another incoming frame.    

{{TODO|Diagram is referred to, but is missing|Switches, Routers, Bridges and LANs}}

The bridge processes the incoming frame as shown above in figure .   The Bridge will check the source and destination address of the incoming frame. In this case the source address is ‘B’ and the destination address is ‘A’. After accessing its routing table, it finds that the destination address is not present in the database and it broadcast the frame to all outgoing ports except the port from which it was arrived. After forwarding the frame it will check the SA (source address) and confirms that it knows it. If SA is present in the database, it will refresh the database and update this entry by refreshing the timer which means that this address is still ‘timely and valid’. In the shown example it does not know about the SA of ‘B’. It stores ‘B’ into database that ‘B’ is an active station on the LAN and from the view point of the bridge ‘B’ can be found on the port 1. 

{{TODO|Diagram is referred to, but is missing|Switches, Routers, Bridges and LANs}}

As shown in figure   , a frame arrives at the bridge on port 3 with DA (destination address) as ‘B’ and SA (source address) as C. The bridge will access its database and check the destination address is present or not. The bridge finds the destination port and determines that ’B’ can reach through its port 1. This decision was made from the previous operation in which a frame arrived from port 1 with SA= ’B’ and DA= ’A’. This source address becomes the destination address for this frame. So bridge know the exact destination port no. This time the bridge will not broadcast the frame because it knows the DA. It will forward the frame to port 1 and not on port 2. The bridge also stores in its routing table that the SA ‘C’ can be reached through port 3. This information will be useful in coming next frames. The learning bridge assumes that the frame received on an incoming port has been properly delivered by the other bridges and LANs so it does not forward the frame to the port from where it arrives. The learning bridge is totally based on trust.  
                             
In some situation bridges will not forward the frame to any of the port. 
The total filtering is possible as shown in the figure 5. a frame arrives to the bridge with SA= ’D’ and DA = ’B’ from port 1. The bridge will access its database and check the SA and DA and reveals that DA=’B’ can be found on port 1. The frame is arrived from the same port so it will not forward that frame to port 2 or port 3 and also not backward to port 1. It also checks the SA is present in the database. The SA =’D’ is not present in the database so it will add this entry to the database and time is attached to the entry.

The multicasting and broadcasting is permitted in learning bridge. AS shown in figure a frame arrives from port 1 with DA = ‘ALL’ (All 1s in the destination address field) and SA= ‘D’. The bridge will not update its routing table as ‘D’ is already present in the database. In this example traffic is sent to ports two and three.                        

The figure 6 shows examples of how a bridge forward and filter the incoming frame.  A frame transmitted from station ‘A’ to station ‘B’ is not forwarded by bridge one because it assumes that the traffic was successfully transformed from ‘A’ to ‘B’ using broadcasting. The traffic sent by station ‘A’ to station ‘C’ must be forwarded by bridge 1 and discarded by bridge 2. And the traffic sent by station ‘A’ to station ’D’ must be forwarded by both of the bridges. 

The following flow chart shows the overall working logic of the learning bridges. When the bridge will receive incoming frame from port Z,  it will look for its destination MAC address in the database. If it is not present the bridge will broadcast that frame to all outgoing ports except from the arrival frame port. If the DA is present in the database, it will forward the frame else if the DA is the port from where it arrives, it will discard that frame. However if the DA is different then it will forward the frame to appropriate port. Then the bridge will check the SA is present in the database. If it is present then it will refresh the timer else it will add that SA to the database.

=== The Transparent Spanning Tree Bridge ===

The last type of bridge is transparent spanning bridge. These bridges use a subnet of the full topology to create a loop free operation. The following table show the logic of transparent spanning tree bridge. The received frame is checked by the bridge in following manner.  
The destination address of arrived frame is checked with routing table in the database. Here more information is required for bridge so the bridge port is also stored in the database. This information is known as port state information and it helps in deciding that, a port can be used for this destination address or not. The port can be in a block state to fulfill the requirements of spanning tree operations or in a forwarding state. If the port is in forwarding state the frame is routed across the port. 
The port can have different status such as; it may be in “disabled” state for the maintenance reason or may also be unavailable temporarily if databases are being changed in the bridge because of result of the change in the routed network. 

== Spanning tree Protocol ==
Some site uses two or more bridges in parallel between the pair of LANs to increase the reliability of the network as shown in figure 7. This arrangement introduces some looping problem in the network.

{{TODO|Figure 7 is referred to, but is missing}}

In above figure frame F, with unknown destination is handled.Bridges don’t know the destination address so each of the two bridges broadcast that frame. For this example this means copying it to LAN 2. After that bridge 1 sees the frame F2 which is a frame with unknown destination address, which it copies to LAN1, generating another frame F3 which is not shown in figure. Same way bridge 2 copies frame F1 to LAN1 generating F4 which is also not shown in figure. Bridge 1 now forward frame F4 and bridge 2 copies frame F3. This cycle goes on and on. This is where looping problem came in picture.

The solution to this looping problem is bridges should communicate with each other and change their actual topology with spanning tree that reaches to each LAN in the network. In the spanning tree some bridges in the network are discarded as we want to construct the loop free topology. For example in figure    shown below there are 10 routers connecting 9 different LANs. This configuration can be changed to loop free topology shown by the graph in figure 9.  Here LANs are shown as node and the LANs are connected by the bridges shown by an arc. This graph can be reduced to the spanning tree by dropping the arc shown by dotted lines. Now there is only single path from one LAN to another. In this way looping problem was solved by the spanning tree and there is only single path from each source to each destination. Loops are totally removed using spanning 3.

To construct the spanning tree follow following Spanning tree Algorithm 
# First of all select the root bridge. The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest serial number (this number is provided by the router manufacturer). All ports which are coming to the bridge or going out from the bridge are designated port. In our given example in figure the root bridge is ‘A’ and the ports coming from LAN 1 and LAN 2 are the designated ports. 
# Then select a root port for the non-root bridge. Root port for the non-root bridge is the port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge. In our example the incoming port to bridge ‘B’ is  lowest cost path. Same logic applies for the other bridges.
# Select a designated port on each segment. The designated port has the lowest cost to the root bridge. In our example the outgoing port from bridge ‘B’ is designated port which has the lowest cost to the root bridge. Same logic applies for the other bridges. 
# After spanning tree algorithm determine the lowest cost spanning tree, it enables all root ports and the designated ports, and disables all other ports. 
# The spanning tree algorithm continues to run during normal operation.

The advantages of bridging over routing are as follows:

# Transparent bridges are plug and play as they are self learning and do not require any configuration. For the assignment of network address routers require definition for each interface. These addresses should be unique.
# Bridging has less overhead for handling packets as compared to routing.
# Bridging is protocol independent while routing is protocol dependent.
# Bridging will forward all LAN protocols while router can route packets only.

=== Packet formats ===

The Configuration Message:

The following fig. shows the format for the configuration message. It is also called as a bridge protocol data unit (BPDU). The following parameters are set to zero:
# The protocol identifier, 
# Version identifier,
# Message type.  

{|
! Octets || Parameters
|-
|2 || Protocol Identifier
|-
|1 || Protocol Version
|-
|1 || Type of BPDU
|-
| 1 || Flags
|-
| 8 || Root identifier
|-
| 4 || Cost to root
|-
| 8 || Bridge identifier
|-
| 2 || Port identifier
|-
| 2 || Message age
|-
| 2 || Max age
|-
| 2 || Hello time
|-
| 2 || Forward Delay
|}

The root identifier field contains the identity of the root bridge, and a 2 octet field which is used for deciding the priority of the root bridge and the designated bridge. The root path cost field indicates the total cost from the transmitting bridge to the 
bridge which is listed in the root id. field.

The flag field in the bridge message contains a topology change notification flag which is used to inform non root bridges that they should update station entries in cache. This field can also be used to indicate topology change notification bit. The bridges do not have to inform a parent bridge that a topology changes has occurred using the previous field. The parent bridge will perform this task.

The priority and ID of the bridge that is sending the configuration message can be indicated by the bridge and port identifier. The message age field indicates the time in 1/256th of a second. The hello time field also indicates 1/256th of a second, defines the time between the sending of message by the root bridge. The forward delay field, also in 1/256th of a second, is the time during which a port should stay in an intermediate state such as learning or listening before moving from blocking state to forwarding state.

=== Port states ===

Each port on a bridge has a state that controls how it handles the packets it receives. The port can forward frames as normal, or can discard the frames. In addition, a port may choose to learn MAC addresses from frames it discards (in addition to learning from frames it forwards). It's theoretically possible that a port could forward a packet without learning the MAC address from it, but this isn't used in practice. The possible combinations are given the following names:

; Discarding
: No forwarding or learning takes place
; Learning
: The port learns MAC addresses, but discards the frames
; Forwarding
: The port both learns addresses and forwards frames

== Remote bridges ==
   
Bridges are used to connect two (or more than 2) different distant LANs. For example a company may have different department at different locations each with its own LAN.  The whole network should be connected so that it will act like one large LAN. This can be achieved by the placing a bridge on each LAN and connecting the bridges with the lines (the line given by the telephone company). In the figure10 the three LANs are connected with the remote bridges. As given in the figure we can join number of LANs using remote bridges.    

{{TODO|Diagram is referred to, but does not exist yet|Switches, Routers, Bridges and LANs}}

== Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) ==

In 2001 the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, which is an extension of the original STP that supports faster convergence after a topology change. The new protocol requires a new BPDU format, but supports falling back to the old format in the event of a plain STP bridge being identified. This means that the STP protocol as such is no longer needed, and was later obsoleted in the 2004 release of the 802.1D standard.

== Switching Technology ==

Switching technologies are crucial to the new network design. 
Because the prices on layer 2 switching have been dropping dramatically, it 
is easier to justify the cost of buying switches for your entire network. This 
doesn't mean that every business can afford switch ports for all users, but it 
does allow for a cost-effective upgrade solution when the time comes.
Layer 2 switching –
Layer 2 switching is hardware based, which means it uses the Media Access 
Control (MAC) address from the host's network interface cards (NICs) to 
filter the network. Switches use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits.
(ASICs) to build and maintain filter tables. It is OK to think of a layer 2 
switch as a multiport bridge. 
Layer 2 switching provides the following:
Hardware-based bridging (MAC)
Wire speed
High speed
Low latency
Low cost
Layer 2 switching is so efficient because there is no modification to the data packet, only to the frame encapsulation of the packet, and only when 
the data packet is passing through dissimilar media (such as from Ethernet 
to FDDI).
Use layer 2 switching for workgroup connectivity and network segmentation (breaking up collision domains). This allows you to create a flatter 
network design and one with more network segments than traditional 
10BaseT shared networks.
Layer 2 switching has helped develop new components in the network infrastructure:

Server farms 

Servers are no longer distributed to physical locations 
because virtual LANs can be created to create broadcast domains in a 
switched internetwork. This means that all servers can be placed in a central location, yet a certain server can still be part of a workgroup in a 
remote branch, for example. 

Intranets 

Allows organization-wide client/server communications based 
on a Web technology. These new technologies are allowing more data to flow off of local sub-nets and onto a routed network, where a router's performance can become 
the bottleneck.


Limitations of Layer 2 Switching

Layer 2 switches have the same limitations as bridge networks. Remember 
that bridges are good if you design the network by the 80/20 rule: users 
spend 80 percent of their time on their local segment.

Bridged networks break up collision domains, but the network is still one large broadcast domain. Similarly, layer 2 switches (bridges) cannot break 
up broadcast domains, which can cause performance issues and limits the 
size of your network. Broadcast and multicasts, along with the slow convergence of spanning tree, can cause major problems as the network grows. 
Because of these problems, layer 2 switches cannot completely replace routers in the internetwork. 

Layer 3 Switching –

The only difference between a layer 3 switch and a router is the way the 
administrator creates the physical implementation. Also, traditional routers 
use microprocessors to make forwarding decisions, and the switch performs 
only hardware-based packet switching. However, some traditional routers 
can have other hardware functions as well in some of the higher-end models. 
Layer 3 switches can be placed anywhere in the network because they handle 
high-performance LAN traffic and can cost-effectively replace routers. 
Layer 3 switching is all hardware-based packet forwarding, and all packet forwarding is handled by hardware ASICs. Layer 3 switches really are no different functionally than a traditional router and perform the same functions, 
which are listed here:
Determine paths based on logical addressing
Run layer 3 checksums (on header only)
Use Time to Live (TTL)
Process and responds to any option information
Can update Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) managers with Management Information Base (MIB) information
Provide Security
The benefits of layer 3 switching include the following:
Hardware-based packet forwarding
High-performance packet switching
High-speed scalability
Low latency
Lower per-port cost
Flow accounting
Security
Quality of service (QoS)
Layer 4 Switching –
Layer 4 switching is considered a hardware-based layer 3 switching technology that can also consider the application used (for example, Telnet or FTP). Layer 4 switching provides additional routing above layer 3 by using the port 
numbers found in the Transport layer header to make routing decisions. 
These port numbers are found in Request for Comments (RFC) 1700 and 
reference the upper-layer protocol, program, or application.
Layer 4 information has been used to help make routing decisions for quite a while. For example, extended access lists can filter packets based on layer 4 port numbers. Another example is accounting information gathered 
by NetFlow switching in Cisco's higher-end routers. 
The largest benefit of layer 4 switching is that the network administrator can configure a layer 4 switch to prioritize data traffic by application, which means a QoS can be defined for each user. For example, a number of users 
can be defined as a Video group and be assigned more priority, or band-
width, based on the need for videoconferencing. 
However, because users can be part of many groups and run many applications, the layer 4 switches must be able to provide a huge filter table or 
response time would suffer. This filter table must be much larger than any 
layer 2 or 3 switch. A layer 2 switch might have a filter table only as large as 
the number of users connected to the network may be even less if some hubs 
are used within the switched fabric. However, a layer 4 switch might have 
five or six entries for each and every device connected to the network! If the 
layer 4 switch does not have a filter table that includes all the information, 
the switch will not be able to produce wire-speed results. 

== Multi-Layer Switching (MLS)== 
Multi-layer switching combines layer 2, 3, and 4 switching technologies and 
provides high-speed scalability with low latency. It accomplishes this high combination of high-speed scalability with low latency by using huge filter 
tables based on the criteria designed by the network administrator.
Multi-layer switching can move traffic at wire speed and also provide layer 3 routing, which can remove the bottleneck from the network routers. 
This technology is based on the idea of route once, switch many.
Multi-layer switching can make routing/switching decisions based on the following: 
MAC source/destination address in a Data Link frame
IP source/destination address in the Network layer header
Protocol filed in the Network layer header
Port source/destination numbers in the Transport layer header
There is no performance difference between a layer 3 and a layer 4 switch 
because the routing/switching is all hardware based.
== LAN Switch Types ==
LAN switching is used to forward or filter frames based on their hardware destination. However, there are three different methods in which 
frames can be forwarded or filtered. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and by understanding the different LAN switch methods available, you can make smart switching decisions. 
There are three switching modes:
* Store-and-forward

With the store-and-forward mode, the complete 
data frame is received on the switch's buffer, a cyclic redundancy check 
(CRC) is run, and then the destination address is looked up in the MAC 
filter table.
* Cut-through

With the cut-through mode, the switch waits for only the 
destination hardware address to be received and then looks up the destination address in the MAC filter table.

* FragmentFree

FragmentFree is the default mode for the Catalyst 1900 
switch; it is sometimes referred to as modified cut-through checks the first 64 bytes of a frame for fragmentation (because of possible collisions) before forwarding the frame.

Figure shows the different points where the switching mode takes place in the frame. The different switching modes are discussed in detail in 
the following sections.

==Route Switch Modules (RSMs)== 
Route Switch Modules (RSMs) are also called internal route processors because the processing of layer 3 packets is internal to a switch. You need to add an RSM to a layer 2 device for example, a 5000 Catalyst switch--to be 
able to provide switching of layer 3 packets without a router. 
An RSM makes layer 2 switches a multi-layer switch and can integrate layer 2 and layer 3 functionality in a single box. The 5000 series uses the 
RSM or a Route Switch Feature Card (RSFC), and the 6000 series uses the Multilayer Switch Module (MSM) to perform this function. The RSM, 
RSFC, and MSM are configured in exactly the same way on the switch.
The RSM is a module plugged directly into the switch, which runs the Cisco IOS in order to perform inter-VLAN communication. The 5000 series 
switch sees the RSM as a single trunked port and a single MAC address. In 
other words, it appears as a router on a stick to the switch. The RSM inter-
face to the switch is through VLAN 0 and VLAN 1. VLAN 0 is not accessible 
to the administrator. The RSM uses two channels, and VLAN 0 maps to 
channel 0, which supports communication between the RSM and the Catalyst 5000 series default VLAN (VLAN 1). VLAN 1 maps to channel 1. The 
MAC address assigned to the RSM is from the Programmable Read Only 
Memory (PROM) on the line communication processor (LCP). This MAC 
address is used to identify the slot of the RSM and for diagnostics. The MAC 
addresses for VLAN 1 are assigned from a PROM that contains 512 MAC 
addresses. All routing interfaces except VLAN 0 use the base MAC address.
The RSFC is a daughter card for the Supervisor Engine II G and Supervisor III G cards. The RSFC is a fully functioning router running the Cisco IOS. 
The MSM uses four full-duplex Gigabit Ethernet interfaces to connect to the switch and looks like an external router to the switch. These four inter-
faces can be four separate links for four different VLANs, or they can be trunked and configured as one load-balanced link running EtherChannel 
and ISL or 802.1q. Subinterfaces are then used to configure each VLAN

==Multi-layer Switching (MLS)==
==Fundamentals of MLS==
You have undoubtedly heard of the term &quot;router on a stick.&quot; Figure 7.1 depicts the router on a stick architecture.

{{TODO|Referenced diagram is missing}}

As you can see from the diagram, there are multiple hosts using two separate VLAN assignments. One segment is running on VLAN10, and the other segment is running on VLAN50. Both VLANs or segments, are connected to the same switch. The switch is then connected to a router. Here we show an external router, but an RSM provides the same functionality, just internally.

By now you understand that for Host A on VLAN10 to communicate to Host D on VLAN50, packets must be routed through Router A. Because of the VLAN assignments, the switch must send the packet to the router on interface FE0/0.10. The router knows that the route to the network assigned to VLAN50 is through interface FE0/0.50. The packet is then sent back to the switch and forwarded to Host D.

Now back to our original question. Why use MLS? You can see from the diagram in Figure 7.1 that it very inefficient to have to use a router, or Route Switch Module (RSM), to move a packet from Host A to Host D when they are connected to the same device. MLS is used to bypass the router on subsequent packets of the same flow. A flow is created by using packet header information&amp;mdash;Inter-Switch Link (ISL), layer 2, and layer 3 headers. There are several fields within a packet that make it unique:

* Source and destination IP addresses
* Source and destination MAC addresses
* Type of Service (TOS)
* Protocol type (i.e., HTTP, FTP, ICMP, etc.)

These are just some of the characteristics of a packet that can be used to establish a flow. A flow is defined by using a specified set of these attributes.

=== MLS Requirements ===
Cisco Catalyst switches require additional hardware to see the packet header 
information. Catalyst 5000 switches use the NetFlow Feature Card (NFFC) 
to gather this information and cache it. Catalyst 6000 series switches use the 
Multilayer Switch Feature Card (MSFC) and the Policy Feature Card (PFC) 
to gather and cache header information. There is a detailed process, which 
will be discussed later in the chapter, that allows switches to establish flows.
MLS requires three components to function in any network 
Multilayer Switching Protocol (MLSP) is a protocol that runs on the 
router and allows it to communicate to the MLS-SE regarding topology or security changes.
Multilayer Switching Route Processor (MLS-RP) can be an MLS-capable router or an RSM installed in the switch.
Multilayer Switching Switching Engine (MLS-SE) is an MLS-capable 
switch (a 5000 with an NFFC or a 6000 with an MSFC and PFC).

Now that you have a basic understanding of what MLS does and what is required for MLS to function in a network, let's get into the nitty-gritty of 
how it works.

==MLS Procedures==
We discussed the three required components of MLS. It is important to 
understand how they work together to enable layer 3 switching. Let's look 
at a sample network topology that will support MLS. Figure 7.2 shows a 
simple architecture of a router and a switch with two connected hosts on the 
switch. Again, the hosts have different VLAN assignments, requiring the 
router's intervention to route packets. Notice that the figure depicts the main 
interface with two subinterfaces, FE0/0.2 and FE0/0.3.
MLS follows a four-step process to establish the layer 3 switching functionality. These four steps can then be broken down into more detailed processes. The four steps required to enable MLS are as follows:
MLSP discovery The MLS-RP uses MLSP to send hello packets out all 
interfaces to discover MLS-SE and establish MLS-RP/MLS-SE neighbor 
relationships. 
Identification of candidate packets The NFFC or PFC watches incoming packets and creates partial cache entries for them, thus identifying the 
packets as potential candidates for a flow, or candidate packets.
Identification of enable packets The NFFC or PFC watches packets 
coming from the MLS-RP and tries to match them with candidate packet 
entries. If matches are made, the packets are tagged as enable packets and 
a shortcut forwarding entry is made in the CAM table.
Subsequent flow packets are layer 3 switched Incoming packets are 
compared against CAM table entries. If the packets match the flow criteria, they are rewritten by the NFFC or PFC, then sent to the corresponding 
exit port for the flow.
MLSP Discovery –
Switches, NFFCs or PFCs specifically, need routers to perform the initial 
route table lookup and the packet rewrite. This dependency requires that 
MLS adjacencies are established between the switch and the router. This is 
accomplished using the MLSP protocol.
Initially, the router, or MLS-RP, sends hello packets containing all of the MAC addresses and VLANs configured for use on the router. These messages are sent every 15 seconds to a layer 2 multicast address of 01-00-0C-
DD-DD-DD. The intended recipients of these hello packets are the MLS-SE 
devices on the network.
When an MLS-SE receives the information, it makes an entry in the CAM table of all the MLS-RP devices in the layer 2 network. Layer 2 is mentioned 
because MLS-SE devices are not concerned with devices that are not directly 
connected to layer 2 devices, such as switches. Figure 7.3 depicts the MLSP 
discovery process.
Part of the information that is stored in the CAM table once an MLSP hello packet is received is an ID called an XTAG. The next section describes 
the significance and purpose of the XTAG.
XTAGs
Simply put, an XTAG is a unique identifier that MLS-SEs (switches) use to 
keep track of the MLS-RPs in the network. All of the MAC addresses and 
VLANs in use on the MLS-RP are associated to the XTAG value in the CAM 
table.
You can clearly see that the MFSC has been assigned the XTAG value of 1. 
The MFSC receives the assignment because the MFSC acts as the MLS-RP. 
In this example, only one MAC address is associated with XTAG 1. How-
ever, there are two VLANs associated with it.
== MLS Cache ==
Once MLS-SEs have established CAM entries for MLS-RPs, the switch is 
ready to start scanning packets and creating cache entries. This was 
described previously as identification of candidate and enable packets.
The cache entries are made in order to maintain flow data. Flow data allows the MLS-SE to rewrite the packets with the new source and destination MAC address and then forward the packets. All this is done without 
sending the packets to the router for a route lookup and to be rewritten. 

Cache entries happen in two steps:
* Candidate packet entries
* Enable packet entries
After these entries have been made in the MLS-SE, subsequent packets are 
matched against existing flow entries and dealt with accordingly.

=== Identifying Candidate Packets ===
The process of identifying candidate packets is quite simple. As has already 
been established, the MLS-SE has MAC address entries for any and all inter-
faces that come from the MLS-RP. Using this information, the MLS-SE starts 
watching for incoming frames destined for any MLS-RP-related MAC 
addresses.

An incoming frame will match one of the following three criteria:
* Not destined for an MLS-RP MAC address
* Destined for an MLS-RP MAC address, but no cache entry exists for this flow
* Destined for an MLS-RP MAC address, but a cache entry already exists for this flow

Different actions will be taken by the MLS-SE, depending on which criteria match. We will discuss the first one right now. The others will be 
addressed in the following sections.
If the incoming frame is not destined for a MAC address associated with the MLS-RP, no cache entry is made. No cache entry is made because MLS 
is used to avoid additional route lookups. If the frame is destined to another 
MAC address in the CAM table, the frame is layer 2 switched.
Let's move on to discuss the processes for identifying and acting on the next two criteria. First we'll discuss what happens when an entry already 
exists. Then we'll cover the details of the cache entry process for a candidate 
packet. Figure depicts the occurrence of a candidate packet
Cache Entry Exists
When frames enter the switch destined for an MLS-RP MAC address, the 
MLS-SE checks to see if a cache entry has been made that matches the 
attributes of the current packet.
As was mentioned briefly previously, each frame has distinguishing characteristics or attributes that allow the MLS-SE to categorize a packet into a flow. The MLS-SE uses these attributes to pattern match. If an incoming packet has the same attributes as an established flow cache entry, the packet is layer 3╜ or shortcut-switched.
No Cache Entry
When a qualified (destined for an MLS-RP MAC address) incoming frame is 
compared against the cache and fails (no match is found), a cache entry is 
made. At this point, the packet is tagged as a candidate packet.
Once the cache entry is made, the packet is forwarded to the router (MLS-RP) for normal processing. Here the router performs the route 
lookup, rewrites the layer 2 header, and sends the packet out the next-hop 
interface, whichever it may be.
The state of the MLS cache is only partial at this stage. A complete flow cache has not been established because the MLS-SE has only seen a packet come in and be forwarded to the router. It still needs to see something that 
it can tag as an enable packet come back from the router.

=== Identifying Enable Packets ===                
Enable packets are the missing piece of the flow cache puzzle. Just as the MLS-SE watched all incoming frames destined for the MLS-RP MAC 
addresses, it also watches all of the packets coming from the MLS-RP.
It watches these packets hoping for a match with the candidate packet cache entry. If it can make the match, the packet is tagged as an enable 
packet and the remaining elements of the flow cache are completed in the 
CAM table. Figure 7.5 depicts the occurrence of an enable packet.
The match is made using the following criteria:
The source MAC address is from an MLS-RP.
The destination IP matches the destination IP of a candidate packet.
The source MAC address is associated to the same XTAG value as the 
candidate packet's destination MAC address.
If all three of these criteria are met, the MLS-SE completes the shortcut cache entry.
Frame Modification
It is important to understand that this shortcut switching occurs at layer 3. 
The layer 2 frame is rewritten by the switch. Normally, a router (layer 3 
device) would rewrite the frame with the necessary information. A rewrite 
consists of changing the VLAN assignment, the source and destination MAC 
addresses, and the checksums. The MLS-SE can also modify the TTL, check-
sums, TOS, and encapsulation 
Because MLS packets are no longer sent to the router, the MLS-SE must perform the rewrite function. When it changes the source and destination 
MAC address, the MLS-SE uses the MAC address of the MLS-RP for the 
source, and it changes the destination MAC to the MAC of the directly connected host. Through this procedure, the frame appears to the destination 
host as if it had come through the router. Figure 7.6 depicts the differences between the incoming frame and the exiting frame.
Subsequent Packets
Once the candidate and enable packets have been identified and a shortcut, 
or flow cache, has been established, subsequent packets are forwarded by the 
switch to the destination without the use of the router. Because the MLS-SE 
has the capability to rewrite the frames, it can make the necessary modifications and forward the frame directly to the destination host.
The MLS-SE stores the necessary information in cache, such as the source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination MAC addresses, 
and the MLS-RP-related MAC addresses. Using this information, the MLS-
SE is then capable of identifying packets belonging to a specific flow, rewriting the frame, and forwarding the packets to the proper destination.
Disabling MLS
There is a right way and a wrong way (not necessarily wrong, just unwanted) 
to disable MLS on a router or switch. Both methods will be discussed here.
The Right Way
The normal, and correct, way to disable MLS depends on the equipment you 
are using. Disabling MLS on a router can be paralleled with disabling MLS 
on an MSFC for a 6500 series switch. The command is even the same: no 
mls rp ip issued from the interface on either the router or the MSFC. To disable it completely, you can issue the same command from the global con-
figuration mode. The consequences of this action vary depending on the sys-
tem on which it is issued. When the command is issued on the router, the 
router alone disables MLS. When it's issued on an MSFC, MLS is disabled 
on the MSFC and the switch itself.
That's why there is a difference when different switches are used. When you're using a 5000 series switch, MLS is disabled by default. However, on 
a 6000 series switch, MLS is enabled by default. To disable MLS on a 5000 
series switch, use the set mls disable command. On a 6000 series, MLS 
should be disabled by issuing the no ip mls command on the MSFC.
The Wrong Way
There are several ways to inadvertently disable MLS on switches. Some are 
temporary, and others are permanent. Here is a list of MSFC/router com-
mands that can disable MLS:
no ip routing 
ip security 
ip tcp compression-connections 
ip tcp header-compression 
clear ip route
By disabling IP routing on the MSFC or router, you automatically disable MLS. IP security disables MLS on the interface to which the command is 
applied. The same results occur with the IP TCP compression commands. 
Finally, the clear ip route command simply clears the MLS cache entries 
and the flow caches must be reestablished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''circumcircle''' of a triangle is the unique circle passing through its three vertices.

The centre of the circumcircle is the '''circumcentre'''.  It is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides.  This can be explained as follows:

* Each bisector of a side is the locus of points equidistant from the two endpoints of the side, e.g. all the points on the bisector of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; are equidistant from point A and point B.
* On the bisector of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; points are equidistant from A and B.  On the bisector of &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; points are equidistant from B and C.  The point where these two bisectors cross is both equidistant from A and B and equidistant from B and C.  So the intersection point's distance from A is the same as its distance to B is the same as its distance to C.  So it is equidistant from A and C and hence lies on the bisector of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; 
* Where the three bisectors cross is equidistant from A,B and C.  Hence a circle with centre that point can pass through all three points.



&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Triangle (Acute) Circumscribed.svg|The circumcenter of an acute triangle is inside the triangle
Image:Triangle (Right) Circumscribed.svg|The circumcenter of a right triangle is on the hypotenuse
Image:Triangle (Obtuse) Circumscribed.svg|The circumcenter of an obtuse triangle is outside the triangle
&lt;/gallery&gt;


The radius of this circle (the '''circumradius''', usually denoted by R) is found as follows: if ''a'' is any side of the triangle and ''A'' is the angle opposite this side, &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{a}{2 \sin(A)}&lt;/math&gt;.  To prove this, consider a triangle where two of the sides are radii of the circumcircle and the third is the side of length ''a''.  This triangle is isosceles (since all radii are of equal length), and the angle between the radii is 2''A'' since the angle at the centre of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference.  The formula follows from applying simple trigonometry to this triangle.

From the sine theorem, the same value of R will be found from all three sides.

If the other two sides are ''b'' and ''c'', the area Δ of the triangle is &lt;math&gt;\frac{bc}{2} \sin(A)&lt;/math&gt;.  Multiplying together these two formulae, &lt;math&gt;\Delta R = \frac{abc}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Rrplacing ''a'' by 2Rsin(A), etc. it follows that

:Δ = 2R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin(A)sin(B)sin(C).

The circumcentre lies in the interior of a triangle if and only if all the angles are acute.  For a right-angled triangle it lies at the centre of the hypotenuse, and if one angle is obtuse it lies outside the triangle.  The circumcircle is the smallest circle that can enclose an acute-angled triangle.  For an obtuse-angled triangle, the circle with the longest side as a diameter is smaller.  (For a right-angled triangle, these two circles are identical.)

      <comment>/* Calculating the radius */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''incircle''' of a triangle is the unique circle that has the three sides of the triangle as tangents.  It is the largest circle lying entirely within a triangle.

Its centre, the '''incentre''' of the triangle, is at the intersection of the bisectors of the three angles of the triangle.  This can be explained as follows:

* The bisector of &lt;math&gt;\angle{ABC}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points equidistant from the line &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The bisector of &lt;math&gt;\angle{ACB}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points equidistant from the line &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The point where those two lines intersect is both equidistant from &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; and equidistant form &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  So the intersection point's distance from &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as its distance to &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as its distance to &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;. So it is equidistant from &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and hence lies on the bisector of &lt;math&gt;\angle{BAC}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Where the three bisectors cross is equidistant from &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence a circle with that point as centre can be tangent to all three lines.

== Calculating the radius ==
Its radius, the '''inradius''' (usually denoted by r) is given by r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter (a+b+c)/2 (a, b and c being the sides).  To prove this, note that the lines joining the angles to the incentre divide the triangle into three smaller triangles, with bases a, b and c respectively and each with height r.  The total area of these three triangles, hence the area Δ of the original triangle, is ar/2 + br/2 + cr/2.  Rearranging, the result follows.

Applying Heron's theorem, &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s}&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Trigonometry/Circles and Triangles/The Circumcircle|circumradius]] of the triangle is R, Δ&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{abc}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.  Combining this with the formula for r, &lt;math&gt;Rr = \frac{abc}{4s}&lt;/math&gt;.

The distance of the incentre from A is 4Rsin({{frac|B|2}})sin({{frac|C|2}}), and similarly for the other vertices.

The square of the distance between the circumcentre and incentre is R(R-2r).  It follows that R &gt; 2r unless the two centres coincide (which only happens for an equilateral triangle).

== Another formula for the radius ==
Let I be the incentre.  Comsider the triangle BIC. Let D be the point where the incircle touches BC; the angles IDB, IDC are right angles.

:Angle IBD = {{frac|B|2}} and angle ICD = {{frac|C|2}}.

:BD = ''r'' cot({{frac|B|2}}); CD = ''r'' cot({{frac|C|2}}); BD+CD = BC = ''a''.

:&lt;math&gt;r(\cot(\frac{B}{2}) + \cot(\frac{C}{2})) = a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = {{a} \over {\cot(\frac{B}{2}) + \cot(\frac{C}{2})}} = a {{\sin(\frac{B}{2}) \sin(\frac{C}{2})} \over {\cos(\frac{A}{2})}}&lt;/math&gt;

By symmetry, there are two other formulae involving ''b'' and ''c'' respectively.

Substituting ''a'' = 2Rsin(A), it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;r = 4R\sin(\frac{A}{2})\sin(\frac{B}{2})\sin(\frac{C}{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

{{frac|r|R}} thus equals {{frac|1|2}} for an equilateral triangle, and it can be shown that it is less than this for any other triangle.

== The Equal Incircles Theorem ==
Consider a straight line and a point X not on that line.  Choose points A, B, C, D, E, F ... such that the triangles XAB, XBC, XCD, XDE, XEF, ... have equal inradii.  Then the triangles XAC, XBD, XCE, XDF, ... will have inradii equal to each other (though larger than the inradius of XAB).  Similarly, the triangles XAD, XBE, XCF, will have inradii equal to each other and so on.

== Another circle ==
There are three points where the angle bisectors intersect the opposite sides.  These three points define a circle that will, in general, cut each side twice, defining three chords of the circle.  (In an isosceles triangle, the base is a tangent to the circle; in an equilateral triangle, all three sides are tangents.)  The length of the longest chord equals the sum of the lengths of the other two chords.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Javascript Comparison ===
A comparison with Javascript would also be interesting, especially with regards to Object-Oriented Programming.  Javascript using a &quot;prototype-based&quot; inheritance model which is quite different from C++'s model.  
--[[User:Autumnfields|Autumnfields]] ([[User talk:Autumnfields|talk]]) 10:47, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

:JavaScript and ActionScript are extremely interesting I think the only reason no one created a section was because rarely we see someone moving from those types of language directly to C++ (at least that was the case because of historical evolution of the languages and the different niches they occupy). I have no objection to add more languages to the comparison section but read the reply below and see if that can't be made in more general terms...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:19, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

=== Comparisons based on classes of problems rather than by language ===
Would it be more interesting / informative to compare C++ to other languages by having each page look at how a specific class of problem is solved, rather than a page per language?  For example, &quot;Memory Management&quot;, &quot;Inheritance&quot;, &quot;Cross-platform Execution&quot;, &quot;String Manipulation&quot;, etc. would make for interesting functional comparisons.  I'm sure there are lots of other useful problem classes to compare.
--[[User:Autumnfields|Autumnfields]] ([[User talk:Autumnfields|talk]]) 10:47, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

:The idea behind this comparisons was to provide a quick jumpstart for people that already had some experience in them. Going beyond that and examine C++'s features in comparison with how it was in other  languages could easily become a new book project, as it would require, as features and constructs are introduced, to provide not only the historical background but the comparisons themselves mixed with the rest of the content, that would defeat the objective of focusing on learning C++ and go beyond the scope of the book.

:It is indeed a great idea for a book, I think that was the intention behind the creation of the [[Computer Programming]] wikibook  (without the specific C++ comparison) but that work has been heavily cannibalized over the time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:10, 30 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Function overloading in C99 ==
I removed the the part in bold from the list of comparisons: &quot;C++ supports function overloading '''(absent in C89, allowed only for some standard library code in C99)'''&quot;.   As far as I know, the part in bold is not true (maybe some compilers support it, but it's not part of the C99 standard, AFAIK).  C99 'overloads' the trig functions by providing different names for the different versions of the functions: e.g. pow(), powf(), powl().  This is not function overloading in the C++ sense since the names are different.

If it is re-added to the page, please include  a relevant reference to the C99 spec (or otherwise valid citation) to support the fact.

I see the removed text was re-added.  I'm almost entirely certain the text is simply not true.  Function overloading is not, and has never been, part of the C language.   

For example, lcc-win32 (apparently) supports function overloading, but that's a compiler that's ''extending'' the C language.

Panic2k4, I strongly (but politely) suggest that reconsider this edit.

: Yes and No. What a person considers to be function overloading has a direct affect on whether C is considered to have function overloading or not. What is true is the function overloading facilities used by C++ do not exist in any C standard. ISO C does provide some [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/tgmath.h.html type-generic macros] which some people may consider to be a type of function overloading. ISO C also has allowed function parameters to not be explicitly declared, which can be used to overload functions. I can see how what was stated could be considered misleading or wrong though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:31, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

::I addressed the concern. Please see if you agree with the solution, it is a bit verbose for my liking as this is not a C book but I think it addresses the issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:14, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

:::Since Panic is an official admin of this wikibook, I'm happy with whatever he likes for the final text.  
:::
:::That said, it's still my opinion that C99 does not have &quot;function overloading&quot; as it is defined in C++ and it is potentially confusing to imply that it does.  In the spirit of good-natured discussion, please bear with my last response for a moment...


:::Computer programming languages do have ''strict, formal'' grammars with very precisely defined terms.  Ambiguity in a programming language definition is usually a major problem (and it's also why specs are so hard to read: they're supposed to leave no room for misinterpretation).  So when we're talking about &quot;function overloading&quot; ''in the context of C++'', we're talking about something very specific and well-defined. It is not a &quot;Yes and No&quot; issue; a person either chooses to use the C++ spec's definition or make up their own definition.  I'm making the ''assumption'' that a Wikibook entitled &quot;C++ Programming&quot; should adopt the definition of &quot;function overloading&quot; as the C++ spec defines it.
:::
:::The pre-C++0x copy of the spec I have, defines &quot;overloading&quot; on p209:  &quot;''When two or more different declarations are specified for a single name in the same scope, that name is said to be overloaded. By extension, two declarations in the same scope that declare the same name but with different types are called overloaded declarations. Only function declarations can be overloaded; object and type declarations cannot be overloaded.''&quot;
:::
:::With the above quote in mind, type-generic macros are not functions (in fact, they're not even declarations since they're part of the preprocessor stage) - therefore, while generic macro may ''look'' like function overloading and ''in some cases'' behave like function overloading, they are not function overloading because in many other ways they're very different from function overloading (part of prepreprocessor, no type checking, not exportable as symbols in libraries, etc.).  This kind of ambiguity is the very reason programmers are told to avoid macros: they ''look'' similar to functions but don't always act like them (which can cause unexpected bugs).   (...And as a quick aside, &quot;method overloading&quot; ''is'' an instance of &quot;function overloading&quot; since the C++ spec technically doesn't use the word &quot;method&quot; but instead calls them &quot;member functions&quot;.)
:::
:::One reason the above might actually matter to someone learning C++ programming is name mangling - or specifically, what that weird '''extern &quot;C&quot;''' thing that shows up in a lot of header files means.  It is ''specifically because C does not (and likely never will) support function overloading'', that C can produce a unmangled symbol name (i.e. makes the name used in the source code).  There's never any ambiguity in C about which function that name refers to ''since function names cannot be overloaded''.   In C++, on the hand, ''because there is overloading'', the parameter types need to be encoded into the symbol names...which produces the weird &quot;mangled&quot; names that end up in libraries and binaries (and seem unnecessarily mysterious to new programmers).  Most intermediate programmers eventually run across name mangling, and the explanation for why C++ mangles names and C doesn't is simple:  C++ supports function overloading and C does not.   To say otherwise, in my opinion, is misleading and inaccurate.


:::(And as for the new text now being too verbose, I agree!  My original edit was solely to remove the misleading text and keep it simpler!)
:::
:::Anyway, apologies if this was a bothersome diversion.  I'm a bit of a stickler for using the formal definitions when there actually is a formal definition.  Hope this was all taken as a constructive discussion.  That said, I do understand the general point about type-generic macros, and also I'm perfectly fine with the wikibook text being left as Panic wants it since he's the admin.

Constructive criticism is welcomed and you do have a say on the subject.
::::I fully understand your issue, but my view is similar to what Darklama describes above, in any case see if you can agree to the last change, it covers the valid points you make above, but also makes any C zealot happy without getting into much of the details.
::::If you still object, do remove the references to the C standards and make it strict negative as the purpose of the page is not to cover the minutiae of C. I can't even remember why or when that was added to the text but it has been there at least since I moved it from the parent page in 2007. In any case it would be great to cover the subject in the C Programming book in greater detail, my believe is that some of the functionalities of C++ can be (with work and added complexity) replicated with C, much of the changes in C have been just that a move to implement some of the C++ features...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:13, 11 December 2010 (UTC)

:::: I can think of one possible way C could be said to have function overloading capabilities by C++'s definition that I hadn't mentioned yet:
:::: union callback { int (*c)(int); void (*d)(void); void (*e)(char*); } caller;
:::: The above is two or more declarations with a single name.
:::: I agree with you though Autumnfields, both for simplicity and avoiding the incredible nuisances of comparing ISO C++'s definition with C. There are many websites, newsgroup threads, and forum postings dedicated to the topic of how C can do anything that C++ can do. None of it is particularly relevant to learning C++ or C though. People who want to learn the similarities and differences between the two languages might benefit from such detailed knowledge, but it could fill an entire book. I've heard C++ programs were in the beginning, when C++ was still being referred to as &quot;C with Classes&quot;, compiled with a C compiler without having had to hack or modify the compiler. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:01, 11 December 2010 (UTC)


:::: Thanks for the discussion, guys.  (And I never thought about using a union in C for that purpose...interesting, thought technically there is one memory address but there are still four compiler symbol names - each with a ''distinct'' data type: caller, caller.c, caller.d, caller.e; a single memory address is overloaded with multiple typed-names, but no single name refers to multiple distinct objects.  There's no way - that I can think of - to get a C compiler to 'choose' the right one for you.)
::::If it were up to me, I think this would be a great case for using a footnote.  Simply make the bullet &quot;C++ supports function overloading [1]&quot; where the footnote is something like, &quot;[1] C99 does support type-generic macros, etc., etc.&quot;...because as darklama noted, C is a generic system-programming language, so it's possible to do anything - it's just a matter of how &quot;natively&quot; it is supported (and, yup, the original C++ compiler was called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront C Front] since it was just a front-end on a C compiler).  I don't know if that would fit the book stylistically, though - since there don't seem to be many other footnotes in the wikibook.   -- [[User:Autumnfields|Autumnfields]] ([[User talk:Autumnfields|talk]]) 14:51, 11 December 2010 (UTC)

:::::I have made a real effort not to use footnotes, to defense of the option is simple, the software and the print versions to my understanding and experience do no respect &quot;page&quot; sizes, so the footnote is only a footnote on this specific web page version (complete), it also increases maintenance costs in text changes. My personal view, one that has been kept in the work, is that there are viable alternatives, if a note is relevant enough to be made (for instance we do have a NOTE template). In this specific case the information is important mostly to satisfy anyone that would see a full negation as an attempt belittle another language, or is more interested in C than C++. We have made an effort on these section of the book to pass the idea that there isn't a perfect language, that C++ is not superior by itself it depends in the context and way it is used, but going further than a few lines is detail about another language, without direct comparison to C++ would be outside of the scope of the book), for instance the Java comparison to me is a bit too extensive.
:::::That is also the reason I think that covering the subject on the C Programming book would help as then we could just add a wikilink to the relevant section. IIRC that book started a similar section but I haven't examined it recently...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:26, 11 December 2010 (UTC)

::::: Probably could describe C++'s overloading in terms of one name, one scope, and different addresses? Using another C example can help to explain why I include one scope:
::::: file_a.c: &quot;static void callback(void) { ... }&quot;, file_b.c: &quot;static int callback(int what) { ... }&quot;, and file_c.c: &quot;static void callback(char *data) { ... }&quot;. Each use a function by the same name that will be have different addresses, but also each is within a different file scope.
::::: BTW the type-generic macros are the only example I gave that are specific to C99. The rest is valid C89 AFAIK. I haven't looked at C99 lately, but there is also a chance that the not explicitly declaring a function's parameters approach is valid with C89 and is not any longer with C99. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:16, 12 December 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;C++ does not require use of macros...&quot; ==

&quot;C++ does not require use of macros and careful information-hiding and abstraction for code portability.&quot;

While I'm not exactly sure what this sentence is supposed to say, I think that in its current state it's not entirely correct. All the standard library functions of both languages work on every platform they've been ported to (I guess that's what makes them &quot;standard&quot;) and macros are not required to use these capabilities in either language. Both languages are designed to be cross-platform. It is true that because C struct members can't be private, macros are one (the only?) way to implement information hiding in C, but this isn't required. One of the tenets of C++ is &quot;careful information hiding&quot;, so perhaps it shouldn't be portrayed as a bad thing here. Also, isn't abstraction the only way to achieve portability? As an OOP language, C++ is more abstracted than C, and they both use layers of abstraction which build on the OS's abstraction of the hardware itself. So...is there some meaning to this sentence that I'm missing?  [[User:Jfmantis|Jfmantis]] ([[User talk:Jfmantis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jfmantis|contribs]]) 03:57, 2 December 2011 (UTC)

:It states that in comparison to C, C++ does not require the use of macros (for/and) information-hiding and abstraction for code portability.
:It probably could have been better worded.
:It does not refer to the standard language as you imply but in the normal and common use of the language. Macros are avoided in C++ on the other hand macros are extremely common in C, and specifically required to provide the C language the capability necessary both for information-hiding and abstraction, the last one a needed to make C code portable.
:On the last part you get off the topic, the macro specific domain. C++ does not depend on macros for any abstraction, C++'s creator at some point in time, IIRC, even stated that if he could he would have removed the feature, but due to C heavy reliance of macros they had to stay in (something on these lines).
:I notice that looking into the edit history that it was a contribution from me and had a misspell (I do sporadic edits, most times I get back to them and reread to see if they are ok other I completely forget about them, but you have found one edit that for the life of me I can't see or remember what was my intention ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/Standard_C_Library/Functions/free&amp;curid=185842&amp;diff=2224980&amp;oldid=1410164 here]), this one left me really puzzled, I have no explanation to it, the best thing I can come up with is some crossedit, I could have intended to edit another similar page.

::The odd parallel construction confused me: I read it as &quot;C++ does not require use of macros&quot;, &quot;C++ does not require use of careful information-hiding&quot;, and &quot;C++ does not require use of abstraction&quot;. The way you've rewritten it makes much more sense. But I still have to disagree with the statement &quot;C++ does not require use of macros&quot;. Choosing a file at random from the libstdc++ source, I see that the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/latest-doxygen/a00969_source.html bitset] header file is rife with macros. It might be safer to say that C++ doesn't rely on macros for OOP, which is certainly true.

:::Implementation of the standards are &quot;vendor&quot; specific, if you look on your example you could come up with alternatives that do not use macros. In any case just because some prefer to use them does not make them an absolute necessity, like in C. Most C++ code that uses macros has a high probability of having been written by an programmer that is at home in C, especially today, the use of macros in C++ is generally accepted as a bad practice and are actively avoided (but in C++ you can use whatever you like and does the job, it all falls to fallowing conventions).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:53, 2 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to view XML documents using your web browser using HTML markup.

== Method ==
We will use an XQuery function that uses the dispatch pattern and the typeswitch function.

== Sample Input ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;aaa a1=&quot;A1&quot; a2=&quot;A2&quot; a3=&quot;A3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;bbb b1=&quot;B1&quot; b2=&quot;B2&quot; b3=&quot;B3&quot;&gt;BBB&lt;/bbb&gt;
    &lt;ccc c1=&quot;C1&quot; c2=&quot;C2&quot; c3=&quot;C3&quot;&gt;
       &lt;ddd d1=&quot;D1&quot; d2=&quot;D2&quot; d3=&quot;D3&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;/ddd&gt;
       &lt;eee&gt;
           &lt;fff&gt;FFF&lt;/fff&gt;
       &lt;/eee&gt;
    &lt;/ccc&gt;
&lt;/aaa&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XML to HMTL Function ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: sequence dispatcher :)
declare function xml-to-html:dispatch($input as node()*, $depth as xs:integer) as item()* {
let $left-margin := concat('margin-left: ', ($depth * 5), 'px' )
for $node in $input
   return 
      typeswitch($node)
        case text() return normalize-space(&lt;span class=&quot;d&quot;&gt;{$node}&lt;/span&gt;)
        case element()
           return
              &lt;div class=&quot;element&quot; style=&quot;{$left-margin}&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;t&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;{name($node)}&lt;/span&gt;
                    { (: for each attribute create two spans for the name and value :)
                     for $att in $node/@*
                        return
                           (
                              &lt;span class=&quot;an&quot;&gt; {name($att)}=&lt;/span&gt;,
                              &lt;span class=&quot;av&quot;&gt;&quot;{string($att)}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                           )
                    }
                    {normalize-space(&lt;span class=&quot;t&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;)}
                    { (: now get the sub elements :)
                       for $c in $node
                          return xml-to-html:dispatch($c/node(), $depth + 1)
                    }
                    &lt;span class=&quot;t&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/{name($node)}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;/div&gt; 
        (: otherwise pass it through.  Used for comments, and PIs :)
        default return $node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Driver ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

import module namespace xml-to-html=&quot;http://example.com/xml-to-html&quot; at &quot;xml-to-html.xqm&quot;;

let $title := 'View XML as HTML'

let $input :=
&lt;aaa a1=&quot;A1&quot; a2=&quot;A2&quot; a3=&quot;A3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;bbb b1=&quot;B1&quot; b2=&quot;B2&quot; b3=&quot;B3&quot;&gt;BBB&lt;/bbb&gt;
    &lt;ccc c1=&quot;C1&quot; c2=&quot;C2&quot; c3=&quot;C3&quot;&gt;
       &lt;ddd d1=&quot;D1&quot; d2=&quot;D2&quot; d3=&quot;D3&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;/ddd&gt;
       &lt;eee&gt;
           &lt;fff&gt;FFF&lt;/fff&gt;
       &lt;/eee&gt;
    &lt;/ccc&gt;
&lt;/aaa&gt;

let $output := xml-to-html:xml-to-html($input, 1)

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;{$title}&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;syntax-colors-oxygen.css&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
        {$output}
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Output ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;element&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 5px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;an&quot;&gt;a2=&lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
=== Definition ===

A virtual exhibit is a display of artwork on the internet. Virtual exhibits are a great way for art teachers to show their students' work in elementary school, middle school, and high school. There are many ways for teachers to set up a virtual art exhibit. Virtual art exhibits are a product of the integration of technology into schools. For the core subjects (math, science, social studies, and language arts), teachers can easily incorporate technology into their lessons. For art teachers, this can become a challenge because art class is filled with hands-on experiences that technology cannot replace. A virtual exhibit is a refreshing way for art teachers to display their students' work. 

=== Ways to Create a Virtual Art Exhibit ===

* Create a sub page off of the school's website 
* Make a class website 
* Create a class blog
* Submit work on a media sharing website such as [http://www.youtube.com Youtube] or [http://www.photobucket.com Photobucket]
* Join an online program designed to display student artwork such as [http://www.artsonia.com Artsonia]

=== How Student Work is Added to a Virtual Art Exhibit ===

The instructor takes pictures of student artwork. If the teacher is using a digital camera, the teacher then transfers the photos onto a computer. If the teacher isn’t using a digital camera, the teacher then develops the film and scans the images using a scanner. Then, the teacher can adjust the size, resolution, and color of the images. The teacher can also crop out empty space in the picture so the focus is on the piece of art. Finally, the images are uploaded to the internet.

== History of Student Art Exhibits ==
Before technology was integrated into the classroom, art exhibits were set up by hand. Art exhibits take a lot of hard work and a lot of collaboration. In the past, these were the steps needed to put on a successful art exhibit: 
# Create a theme for the exhibit
# Create a name for the exhibit
# Create artwork to display in the exhibit
# Secure a gallery space 
# Secure a time to have the exhibit
# Promote the art show via advertisements
# Judge the art show and choose a winner
# Organize artwork into appropriate media
# Hang-up and display artwork
# Create and display name plaques
# Put on art show
# Take down the art show
As you can see, putting together an art exhibit is not an easy task. It takes a lot of time,money, and management which a lot of teachers may not always have.

== Advantages ==

=== Increases Students' Confidence ===

Effort is a main component of art class. Students feel a heightened sense of accomplishment when they see their finished work on display. Virtual art exhibits encourage students to take pride in their work. Also, the virtual exhibit can act as a journal for the students, marking their progress throughout the year. They can reflect on their performance and identify strong areas as well as areas that need improvement. 

=== Fosters Parental Involvement ===

Not all parents have time to physically come to school and appreciate their child's artwork. In todays society, many homes have a computer with internet access which makes it possible to interact with the students. Parents as well as other family members that do not live near the student can access the virtual art exhibit.

=== Supports School Art Programs ===

Some virtual exhibit programs offer fund raisers. Artsonia, a virtual student art gallery, sells keepsakes of student work and &quot;15% of the revenue is commissioned back to the school art program. Depending on the amount of promotion the teacher invests and the demographic of family members, this support could range from hundreds to thousands of dollars for additional equipment / art supplies for the classroom.&quot; Also, art teachers can use the virtual exhibit when introducing a new assignment to the class. The students can see past examples of the assignment and find inspiration for how they will complete the project.

=== Creates everlasting artwork ===
Not every piece of art that students make within the classroom is going to be permanent. Some projects may include natural materials found outside or materials like snow for instance which is not able to be kept for long periods of time. With the online art exhibit, students are able to take pictures of their nature based artwork and cherish it forever even when it is not still around. 

=== Creates Space Within The Art Room ===
Unlike regular education classrooms, homework is not able to be packed away in folders it needs to be stored to dry in the classroom. With utilizing an online art exhibit, students are able to take pictures of their projects and then recycle the materials to make space in the classroom for future projects. With recycling of materials, students and teachers can save materials and money. 

=== Integrate Technology into the Classroom ===
With the growing interest in technology, teachers are likely to get passed up by their own students which may lead to boredom and lack of interest within the classroom. Online art exhibits are a way to get the students involved with the exhibit process and promote responsibility.

== Disadvantages ==
=== Compromises the Experience of Art Appreciation ===
For certain projects, a photo will not be able to portray the quality of the artwork. For example, a three-dimensional sculpture must be experienced in person in order get the full effect. The viewer can move around and feel the texture of the piece. But, a viewer of a virtual exhibit will not be able to move around a computer screen image or feel the texture.

=== Presents a Privacy Concern ===
Parents may not approve of having their child's work put on the internet. Jeffrey Branzburg, author of &quot;Posting Student Work on the Web&quot;, mentions that while online exhibits serve a positive purpose, teachers need to ask for parental permission before putting any student work online. Branzburg also reminds teachers that students' last names and addresses should never be posted on the internet as doing so could risk the students' safety.

=== Lack of Internet Access ===
Students and parents may not necessarily have access to a computer or the internet. Although it is possible to go to a local library or use a friends computer, some parents/family members may not be willing to go through the hassle.

== The Future of Virtual Art Exhibits ==

Children are gaining technological experience at very young ages. As virtual art exhibits gain popularity in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools, the students will be able to create and manage the exhibits on their own rather than the instructor doing it. Also, as advancements in technology continue to be made, image quality will increase. This will overall improve the experience for visitors of virtual art exhibits. Usually, the art department is the first to be affected by school budget cuts. Virtual exhibits can be created with little to no costs and, with fund raising opportunities, can actual make money to support art programs.

== Conclusion ==
Art exhibits have been being put together for many years and will continue for many years to come. As long as art is around to be exhibited, art shows will continue to thrive. Whether it be professional artists or student artists, art work will always need to be shown;because after all what is art without people to enjoy it? With the compliment of technology in the classroom student art exhibits are easier than ever.

==Trigonometry Book==

===for Enthusiasts Sections===

My idea for the 'for Enthusiasts' sections is that they are to interest and engage the student who is racing ahead.  

* I am a bit concerned that your three new additions for enthusiasts in book 1, even when complete, might be more of a turn-off than a turn-on for the interested student.  Something like the compass bearings page could be spiced up with a discussion of true north and magnetic north - and I'd then be happier that it was of interest to them.  Are you OK with it moving in that direction?
* Are angles of elevation part of mainstream trig syllabus in some syllabi?  If so they should be in the main section.  Do we need a section in the main book on real-world applications of trigonometry?

I want to get across that for enthusiasts sections aren't a dumping ground for off-syllabus topics.  They are to help bright students who would otherwise be getting bored.  These students may also be neglecting to practice their trig skills, so the idea is that the trig in it will get them thinking and practising again.  I'm open to a different vision of what the enthusiasts section is for, but I would like us to try and articulate it better so that we agree.  -- [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 17:13, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Smartboards in special ed classroom==
Technology is needed in every classroom regardless what type of classroom it is. From gym to special education all of these types of classes use some sort of technology to advance their students knowledge and speed up the learning process.  I believe that technology is used more in a special education classroom than in any other classroom or class setting because of all the different types of students and their needs that need to be met to make their education the best it can possibly be. I will focus on the use of SMARTboards in the typical special ed. classroom; first I will inform you on what a SMARTboard are exactly, then how it is useful in special ed. classrooms, and lastly how the students react to the SMARTboard. Technology is a necessity in today’s classrooms without it our students would not be as advanced and would be stuck in the times if not exposed to the new innovative technology that has been presented to them.

=== Advantages ===
First of all the SMARTboard is an interactive white board that was invented by SMART Technologies in 1991. SMARTboard users must also have a projector to project the image of the computer screen onto the SMARTboard. Usually the SMARTboard is mounted to the wall or is put on a wheeling cart. This way the SMARTboard is out of the way or it is movable and can be transferred from room to room making it more useful for a school that can not afford one in every room. The SMARTboard does not use keyboards or a mouse, but it uses the touch of your hand or one of the tools that come along with the SMARTboard. The tools that come with the Smart board consist of 3 pens where you can switch the colors or even change one into a highlighter to highlight important information on the board and an eraser so a teacher or student can erase the writing with out a mess. The SMARTboard pens creat a digital line when being used on the SMARTboard as if one was using the program paint and made a line with the free draw tool. The SMARTboard also helps with handwriting. When a students or teacher writes a letter on the board it transforms it into the actual letter in the default font. If a student writes anything similar enough to a letter the SMARTboard will try its best to make it a letter. This means that the SMARTboard can depict some of the toughest hand writing. The SMARTboard can do more than this but these are some of the general things that most teachers use in their classrooms.

The SMARTboard is great in any kind of special education classroom. Whether the classroom is inclusive with a few students with disabilities or if it is strictly just a special education classroom the SMARTboard can be put to great use to get the student up and involved in the classroom. First off the SMARTboard is new technology and all students love new things that can do things that we not done before. Students will be more likely to volunteer and come up to the board just to try writing and erasing on the new piece of equipment. The SMARTBoard also allows teachers to address different learning styles. These learning styles consist of visual, auditory and kinesthetic. The SMARTboard technology engages all types of students and facilitates differentiated instruction, which in special education is needed because each disability is different and each student has different needs that need to be met. As an educator its is out responsibility to maximize the students fullest potential and by differentiated instruction and individualized instruction through the SMARTboard this will be able to occur. SMARTboards help with many types of disabilities with social skills and being part of a team. Team projects and collaboration can occur when students would have to put together a project. Students will learn how to become leaders and also to listen better to their fellow peers to create and finish the project. The project could have a deadline so it would be as if it was a real word business project. The mouse and keyboard of a computer may be very hard for a student to use and maneuver. The SMARTboard allows students to draw or write just like they do on paper to represent their ideas on the computer. Typing will be something that may come easier for them now if they can just write their letters on the SMARTboard and have them transformed into the font they choose. To me the SMARTboard evens the playing field for all students with or without a disability. Lastly teachers love SMARTboards to create presentations and lessons on PowerPoint or on the computer that are exciting and interactive. These lessons keep the students engaged and keep them from getting sidetracked and off task. An example would be if a PowerPoint was made with interactive buttons for a multiple choice quiz. Students could volunteer and come to the board to select a button on the touch screen and test their knowledge on the recent lesson. SMARTboards provide many tools for students of all skills and needs and soon every classroom will have one.

=== Conclusion ===
Students love to use SMARTboards because it gets them up out of their seat and moving keeping them engaged in the activity. The students do not realize they are learning while having fun. Keeping lessons fun for students will help them learn better and also give them something to be excited about. Huge strides have been made by students with special needs because of technology and SMARTboards have a huge affect on that. They used SMARTboards in one of the special education classrooms in my high school and the students all felt like they got a great gift from the school because they could watch youtube clips on their free time on there and also do things they could not do before. SMARTboards were made for the educational purposes but if the students have some free time they found ways to use the SMARTboard for entertainment as well, which is still improving social skills because they are talking to other students about what is fun and how to work the new equipment. Hopefully every classroom, not just special education classrooms, will have a SMARTboard so they too can watch their students learn and grow at a faster rate.

== Proloquo2Go ==
Proloquo2Go is an ap, just like any other ap, on iPads, iPods (iTouch) and iPhones.  The only difference is that this ap allows children, adults, anyone to communicate with others when they may otherwise be unable to.  Users need to press pictures or type out a message to communicate a thought.  It it has a default of over 7000 items!  It is often used as a great solution for children and adults with cerebral palsey, autism, apraxia, down syndrome or developmental disabilities.  It also can be used for adults who have acquired disabilities, like those who have suffered from a stroke or traumatic brain injury.  

=== Advantages ===
One advantage of Proloque2Go is the inexpensive price.  You can find iPads for $499, iTouch for $229 and iPhones for $99 (with contract).  The ap itself costs $189.  Compared to other Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ACC) devices, which are in the thousands, these devices are incredibly inexpensive.  It is compatible if not better then these thousand dollar devices, and must more portable.  Because of its low costs, therapists and special educators are jumping at the idea of buying these devices.  
Another advantage is its portability and design.  By using these Apple devices as a medium, they are extremely portable.  All of them can fit in a pocket and have many accessories to personalize it.  These devices are also a common thing to be carried around.  Teenagers may like that it is not a noticeable thing to be carrying; many people carry apple devices around.  They are not the big plastic squares like other ACC devices.  
Easy to use is a really big advantage for Proloque2Go.  There is an easy to follow tutorial that gives you the main rundown of the ap (http://www.proloquo2go.com/resources/article/introductory-videos) .  You can either type out what you want to say and it will speak it or put it in pictures or you can pick out PECS and have the device read them as words or as a full sentence.  It also has a memory on there, so previous statements you have made on Proloque2Go are saved on there.  You can take these previous stated items and save them to your device for future use.  

=== Disadvantages ===
One disadvantage is that users with motor control difficulties may have problems using the device.  On the iPod and iPhone the 3.5 inch touch screen makes is not an appropriate size for those with motor impairments.  The program does not allow changes to screen sensitivity, which is something very common on other ACC devices to adjust to tremors or accidental activations.  

=== Reviews ===
“I love this app for a lot of reasons. Let’s start with what I consider the best reason to use this iPhone and iPad app. What could be cooler than using an ipad instead of a bulky communication device? As a therapist, one of my primary goals is considered to be establishing the least restrictive environment. Adaptive equipment traditionally is big and cumbersome and screams DISABILITY. It commands unwanted attention and can bring embarrassment to the user. Obviously I like Proloquo2Go because it can be used on the iPhone or iPad. To quote the Proloquo2Go rep “It is one thing to have a solution that assists you in completing a task or taking part in an activity; it is something else if that solution presents itself just like any mainstream consumer product and treats its user like any regular member of society.” -Milestone Mom
“I just download this yesterday. It took me 15 mins. to get it up and running. Programming and making changes in 20 min. I had purchase a DYNAVOX for my son a few years ago. It was hard to make changes, not parent friendly, very hard to program on the spot. My son became very discourage. So I was told about your product my a wonderful man, name Brian Friedlander. He has been my mentor on assistive technology for a long time. Well, He hit this one on the nose. My son thinks it is GREAT! Today in 10 min I added a few more thinks that we needed. AS a MOM how can I every thank you so very much for this wonderful product. You do not have to spend $thousands like Dynavox and it is up and running. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!

=== Conclusion ===
This easy to use, inexpensive program is becoming more and more popular through parents, therapists and special educators.  Its portability and design are perfect for not sticking out of the crowd.  By having the ability to use both text and pictures, it brings a new learning experience for children to connect the two while communicating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe we should cover different topics other than just the three case studies. Which might make it difficult to all 3 studies AND other view points. For example, we should discuss the police social group. We can show how the videos have interfered with arrests and other unfavorable facets.

Should we reorganize this a bit then? Or just shorten the cases and include the police side after?[[User:Natewilson|Natewilson]] ([[User talk:Natewilson|talk]]) 00:53, 1 December 2010 (UTC)


I made a police rights/protection section. We should try and find cases for this section if we can.[[User:Natewilson|Natewilson]] ([[User talk:Natewilson|talk]]) 03:53, 1 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Setting Windows XP password can help us prevent others logging into our PC without permission. However, every coin has two sides. on the one hand, it helps us very much in our privacy protection. On the other hand, For the sake of carelessness or accidence, we are perplexed with the problem of losing password. Thanks to the development of technology, many tricks are available to recover a Windows XP password. In some cases, recovering from a lost password can be very easy though.

In order to show completeness, we start with the simplest tips that can help you regain access to a locked account.

'''Method 1: Log into an alternate account'''

If you have another user account or you share your computer with others, things will be much simpler. Log into the Windows with the other account and perform the following steps:
# Click &quot;Start&quot; button
# Click &quot;Run&quot;
# In the &quot;Open&quot; field, type &quot;control userpasswords2&quot;
# Click &quot;OK&quot;

Often many users will leave the '''administrator account''' alone and/or have other accounts with '''administrator rights'''. If you're not logging into the computer as administrator or have other accounts follow the below steps to reset your other account's password.
*Reboot the computer into Safe Mode.
*When logging into Safe Mode you should be prompted with an option to what account you wish to use. Select the Administrator account. If prompted for a password try simply pressing Enter on the keyboard for no password. If this does not work, try other passwords you may have used. If you're unable to log into the Administrator account skip to the next suggestion
*Once you've logged into the Administrator account open Control Panel and User Accounts.
*In User Accounts select the account you wish to change the password for, click change password and then enter the new password or click remove the password to remove the password from the account.

Windows opens a user accounts dialog. Select the user with the lost password and click the “Reset Password” button. Enter a new password, and click ok. Click ok once again and you are ready. Now you can log on to your account using the new password.

'''Method 2: Using the forgotten password diskette'''

If there are no other users on your machine to unlock your account, you need to boot your PC from outside your usual Windows XP environment using a boot disk or a bootable CD. But if you are not proficient with technology, it will be hard for you. How to solve this headache problem easier?

If you have forgotten your '''Windows XP password''', but have [http://www.windows7password.net/create-windows-xp-password-reset-disk/ created a ''forgotten password diskette''] earlier to use the diskette, follow the below steps.
*At the '''Windows XP''' login prompt when the password is entered incorrectly click the reset button in the login failed window.
*Insert the '''password reset diskette''' into the computer and click Next.
*If the correct diskette '''Windows XP''' will open a window prompting for the new password you wish to use.

'''Method 3: Use a third party Windows XP password recovery tool'''

Of course, you will need access to another PC to create a boot disk or bootable CD. Nowadays, many tools support bootable USB. Easily burn the BIOS image file to the CD/DVD/USB Flash Drive, reboot the PC with the CD/DVD/USB Flash Drive, then you regain access to your PC. Here let’s take Windows Password Recovery Enhance for example. Only four steps, we can log into the PC again.

Step 1. Download Windows password recovery tool and install the program on the other unlocked computer.

Step 2: Burn bootable CD/DVD or USB flash drive

Step 3: BIOS setting

Step 4: Recover Windows XP password

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a list of the grammar points likely encountered on level N4 of the [[w:Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Japanese Language Proficiency Test]].  There is no official list, so it is possible that other grammar points may be seen.  [[JLPT Guide/JLPT N5 Grammar|JLPT N5 grammar]] is likely to be seen on the N4 test but are not listed again here -- see the N5 page.

===～し===
When you want to list reasons for multiple states or actions you can do so by adding 「し」 to the end of each relative clause. It is very similar to the 「や」 particle except that it lists reasons for verbs and state-of-being. 

Ｂ：優しいし、かっこいいし、面白いから。
B: Because he's kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things).

===そうです===
===てみる===
It means to try do something.
*Example: 彼は彼女と話してみる。&lt;i&gt;He'll try to talk to her.&lt;/i&gt;
*Example: 私はあの本を読んでみる。&lt;i&gt;I'll try to read that book.&lt;/i&gt;

===なら===

Use of なら implies that the verb before なら (nara) succeeds the verb after なら (nara) in time. This is the opposite of the conditional particle たら, which implies that the first verb will precede the second verb.

例：

友達が来るなら、私はピザを注文する。

ともだちがくるなら、わたしはピザをちゅうもんする。

Tomodachi ga kuru nara, watashi wa piza o chūmon suru.

If our friends come, I will order pizza [first].

It means to want something (literally that something is wanted).
*Example: 私はこの本がほしい。&lt;i&gt;I want this book.&lt;/i&gt;
*Example: 彼女はお菓子が欲しい。&lt;i&gt;She wants some sweets.&lt;/i&gt;

===～たがる===
The 「～がる」 grammar is used when you want to make an observation about how someone is feeling. This grammar is also used to observe very frankly on what you think someone other than yourself wants. This involves the adjective 「欲しい」 for things one wants or the 「～たい」 conjugation for actions one wants to do, which is essentially a verb conjugated to an i-adjective.

家に帰ったら、すぐパソコンを使いたがる。
(He) soon acts like wanting to use computer as soon as (he) gets home. 
http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/signs

===～かもしれない===

Use of かもしれない or かもしれません indicates possibility (maybe). It is used in a similar way to ~でしょう

例：

明日は雨が降るかもしれない。

あしたはあめがふるかもしれない。

トムさんは子供のとき意地悪だったかもしれない。

トムさんはこどものときいじわるだったかもしれません。

Tom may have been a bully when he was a kid.

===～たらどうですか===

This construction is used for giving advice or suggesting a particular course of action (Advice…how about…? Why don’t you…?)

It it made from the past tense short form of the verb. It should only be used when explicitly being consulted about something, as it can be slightly critical. if someone is seeking your advice on a matter, you can use ～たらどうですか.

薬を飲んだらどうですか？

くすりをのんだらどうですか？

How about taking some medicine? (Said to someone who is ill)


もっと勉強したらどうですか？

もっとべんきょうしたらどうですか？

Why don’t you (how about you) study more? (Said to someone who has an exam coming up and is worried about it)

===Number+も===

昨日、電話三回もしたよ！

*Example: このケーキを食べよう。&lt;i&gt;Let's eat this cake.&lt;/i&gt;
*Example: あの映画を見よう。&lt;i&gt;Let's watch that movie.&lt;/i&gt;

===～おう===
It means &quot;let's do (something)&quot;. The 「お」 may become any syllable ending with an &quot;o&quot; (e.g. こ、ろ、そ). This form is only used for godan verbs, for ichidan verbs see

 Example: 私は山田さんに本を買ってあげました。　I bought this book for Yamada-san.

===～てくれる===
くれる means &quot;to receive&quot; but can be only referred to the person that is talking. 
 A は 私に verb-て　くれる。    A does something for me.
It must not be confused with もらう that can be used talking about everybody. For example these sentences have the same meaning.
 Example: 山田さんは私に本を買ってくれました。 Yamada-san bought this book for me.

Note the difference use of the particles は and に.

===～ていただけませんか===
===～といいです===
===～てすみません===

Use the te-form to describe things you have done that you want to apologize for.

汚い言葉を使ってすみませんでした。

きたないことばをつかってすみませんでした。

I’m sorry for using bad language (previously).

When you want to apologize for something you failed to do, you use ～なくて, the short, negative te-form of a verb.

もっと早く言わなくて、ごめん。

もっとはやくいわなくて、ごめん。

Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

===～そうです===

This phrase means, literally, &quot;it is so.&quot; It is used to show agreement, and is a general filler. When そう is used as a suffix, however, such as after a verb (''note: you can only place it after the stem of a verb'',) noun, or adjective, it means that something is seeming to be a certain way.

* Example: 彼はケーキをたべそうです。 ''It seems he eats cake.''

*Example: あそこへ行けば分かる。&lt;i&gt;If you go there you'll know.&lt;/i&gt;

===～ても===
By simply using the te-form and the 「も」 particle, you are essentially saying, &quot;even if you do X...&quot;

全部食べてもいいよ。
You can go ahead and eat it all. (lit: Even if you eat it all, it's good, you know.)

===～てしまう===
It means to end up doing something.
*Example: 私はけっきょく学校へ行ってしまう。&lt;i&gt;After all I'll end up going to school.&lt;/i&gt;
*Example: 彼はたぶんあのケーキを食べてしまう。&lt;i&gt;He'll probably end up eating that cake.&lt;/i&gt;

===Dictionary form+と===
===～ながら===
This form shows that two actions are happening at once, such as &quot;the boy eats coffee cake while he drinks coffee.&quot;  This form is used with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_verb_conjugation#i_form verb stem of a verb], and simply appended to the end. The emphasis is stronger on the second verb in the series. The second verb in the series is also the verb which determines the tense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Protein Evolution ==

Protein evolution is a key indicator of the progression of proteins through time.  These studies have lead scientists to determine the relationships of proteins between species which share similar functions. Similarly proteins which are homologous adapt to perform different functions.  Evolution has forced proteins to become more complex and thus lead scientists to question the origins of simpler proteins which preceded modern proteins.

Protein evolution is not an independent process but part of an entire organism.  Changes to the proteins are often only occurring on the sequence level leaving the structures and functions rather conserved.  This can be used to explain the presence of homology between proteins which share similar structures but have adapted to perform different functions.

== Study of Protein Evolution ==

The two main approaches to the study of protein evolution are the analysis and comparison of sequences of proteins to prove or disprove evolutionary relationships and the other is the simulation of the evolutionary processes computationally in in vitro studies.

== Stages of Protein Evolution ==

One scenario that was suggested are that the earliest proteins were very small polypeptides with about 10 amino acids and specified by small primitive genes made of RNA. The presence of RNA as the genetic material predated the presence of DNA as the genetic material.  The genes coding the proteins probably join together in random sequences while a primitive splicing mechanism pieces together the proteins.  Each of the proteins formed would consist of a domain with the characteristic length of amino acids being 100.  Further concatenation would lead to multi-domain proteins and thus more complex proteins.

Another scenario which proteins might have evolved starts with small peptides consisting of less than 10 amino acids.  These short peptides is said to then form closed loops which consist of 25-30aa and into folds 100-150aa which would lead to multifold proteins.  Functionally, the short peptides of less than 10 amino acids do perform any functions, however, the closed loop proteins are functional.

== Protein Domains ==

Domains are typically 100-150 a.a. in length.  This characteristic lengths are usually present in all proteins.  The fold sizes are believed to have appeared during the early stages of the development of DNA genes.  DNA being the successor of genetic material from RNA in many organisms was primitive and believed to have existed in circular forms.  The optimal size of DNA ring closure is believed to be about 400 base pairs which is determined by DNA's flexibility.  The 400 base pairs can be lead to code to approximately 100-150 amino acids seen in a domain.  The upper limit of the circularization of DNA thus has a direct impact on the upper limit of a domain of a protein, the two being interconnected.  Most proteins can be said to have evolved from these ancient closed loop units.  

===PDZ Domain===
The PDZ domain is a common domain located in signaling proteins in structures of bacteria, plants, and animals. They are widespread in eukaryotes and eubacteria. Being approximately 90 residues long, they contain critical regions of sequence homology in diverse signaling proteins. Generally, PDZ domains attaches to a small region of the C-terminus of the next consecutive protein. Particularly, these small regions bind to the PDZ domain via beta sheet augmentation. Implicitly, this signifies that the PDZ domain is expanded through the addition of a beta strand from one terminal of the binding partner.
PDZ domains are usually located in the combination with other interaction modules and play a role that is directly specified with receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling. It is also involved with other cellular functions such as protein trafficking, synaptic signal coordination, and cell polarity initiation.
===SH3 Domain===
The SRC Homology 3 (SH3) Domain is a relatively small protein that consists of 60 amino acids.  The SH3 domain has the tendency to regulate the state activities of adaptor proteins and tyrosine kinases. They also function as a stimulant for substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases that bind at a large distance from the active site. 
The SH3 domain is structured in a beta-barrel fold, which is made up of 5-6 beta strands organized in tightly packed anti-parallel beta sheets. The structure of the SH3 domain is a classical fold that is common in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
===WD40 Domain (WD- Repeat)===
WD40 domain is one of the most abundant domains and is one of the most active domains of the eukaryotes. Their functions are deeply involved in cellular processes by playing a crucial role as hubs in cellular networks. WD40 Domain regulates diverse protein-protein interactions, especially those that scaffold. They are present in processes such as signal transduction, cell division, chemotaxis, RNA processing, and cytoskeleton construction.
WD40 domains were first discovered in bovine beta-transducin, a subunit of the trimeric G protein transducin complex. It contains a series of sequence of approximately 44-60 residues with folds into seven-bladed beta-propellers. Each blade is designed in a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet.
WD40 is naturally exploited as seemingly more suitable than other domain candidates because it structurally more compelling. This means that WD40 domains form structures that are highly symmetrical in comparison to other domains that are involved in intracellular processes. The symmetry is of high importance when proteins that lack sequence need to adopt. Additionally, symmetrical folds provide rapid and convenient folding especially for folds that are comprised of discrete and local, non-interlocking units of secondary structures.
Unfortunately, WD40 domains have proven to give difficult management. This is mainly because they are usually subunits of a larger assembly. Moreover, they lack the ability to measure intrinsic activity like catalysis. Regardless, WD40 domains act as scaffolds and clearly characterize one of the most significant domain families for cellular processing.

      <comment>/* Measuring Angles */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}

In this lesson you will learn about angles of rotation, which are found in many different real phenomena. Consider, for example, a game that is played with a spinner. When you spin the spinner, how far has it gone?

You can answer this question in several ways. You could say something like &quot;the spinner spun around three times&quot;. This means that the spinner made three complete rotations, and then landed back where it started.

We can also measure the rotation in degrees. In the previous lesson we worked with angles in triangles, measured in degrees. You may recall from geometry that a full rotation is 360 degrees, usually written as 360°. Half a rotation is then 180° and a quarter rotation is 90°. Each of these measurements will be important in this lesson, as well as in the remainder of the chapter.

==Learning Objectives==
* Determine if an angle is acute, right, obtuse, or straight.
* Express the measure of angles in degrees, minutes, and seconds.
* Express the measure of angles in decimal degrees.
* Identify and draw angles of rotation in standard position.
* Identify quadrantal angles.
* Identify co-terminal angles.

==Acute, Right, Obtuse, and Straight Angles==
In general, angles are categorized by their size. The table below summarizes the categories, which might be familiar from the previous lesson.

You should make sure that you can visually determine which category an angle belongs to.

b.

c.
:[[File:Measuring Rotation Example 1c.svg|200px]]

----

'''Solution''':

a. This angle is an acute angle.

If it is difficult to categorize the angle visually, you can compare it to a right angle. Doing this will help you see that the angle is smaller than a right angle.

:[[File:Measuring Rotation Solution 1a.svg|200px]]


b. This angle is an obtuse angle.

Again, you can compare the angle to a right angle, if needed.


c. This angle is a right angle.

It is important to note that usually a right angle is marked with a small square.

It is also important to note that you can determine the measure of an angle using a protractor. This measure will of course be an approximation, as no protractor is perfect and the person measuring cannot perfectly line up the protractor or hold it steady.

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 2}}
Use a protractor to measure the angle in example 1a.

'''Solution''': 

The angle is about 50°.

When working with angles measured in degrees, we often report our answers using a decimal, such as 78.5°. However, in some contexts, angles are measured using fractional parts.

==Measuring Angles==
{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 3}}
Two wheels are in direct contact. The radius of one is .5 meters. The radius of the other is 1 meter. The smaller one rotates four full turns. How many rotations does the larger wheel make? How many degrees does the larger wheel rotate through?

----

'''Solution''':

Every time the small wheel rotates once, its entire circumference passes along the larger wheel, ''C'' = 2π(.5). Since the circumference of the large wheel is 2π(1), the large wheel rotates half way around. So if the small wheel rotates 4 times, or 360 · 4 = 1440° the large wheel rotates 2 times, or 360 · 2 = 720°.

We can measure angles in much the same way we measure time. A '''minute''' is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{60}&lt;/math&gt; of a degree. A '''second''' is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{60}&lt;/math&gt; of a minute, so it is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{360}&lt;/math&gt; of a degree. For example, 48°20′45″ is the way we write 48 degrees, 2 minutes, and 45 seconds. We can write this angle using fraction notation, as well as decimal notation:

:&lt;math&gt;48^\circ 20' 45'' = 48 + \frac{20}{60} + \frac{45}{360} = 48 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{8} = 48\frac{11}{24} = 48.458\overline{3} \approx 48.4583^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write a decimal degree using degrees, minutes, and seconds. For example, we can rewrite 125.88° if we write the decimal part as a fraction:

:&lt;math&gt;0.88 = \frac{88}{100} = \frac{x}{60}&lt;/math&gt;

Now solve for ''x'':

:{|
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{88}{100} =&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{60}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{44}{50} =&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{60}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;44 \times 60 =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;50x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;2640 =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;50x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;x =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;52.8\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now we have 125.88° = 125°52.8′. We need to write .8 minutes as seconds:

:{|
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.8}{60} =&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{360}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;0.8 \cdot 360 =&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;60x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;288 =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;60s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;s =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-bottom:10px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{288}{60}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;s =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;4.8\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Therefore 125.88° = 125°52′4.8″.

Notice that the angle 125.88° is an obtuse angle. Its measure is less than 180°. What does an angle look like that is more than 180°? More than 360°?

Next you will learn about a particular way to represent angles that will allow you to represent 180°, 360°, or any other angle.

==Angles of Rotation in Standard Position==
We can use our knowledge of graphing to represent any angle. The figure below shows an angle in what is called '''standard position'''.

:[[File:Standard position.svg|400px]]

The initial side of an angle in standard position is always on the positive ''x''−axis. The terminal side always meets the initial side at the origin. Notice that the rotation goes in a '''counterclockwise''' direction. This means that if we rotate '''clockwise''', we are generating a negative angle. Below are several examples of angles in standard position.

:{| style=&quot;width:600px;&quot;
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | [[File:45 degree standard position.svg|300px]] || [[File:90 degree standard position.svg|300px]]
|-
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px; padding-top:20px;&quot; | [[File:225 degree standard position.svg|300px]] || style=&quot;padding-top:20px;&quot; | [[File:-45 degree standard position.svg|300px]]
|}

The 90 degree angle is one of four '''quadrantal''' angles. A quadrantal angle is one whose terminal side lies on an axis. Along with 90°, 0°, 180° and 270° are quadrantal angles.

:{| style=&quot;width:600px;&quot;
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | [[File:0 degree angle.svg|300px]] || [[File:90 degree angle.svg|300px]]
|-
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px; padding-top:20px;&quot; | [[File:180 degree angle.svg|300px]] || style=&quot;padding-top:20px;&quot; | [[File:270 degree angle.svg|300px]]
|}

These angles are referred to as quadrantal because each angle defines a quadrant. Notice that without the arrow indicating the rotation, 270° looks as if it is a 90°, defining the fourth quadrant. Notice also that 360° would look just like 0°. The difference is in the action of rotation. This idea of two angles actually being the same angle is discussed next.

==Coterminal Angles==
Consider the angle 30°, in standard position.

:[[File:30 degree standard position.svg|400px]]

Now consider the angle 390°. We can think of this angle as a full rotation (360°), plus an additional 30 degrees.

:[[File:390 degree angle.svg|400px]]

Notice that 390° looks the same as 30°. Formally, we say that the angles share the same terminal side. Therefore we call the angles '''co-terminal'''. Not only are these two angles co-terminal, but there are infinitely many angles that are co-terminal with these two angles. For example, if we rotate another 360°, we get the angle 750°. Or, if we create the angle in the negative direction (clockwise), we get the angle −330. Because we can rotate in either direction, and we can rotate as many times as we want, we can keep generating angles that are co-terminal with 30°.

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 3}}
Which angles are co-terminal with 45°?

a. -45°

b. 405°

c. -315°

d. 135°

----

'''Solution''':

b. 405° and c. -315° are co-terminal with 45°.

:[[File:45, -315, and 405 co-terminal angles.svg|400px]]

Notice that terminal side of the first angle, −45°, is in the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant. The last angle, 135° is in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant. Therefore neither angle is co-terminal with 45°.

Now consider 405°. This is a full rotation, plus an additional 45 degrees. So this angle is co-terminal with 45°. The angle −315° can be generated by rotating clockwise. To determine where the terminal side is, it can be helpful to use quadrantal angles as markers. For example, if you rotate clockwise 90 degrees 3 times (for a total of 270 degrees), the terminal side of the angle is on the positive ''y''−axis. For a total clockwise rotation of 315 degrees, we have 315 − 270 = 45 degrees more to rotate. This puts the terminal side of the angle at the same position as 45°.

==Lesson Summary==
In this lesson we have categorized angles according to their size, and we have extended our knowledge of angles to include angles of rotation. We have defined what it means for an angle to be in standard position, and we have looked at angles in standard position, including the quadrantal angles. We have also defined the concept of co-terminal angles. All of the ideas in this lesson will be used in the following lesson, to define the trigonometric functions that are the focus of this chapter.

== Splitting a book ==

I've been considering giving each error message on [[GCC Notebook]] it's own page using the error message as the title, but some of them are extremely long and/or contain non alpha-numeric characters. I've looked the official naming policy page and the style guides, but didn't find anything specific related to page name length or special characters to avoid. Are there any set restrictions or recommendations in those two areas? [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 06:46, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

: &quot;/&quot; is used to separate a book's name from chapter and page names. &quot;:&quot; is used to separate works into different namespaces. Those two characters should be considered special characters to avoid reusing with a different meaning. I suggest no more than 3 to 5 words for chapter or page names, because longer titles can be harder for people to remember, to find, and to retype correctly. Some GCC documents I've read group related error messages, that could possibly be more useful for readers than giving each error its own page. You should also consider that error messages can change from version to version and that might be another reason to group errors than to give each error its own page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:15, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

:: Avoiding just those 2 characters shouldn't be a problem.  I'm not sure about 3 to 5 words per page name, that might be overly limiting, maybe 5 to 7 (this would be just for error message pages). I had planned on grouping error messages that had the same, or almost the same, root cause, but I don't want to over-group as I think I'd lose too much context.  I mainly wanted the book to be a verbose reference for resolving errors and code bugs reported by GCC's C/C++ compilers as I've yet to find a good one, but didn't want to title it &quot;g++ errors&quot; as that's probably too narrow a scope. I was thinking of changing the title to something like &quot;Debugging with GCC&quot; before splitting it up though. Differing error messages shouldn't be a problem, I planned on including sample source code that would produce the error message on the error pages ([[GCC_Notebook/Draft|something like this]]), so it wouldn't be too difficult to keep track of changes. Thanks for the advice. [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 04:35, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== Relative measure for Images? ==

Can anybody please tell me? ...Is there a facility to use relative measure for image sizing?

That is to say, instead of expressing an image size in only pixels.   This would allow users to better design layouts that can adapt to the screen size of the reader.   This is particularly desirable for images in a bounding table cell at the head of a page.

Any thoughts?   Regards to all, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 16:27, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

: I thought this use to be possible, but doesn't seem to work now. If you don't include the image size, I think the image's actual size will be used unless the image is bigger than the maximum size set by a user in their preferences. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:35, 26 November 2010 (UTC)
== PD-Translations on Wikibooks? ==

Hi, there is a discussion (see [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium#Where they are hosted]]), whether '''Wikisource-based''' translations (such as [[s:Category:Wikisource translations]]) do belong to Wikisource, or maybe to Wikibooks, or somewhere else. What do you think? --[[User:D.H|D.H]] ([[User talk:D.H|talk]]) 11:17, 28 November 2010 (UTC)

: I think Wikisource is the place when the translation intends to preserve the original meaning with no other changes. If the intentions is to also provide an updated work of educational value, I think the answer depends on what form the work is intended to take. If the work is intended to take on an encyclopedia quality it should be forked to Wikipedia after translation. If the work is intended to take on a form that is within Wikibooks' scope than it should be forked to Wikibooks after translation. If the work is intended to be some other kind of learning material it should be forked to Wikiversity after translation.

: Different language editions of Wikisource may have different inclusion requirements about translations too. Whether translations intended to preserve the original meaning belong at the target language Wikisource project or should be moved there after completion is best left up to Wikisource.  --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:41, 28 November 2010 (UTC)
== Bottom border of tables missing in Internet Explorer 8 ==

Hi,

I note that whereas Opera and Firefox depict the bottom borders of tables correctly, IE8 does not.

For examples see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Tables_Ready_to_Use '''Tables Ready to Use''']

Any ideas, folks?

Regards to all, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 22:27, 24 November 2010 (UTC)

: Is this a problem you've noticed in the last day or two, or is this been around awhile? I've been told of similar problems with the borders for the tabs in the vector skin. Do you know if this problem is unique to Wikibooks or have you noticed this problem at other wikimedia projects as well? The problems I've heard were only noticed at Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:10, 24 November 2010 (UTC)

::While I notice the tab border problem, I'm looking at the above-linked page and I don't see a difference for me between Firefox and IE8 with regards to the tables. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:07, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

Given this new information. What operating system and operating system number are you both using with IE8? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:29, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

I have been off the net for a while so I do not know whether or not it is recent. I use a new computer with Windows 7, fully updated.   Oops!; it seems to be working today on all three browsers.  [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 12:57, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

: Well the problem I was told about appears to be fixed now. Maybe the problem is similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Licensing Terms?==
The [http://www.ck12.org/flexr/ CK-12 web site] now provides their books under a non-commercial CC-BY-NC-SA license. I have read a [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2010/October#Five-year_WMF_targets|claim]] that they previously used the CC-BY-SA license and that our books are derived from the earlier materials, but do we have the supporting evidence for this claim? Perhaps we should be collecting together our copies of the older books and storing them somewhere safe. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:35, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

:The &quot;wayback machine&quot; has the [http://web.archive.org/web/20080702154346/ck12.org/about.html site] archived from July 2008.

On the [http://web.archive.org/web/20080731094703/www.ck12.org/about.html 31 July 2008 version] the license has changed to [http://web.archive.org/web/20080730222544/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Attribution -Share Alike 3.0 Unported]. It isn't proof, but it would be reasonable to assume that if our books were begun before 31 July 2008 then they used content under an acceptable license. The 31 July 2008 archive is the last one captured, so I can't see when the license changed to a non-commercial one. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:29, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

::Actually, it looks like Adrignola has already uploaded useable PDF files to Commons for the books we have here at the moment, so the only issue could be to ensure that no more new material is taken from the CK-12 web site. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:17, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

:::Indeed, as you can see the CC-BY-SA logo in those PDFs.  It was around the middle of 2010 that they changed the license.  They also went back through and regenerated all their PDFs with the NC logo in them.  It was a bit like pulling a rug out and made me very disappointed, but fortunately I had the foresight to download them all to work from.  Some of them I had to break into pieces because they were larger than the 100MB upload limit, but doing so allowed me to link to PDFs at Commons rather than at the CK-12 site.  I'm sure they regret the fact that they can't change licenses retroactively on already-released material, but that's our gain. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:27, 2 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

== contributors vs authors ==
The section under GFDL is in error, there are no mentions about contributors on the GFDL only authors (as in the level of contribution to a given work).

[http://en.wikibooks.org/ Wikibooks]® is a registered trademark of the [http://wikimediafoundation.org Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.] (registered as a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of Florida, USA, as such it MUST obied by Florida and USA Law), it consists in collection of [[:w:free content|free content]] books licensed under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:GNU_Free_Documentation_License|GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)]] ([[Wikibooks:Protected page|protected]] for legal reasons) with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|some limitations]], this is the license that protects all the works and authors on Wikibooks.

There are general Wikibooks policies that extend protection to contributors, but not all contributors are authors.

Copyright is the ownership of an intellectual property within the limits prescribed by a particular nation's or international law.

Author is defined under the laws of Florida, USA. and no local policy can redefine it. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:47, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

:The terms &quot;contributor&quot; and &quot;author&quot; are being used, interchangably here, to denote &quot;copyright holders&quot;. All users hold copyright ownership over their own contributions, regardless of the quality or quantity of their contributions, and a page may not be distrbuted without properly attributing all copyright holders under the terms of the GFDL. However, what you are talking about are legal rights of attribution and do not specifically apply to what this policy proposal is about. What this is about (and a point that likely needs more clarfication) is &quot;project ownership&quot; as opposed to &quot;content ownership&quot;. No wikibookian by virtue of contribution (and therefore being a copyright holder over their own contributed material) may excercise any amount of control over the project, nor claim to &quot;own&quot; the project. I will clarify this section. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:Also, a point worth making is that the history lists of the individual pages count as proper legal attribution under the terms of the GFDL. Any ancillary lists of authors therefore do not count as legal attribution under this license or under any laws. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Not so, the history only provides a log of changes not all contributors are authors and the said list of 5 authors is not an obligation, due to the nature of wikipages the log or history is needed and does provide the facility to check authorship or disputes of content , the log/history is not a requirement of the GFDL but a way to keep a Wikipage legal (due to its volatility) under that license.

::More, the history/logs may be changed or corrupted by any user with administrative rights, it is my belief that a history and reversal of that changes can be checked (but not by using the normal rights of a user), some administrators that are more careful that others. Example a administrator copies content of several pages to another and deletes the originals without doing a resynchronization of the logs, and so granting him the &quot;credits&quot; of the contribution/creation.

::The interchangeably  use of &quot;contributor&quot; and &quot;author&quot; in the context of GFDL or Wikibooks is wrong, the &quot;contributor&quot; does not have a legal protection (rights and obligations) under the law (and GFDL) and does have a small protection under Wikibooks/Wikimedia, any &quot;contributor&quot; get to   be a &quot;copyright holder&quot; if granted authorship (or part) of a work (see legal definition of author as defined on the GFDL and the laws of Florida, USA )--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:37, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

::: The history pages constitute a [[w:byline]], and therefore serve as legal attribution under the GFDL. That is the official stance of the WMF, and is not currently up for debate here. See also [[w:WP:OWN]]. I think you are also wrong about the distinction between &quot;contributor&quot; and &quot;author&quot;, as there is no distinction made between the two in the text of the [[GFDL]]. Any contributor who makes change to a page, or (according to the GFDL) modifies the document may list themselves as an author, along with authors of the previous unmodified document. The history pages serve this purpose. We do not make a qualitative or quantitative distinction here between &quot;contributor&quot; and &quot;author&quot;. The GFDL does not make such a distinction, our policy documents do not make such a distinction, and you are wrong to make such a distinction. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:20, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

::::Sorry if my prev. post is a bit confusing as I didn't had the time to recheck what I wrote...

::::Yes the log/history provides and is used on wikimedia as a bases for the legal attributions, but we here must deal with several pages not as one page article as in Wikipedia, the line or the attribution of authorship in this case is a bit harder to find, as I said again and again contributors are promoted to authors depending on the size of the contributions (this is defined on the GFDL) see translations or what constitutes derived work.

::::&quot;Any contributor who makes change to a page, or (according to the GFDL) modifies the document may list themselves as an author&quot; this is a wrong and a bad evaluation of the GFDL.

::::This affirmation could be valid on the bases of single page works (wikipedia vs wikibooks) but again not all changes qualifies one as author, minor corrections, spelling, reformat without adding content... to be an author one must provide a level of content to a work.

::::The [[GFDL]] doesn't create a contributor, wikimedia use of the GFDL needed to create some support for all edits, in a dead trees book you will have authorship of a work if you create a derived work under the GFDL, Wikimedia does try to simplify this, but not all edits create derived works (not on wikibooks) this can be troublesome, for instance I've been moving the books I was working on to another electronic support (tiddlywiki), but I haven't got a copy of the derived works I must point out on my new copy, since wikibooks only provides the last edit (one can't check the log/history) in a way that will enable the visualization of the hole work at a given point in time.

::::There is no definition in the law or GFDL to &quot;contributors&quot; or credits awarded/responsibilities/rights to them, there is a copyright law that defines authors, the GFDL addresses authors any other requests, formulations or policies are local to Wikibooks (and valid as long as they don't overstep/limit the GFDL and any legal definition without clearly state that it is being redefined).
::::Do you consider &quot;contributors&quot; is a synonym to &quot;authors&quot; ?!? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::US Copyright Law (201.c) grants anyone who contributes to a collective work, copyright to his or her own contributions and permission to reproduce and distribute the collective work and any derived works. US Copyright Law doe use the word &quot;contributor&quot;. US Copyright Law (201.d1) also allows transfer of ownership by any means of US Law. A license is such a formal legal contract that applies and that is what the GFDL is. The GFDL grants anyone permission to modify, reproduce and contribute material licensed with it. The GFDL grants permission to anyone who modifies it the right to add their name to the list of authors. The GFDL does not require a specific type of modification to be listed and since its a license thats legally binding under US Law, any modifications qualify for listing as an author. US Copyright Law (201.b) also allows work written for hire to be owned by the employeer. Under US Law a non-profit organization is form of business and such any work done for such a business could in effect be owned by that business, meaning the Wikimedia Foundation owns the copyright to any modifications made. Wikipedia for instance suggests giving credit to Wikipedia when reproducing such work. The Wikimedia Foundation could in effect be the one giving permission to anyone to contribute, modify, etc. under the terms of the GFDL. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:43, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

''Reset ident''


== Laws of Florida don't apply ==

It is very important to note here that the laws of the State of Florida and the USA don't apply here regarding ownership of the content on Wikibooks.  Instead it is the copyright laws '''''of the nationality of the contributor'''''.  I strongly emphasis this to point out that you, yes you, who are reading this and are a contributor to Wikibooks, own your own words that you have added and you can seek to defend your copyright based on the laws of the country where you live.

While this gets ugly, it should also be strongly noted that the Wikimedia Foundation completely disclaims any and all copyright to anything produced on Wikimedia projects.  There are legal reasons for this, and it should be pointed out that some WMF trustee members do have a copyright claim ''on their own contributions'', but don't claim anything for the projects in general.  In fact, the only &quot;intellectual property&quot; that they actually own is the logos and names to the various projects.  Even that had to be coerced after a fashion, but was considered something important and was decided through a sort of community concensus.  The rest of us are left &quot;holding the bag&quot; in terms of copyright enforcement.

Furthermore, in terms of the laws of the USA, it is still incredibly useful and advantageous to formally &quot;register&quot; copyright with the United States Library of Congress as it gives additional legal protections that you don't get with unregistered copyright.  And to really muck things up, there are international copyright treaties like the Berne Convention (and others) that allow copyright protection across international borders.  But to register copyright usually requires substantially more information than is found on user pages and on Wikimedia projects.

I know that I have fought people on these issues, and I'm willing to be patient until something comes up that let's me shout &quot;see, I told you so&quot;, but this is an issue that most people involved with Wikimedia projects don't really seem to care about.  Which is precisely why this discussion seems to fall apart without a real clear understanding or resolution either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:I had the idea that it all depends on the local where the work is published, or if the authors aren't local, to their national laws if so expressed on the work. I'll check that one. As for the rest I agree with you. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for clearing that up Rob, I had thought about sending you a message about it directly (because you are always very knowledgable on these topics), but I decided to send a message to foundation-l insteat (which turned out to be zero help). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

==== Re: local publication ====

One of the many reasons why the WMF doesn't want to get into the &quot;publishing&quot; game (hence owning content and asserting copyright authority) is because there are some huge legal liabilities once you become a publisher as opposed to the current legal status of the WMF being essentially an independent ISP for Wikimedia-related content.

As an ISP, the WMF can't be sued into submission to remove content (although they have done so... even here on Wikibooks).  The legal liability for what is said is also largely removed from the WMF, so if somebody here on Wikibooks posts something politically inflamatory or even libelous (the real worry here), that the WMF does not have to directly be responsible for it.  Once you become a &quot;publisher&quot;, you need to be considerably more careful about these little details.

As for being &quot;published&quot; on Wikibooks, this is indeed a legal grey area that needs to eventually be sorted out.  Unfortunately, it will be done by lawyers in a courtroom, not by mutual concensus among a bunch of Wikibooks contributors.  Once something is &quot;fixed&quot; onto some tangible media, the legal grey areas are fewer and the legal preceedence (of particular importance to UK/Commwealth/USA court systems using [[w:Common Law]]) is well established.  That sort of preceedence has not really been well established for websites other than as common carriers of information.  Certainly major wikis have not had copyright issues challenged, nor can I think of even a single legal case that involves libel issues and a major wiki website.  The WMF doesn't want to be the first to be a party to such a case either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:03, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Laws Don't Apply ==

I think the key issue thats being missed here is it is not about who does or doesn't own the contributions that are contributed, which is outside the control of anyone here, but who controls contributions to books on this project, which is not decided by any laws. So laws do not apply and neither does the GFDL. Those apply only to who owns the contributions made and what can be done with it outside of Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:53, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:In that case you are right, but to conform to the GFDL one must provide a framework or a interpretation of what is accepted since most people will not care about reading the license or even the wikibooks policies, on the other hand we must check that the policies we try to enforce are legal.

:The point that I intended to make with my first post is that GFDL:

:1) doesn't address contributors 

:2) the author's list in not the same as the log/history

:and since I was addressing you, the removal of the authors list from the cover page (it's my interpretation that the cover page is the entry page to a independent work) is a GFDL violation if not done in consensus of all listed authors.

:The definition of author vs contribution is very important if we intend on setting things like book communities and provide some structure to contributions (that is my main point), Wikibooks tries to provide works that are more complex and do take more time to build that lets say Wikipedia archives...

:The definition of author and contributor should be expressed if not here on what are wikibooks if it gets to be a policy.

:I'll agree with the Ownership policy and think that reference to a authors list isn't necessary in the text, by using GFDL authors and contributors give up the rights to their work (better say version, work under dual license etc...) to Wikimedia. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Whether or not the GFDL addresses contributors is not important, Wikibooks does. From what Whiteknight said, it would seem that the Wikimedia Foundation stance is that the history log is the only valid way to legally identify who is an author or not in case of legal disputes and you acknowledged this problem yourself, that its the only method of solving such a legal dispute. Its not pretty, its not cute, but thats the way it is. To do anything else could be violation of some law of some country.
:: I disagree that a distinction is necessary between author and contributor. There is no difference on Wikibooks, anyone is free to contribute and no single individual has the authority to say who can and cannot contribute. As you've already been told on numerious occations, decisions are made through concensus by those people active in editing a book. This is irregardless of who may have any legal ownership of the contents of the book. So whether a person is an author or not does not mater, they can be overturned just as easly as anyone through concensus. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Yup and there is where we diverge on our views, I can understand and even give you accolades for your point but you can not force your wishes on others even more if the legalities of the thing doesn't particular help you in your point, I like to sign what I do and in a later date point to what I have done, I don't particularly like to be part of an amorphic mass, I do take some pride for what I do. (pride leads to the achievement of quality), that is probably why I don't contribute to wikipedia (I do provide some level of content but only on the discussion pages).
:::I like even less when people start getting credit or placing their names in stuff they don't create.

:::&quot;no single individual has the authority to say who can and cannot contribute&quot; I agree with you on this and we have already got what our divergence is, but even this is a gray area, administrator on a daily base remove and correct spam or humm &quot;null content&quot; from books even more I was just '''wrongly''' blocked in sequence of asking a user to correct (state his intentions) its contributions (in place of just removing or correct them myself).

:::Even more confusing is the common understanding of things like a book community most users agree that there is such a thing, and is my view that placing a work under the control of a limited set of involved users will only provide and help building   better works as it provides a static framework were the work can evolve.

:::The logic is the same as the required edits on granting administrative right, etc.... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I understand anyone wishing to be acknowledged for contributions that have been made. I don't think anyone here is saying your contributions can't be acknowledged on some page in books, simply that you can't prevent anyone else who wishes to be acknowledged for their contributions from doing the same. Its optional and not required to exist and like any page not guaranteed to be accurate, nor should it be attempted to be used for legal purposes, as I believe this proposal is trying to say. 
:::: When administrators remove or correct spam, etc. they are suppose to be doing so because that is what the community concensus is and is what the community wants them to do. All policies that exist on Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects as well, are due to community concensus by the people who currently make up the project's community. You know I and other people disagree with you views about controling books and limiting involvement. Wikibooks is a dynamic framework, not a static one, nor do I think it should be. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

::::::Yup, the primary place to acknowledged contributions is set by the GFDL as the authors list (it sets rules and limits). All contributors are listed on the log/history but I don't agree with you, authors are (in law) and should be (by the Wikibooks community) accountable for their contributions.
::::::Since no pool is made, the removal of &quot;null content&quot; (spam is yet to be defined on wikibooks, there is a proposal on that), it is done with assumed community consensus, I think this is the reason why the policy proposal was first created. If you extrapolate this further  every single edit you make on a existing page that does not provide extended content is considered a way to enforce control on the previous work without any consensus being reached (you are imposing a personal view on a already existing work), this is expressed more clearly in esthetics's redesigns, page moves, pages/book renames or content moving. (I think corrections and punctuation will not fall under the need for consensus).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:30, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: I've recently changed the text of the proposal to prohibit all listings of authors or contributors on a module page. Since the history pages serve as a complete byline to the pages, it would seem improper (if not downright illegal) to list a subset of all the authors to a page as &quot;the authors&quot;, especially if a complete list exists in an easy-to-find and easy-to-read format. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:15, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::: I strongly and vehimently oppose any such prohibition to listing of authors and contributors on a module page.  The WMF has strongly opposed any efforts to collect the necessary information legally that is required for publication of information under the laws under the United States of America, and these author pages are the one and only legal means to collect that information.  Far from being illegal to list the authors (even a subset), it is legally '''''required''''' to collect specific information about these authors if you wish to enforce copyright.  In addition, the notice that such a page exists is quite clear on most Wikibooks.  I also put in the disclaimer (see [[Wikijunior Solar System/Authors]]) that this is used if you want to claim authorship.  I think that is a very reasonable method for Wikibooks (Wikipedia may have other problems, as seperate pages like this are discouraged).&lt;p&gt;Frankly, this is something that the WMF needs to work on, and there are many people who bury their heads in the sand about this issue, including WMF board members and developers.  Brad simply doesn't care here, as the WMF doesn't want to get into the publication business and the current information is all that is needed as an ISP.  But you may end up seeing that the content on Wikibooks (and other Wikimedia projects) may end up in the public domain instead of being protected by the GFDL.  Is that what you want?&lt;p&gt;BTW, It will take an act of GOD (or Jimbo, as it may be) for the alternative solution to author pages to happen.  What is really needed is for personal user information such as the year you were born (because of the life+75 rule for copyright), where you live (for purposes of nationality and residence), and your true legal name.  This may be voluntary information (should be IMHO), but the only way to collect this information at present is to request it directly as a seperate module page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

::::::: I disagree with you as well Rob. The history pages count as the necessary legal attribution for these books, and any listing of authors outside the history pages (especially a manual list) will only represent a subset of those authors. Books that are going to be published should include prominent mention of the history pages as a byline. If your only worry is about the legality of publishing the material, perhaps we need to find an alternative to the traditional notion of &quot;publishing&quot;. Wikibooks (and other wikimedia resources) are already available for reading online, and any printed version of those wikibooks that include mention of wikibookians as the original authors, and wikibooks.org being the home for the book project should serve as all the attribution we would need. I don't see why we would need to be enforcing any copyright: We have history pages that show the origin of our texts and the edit history thereof, and we are also not intending to publish books for profit around here (at least not in an organized way). Worst case scenario, we could print out the history pages along with the text of the book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

::::::::: ''&quot;Worst case scenario, we could print out the history pages along with the text of the book.&quot;''

::::::::: Do you see this as possible or practical ? (most history pages are several times larger that the book content that they refer to), I don't see it as possible on the a dead tree book, the best way of doing that is to recreate (what a task) just before printing a smaller version extracted from the global list of edits based on each user contribution (lets simplify and say the level of each contribution), even harder is to determine who has done what...

::::::::: Reading the  Wikibooks limitation to the GFDL ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Copyrights here]), we get ''&quot;To display author information, please check the &quot;Page history&quot; for modules and &quot;Authors&quot; page of any book&quot;'' this is pretty clear.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:No, i'm not saying it's possible or practical. If Rob is right (and I have no reason to doubt that he is), then legal attribution for copyright and publishing is going to require actual information about the authors (real names, etc), and not just the screennames that people use to sign books. If a person wants to list themselves as an author, we should require that they provide their real names and valid (verifiable) contact information. If they don't provide such information, any list of authors is simply going to be a distillation of the history pages. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== The text (get to the point) ==

To return to the primary point of this thread, Darklama is right: this policy doesnt address legal issues directly (no local policy can superceed laws). Instead, the idea of this policy is to affirm and strengthen the notions of collaboration and community, and mandate that people are on an equal footing when contributing here. Wikibooks membership isn't a hierarchy of any kind, and the newest of new members has just as much say in the content of a page as the oldest and most experianced veterans. Wikibookians should not be qualified based on their edit counts, the length of membership, or their expertise in the areas on which they write. Also, no user can mandate what kinds of edits can be made to a page, or who makes those edits. The notion of &quot;ownership&quot;, in this sense, is different from the legal meaning of the word. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I have examined the proposed text again and found other points that probably need a rewording/rephrasing.
*&quot;and any user can edit any page at any time.&quot;
:to and any user should be able to edit any page at any time.
*&quot;No user may:
1. Prevent other users from editing a particular page or book.&quot;
:administration can and do prevent users from editing pages, this should be made clear with reference and/or links to the other policies that grant that right to administrators and explain the why...
*&quot;Revert edits made in good faith by another contributor.&quot;
:if edits are done in good faith there wouldn't be a need for a revert, this leaves a wide space to interpretation with the only reason being a contribution that is on error/outside of the book context and this shouldn't be left to personal interpretation.
*&quot;Treat edits that were made in good faith as spam or vandalism.&quot;
:this is a bit of blind faith and I have pointed that out on another policy that has the same text, this should be easy to solve by the use of the proposed spam/vandalism policy&quot; and restated, it is a call for the interpretation of another person state of mind or the supposition of intentions.
*&quot;Force people to ask permission from you, or to gain your acceptance in order to contribute to a particular book or module.&quot;
: this again is confusing if a consensus is needed, people need to have a way to impose a consensus decision (there isn't one at the moment and simple users should not have means to do it) or a fixed set of rules that explains and gives users the bases on enforcing/asking to reach such consensus, even more important a way of protecting the content/work until a consensus is reached (there is not such thing at the moment).
*&quot;the books and modules&quot;
: there is no such thing as modules you are contributing to books on Wikibooks.

:: the individual pages in a book are known as &quot;modules&quot;. Next, I don't think many of the things that you brought up are confusing in any way. No person can demand more respect or consideration in a discussion, then any other person can. Also, no person can have more &quot;say&quot; about a book or module then any other person. I will make a note that administrators can protect certain pages for certain reasons. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Yup, I stand corrected (I just noticed the definition on the limitation to the GFDL), I don't understand the need for a redefinition do you have any idea ? The GFDL deals with pages not modules it calls authors pages, cover pages, etc... why make it more confusing redefining pages as modules (pages and modules aren't even the same thing, IMHO) Is it backlog from Wikipedia project? They deal with articles and each article is indeed a module to the Encyclopedia, here we deal in books and book pages. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== Interesting alternative... ==

I thinki one of the problems with this policy is that it's based on the wikipedia concept (but thoroughly stripped down. The [[commons:Commons:Ownership_of_pages_and_files|policy on commons]] is a bit clearer (and prose-written). 

The GFDL issue is about &quot;end-usage&quot; (rather than editorial control, which is what this policy is about), so I'm not sure why it's in here. Meta and commons both have excellent paterials developed for that too, so perhaps we should have a separate page explaining that rather than trying to combine it with this. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:21, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== GFDL and Authorship ==

I want to start this as a seperate thread, even though I posted a reply to Whiteknight regarding the use of author pages.

I want to state very clearly here that the &quot;history&quot; section of Wikimedia pages is woefully inadequate for the purposes of asserting authorship on a number of levels.  While I will openly admit that the basic information that is absolutely required is there, much more information needs to be gathered before it can be used as &quot;evidence&quot; to enforce copyright.

More to the point, can anybody, and I mean anybody, point to content that has been developed using MediaWiki software and has successfully been defended against a copyright claim of ownership?  Even if just to enforce the GFDL?

I can only think of one (and only one) legal case that even involves the use of the GPL (much less GFDL) where the terms of the license have even been a major issue that could result in the outcome of the case (it is still in the court system at the moment... (see [[w:SCO v. IBM]] and very closely related cases)

Some people (like myself) use their legal names as user names, and this helps somewhat.  And perhaps some additional information can be gleaned from user pages and correspondance such as the various mailing lists.  But unless these three critical pieces of information are stored and kept with user accounts, copyright enforcement can't be done:

#Real Legal Name (you can author under a psuedonym, but at some point you have to admit who you really are to claim authorship)
#The Year of your birth (to determine exactly how long something is copyrighted.... often ignored in many situations, but required to enforce the life+75 rules)
#Your nationality - what country you claim citizenship in, even if you don't have a country you claim to be from.
#Where you currently &quot;reside&quot; - this may be different than your nationality.

Without these very critical pieces of information, you might as well be donating your contributions to the public domain, and issues surrounding the GFDL are no longer valid.  That means no GFDL protection at all and everything that goes with it.  And it means you can't even claim authorship.  While it may be true that nobody cares here, it is important to note that there are plenty of vultures around that would love to get especially Wikipedia content without having to go through the hoops of the GFDL.

While I will admit that there has been some legal bluster around, the current scheme is really just a house of cards waiting to fall apart.  What I'm trying to do here is make an air-tight case for defending copyright, and giving proper assertion to those authors who want to claim authorship of a given Wikibook.  The only way to do this at the moment is precisely through the use of &quot;author&quot; modules.  If you kill these pages (as the current wording of this policy would provide), you are in effect throwing out the GFDL entirely.  And I mean that completely.  There is no other way to deal with this issues.

BTW, I did make a Bugzilla request about this (see [[Bugzilla:2993]]).  Note particularly when I wrote the bug report, and the reply that was recieved.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I agree completely: the author pages can be important, and by no means should be disallowed (in fact they should be encouraged). However, we are mixing apples and oranges: this policy is about &quot;owning&quot; wikibooks content in the sense of editorial control. We might need to rename it to better reflect that, but other wikimedia projects tend to use ownership in the sense we mean here. 

:As far as attribution for publishing off-wikibooks, see [[commons:Commons:Reusing content outside Wikimedia|Commons:Reusing content outside Wikimedia]], which contains the sentence &quot;What methodology or metric regarding how you determine these five substantial authors for the purposes of the GFDL is not defined in a legal sense, but it would be wise to use a consistant method such as edit count, word count, hours contributed to the content, or something of a similar nature.&quot; But that's ''an issue of attribution, '''not''' an issue of who can edit''!!! I would support a policy about how we attribute and when we should do it, but that's not this policy. This policy is about ensuring that wikibookians are free to contribute to wikibooks without being hounded by another editor who insists on editorial control. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:Adding: the reason the GFDL has been made an issue here (again, inappropriately), is because [[User:Panic2k4]] has been '''claiming''' authorship (sole or nearly so) of a particular book, and has interpreted this as giving him the right to editorial control over the book. He was blocked, twice, for demanding that the edits of others be done to his approval, and arguing that it is his right to do just that. In this sense, [[WB:OWN]] is simply the enforcement end of &quot;anyone can edit&quot;... if someone violates this policy and makes it difficult for others to edit and collaborate, the consequences need to be laid out. Without a policy, it's simply at administrators discretion on how to enforce &quot;anyone can edit&quot;, which is fine as long as we have careful admins. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

::Please try to restrain yourself in making claims that have no base, I see you are [[User_talk:Panic2k4#Welcome_back|back online again and this wasn't the place I had intended to reply to you]] but here it goes... 

::Again I don't claim '''sole''' authorship and never have I claimed editorial control (I claim the right to get a consensus on changes to the status quo, that is changes to pages or the structure of the book), you know that and [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] also (in this particular example, I have been contributing to a work for years and [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] who had not contributed content and started editing the book for lets say 4 months now, disagrees with it's structure, moved pages to other books, changed the cover and introduced an alternative TOC, corrupted the pages histories by merging several pages into a new one, deleted content and created a print version of that alternative TOC without including the GFDL copy, in a clear GFDL violation and sanctioned by you).

::The problem with the other user and the reason you blocked me and I again say '''wrongly''' doesn't have directly to do with reformatting or big changes, the problem was that the user in question made some changes that corrupted the logic of the text on that particular page, I recognized that the user was participating on the book (for some time) and did not want to interpret is actions as &quot;spam&quot; and asked him to correct the problem in a time frame or I would do it. (The validity or imposition is like saying to you; please call me in 10 minutes or I'll call you back), for this I was blocked for 2 weeks. (Well I was blocked twice for the same event)

::''« You shouldn't try to impose &quot;deadlines&quot; on your fellow contributors. You are an equal partner, not a &quot;chief editor&quot; »'''

::If you had done some group work or had a need to synchronize stuff under a collaborative framework (probably I as a programmer know this more that you) you need a way to check if you have control of a structure before you make changes to it.

::The problem is bigger yet as the blocking action resulted on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=680794&amp;oldid=680734 monitor of a different conversation (on another unrelated user page) were I was explaining this problem], this violates my freedom of expression and even if your interpretation was correct, my point of view had the same value as yours, since I was talking to a third party on a private page, that is, by your action any person that disagrees with any policy can't talk about it or express the wish for changes (not the problem here but the final result is that).

::Policies exists to be challenged and updated and express the community views on it and as it stands not even a majority has control on general policies. Users are all equal, you personal views, even if divergent from mine shouldn't influence your actions as an administrator.

::More I have been an active contributor and participative on votes, policy creation/building and in the community in general, by being blocked I did not only become unable to continue working on the books I normally do, but could not express my vote on other subjects, and [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] took that chance to impose his views on the book in question, the other user changed my signed posts on the talk page, etc...

::''&quot;if your fellow authors create new pages in order to experiment with the structure, format, or style of the book, do not tag them for speedy deletion (if you feel there is a problem, list the page on vfd instead, as I don't think any administrator will take a speedy nomination from you at face value as things stand now).&quot;''

::I have no problem with the creation of pages (I even incentivated [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] to create the alternative TOC), the problem was that [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] duplicated content of several pages inside a new single one (a copy of several existing pages) on the bookspace and replaced the TOC with that page (this is a big no no under actual policies and my speed deletion tag was correct). 

::''&quot;Don't move talk pages around or consolidate them. If people leave a note on a particular page, they probably meant to leave it where they left it. (What you do with your own user talk page is of course completely at your discretion: this page really is your page).&quot;''

::I disagree we are working on books not o separated modules there is a book structure and all pages must be a single work, a user that isn't monitoring EVERY single page of a book will not get notification of talkpages posts, by centralizing the talk pages it eases the burden for new users and facilitates coordination of the work.

:::I'll reply to the above on Panic's page in a few hours (#real.life has me busy during daylight).

The above post clearly shows the need for having an &quot;active policy&quot; about asserting ownership on this wiki, since the lack of a policy has allowed over a year of wikilawyering and other bad behavior to go on without redress. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:32, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

I post it here as the definition of author and contributor, it can have some specifics to national laws that I'm not aware of (I know that the US doesn't sign every international treaties on this subject):

*'''Author''' - Author is the one that creates or contributes for the creation of a work, after creation and/or publication of the work, the one that assumes legal responsibility for it and rights over it, each subsequent alterations to the same work fall in several categories including revisions, re-editions, translations etc... It is considered that a existing work can only be co-authored with the previous authors if it is considered a derivative work.

NOTE: my national copyright law permits anonymous authors, in that case the limiting date on copyright will end in a similar fashion as states above by [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] (70 years after publication). 

:'''NOTE:''' GFDL states that any derivative works should remain FREE under a compatible license to GFDL itself.

*'''derivative work''' - new work based upon an original work to which enough original creative work has been added so that the new work represents an original work of authorship.

*'''Contributors''' -  the one that contributes to a work, as editors, collaborators, an author can be considered a contributor but not all contributors may be authors, for example spell correction, reformatting will not constitute original creative work, on the other hand translation do. 

I had (a few years ago) a class on law but that dealt specifically with my Nation and European Community Law and  mostly on software, personal data and electronic(databases and security), but from what I have gathered this seems to be correct, it is my interpretation that most subsequent edits to a book here on wikibook don't particularly fall under derivative work definition and the GFDL doesn't give this definitions on its text but address those concepts and even provides rules for them, are the definitions wrong in any way?

It is generally accepted by a large percentage of Wikibookians that contributor is synonymous to author... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:23, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I understand a little of what you are going through here.  The largest problem that copyright laws face here in a situation similar to Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects is that they were not written with the idea of massive cooperative authoring of the nature that exists here with this project.  Generally speaking, it is rare for even multiple authors getting together on a single published work, and even then it is usually just two or three people.  Far more often you will see perhaps &quot;collections&quot; from multiple authors, but even then it is very clear who wrote sections &quot;X,Y, and Z&quot;.  Usually with a byline or other attribution.

:This does not happen here on Wikibooks.  While I will admit that minor edits also occur that would be analogous to perhaps an editor at a major publishing house, there are also times when on a given page that substantial changes will occur by multiple authors, and it is difficult even to pull out what words were really written by one author as distinguished by another one.  The best example I can come up with is [[wikia:novelas:One-word-at-a-time]], where literally every word is (practically speaking) authored by somebody completely differently.  Some Wikipedia articles are almost that bad, where you can attribute nearly every word to a different contributor.

:The point is that we are operating on something a little bit different here than is typical.  Wikis are a little unusual in general anyway, and the GFDL does add some dimensions of its own on top of the typical Wiki editing experience.

:BTW, not to belabor the point, but you should remember that &quot;free&quot; is as in freedom, or a &quot;libre&quot; (to use French) license.  That does not mean that you have to give the content away at all times, and charging money or making a profit off of GFDL content is perfectly acceptable.  Where you get into trouble under the GFDL is that you can't restrict (hence freedom) how that content is subsequently republished once you have given it to somebody else.  This is precisely why it is often called [[w:Copyleft|Copyleft]], because while copyright laws are invoked, it doesn't really have the same philosophical basis as is typical for copyrighted material published by a traditional printing house.

:It is reasonable to point out in this policy (or guideline... as I see it) that once you have released something into the GFDL, that others can &quot;edit mercilessly and redistribute at will&quot;.  In some ways you have lost &quot;control&quot; over your own words to a certain extent.

:That said, there are international laws that do recognize the &quot;rights of authors&quot;, which is one of the reasons why I put into the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|Deletion policy]] a specific clause about allowing a speedy delete by the author when there are no other major contributors.  What we don't have is a policy in place that even addresses what we should do if the original author no longer wants the content on Wikibooks yet several others have contributed and can all claim joint-ownership.  In theory the same thing applies but in this case all of the authors would have to agree that the content needs to be deleted.  That is a particularly thorny question with anonymous edits.  All of this implies some authorship control on this project.

:French law in particular has some very specific laws regarding authorship that the GFDL disregards or doesn't cover and supersceed any license agreement.  Other similar EU laws also apply, which is perhaps what [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] is trying to say here.  In the USA, there are no other &quot;moral rights&quot; other than what is explictly spelled out under United States Code, section 173 (copyright law), or at least they are not interpreted the same way.

:As to if subsequent edits past the first original page creation count as &quot;derivitive works&quot;, are more &quot;co-authorship&quot; or some other legal status, I can't answer.  It is something that hasn't even been tested legally, which is one of the problems we are facing here and where some of the uncertanty comes from.  But the spirit of Wiki editing is such that for most pages of content, anybody and nearly everybody has the opportunity to make changes, including very substantial changes.  

:What you enjoy as an author is the &quot;right to fork&quot; the content if you don't like the direction it is going.  Unfortunately, those content forks can't exist simultaneously on Wikibooks, so a fork must necessarily exist on an external website or other publishable medium.  What is so amazing is that in spite of this free for all principle to create hundreds of versions of the content, that we have been able to come up with [[Wikibooks:Forking policy|policies]] ''within this project'' that are largely followed and keep these fork to an absolute minimum.  Or that a fork is such a huge event that everybody in the community is talking about it when it occurs.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:12, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I call you attention that Wikibooks and Wikimedia project differ in content and objectives, Wikipedia is considered a single work constituted of multiple modules, here we have an repository of distinct works (books), example, the user I have been having a depute moved some pages from a book to another this is a legal problem as he didn't credit the work or the author  of the original book, this is not a problem on Wikipedia but it's a problem here that none seems to be willing to address...

:: ''it is rare for even multiple authors getting together on a single published work''

:: Not so, this is very common on the software and even music world, I know a bit about the first but the licenses are a bit more elaborated and copyright holders are a bit more protective of their rights.

:: The Wikinovelas example provides a warning to us at Wikibooks of what we should avoid, things aren't that complex here, and some work should be taken to make that clear to the users.

:: As for the &quot;rights of authors&quot; as in &quot;moral rights&quot;, it is my view it doesn't apply to Wikimedia as they are located on the US and the US did not sign the convention.

:: &quot;derivative works&quot; are &quot;co-authorship&quot;, even if the GFDL is not tested it is in the spirit of the license to treat them as such, example they use &quot;derivative works&quot; on its text and &quot;modified work&quot;, they even treat a translation as a &quot;derivative works&quot;, they aren't very clear but what the license misses is basically defined in every copyright law. Any contribution that doesn't add enough original creative content creates a modification and if it does it creates  a derived work, it's pretty simple, by being a derivative work the contributor can sign as a author, if he wishes more problematic yet is that if doesn't sign it is taken that he gives his rights to the other listed authors (but that is another mess).

:: As for the fork policy it doesn't exist, please take the time to examine my post below were I address directly what my disputes are and the fork policy in specific.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Actually, I'm really surprised to see the fork policy as a &quot;proposed&quot; policy.  It has been refered to in the past as justification for deleting content and was one of the motivations for the merger of two very different C++ textbooks.  It certainly fits in as a defacto policy even though no formal &quot;vote&quot; has ever been held on it.  I certainly wouldn't go against the spirt of this policy, even if a more formal vote for acceptance perhaps ought to occur.

:::As far as multiple authors are concerned, yeah, I know music and computer software are more typically done with multiple authors.  And the case law is much more established for those two forms of expression in that situation as a result.  That a court might use computer software examples to extablish precedence for multiple authorship of a Wikibook is possible, but you might end up being surprised here as this really is a different kind of work.  Besides perhaps a major college science textbook (which is typically written under contractual terms, establishing case law to work under) I can't think of another major authorship situation where a very large number of authors are involved with the same paragraphs of text simultanously, except with perhaps other Wiki environments.  This really is a new area of law and something that will IMHO be tested in the not too distant future.  Just like the legendary test of the GPL that has been discussed in the past on many hacker mailing lists and forums.

:::BTW, except for FOSS software, I can't think of too many software authoring situations that also have multiple &quot;authors&quot; where the copyright &quot;owner&quot; isn't also very clear.  In most cases including typical software copyright issues there is a clear &quot;owner&quot; (usually a company like Microsoft or EA Games) that &quot;hires&quot; an employee or contractor to write the software on their behalf.  This situation for Wikibooks is much more like FOSS and any such legal precedence would rely upon interpretations of copyright law under very similar situations.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:11, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I agree with your views except the defacto state of the fork policy, I would agree if it was a imposition from Wikimedia, but even so the arguments that have so far been proposed for defending the existence of such a policy are easily refuted.
:::: As for your stance of the copyright/authorship/GFDL problem, it is my opinion that steps should be made to inform, protect and preserve against future legal problems, by avoiding to discuss or address problems we are putting blindfolds on users and trowing them out of a moving helicopter that we have no control over.

== Completely misses the purpose and intent ==

I believe Panic's [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AOwnership&amp;diff=699747&amp;oldid=699003 changes] completely misses Whitiknight's purpose in creating this policy and its intentions. So I reverted his changes to the last revision made by Whiteknight and tried to explain the purpose and intent of this policy a little better. Which I believe to be not about ownership and copyright at all, since that depends entirely on what license is being used, but on how Wikibookians are not expected to conduct themselves when working together and briefly on how to acknowledge contributors when printing or copying to another source. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:25, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: The way Wikibookians should or not behave is well documented on other policies and guidelines and there is no need to include it in a new policy (probably a guideline will suffice) a simple phrase will probably do it, as for the other points the GFDL and Wikibooks Limitations to GFDL already address it, if a clarification is needed the Wikibooks Limitations to the GFDL page is probably the best place to extend a more basic GFDL interpretation for Wikibookians. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Culling the legalistic content ==

I removed the following section from this page:

:''Under the terms of the GFDL, attribution for a book must be made to at least 5 authors of the book (if there are more then 5 authors), or all authors (if there are less then 5). Every module of a textbook contains a history link that lists every contributor to a book which is used to satisfy this clause of the license. Manual lists of authors on module, talk and discussion pages do not count as proper, legal attribution. Lists of authors of this sort are prohibited.''

:''Do not sign your contributions. Your signature only belongs on the talk and discussion pages, not on the module pages. The page history records your contributions, and that is all that is needed.''

First of all, this is giving legal advise when it isn't stritcly necessary.  As I stated above, I also think this is patently wrong advise as well for many reason, as I don't think the history page is all that is necessarily needed.  Much more is needed.  And making an issue about the creation of author pages completely detracts from the purpose of this page, which is to define what ownership of Wikibooks content is really about and why we do what we do for collaboratively developing textual content to create books.

I also have tried to give this policy a much more positive tone, by noting that what we do isn't because of the GFDL (although that does allow us to create derivative works, etc.), but because we are using a wiki and what wiki editing really means.  In this case emphasizing the &quot;Wiki&quot; in Wikibooks.

The whole issue over how many authors can be claimed on a book and the legalistic stuff perhaps ought to be instead with some republication guidelines, which would be also where an explaination as to why author pages have been created in the first place.  I'll say it again, this is not the place to argue and debate over the merits of author pages, and I don't think it is necessary for this policy to work to even have that clause in this policy.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I actually think we need to have 2 policies here... one about &quot;collaboration ethics&quot;, and the other about the publication issues. I think we can come up with something reasonable and precise for the first issue, the second (as Robert knows well) is a complicated issue that's constantly debated on many fora, including wikiprojects, mailing lists, etc.

:I had suggested &quot;Ownership&quot; because that's what the similar policies are called on other wikimedia projects. It might not be a bad idea to call it something else here though, as is our tradition. Maybe [[Wikibooks:Collaboration]]? 

:The trouble comes about when a user has worked on a book for a while, and then has difficulties collaborating with a new contributor. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:18, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I'll do one better, since now [[User:SBJohnny]] seems reluctant to point to the 800-pound gorilla in the room...
:: (since [[User:SBJohnny]] told me that my actions are the reason for the creation of this policy, I feel very strongly that if this will not prove my POV will serve as a base to resolve a similar problems in the future, I do this for the benefit of every other Wikibookian as I will probably avoid to contribute to a project here after the troubles I been trough...)
:: This fallowing points for me are closed and I don't intent o debating them I give them as examples of things that for me weren't right, I'll use the definition I provided above...
::#'''Fork''' - I and Paddu (the user that was the most active contributor at the time to the CPP book), had a small and not intervened war (even upon revert and other motions),  on content and format. I unilaterally  decided to created a news book (at the time on the posts we used the term fork, that was badly chosen but there was no policy on it so that was not a problem) and by doing so the dispute was resolved and I could continue to write.
::#'''Fork policy''' - The fork policy to me shouldn't even exist, I will talk to anyone on that policy talk page to defend my POV on it, but the policy wasn't agreed upon (I am/was against it) and so the decision process wasn't fallowed, or am I missing something ?!?
::#'''Forced merge''' - 2 administrator took to the task of forcing a merge on the two books, I was against it and fought to prevent it, the first administrator really did understand the problem and provided me with some insights and I started to adapt the book format a bit from the monolithic (one page) status it had (and the problem that most aggravated Paddu before the so called fork) and other changes, the second administrator did a lousy job at it, forced the merge, imposed a new definition to the scope of the book, format, image, name change etc... a mess, again no consensus on most of the changes, but as the cpp book was not evolving a copy of the new book survived as result of the merge (strangely enough no voice tried to defend the original cpp book).
::So my point is, does the decision process work or any user with a bit more rights or the support of community (form a majority) can disregard the policy ? What constitutes the &quot;be bold&quot; ? What structure do we give to contributors to build books, since any one seems to be able with enough time and support to impose radical changes without due process...

:: '''The actual problems that must be addressed so I can stop making a fuss about it...'''
:: When a user has authorship of a work, (not really the main point, it should be valid for any &quot;type&quot; of user) and a &quot;new&quot; collaborator forces a reformat of the work without consensus, that is by violating the Wikibook decision policy (since the user has the right to propose changes to the whole Wikibook community), and administrators who should know better, fail to protect the work as required by the simple policy of decision making, What is the solution, protect the work and the first user or the second user rights to reformat the work ?!?
:: Administration also has failed to note that &quot;cover page&quot; is the entry point to any specific wikibook namespace (if you prefer the most linked to page on the specific namespace), and that the GFDL requires that authors/copyright should be &quot;accessible&quot; from there), this one is simple isn't it ?
:: Another point that I made and was (without the fallowing of the decision process, as it should suffice my opposition to resolve the issue) the creation of a new print version of a secondary TOC that removed authors and a copy of the GFDL from the final product, that is was intended to generate a copy without those informations, is a violation of the GFDL or am I missing something ?!?
:: I've taken the time and patience to point to the users that even if they didn't want to get on the legal matters, if they just fallowed the existing decision process, the issues even if the other part didn't concede, would be rightly &quot;resolved&quot;. What I have noticed is a collapse of the decision process here at Wikibooks.

::Again, state the I do not '''invoke special power, specific rights or claim sole ownership or power of decision greater that any other user''' this is not the problem here, there is no other claim or dispute active that the ones stated above, I refused to &quot;be bold&quot; this time and tried to see if administrators really took up the task of enforcing a policy or proving that I was on the wrong, none so far and more problematic yet is that the administrator that did take any action based on his interpretation of the problem, blocked me, let the other user do even more changes to the work and in his last post on the talk pages seems to think that he has done his task and all is resolved... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC) 

::I agree that IF this proposal is to be adopted at all that it should be renamed so as not to be misleading. I generally believe though it is not necessarly a seperate issue from decision making, which is why there is similar wording in [[Wikibooks:Decision making/Unstable]]. I think I will adopt the more positive wording used here on that one as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: I removed ''The terms of the GFDL do not override these principles'' because I believe it to be giving legal advice which may not be true. I added ''and &quot;legal rights&quot; granted to everyone else'' as another example in addition to the &quot;moral rights&quot;, in its place. My thinking is there may be too many legal issues to try to cover without seeking some type of formal response from the Wikimedia Foundation as to their position on any copyright and ownership issues here, if legal issues are to be addressed. My intent with the addition example is to cover for example that the GFDL may very well be considered a legal binding contract of some sort that is stating the author is giving up certain rights, like the right to prosicute someone of they publish the contents for profit, since the GFDL allows someone to do so. This I think would be in contridiction to the &quot;do not override these principles&quot; statement. Perhaps their needs to be something added about how Wikibooks does not try to give legal advice and is no substitute for a copyright lawyer? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Guideline vs Policy ==

I have changes the text from policy to guideline since the proposed text isn't more that a clarification on other policies and guidelines on a specific topic, it doesn't introduce innovations or in itself creates a new imposition to users. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:You also reverted the wording again which is incorrect. Books consist of more then just text which is copyrighted. All contents that is contributed whether its text, images, sounds, videos, etc. may be copyrighted.

:: Since we don't accept images, sound, video, etc under GFDL, all references to contributions on that pages deals with text, you may add that other kinds of content do have other licenses and such but any resulting work or aggregation of works will not be like adding text, that is you can change text I had on Wikibooks but you can't edit, modify a sound or other type of content without generating a separated work that have some other rights in itself, and not directly on Wikibooks you must dl the content change it, upload it again and ''change'' the text on the book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::: A mention to that would probably be usefully, as I'm not proposing the policy or guideline, I will refrain to do that change, as it its, I see a very small usefulnesses to it (the only one that I see is the aggregation and clarification of concepts from other policies and guidelines in a single text).
:::::: I would like to see the definition and clarification of other concepts like author, contributor and modification vs derivative work, page vs module but this isn't probably the policy or guideline to do that (well author and contributor could probably get in the text until they are added elsewhere as people do confuse the two). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

''reset tab''

I don't believe there is any confusion between author and contributor, because as far as Wikibooks is concerned there is no difference, and only has relevence when reusing the contents of a book (text, images and all) outside of Wikibook and maybe when uploading previous published works to Wikibooks. I believe as far as Wikibooks is concerned every modification creates a derivative work. I think page and modules are more or less interchangable words here, with possibly the only distinction being when printing out is that more then one module may make up a single printed page.

I will again change the text of this proposal to say contributed contents and refer to it as &quot;works&quot; rathern then &quot;books&quot;, in order to cover the fact it applies to more then just the text of a book. I don't think there is any real need to clarify beyond that. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: No sir, you are wrong, and I have stated that to you many times before, author and contributor are defined above if you are intending in redefining those concepts you must pass the decision process of Wikibooks, make the new definition highly visible and extend the limitation to the GFDL (that probably won't work as you are recreating the rules of copyright).

: One of our disputes for instance, shows how there is a problem with your interpretation in this case when you move pages between books here in Wikibooks, you are obligated per the license used to refer on the target book the source book, a more common example is when you copy text from Wikipedia (a bit different but basically the same) you must provide that info on the copyright information of the target book.

: And not every modification is a derivative work, derivative work implies that you added a significant contribution to the work (see above), as in a translation, not in moving pages, simple reformat or spell checking.

: In Wikibooks, a policy, a user page, a guideline or basically every page that is not part of a book is a module (if protected by the GFDL), as it is part o Wikibooks as a whole, every book pages is part of that particular book not a module, you can't move it freely on the Wikibooks namespace, as they have particular rights a legal protections that make them different from the rest.

: Most of this things are the basis of our work here, they came not from the community but from what Wikimedia gave us, the license and the legal framework we must work with, I hope that this is the last time I have to say the same thing over and over again, if you have another interpretation please can you provide me with the basis for you claims ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:: You seem to keep missing my point: Is it irrelevant what definition You or I believe that author, contributor, modification and derivated work have. They have no relevance within the framework of Wikibooks. I don't believe Wikibooks defines them as you have stated and I am not trying to change their meaning here. I believe however that you are trying to change them and that you are also confused about when such things do and don't mater or are possibly trying to change the does and don't. I'm simply trying to clarify things to adopt to the community while I believe your trying to force changes to make the community adapt to you. As usualy this is going nowhere and is a waste of time. I don't believe I have a need to justify myself. I know I disagree with your stance and am simply waiting for the community to help clarify and put an end to this mess. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Is it your point that there aren't authors in Wikibooks ? or that all contributors are authors ?
::: The first statement is wrong and the second also, I gave support to my POV based on the GFDL and normal rules we agree when we start writing on Wikibooks as it doesn't stand on a vacuum, if you can provide any bases to your POV please do or at least say that they are based only on your personal wishes. I go so far as to state that my interpretation does not even need a debate for reaching a consensus on the bases these are legal presets that we must comply to as set by Wikimedia, these concepts are protected by law and can't be changed. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:::: I will say that the issue about authorship is something that has not had any real significant review on Wikimedia projects.  Of course, it has been said that Wikimedia projects are the only &quot;Web 2.0&quot; projects that actually take copyright seriously at all, but that is an issue better left elsewhere.  I have seen a gross misunderstanding of the GFDL and copyright laws or even copyright ethics in general when it comes to pages like [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]], particularly on Wikipedia.  I have recieved advise that I can radomly pick 5 people from the user list to meet the authorship requirements of the GFDL (vandals and bots included!)  I find that so far afield that my mouth actually dropped open when I read that.  Still, I think it is reasonable to say that somebody who has added a signficiant quantity of content to a page in the form of words can be considered an &quot;author&quot; for the purposes of the GFDL.&lt;p&gt;What is the big issue here on this policy page is what sorts of control does the author have on their work here on Wikibooks after you have hit the &quot;Save page&quot; buton?  There are many here who would say &quot;absolutely none at all&quot;, and others that would say &quot;it is mine, mine, mine, all mine, and you can't touch it unless I let you&quot;.  While I would lean to the &quot;none at all&quot; camp in terms of general thinking, I am willing to entertain the idea that perhaps an author has some legal and ethical &quot;rights&quot; regarding what they have written.  Of principle concern is that if you have substantially contributed to a Wikibook, for example, your name ought to be cited as an author of that book and you should be given credit for helping to create that content.&lt;p&gt;Now what other &quot;rights&quot; does an author enjoy in regards to Wikibooks content?  You do have the &quot;right&quot; to object to changes in a Wikibook you helped create and raise a fuss if you think the book has changed substantially from what you originally intended.  Now this doesn't mean you always win, but it does mean that people should take seriously suggestions of those who helped put the content together.  This also includes page formatting and even module names, in terms of where those contributing should strongly suggest how this is put together.  A person who steps in and has not been involved with the development of a Wikibook but decides to make huge changes to the format and structure of the book should legitimately be questioned and held to a tougher standard in terms of answering why they need to make these changes, particularly if the major contributors don't want them happening.&lt;p&gt;If all of this seems like common sense, well it should be.  But at the same time, often people act before they think and sometimes run roughshod over others, and in this sense what is written here for this policy is to help smooth things out a bit and try to explain some of the reasons why things are done instead of pontificating that it should be done in some particular manner.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: I don't agree with [[User:Robert Horning]] on several point but those aren't directly related to this guideline, I don't agree that a author should have more rights over a work on Wikibooks, this is, after a book exist the community can ask for his removal (VfD) or ask for forced alteration (NPOV) even if the author objects, etc ... (humm... well we actually can't because of the problem that all decisions are based on consensus, so we have to have much more detailed polices to create violators that will let us impose such decisions, we must create rules to have criminals we can punish)
::::: What I don't agree is that all users that contribute are equal on the decision process of a book evolution (this is further extended on my talk page and this is not the indicated forum).
::::: I've now come to notice that [[User:Darklama]] thinks that all users regardless of the level of involvement/contribution to a work can be defined and added to it as authors  (or as you give in example pick 5 elements and fill the authors page), this is plainly wrong, and I have by now proven why. the license (GFDL) we use here is not to protect Wikibooks, it's users or contributors it is to protect the works (books) the authors and finally to guarantee that the works can forever remain free for all. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:48, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::::::Wikibooks is not a hierarchy, there is no distinction made between wikibookians based on the number or the quality of their contributions. All contributors to a book hold copyright over the materials that they've contributed, regardless of how small the contributions may be. A book with multiple copyright holders needs to maintain the rights of ''all the copyright holders'', regardless of the scope of their contributions to the book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Other policies with similar points ==

This proposal appears to refer to items already covered by [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License]]. I therefore do not believe it should be a separate policy. Keep it as an unofficial guideline or summary, by all means, but I'd be loathe to see it gain any official status. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:I don't agree with that, the fact that wikibooks is not a hierarchy, and that users are not ranked or graded is an important point. The main idea of this proposal (even if the language is a bit too harsh) is that all wikibookians are on an equal footing, and that all people should be given equal opportunity to edit, and all people should be allowed to participate equally in the wikibooks process. This is a fundamental point that isn't written in stone anywhere, and really deserves to be. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Fixes and Copyright Stuff ==

I've gone through and cleaned up this proposal, there was alot of stuff in here that needed to be removed, and alot of other stuff that needed to be rewritten. This page is about the exercise of editorial control over modules, it is not a replacement nor a competitor for [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]. Things that are only about copyrights do not belong here, they belong in a new proposal for that other policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:I think the text as it is now addresses the concerns that lead to the proposal creation, it gives useful information to the unaware, by making it a policy we will be enforcing that no one can claim editorial control, in a few days a call for comments, would be nice so we can proceed in passing this as a policy.
:For the added information that was removed some, it is very important and part of it was, I think, behind the creation of this proposal, and it also addressed problems that should be made clear or at least passed in a NPV way to Wikibookians, some I know you disagree with me, some should be discussed or stated that there isn't a consensus on it (ie: the aggregation of works and the positive side to it), or at least make the points accessible in a single forum and I agree that the copyright page is the best location for that discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:24, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::Things that have to deal with copyrights are certainly valuable, but they would belong at [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] instead. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:25, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::We could, like the user on the thread above pointed out, make the case that all should go into the copyrights policy, if we really extract only what is the being attempted to pass along with the text we could reduce it to 2 lines or very few words that all people agree and never was contested, but I think it will probably be less troublesome if we do it by parts we can always decide to merge the two texts later.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:28, 13 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''SIRCh: Selected Internet Resources for Chemistry'''
&lt;/center&gt;
Variously known as chemoinformatics, chemical informatics, or even chemiinformatics, '''cheminformatics''' is the application of computer technology to chemistry in all of its manifestations. Much of the current use of cheminformatics techniques is in the drug industry. Indeed, one definition of cheminformatics is &quot;the mixing of information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge, for the intended purpose of making decisions faster in the arena of drug lead identification and optimization.&quot; Now cheminformatics is being applied to problems across the full range of chemistry. 

Cheminformaticians often work with massive amounts of data. They construct information systems that help chemists make sense of the data, often attempting to accurately predict the properties of chemical substances from a sample of data. Thus, through the application of information technology, cheminformatics helps chemists organize and analyze known scientific data to assist in the development of novel compounds, materials, and processes. People who work in cheminformatics may concentrate on molecular modeling, chemical structure coding and searching, chemical data visualization, or a number of other areas of specialization. Indeed, the various computer graphics codes for chemical structures that let us both view and search chemical structures via computer were developed by cheminformaticians. 

Methods and tools used in cheminformatics include: 

*Quantitative Structure/Activity or Quantitative Structure/Property Relationships (QSAR, QSPR) 
*Genetic Algorithms 
*Statistical Tools (e.g., recursive pairing) 
*Data Analysis Tools 
*Visualization Techniques 
*Chemically-Aware Web Language (CML).
 
A sound knowledge of chemistry and excellent facility in computer science are required to be an effective practitioner in the cheminformatics field. Chemical and pharmaceutical companies are in great need of people with such skills. The curriculum for the graduate programs in Cheminformatics in the Indiana University School of Informatics educates students in the following major aspects of chemical informatics: 

*Information Acquisition: Methods used for generating and collecting data empirically (experimentation) or from theory (molecular simulation) 
*Information Management: Storage and retrieval of information 
*Information Use: Data analysis, correlation, and application to problems in the chemical and biochemical sciences.
 
'''Information Acquisition'''

Information acquisition is highly dependent on the computer today. With the integration of modern sensors into chemical instrumentation, the volume of data that can be generated is enormous. Future instrumentation will incorporate information from existing chemical databases, employ modeling techniques, and analyze experimental data as they are generated. Such &quot;smart instruments&quot; will significantly improve the ability of the user to make intelligent decisions about the course of an experiment while the data are being collected and analyzed. 

There now exist two complementary pathways for generating and collecting information in the chemical sciences: experimentation and computer simulation. Traditionally, the gathering of data from experiments was done manually, but with the development of computers small enough to be purchased by individual laboratories, the phrase &quot;computers in chemistry&quot; arose to describe their use. Several decades ago this expression meant interfacing a computer to an experiment like a spectrometer or a chromatograph and collecting the data in real time for storage and later manipulation. While this is still being done with microprocessors built into the instruments themselves, a more encompassing label for the wide range of chemical activities involving computers is '''computational chemistry'''. 

Computational chemistry seeks to predict quantitatively molecular and biomolecular structures, properties, and reactivity by computational methods alone. It uses modern chemical theory to predict the speed of unknown reactions and the synthetic sequences by which complex new molecules can be made most efficiently. Computational chemistry allows chemists to explore how things work at the atomic and molecular levels and to draw conclusions that are impossible to reach by experimentation alone. Thus, computational chemistry supplements experimentally derived data. 

One aspect of computational chemistry is '''molecular modeling'''. Molecular modeling involves the investigation of three-dimensional molecular structures using classical and quantum mechanical methods assisted by computer graphics. Other molecular modeling techniques include quantitative structure-property relationships, which finds applications in structure-based drug design, similarity searching, and molecular shape prediction. Molecular modeling techniques are utilized extensively in pharmaceutical research, especially to predict '''pharmacophores'''--the structural features of molecules required for particular biological activities. Molecular modeling is now used routinely to generate data concerning energetics, dynamics and other information at the molecular scale that is not amenable to experimentation. 

Recent advances in combinatorial synthesis and high throughput screening technologies now allow for preparation and analysis of hundreds of thousands of or even millions of molecules in a very short period of time. Combinatorial chemistry techniques grew out of several disciplines, including organic, medicinal, and physical chemistry, engineering and robotics, computational chemistry, informatics, and screening technology. Robotics as used in combinatorial chemistry provides the drug industry a powerful tool with which to screen millions of potential compounds in a fraction of the time it would have taken to evaluate even a few dozen compounds a decade ago. Now widely employed in the pharmaceutical area, combinatorial chemistry has also begun to find applications in materials science. Because so much information is being generated and collected from combinatorial technologies, there is a concomitant problem associated with storing and retrieving those data. That problem is now being addressed by those skilled in cheminformatics. 

'''Information Management'''

Many of the applications for storing and retrieving chemical data have grown out of the rapid developments in chemical structure coding and searching. The advances in structure-based applications have led to integrated chemical information systems--more and more of which have Web interfaces--and to specialized applications such as Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). The ability to search large secondary databases such as Chemical Abstracts or Medline easily and precisely and to move seamlessly back and forth between the original primary journal literature and the abstracting and indexing databases is one of the truly great achievements of modern cheminformatics research. 

Chemists have developed their own communication system (chemical nomenclature and structure systems) that adds a unique dimension to informatics. There is a confluence of activities in cheminformatics that is centered on the chemical structure (both 2-D and 3-D depictions). Two-dimensional chemical structural databases have evolved from traditional chemical structure diagrams into structure searching and substructure searching systems. In the late 1980s, attention turned to 3-D structure searching and representations of chemical structures in three dimensions. Techniques for the full description of the conformational space of flexible molecules and similarity searching techniques have also been developed. These are now being incorporated into chemical information storage and retrieval systems. 

'''Information Use'''

The computer has enabled chemists to analyze and correlate data from massive chemical and biochemical databanks, and when coupled with chemical visualization and modeling techniques, it is revolutionizing chemical research. Informatics techniques help create an integrated information environment in which all aspects of chemical research and development can be dealt with in a unified system. Not only can chemical structures be used as search keys in such systems, but also unknown properties and spectra can be predicted using cheminformatics tools and techniques that draw on the existing knowledge base of chemistry. Data mining has emerged as a significant factor in the reassessment of data collected over time in an organization. Chemists can now access decades of raw data stored in disparate formats and obtain useful results to build on the research that has taken place in past years. Tying together through Web Services many disparate sources of chemical and life sciences data and information into a usable and useful whole is one of the main activities of the [http://www.chembiogrid.org/index.html CICC] (Chemical Informatics and Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory) at Indiana University.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the increase in technology around the world, it is crucial to look at how we as educators can use technology-based equipment inside our classrooms. Now, more than ever, there is a surplus of gadgets that are easily and readily available. Technology makes our lives run smoothly and efficiently. Tasks that could take days or even weeks to accomplish are now feasible in a matter of minutes. Companies like DELL and Apple are no longer foreign to us. Each have made a household name of themselves and can be spotted virtually anywhere you go. Music can be enjoyed through MP3 players like the I-pod, Zune, Zen or Jukebox versions versus CD players or Casettes, which have become items of the past. The internet is another great resource tool, prevalent in today's society, that has made it increasingly easier for individuals to find out information and research fast. Computers, laptops and even phones have the capability to use the internet and sometimes surpass the amount of information found in books. As citizens living in the United States who are constantly busy we no longer find the motivation or need for going to a library to pursue finding resources and research for our papers. There is simply not enough time in our day and we continue to try to find the most sufficient means of getting this valuable information: through the internet. All we wish to know can be found within a webpage obtained from a few keystrokes and a couple clicks of the mouse. So why should this be any different from the way our education is being taught? Books and readings still provide ample information, but why not use the tools of technology to enhance the teaching of our education? We should be bringing all the available necessities education has to offer because then we know there is no cheating our students of their education. We, as future teachers, need to provide for our students' needs in any way possible and this includes giving them instruction provided by the technology they have grown up and come to know. It is time to welcome technology into our classrooms with open arms. We need to move forward in the way we present information and education because it's not going away anytime soon. One way we can introduce technology into the classroom without forfeiting learning in the process is through an Interactive Whiteboard. Specifically, the use of the SMART board inside the classroom increases students' knowledge and will ultimately prepare them for the future world we will be living in. This useful piece of technology is beneficial and amazing in more ways than one. Not only does it allow students to become engaged in the learning process in an entirely new way, it provides them with the opportunity to grow as individuals. Those who might initially be wary to contribute make significant gains in their participation when using the SMART Board. By exposing students to this piece of equipment, their knowledge and desire to learn about the ever-changing world of technology will flourish. All in all, the SMART board is an extremely worthwhile investment and piece of equipment to have inside every classroom nationwide.

To understand what a SMART board is we have to take a few steps back to explain the actual definition of one. Even before the idea of a SMART board came around, there were chalkboards and blackboards. A chalkboard is a hard surface usually made out of slate, that you use chalk to write on. The next board that came was called a whiteboard. A whiteboard is a glossy surface that uses a special kind of erasable marker. Both of these boards are still used today. However, this is where SMART boards come in. An overall definition of a SMART board is an interactive whiteboard. This means that the SMART board is electronically hooked up to a computer and then the computer screen is projected onto the white board through a projector. Once projected onto the screen, there are many different programs and objects you can use on the screen. You can touch the screen with your finger or use the provided pen to write on the board. To use a SMART board you must download the program onto your computer. SMART board is the innovative way to teach and to learn. Teachers are able to bring up fun active lesson plans, applications, and much more for students to learn. The students are then able to touch the screen and write or move the objects. There is so much use for a SMART board and it is constantly being improved and to ensure and enhance the most effective learning environment for students.

== History ==
Where did the SMART board come from? Who invented it? When was the board first introduced to the world? In this section, we will focus on the actual history and origin of the SMART board. This is crucial knowledge because it allows individuals to understand why the SMART board is a useful tool in the classroom and why it was even invented in the first place.

The SMART board was first introduced in 1991 by a company called SMART Technologies. This board was manufactured to serve as a large display screen in lecture halls, classrooms, and more. In short, it combined the benefits of a computer and a chalkboard/whiteboard in one. In 1992, a company by the name of Intel Corporation decided to explore this idea and went on to become an investor. At first, the idea of the SMART board did not receive positive reactions, but was able to slowly gain support and recognition as a useful technology. Today, more than 100,000 boards have been sold and distributed. Many educators find this interactive tool extremely beneficial because it allows students to become involved and engaged in the lesson. Due to the fact that the SMART Board is “touch-sensitive,” students can feel a sense of ownership and control when interacting with this piece of equipment.

Due to advances and demands in technology, there are several different variations of the SMART board. The earliest models are front projection boards, rear projection boards, in-wall rear projection boards, the SMART notebook, and other useful software. As technology progresses, even more new additions have been added to the board. These additions include the SMART Recorder, meeting productivity software, a wireless slate, the Senteo response system, SMART camera, and the 600i interactive system. On average, the SMART board is sold for $3000-$5000. It is evident that the board is constantly being revised in order to ensure maximum satisfaction and up-to-date technologies for all users.

== Issues and Problems ==
As with any technology, problems can occur when utilzing the SMART board and as educators, we must be prepared if the SMART board were to break down. Havre Public Schools in Montana has come up with the most common problems that can be found when using a SMART board and the possible solutions. The most common problems: are 

When writing with the stylus, it does not align to where you are writing on the board.

SMART board is not interactive, when writing on the board it does not work.

An image will not show on the actual board.

Care for the SMART board. How to properly care for it when there are fingerprints all over the board.

To help overcome these problems, there is a company available for assistance or several websites, such as the Havre Public Schools. It is necessary to ask for troubleshooting.
Another issue with the SMART board is it's effectiveness. Does it really make a difference in the classroom? As of today, there has not been usable research that either proves the benefits of a SMART board or disapproves the use of a SMART board. However, each year more and more classrooms are investing in a SMART board throughout the school. One of the biggest ways to prove that SMART boards can be effective is by having the educators receive proper training in the use of the SMART board. If a SMART board is placed in a classroom where a teacher has not received training, this can lead to unnecessary problems and become ineffective for students. At http://www.education.smarttech.com/ste/en-US/, you are able to receive training tutorials on how to use the SMART board and different applications. Also, by contacting your school super-attendant, it is possible to receive an in-service on how to use this board. By better informing educators on how to use these boards and by how integrating them effectively into the classroom, we will begin to see the problems and issues of the SMART boards decline.

== '''Advantages and Disadvantages'''&lt;br /&gt; ==
Advantages&lt;br /&gt;

The SMART board creates an interactive atmosphere in the classroom while also creating meaningful learning experiences. SMART boards can create a lot of hands-on activities for each and every student. These boards have the ability to create an alternate  learning atmosphere instead of being the typical one-way lecture, where only teachers lecture students. With a SMART board, students can interact during the actual lecture and go up to the smartboard to make any changes. They can modify the notes and be part of the actual lecture. SMART boards create a new experience in the classroom where there as there can be a lot of learning games that students can be part of.&lt;br /&gt;

Another great advantage with a SMART board is the fact that you are the one that can control the applications through the use of the touch board; you do not have to sit behind a desk. With the Smartboard you can go up to the board and pull out the touch keyboard and work from there instead of sitting behind the computer. You are in front of the classroom and are able to interact with the students while simultaneously editing the information.&lt;br /&gt;

There are countless virtual tours that you can take your classroom on through the use of a SMART board. Several museums have virtual tours on the web. Instead of spending the money on a field trip you can take your students on a fieldtrip in your own classroom! If you are teaching the students about the planets, there are available websites that can take you on a virtual tour of the planets. It is a great way to get students engaged into the learning activities. 
SMART boards are very large in size and this helps to get the students attention and remain focused. The fact that they can go up to the board and are able to click on the buttons and interact really grabs the student's attention. If there is reading time, you can put the book on the SMART board and students can read along with.&lt;br /&gt;

Another great feature that the SMART board contains are the four colored markers. Every time you lift a pen out of the slots, it specifically selects the color that you have chosen. The fact that you can write on the board while you have a page up on the screen is extraordinary. If you are learning about planets and wish to write the name of one of their moons in the pictures you are showing, you can do that just by lifting the marker and writing on the board. Once you are done, you can save your work in a work file and convert the handwriting into text. 

The eraser is another great feature the board has because with normal boards you have to erase everything by hand. With the SMART board, you can circle the area that you wish to erase and thenjust tap the middle of it and it’s gone! You can also highlight text on the SMART board, along with editing, sharing and emailing whatever you have written on your SMART board. &lt;br /&gt;

Disadvantages &lt;br /&gt;

One of the biggest problems that can be experienced with the SMART board is that it can be very touchy. If someone walks by it and bumps into it, you would have to orient it once again. In an elementary classroom students are always moving around and bumping into the SMAT board can be a daily occurance. Another disadvantage is that the lights create a shadow, making it difficult to read and view the board. It is also hard to see the images when you are in front of the board because of the shadows that it casts.  This might create an uncomfortable experience for some students and might discourage them for participating in the future.
Due to the fac that the SMART board is somewhat new to the classroom, there are not a lot of websites that you can really rely on. Also if a website is down, then it is necessary to find other sources. &lt;br /&gt;

You have to be somehow knowledgeable in technology because there are a wide variety of problems that can be encountered and if you do not know how to solve them or are not very technology savy, you can run into further problems. You would need to really prep for your lessons and try them out a couple of times before using them in the classroom just to ensure that you will not have future problems. 
If you are using a SMART board for the first time,writing on it can be very difficult. Due to the fact that the SMART board can be very touchy, it can be complicated to write large, lengthy paragraphs. It is very difficult to write neatly on a SMART board because you have to always write with the tip so that the writing is neat.&lt;br /&gt;

A big disadvantage is the cost of the SMART board. They can start at $3,079 and if your school does not have the proper funding, it can be difficult to acquire one. The bulbs for the projector can be expensive, costing around $300. You can buy a SMART board but you also need a projector to display the image and the cost of those run around $500 - $1000. That price includes software, connections cables, and a stand.
Also if you do not have a good wireless connection that is something that you might need to add just to eliminate cables. As previously mentioned, the SMART board is very touchy and if you run into the projector it gets out of alignment. That is why you may want to have a wireless connection. Then, you would not need to worry about having too many cables running around in a classroom. Every time the smartboard is out of alignment, it is necessary to realign your hardware.

== Future Direction ==
As for the future direction of this amazing and innovative technology, we believe it has the ability to drastically enhance each and every classroom around the world. Not only can the SMART board serve as an essential tool for an educator, but for all the students involved also. Although these boards can cost a substantial amount of money, the rewards reaped by students and educators alike are invaluable.

First and foremost, the SMART board is excellent in the fact that it greatly increases student interaction. In the past, student interaction was often limited by the lack of technology and other resources. By allowing students to engage with this piece of technology now and in the future, they are likely to become more interested and engaged in the overall learning process. This in turn, increases the likelihood that the students will retain the information discussed. In general, when students enjoy the information being presented, they are able to create meaningful connections between the information and their own lives and previously learned knowledge. In return, they are able to retain the new information much more efficiently.

Next, the SMART board is important for the future in that it integrates technology in the classroom, which is essential in today’s world. Technology has the ability to change both the educator’s and the student’s views on education and transform the education system as a whole. By integrating this tool in the education system, an abundance of positive benefits are possible. Generally, students enjoy utilizing and learning about technology and the SMART board is no exception. By allowing them ample opportunities to interact with this piece of technology, they will start to become more well-rounded and knowledgeable individuals. The knowledge gained from the SMART board will carry into the student’s future lives and careers.

Third, the SMART board has invaluable advantages to future students with special needs. Often, students with special needs require additional assistance in the classroom and this board can be extremely rewarding for both the educators and the students involved. It provides great visual aids, auditory cues, and hands-on activities for these types of students. Due to the fact that every student has an individual learning style with personal needs, the SMART board can meet many of these needs efficiently and successfully. The benefits associated with this board and students with special needs range from improved social skills to enhanced physical skills. These aspects are extraordinarily advantageous because in the past, students will special needs were not always able to experience the same opportunities as other students. Now, they can be fully included in the regular education classroom and partake in similar, if not the same, activities. This is a huge step and bonus for the future of special education.

Last but not least, the SMART board will benefit the future of education in that it helps to provide more meaningful learning experiences. While in the past, educators could only use paper-based and other such basic materials, they are now able to utilize a computer to educate their students. The SMART board allows students to visually see what the educator is discussing, whether it be a chart, a picture, or a word document due to the fact that it is directly connected to a computer. A computer provides countless resources, such as the internet, power points, word documents, clip art, and more. It is more than beneficial for students to be able to directly view and access these materials because it enables them to learn on a much grander scale.

By integrating technology in the classroom, such as with a SMART board, the future of education has great possibilities. As previously stated, a SMART board increases student interaction, incorporates technology in the classroom setting, benefits students with special needs, and provides meaningful learning experiences for all students. These, among numerous others, are reasons why the incorporation of the SMART board is necessary for the future of our education system. Utilizing the SMART board will open the door to endless possibilities and hopefully lead to the incorporation of even more technology, which is beyond beneficial and worthwhile.

== Conclusion ==
Overall, the SMART board is an excellent piece of technology for every classroom. The SMART website and software comes packed with course material. It is able to benefit all learning types; whether a student is more hands-on or visual, performs at a slower level or has special needs. There is no exclusion with the use of a SMART Board. Technology integrated into this interactive whiteboard helps students grasp the concept being taught because students are now, more than ever, visual learners. They require a certain amount of direct engagement during the lesson as well as watching the educator demonstrate a hands-on activity, rather than simply hearing that teacher lecture about the course material. With the SMART course material you can find a surplus of activities geared towards many subject areas including: Art, Language Arts, Reading, Geography, Science, Social Studies, Math, Healthy, Physical Education, History, Foreign Language, Music and more! Unique tools have made the SMART Board compatible when working with children whose first language is not English. In fact, specific software and downloadable templates have been posted to the SMART Tech website for ESL activities. In addition, students who require more teaching time and are special needs have a segment under Special Education. Creativity and critical thinking are also enhanced and continue to strengthen throughout each lesson utilizing the board. What makes working with the SMART Board exciting is the amount of interaction. Within this effective classroom tool are exciting colors and hands-on experiences for both the teacher and the students. Students feel like they have become part of the learning experience as well as the teaching experience when they are up at the SMART board. For students the SMART Board is an object perceived as fun!Though mastery of the SMART board may take practice and the cost may be pricey, it is an extraordinary investment that can help turn any classroom into a positive learning experience and environment. It is more than a piece of equipment; it is a serious educational enhancer and great investment for any classroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ADME is the acronym commonly used in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics used to reference the four basic stages of a drug/medicine's life inside the human's body: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion. 

==Absorption==
Absorption is the transfer of a drug into the blood after it is released from its dosage formulation. The body can absorb drugs in many ways, such as oral (swallowing an tylenol tablet), intramuscular (getting a flu shot in an arm muscle), subcutaneous (injecting insulin just under the skin), intravenous (receiving chemotherapy through a vein), or transdermal (wearing a skin patch). The most common way is through oral administration. Once the drug has been absorbed it gets shuttled by a special blood vessel where it enters from the digestive tract to the liver, and this is where a large amount of the drug may be destroyed by metabolic enzymes (often called &quot;first-pass effect.&quot; One of the most important factors affecting oral drug absorption is the gastric emptying time. The gastric emptying time is the time a drug will stay in the stomach before it is emptied into the small intestine. This time affects a drug's action because most drugs are absorbed in the intestine. Stomach acid can degrade many drugs before they reach the absorption stage. Once a drug leaves the stomach without being destroyed, its rate of movement through the intestines affects its current absorption. If the drug moves through the intestines slowly, more of the drug will be absorbed since it is in contact with the intestinal membrane for a long time. On the other hand, fast movement through the intestines might cause a drug to not be fully absorbed. In addition, bile salts and enzymes from the intestinal tract also affect the absorption of a drug. Bile salts improve the absorption of some hydrophobic drugs. However, enzymes decrease the absorption of drugs by destroying the drugs as they pass through.

[[File:Absorption.pdf|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]

==Distribution==
Distribution is the movement of a drug inside the body once the drug has reached the blood. Blood carries the drug throughout the body and also to its sites of action. First, distribution is affected by the blood flow rates to certain organs. When an organ has a high blood flow rate such as in the heart, liver, and kidneys, the drug is distributed quickly. However, organs with slow blood flow rates like the muscle, fat, and skin, cause distribution to be much slower. Moreover, the permeability of tissue membranes to a drug is also extremely important. Small drug molecules and hydrophobic drugs will diffuse through tissue membranes easily. Also, there are some tissue membranes that have specialized transport mechanisms that assist penetration. However, there are some tissue membranes that are highly selective in allowing drugs to penetrate through. For example, the blood-brain barrier limits drug access to the brain. Lastly, protein binding can affect distribution as well. Most drugs bind to proteins in the blood plasma, forming what is called a complex. Because these complexes are large, it prevents the drug from entering its sites. So, only free or unbound drugs can move through the tissue membranes. Furthermore, some drugs with a stronger binding capacity can displace a weaker bound drug from a protein, making the weakly bound drug not bound anymore.

==Metabolism==
Drug metabolism refers to the body's way of processing drugs. This drug that is being transformed inside the body is called a metabolite. Most metabolites are inactive molecules that are excreted but some are active and produce effects in a human until they are further metabolized or excreted. The liver is the primary site of drug metabolism. The enzymes found inside the liver interact with drugs and change them into metabolites. CYP3A4 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme in the intestines that increases or alters blood levels of certain medications in people. CYP450 is a cytochrome enyzme that processes essential molecules such as hormones and vitamins a well as metabolize hundreds of prescribed medicines and natural substances. Some drugs allow the liver to increase its enzyme activity, allowing the drug to result in greater metabolism. So, some doses of drugs must be larger to produce the same therapeutic effects. However, some drugs decrease enzyme activity. In this situation, smaller doses of the drug are needed to avoid toxicity. Also, the liver may secrete drugs into the bile that is stored in the gallbladder. Any drugs or metabolites in the bile may be reabsorbed or eliminated within the feces. If the drugs are reabsorbed back into the blood, it is called enterohepatic cycling.

==Excretion==
Most drugs and their metabolites are excreted by the kidneys and come out of the body through urine. Some drugs are not easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and so will be excreted in the feces rather than the urine. Excretion can also happen through the bile and some drugs are removed through the lungs in the expired breath. But, most drugs are excreted through the kidneys, which filters the blood and removes waste materials from the blood. Some of the plasma water is filtered from the blood into the nephron tubule in a process called glomerular filtration. This filtered water may have waster drugs from other parts of the body. As the water continues to move across the body, other waste drugs can be secreted into the fluid. While this is occurring, some drugs can be reabsorbed back into the blood through urinary reabsorption. After all of this happens, the final fluids are excreted from the body as urine. The rate of urinary excretion is much faster than that of fecal excretion. Drugs excreted through the urine take a couple of hours while drugs excreted through the feces take a couple of days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Prions=

==Prion Disease==
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs or prion diseases) are a rare group of deadly neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and other mammals. TSEs are protein misfolding diseases that encompass the aggregation of abnormally accumulated form of the normal host prion protein. TSEs are unique in that they are transmissible. Characteristics of TSEs include that they replicate, are capable of selective evolution (can evolve drug resistance), have various strains of infectious agent that are related to unique phenotypes in vivo, and demonstrate strong species specificities; the same characteristic of many viral and bacterial pathogens.

[[File:Prion subdomain-colored sec structure.png|thumb|Prion subdomain-Residues 125-228 are shown]]

There are 3 classes of TSE diseases in humans:

# Sporadic – the most common form of TSE (e.g. Creutzfeldt Jakob disease)
# Heritable – in which TSE is mutation within the prion protein
# Acquired – in which TSE is a result of ingestion or inoculation of TSE contaminated materials.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Histology bse.jpg|Microscopic &quot;holes&quot; are characteristic in prion-affected tissue sections, causing the tissue to develop a &quot;spongy&quot; architecture.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The Prion Hypothesis==
Typical infectious agents use nucleic acids to spread and propagate, evident in bacteria and viruses. The prion hypothesis states simply that the specific diseases detailed above are solely caused by proteins, a sentiment that went against common knowledge at the time of its proposal. At first, it was thought that prions were a side-effect of some other type of infection. This theory does not hold up, however. Experimental evidence since the concept of prion-induced disease was proposed has fallen in favor of this theory, and the effects of prion replication have been witnessed in the lab. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


==History of Prions in Science==

Prions and their infectious nature were first discovered in 1937 when scrapie was accidentally transferred to a sheep while attempting a viral inoculation.  In later experiments, scrapie was purposefully transmitted to sheep and then mice to determine the nature of this molecule.  Cannibalism in New Guinea was the source of infection by kuru in humans and in 1966 this disease was demonstrated to be transmissible to monkeys&lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  At this point, science was beginning to understand that the infectious nature of prions was different from viral or microbial infection.  More recently, outbreaks of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and the emerging variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that was linked to consumption of infected meat were shown to be caused by prions.  

Historically, studies of prions first determined that the method of infection was novel, and then determined that it was due to a misfolding of the protein chain.  The first experiments destroyed nucleic acids with UV and ionizing radiation and found the infectious agent still present&lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Then, the smallest molecular weight particles that were still infectious were determined to be on the order of protein weight.  

Later on, protease-resistant prion protein (PrP) concentration was found to be proportional to the infectivity.  Additionally, agents that destroyed protein structure were employed, reducing the infectivity of the PrP.  PrP was found to be present in a normally functioning brain, demonstrating that the protein could exist both as a normal and as a malfunctioning protein&lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Recently, studies have shown that infectious and non infectious proteins could be mixed and the infectious agent would propagate among non infectious molecules.  This demonstrates that the protein folding error can propagate indefinitely.

=Prion Replication=

==Conversion of PrP isoforms is the cause of Prion Disease==
TSE is a protein misfolding disease in that disease occurs due to conformational changes in host prion protein (PrP). PrP is a mammalian glycoprotein, 208 amino acids long. When the PrP becomes a TSE, in a process known as pathogenesis, a protease sensitive form of PrP (PrP-sen) refolds into PrP-res (a protease- resistant form of prion protein). PrP-res and PrP-sen have the same primary sequence but different secondary structures, with the PrP-sen featuring more alpha-helices. (In other words, PrP-res and PrP-sen are isoforms) PrP-res is the primary component of TSE. Hence it is imperative to research how the PrP-sen to PrP-res conversion occurs, in order to inhibit the formation of the PrP-res form.

[[File:Prion Replication.png|400px|thumb|PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; induces a conformational change in PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;]]
Current knowledge of the PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; to PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; conversion can be generalized into a two-step mechanism:

'''1)''' Ordered aggregates of pre-cursor “seed” PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; bind to PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''2)''' PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; experiences some conformational change that results in the propagation into more PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;. The mechanism of this step is largely a mystery. The converted PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; is added to the polymer, which eventually fragments and causes more PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; to be converted. This fragmentation is thought to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification===
In 2001, a process for laboratory replication of prions was developed. This process, known as Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplication (PMCA), produces prions ''in-vitro'' which mimic prions replicated normally ''in-vivo''. This process relies on the idea that prions are auto-catalytic, and can reproduce indefinitely given the correct surroundings. This technique has proven invaluable in the study of prions and the testing of the prion hypothesis. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-Factors==

One area that is still unclear to scientists is the importance of co-factors in the replication process of prions. While it is now understood that there are outside factors that influence the success and rate of prion replication, these co-factors have not been fully discerned and represent an area for future research. 

===Transgenic Mice and Hamsters===

Evidence for the role of co-factors in prion replication has come from various studies performed on animal subjects. In a study done on transgenic mice, there was found to be some sort of factor affecting prion protein expression. This was termed &quot;protein X&quot;, though the identity of the factor specifically as a protein was never discerned. &lt;ref&gt;Telling GC, et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867495902368 “Prion propagation in mice expressing human and chimeric PrP transgenes implicates the interaction of cellular PrP with another protein.”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on 20 November, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. In a separate study performed on hamster PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;. When isolated and purified, hamster PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; could not be converted when mixed with PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;. When brain homogenate was introduced to the sample, the prion conversion occurred, indicating that there was something in the homogenate that contributed to the conversion, whether as a catalyst or as an integral factor. Further testing showed that  that RNA in hamsters acted as a catalyst for prion replication, but not in mice. Specifically how it does this is not clear, but there is a possibility that it helps to stabilize the comformation of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; that is produced. The fact that it does not work on all mammals leads to the possibility of multiple co-factors, or species/organ specific ones.

===Types of Co-Factors===

Although the importance of co-factors is not fully understood, the ways in which co-factors might affect the conversion of prions fall into 5 categories. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Genetic Information|| It is possible that there are certain co-factors that contribute to prion replication by helping to determine how these proteins fold. One study that supports this was performed on mice by injecting prions into different types of cells. In each cell, prion replication led to different prion strains, which could be a result of different co-factors in each cell type. 
&lt;ref&gt;Weissmann C. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19618334 &quot;Thoughts on mammalian prion strains.&quot;], '[PubMed]', 2009. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Catalytic|| Certain co-factors might catalyze the PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; to PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; conversion by attaching to PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; and partially unfolding it. This would make it easier for PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; to induce a misfolding pattern on the protein, resulting in the conversion. This type of co-factor has been examined in the lab in ''vitro''.
|-
| Conformational Stabilization|| Some co-factors might aid in the stabilization of the new prion conformation. Examples of these include nucleic acids, proteins, metal ions, and other things. Many of these are charged species that can bind to the prion and help form a more compact structure. 
|-
| Fragmentation|| PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; polymers often fragment, which greatly speeds up the conversion of PrP&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; to PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;. Some co-factors may help in this fragmentation process, which creates new seeds and is essential to the replication process. An example of this is found in yeast, which rely on protein 104 (Hsp104). Removing this protein stops prion replication from occuring. 
|-
| Biological Stabilization|| For successful prion replication to occur, prions must first survive in the biological medium. Certain biological resistance, such as microglia cells which can perform phagocytosis, can inhibit their spread. A co-factor that reduces the ability of microglia to destroy these prions would allow them to replicate, and might prove to be essential. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;Soto, Claudio [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130657 &quot;Prion Hypothesis: The end of the Controversy?&quot;], '[PubMed]', 2010. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Prion Structure=

==Primary and Secondary Structure play crucial role in the initial Rate-limiting step==

Primary and secondary structural components within at amino acids 108-189 of the PrP-sen proved to be important for conversion, as determined by NMR structure and in vivo studies. PrP-sen at the critical residues (108-189) include most of the folded domain including beta strands, alpha-helices, and most critical, the loops and turns. Slight variation with turns and loops are particularly noteworthy, as it has been determined that the loops are involved in the intermolecular interactions between PrP-sen and PrP-res.

==Lack of Structural Understanding of PrP-res==
While there is extensive knowledge of the PrP-sen tertiary structure, the same cannot be said for PrP-res. Part of the reason as to why there isn’t extensive knowledge regarding the mechanistic pathway of the conversion into PrP-res is that the PrP-res structure is unknown, as it has not been purified sufficiently for high-resolution structural studies. Because high-resolution techniques cannot be used, focus on ascertaining the structure of PrP-res has been confined to using lower resolution techniques such as electron microscopy to determine ultrastructure and the secondary structure of PrP-res.

=Further Understanding=

==Yeast Prions==

One interesting case of prions can be found in yeast. While they are normally observed in mammals, it was found that a particular protein in yeast (Ure2) behaves and reproduces in the way a typical prion does. However, instead of killing its host cell it instead reproduces by inducing conformational change in other proteins and is inherited through cellular division. This special case has led to the discovery of other prions in fungus which also exhibit non-lethal behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prion Hypothesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Good&quot; Prions?==
[[File:MAVS Protein.jpg|300px|thumb|MAVS protein conformational change as a result of viral activity. ]]

As found in the example of yeast prions, these misfolded proteins are not all inherently malicious and harmful to organic life. In one study conducted by scientists in UT Southwestern, it was found that certain prion-like proteins found within the body may help in the immune system. These mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins (MAVS) were found to be in mitochondrial membranes, and actively defend them against infection. It was found that under threat of viral infection, MAVS proteins misfold and aggregate on the surface of the mitochondria, effectively shielding the organelle from attack. This deliberate misfolding and aggregation is interesting because it does not reflect the malicious and uncontrollable misfolding often caused by prions in cases such as Cretzfeldt-Jakob Disease and Bovine Spongify Esophagus. While the sequential activation of the system by the initial viral detection can be complex, the aggregation of MAVS proteins actually occurred quickly. &lt;ref&gt;Hou, Fajian et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411007161 &quot;MAVS Forms Functional Prion-like Aggregates to Activate and Propagate Antiviral Innate Immune Response&quot;], '[Cell]', 2011. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;



==Similarity of PrP-res to Amyloid Fibril==
The way PrP-res amplifies itself is highly similar to the way in which amyloid fibrils grow through seeded polymerization from a reservoir of precursor protein. Therefore amyloid fibril offers insight for which to hypothesize the PrP-res growth mechanism. 

Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates that harbor specific structural traits. The structure of amyloid fibrils features a characteristic cross-beta folding pattern in which beta-strands align to form sheets that are perpendicular to the fibril axis while hydrogen bonds between strands is parallel to the fibril axis. While this cross-beta quaternary structure is known in amyloids, a detailed structure of this scope has not been determined for PrP, which is by far, a much larger protein. 

Like amyloid fibrils, PrP can be induced to form amyloid-like fibrils. A particularly significant model of this was that of the recombinant peptide, PrP23-144. (Recombinant peptide is the peptide encoded from its corresponding recombinant DNA). The PrP23-144 proved to have a high degree of conformational plasticity (ability to change conformation in various possible ways) and can be induced to form a wide range of fibril amino acids. That the PrP23-144 in this model could be differentiated into a wide range of conformational possibilities is an indication that the PrP isoform conversion is highly dependent on the structural compatibility between PrP-sen to PrP- res (for example, the aforementioned variations in turns and loops). Choice of solvent also plays a role in that certain structural elements are affected by electrostatic or hydrophilic effects.


==Treatment==

As a result of the limited knowledge scientists have on prions, there is currently no full-proof method of treatment for those diagnosed with a prion related disease. One possibility of prion removal is through microglia and phagocytosis. It has also been found that lichens posses the ability to break down prions. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Christopher J. et al [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0019836 &quot;Degradation of the Disease-Associated Prion Protein by a Serine Protease from Lichens&quot;], '[PLOS]', 2011. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many avenues of research possible, there is no clinical solution for those suffering from a prion related disease. 


===Detection===
[[FILE:SOFIA platform.jpg|thumbnail|left|Prototype SOFIA Platform]]

There has been research in the past decade that has helped to identify PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in the blood. Up until this point, there has been no reliable way to identify these misfolded proteins in brain tissue. Employing a new method known as SOFIA (surround optical fibre immunoassay), scientists have been able to identify the presence of prions in brain tissue at high precision (one part in one hundred thousand million). First, the sample with PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; is amplified and fluorescently labeled using an antibody. It is then put through a device that surrounds it with optical fibers that detect emitted light. A laser is used to excite the dye, and the emission from the sample is picked up by the detector. 


This method was tested on sheep that were previously thought to be healthy, but eventually developed prion disease. Samples of their blood before they exhibited symptoms were analyzed, and it was found that the presence of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; could be detected very early on. While this method does not cure or remove any of the problems, it can be used to quarantine and greatly reduce the risk of these prions spreading. &lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, R., Chang, B., Gray, P., Piltch, M., Bulgin, M.S., Sorensen-Melson, S. &amp; Miller, M.W [https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf &quot;Detecting Prions in Blood&quot;], '[Microbiology Today]', 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Equilibrium may be defined as lack of change, or a static condition. In thermodynamics, equilibrium not only implies the lack of change, it also refers to the absence of any tendency toward change on a macroscopic scale.

&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt;==Relationship between Equilibrium, Driving Force, and Resistance in a System==

A system of interest at equilibrium exists if and only if there is no net change in the surrounding conditions. In this case, the driving force can be viewed as negligible also since the absence of any tendency toward change also indicates the absence of any driving force. Thus, all forces are said to be in balance when equilibrium exists in a system. One thing that needs to be pointed out here is that whether a change actually occurs in a system not at equilibrium depends on two factors: the resistance as well as the driving force of the system.

==Equilibrium, Free Energy, and Reaction Direction==
Thermodynamic equilibrium refes to a condition in which equilibrium exists with respect to P, T, and concentration. Equilibrium is established with respect to a given variable only if that variable does not change with time, and if it has the same value in all parts of the system and surroundings. The equilibrium with respect to concentration exists only if transport of all species across the boundary in both directions is possible. If the boundary is a movable wall that is not permeable to all species. 
The sign of free Energy (ΔG) can determine the direction of a spontaneous reaction. In addition, one can determine whether the reaction will proceed to the right or the left based on the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K). As a result, Silberberg states that 
 
If Q &lt; K or Q/K &lt;1 , then the reaction will head to the right

If Q &gt; K or Q/K &gt;1 , then the reaction will head to the left

If Q = K or Q/K =1 , then the reaction will be at equilibrium. 

As a result, the equation that combines the equilibrium constant, free energy, and reaction quotient is 
ΔG= RT ln (Q/K)

==Different Driving Forces Produce Different Kinds of Changes==

Many kinds of changes might be encountered in a system; these different changes are caused by different driving forces. Driving forces may be classified by their physical properties, which include pressure, temperature, concentration, gradients in chemical potential, and so on. 

For example, imbalance of mechanical forces, such as the pressure gradient on a piston, will tend to cause energy transfer in the form of work. Gradients in chemical potentials tend to cause substances to be transferred from one phase to another; temperature differences tend to cause the flow of heat in or out of the system. Nevertheless, the final results of the above listed tendencies are the same--equilibrium will be achieved in a system.

==Effects of Chemical Reactions on Thermodynamic Equilibrium==

In most of the applications of thermodynamics, the effects of chemical reactions are usually ignored. Since a system may stay in a long-term equilibrium if a chemical reaction is not initiated, it is convenient to not consider the effects that a chemical reaction might bring about to the system. Furthermore, equilibrium is mostly likely to be reached after a chemical reaction is carried out in most thermodynamic cases. Therefore, a purely physical process may be analyzed without regard to possible chemical reactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation==
You want to play music available in MusicXML format on an Arduino.

==Approach==
Fetch the Music XML file (either plain XML or compressed) and transform one monophic part to code to be included in an Arduino sketch. 

==Script==
&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
(: ~
 : convert a monotonic part in a MusicXML score to an Arduino code fragment suitable to include in a sketch 
 :
 :@param uri - the uri of the MusicXML file
 :@param part - the id of the part to be converted to midi notes
 :@return text containing Arduino statements to :
 :     set the tempo, 
 :     define the array of midi notes a
 :     define a parallel array of note durations in beats

Shouldn't we define sin, cos and tan before we get here?--[[User:Wisden|Wisden]] ([[User talk:Wisden|talk]]) 10:34, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:No.  We're getting the students familiar with the functions first.  They have it as buttons on their calculators.  This plotting exercise is really crucial and needs to come in early.  See [[Trigonometry/Teachers_Notes/About_This_Book]].  The soh-cah-toa 'definition' is inferior on many accounts, (limit to 90 degrees; loses sight of fact that this is about triangles with hypotenuse of length one).  

:A teacher who does not like this approach can tell the students to read the pages in a different order, or the teacher can use the more conventional K-12 trig book instead.  Part of the motivation for this trig book is to question conventional ways of teaching, using insight that comes from having used trig for real.

=== Bay Psalm Book ===
In 1640, ''The whole Booke of Psalms Faithfully Translated into English Metre,'' commonly known as the ''Bay Psalm Book'' was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It was the first book written in the new world.  A psalter is a book of psalms.  The ''Bay Psalm Book'' was the first metrical English translation of the psalms.  The book was in use for nearly a century and numerous editions of the book were produced.  There are still eleven known copies of the original book in existence, quartered throughout various libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Jean Americans Musical Landscape, Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism During the 16th and 18th Centuries ===
During the 16th and 18th centuries, European countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, France, England, and Poland had a large population of Jews. Except, Western Europe was much different than other parts of Europe, like Poland. In parts of Western Europe, Jews were extremely prosperous and were enhancing the economy, but in Poland, it was a different story, Jews were earning a meager pay and were denied equal rights. Western Jews were given the same rights as any other European. Jews at the time in Poland were also being poorly educated. Also, during the 17th century, since Amsterdam  allowed Jews to equally participate in trade, their economy flourished. Amsterdam was trading diamonds and Jews grew an expertise for that area by being able to trade raw diamonds, as well as cutting and polishing these precious stones. Another area where they allowed Jews to have equal rights was the Netherlands. Jew’s came to the Netherlands and were able to become doctors, writers, scientists, and lawyers. During the 16th century, both the Jewish community and the Dutch community prospered (Charing pg. 20). Charing, Douglas. Judaism. New York, NY: DK Pub., 2003. Print.

=== Women's History of the Period ===
==== Ann Hutchinson ====
Ann Hutchinson was a pioneer settler in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. She was also an unofficial minister of a dissent church (Christians who broke away from the Church of England) discussion group. The Bible studies that Ann held appealed to both men and women. Her own interpretations of the sermons caused much controversy. By 1637 Ann was brought to a civil trial By the General Court of Massachusetts on the charge of &quot;traducing the ministers&quot;. She was found guilty and was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

===Education===
During the Middle Ages Western society and education were heavily shaped by Christianity, particularly the Roman Catholic Church. The Church operated monastery schools at the elementary level. Schools in monasteries and cathedrals offered secondary education. Much of the teaching in these schools was directed at learning Latin, the old Roman language used by the church in its ceremonies and teachings. The church provided some limited opportunities for the education of women in religious communities or convents. Convents had libraries and schools to help prepare nuns to follow the religious rules of their communities. Merchant and craft guilds also maintained some schools that provided basic education and training in specific crafts. Knights received training in military tactics and the code of chivalry. 
As in the Greek and Roman eras, only a minority of people went to school during the medieval period. Schools were attended primarily by persons planning to enter religious life such as priests, monks, or nuns. The vast majority of people were serfs who served as agricultural workers on the estates of feudal lords. The serfs, who did not attend school, were generally illiterate. 

In the 11th century medieval scholars developed Scholasticism, a philosophical 
and educational movement that used both human reason and revelations from the Bible 
Scholasticism, philosophic and theological movement that attempted to use natural 
human reason, in particular, the philosophy and science of Aristotle, to understand the supernatural content of Christian revelation. It was dominant in the medieval Christian schools and universities of Europe from about the middle of the 11th century to about the middle of the 15th century. The ultimate ideal of the movement was to integrate into an ordered system both the natural wisdom of Greece and Rome and the religious wisdom of Christianity. 
Formal education was unusual in the Middle Ages, although by the fifteenth century there were schooling options to prepare a child for his future. Some cities such as London had schools that children of both genders attended during the day. Here they learned to read and write a skill that became a prerequisite for acceptance as an apprentice in many Guilds. 

A small percentage of peasant children managed to attend school in order to learn how to read and write and understand basic math; this usually took place at a monastery. For this education, their parents had to pay the lord a fine. 
Noble girls, and on occasion boys were sometimes sent to live in nunneries in order to receive basic schooling. Nuns would teach them to read (and possibly to write) and make sure they knew their prayers. Girls were very likely taught spinning and needlework and other domestic skills to prepare them for marriage. Occasionally such students would become nuns themselves.

=== Pollution ===

Before 1492 one of the most common forms of pollution was human and animal waste being tossed into the streets. The reason this was such a problem is because it spread bacteria and attracted rats and fleas that spread disease. Another form of pollution was global warming that was caused from the large amount of fires that were being used throughout Europe, causing the smoke to spew into the atmosphere. Soil pollution was also common because when armies were defeated they would contaminate the soil so that the enemy couldn’t use it to grow their own food. This not only hurt the people during the time period, but for the future generations. What also created a lot of pollution up to 1492 was lack of knowledge. People didn’t know that pollution was unhealthy and therefore did not care about it. 

From 1492 to 1690 the story hadn’t changed much. Except for the fact that now there was a significant increase in water pollution due to Christopher Columbus and the exploration of the America’s. An example of this would be the crew members tossing waste and unnecessary items overboard into the water hurting the Ocean’s eco-systems. Also, the many sea battles that occurred caused more pollution when the ships would sink and the waste that was on the ships would damage the ocean floor. Between these time periods there was also a lot of technological advancement (especially during the renaissance), and with new technology, usually comes different forms of pollution to go along with it. An example of this would be the printing press that was developed during the renaissance by Gutenberg around 1440. The printing press did revolutionize how people were able to access learning material. But, because of the increase demand for books, came the increase demand for paper. At this time they used both cloth and paper for the printing press. But, because of the increase demand for paper they started cutting down more trees for the paper. In doing so, they damaged the surrounding woodland because they didn’t know how to re-plant trees so that nature could recover. They also needed the wood for the actual printing presses themselves. There were also improvements on previous inventions that created more pollution such as the blast furnace. What this did was shoot more greenhouse gases into the air damaging the ozone. This was essential for metallurgy though which provided the people with their tools and weapons. 

Another common form of pollution during this time period was mining. Now mining was an important part of the economy during this time period because it provided jobs and precious metals. But it was a very crude form of mining and was not the most eco-friendly. At first they just used open pit mining that extracted ore from shallow depths as oppose to digging deep mine shafts which became more popular later on. Then in 1627 they started using black powder to start blasting rock to create ore veins in the Earth which was a lot faster than fire setting. This was a problem because when you blast holes into the Earth it leaves scars on the Earth’s crust that are hard to recover from. The reason this was a problem is because not only did this damage the interior of the Earth, but it also created more air pollution as well. Plus, when the miners were down in the shafts they were breathing heavily polluted air from the black powder and soot which caused them to become sick easily and die younger than they should have. 

Probably the most significant form of pollution was within the cities that the people lived in. Major cities Europe such as London, Paris, and Rome are good examples of cities with poor hygiene. Many of these cities and towns did not have toilets, garbage disposals, or sewage systems&lt;ref&gt;Breaking Away from the Textbook: Prehistory to 1600 By Ron H. Pahl&lt;/ref&gt;. What this did was create ample opportunities for people to catch diseases and spread them amongst each other at a rapidly dangerous pace. The people would also dump their waste and garbage into their major water supply (if they had one) which would contaminate it and make people extremely sick. What this also did was poison the water supply, damaging whatever wild life was in the water. Along with all of this pollution came rats and fleas who were the disease carriers. An example of this would be the black plague. Rats that were on ships would travel from city to city spreading the disease which resulted in one third of Europe’s population being depleted&lt;ref&gt;2.	The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages By Jean Gimpel &lt;/ref&gt;. 

A kind of smaller form of pollution was people’s own personal hygiene. During this time period, the average person would be lucky to bathe once a month. What this did was make people more susceptible to bacteria and sickness and all the other pollution around them. Not only did their personal hygiene affect the individuals and the others around them, but the environment as well. Since the people didn’t know how to take care of themselves, they didn’t know how to take care of the environment that surrounded them. 

Blast furnaces were also a big polluter again using coal as a catalyst. Carbon monoxide would be emitted heavily from these devices. These devices would have been around in the 1600s way before the industrial age and it proves that pollution has been around for a long time. Chemicals were also invented in 1791 to create glass vessels and other things cheaper and more effectively. Such chemicals included sulphuric acid which can be harmful to humans. Many things invented in these time periods were to boost the speed in which goods were created and to line the pockets of the inventors and factory owners. What cost was this to human lives then and now, most cases prove to be disastrous to people from ingesting air, land and water pollutants from emissions from factories and chemicals spilled into water and land.

== May I eliminate sections? ==

You have two sections on the Vikings, in the previous chapter and here. You have two sections on Columbus, in the previous chapter and here. I'd like to eliminate this chapter's section on Vikings, putting the pertinent information into the previous chapter, and only discuss Columbus in this chapter. The Vikings belong to a previous era than Columbus. The latter's explorations, as vile as they may be, exemplify the national interest in discovery, rather than expanding of _ethos_ or of city.

:I would say go ahead and make your changes.  This page and others in the book haven't been edited by other users for some time so feel free to make changes as you see fit.  Explain any changes in the Edit Summary just so others can see what you are doing.  Of course in the future somebody may well want to add the sections back but I can't see why given your explanations above.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:27, 12 April 2014 (UTC)

== French Catholic missionaries ==

I feel there needs to be a mention of French Catholic missionaries among the Indians, even if it is only parenthetical. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 14:13, 24 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The mythology of pre-Christian Ireland did not entirely survive the conversion to Christianity, but much of it was preserved, shorn of its religious meanings, in medieval Irish literature, which represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branch and the Historical Cycle. There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles. Additionally, there are a small number of 
recorded folk tales that, while not strictly mythological, feature personages from one or more of these nine cycles.

==The sources==

The three main manuscript sources for Irish mythology are the late 11th/early 12th century Lebor na hUidre which is in the library of the Royal Irish Academy, the early 12th century Book of Leinster in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, and the Rawlinson manuscript B 502 (Rawl.), housed in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Despite the dates of these sources, most of the material they contain predates their composition. The earliest of the prose can be dated on linguistic grounds to the 9th century, and some of the verse may be as old as the 6th century.
Other important sources include a group of four manuscripts originating in the west of Ireland in the late 14th or early 15th century: The Yellow Book of Lecan, The Great Book of Lecan, The Book of Hy Many[1], and The Book of Ballymote. The first of these contains part of the earliest known version of the Táin Bó Cúailnge (&quot;The Driving-off of Cattle of Cooley&quot;) and is housed in Trinity College. The other three are in the Royal Academy. Other 15th century manuscripts, such as The Book of Fermoy also contain interesting materials, as do such later syncretic works such as Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn (The History of Ireland) (ca. 1640), particularly as these later compilers and writers may have had access to manuscript sources that have since disappeared.
When using these sources, it is, as always, important to question the impact of the circumstances in which they were produced. Most of the manuscripts were created by Christian monks, who may well have been torn between the desire to record their native culture and their religious hostility to pagan beliefs resulting in some of the gods being euhemerized. Many of the later sources may also have formed part of a propaganda effort designed to create a history for the people of Ireland that could bear comparison with the mythological descent of their British invaders from the founders of Rome that was promulgated by Geoffrey of Monmouth and others. There was also a tendency to rework Irish genealogies to fit into the known schema of Greek or Biblical genealogy.
It was once unquestioned that medieval Irish literature preserved truly ancient traditions in a form virtually unchanged through centuries of oral tradition back to the ancient Celts of Europe. Kenneth Jackson famously described the Ulster Cycle as a &quot;window on the Iron Age&quot;, and Garret Olmsted has attempted to draw parallels between Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulster Cycle epic, and the iconography of the Gundestrup Cauldron. However, this &quot;nativist&quot; position has been challenged by &quot;revisionist&quot; scholars who believe that much of it was created in Christian times in deliberate imitation of the epics of classical literature that came with Latin learning. The revisionists would indicate passages apparently influenced by the Iliad in Táin Bó Cuailnge, and the existence of Togail Troí, an Irish adaptation of Dares Phrygius' De excidio Troiae historia, found in the Book of Leinster, and note that the material culture of the stories Mythological cycle

==Mythological cycle==
The Mythological Cycle, comprising stories of the former gods and origins of the Irish, is the least well preserved of the four cycles. The most important sources are the Metrical Dindshenchas or Lore of Places and the Lebor Gabála Érenn or Book of Invasions. Other manuscripts preserve such mythological tales as The Dream of Aengus, The Wooing Of Étain and Cath Maige Tuireadh, The (second) Battle of Magh Tuireadh. One of the best known of all Irish stories, Oidheadh Clainne Lir, or The Tragedy of the Children of Lir, is also part of this cycle.
Lebor Gabála Érenn is a pseudo-history of Ireland, tracing the ancestry of the Irish back to Noah. It tells of a series of invasions or &quot;takings&quot; of Ireland by a succession of peoples, the fifth of whom was the people known as the Tuatha Dé Danann (&quot;Peoples of Goddess Danu&quot;), who were believed to have inhabited the island before the arrival of the Gaels, or Milesians. They faced opposition from their enemies, the Fomorians, led by Balor of the Evil Eye. Balor was eventually slain by Lug Lámfada (Lug of the Long Arm) at the second battle of Magh Tuireadh. With the arrival of the Gaels, the Tuatha Dé Danann retired underground to become the fairy people of later myth and legend.
The Metrical Dindshenchas is the great onomastic work of early Ireland, giving the naming legends of significant places in a sequence of poems. It includes a lot of important information on Mythological Cycle figures and stories, including the Battle of Tailtiu, in which the Tuatha Dé Danann were defeated by the Milesians.
It is important to note that by the Middle Ages the Tuatha Dé Danann were not viewed so much as gods as the shape-shifting magician population of an earlier Golden Age Ireland. Texts such as Lebor Gabála Érenn and Cath Maige Tuireadh present them as kings and heroes of the distant past, complete with death-tales. However there is considerable evidence, both in the texts and from the wider Celtic world, that they were once considered deities.
Even after they are displaced as the rulers of Ireland, characters such as Lug, the Mórrígan, Aengus and Manannan appear in stories set centuries later, betraying their immortality. A poem in the Book of Leinster lists many of the Tuatha Dé, but ends &quot;Although [the author] enumerates them, he does not worship them&quot;. Goibniu, Creidhne and Luchta are referred to as Trí Dé Dána (&quot;three gods of craftsmanship&quot;), and the Dagda's name is interpreted in medieval texts as &quot;the good god&quot;. Nuada is cognate with the British god Nodens; Lug is a reflex of the pan-Celtic deity Lugus, the name of whom may indicate &quot;Light&quot;; Tuireann may be related to the Gaulish Taranis; Ogma to Ogmios; the Badb to Catubodua.is generally closer to the time of the stories' composition than to the distant past. A consensus has emerged which encourages the critical reading of the material.

Proposed Submission
Issues dealing with educating children about sex have affected our nation since the late sixties.  Some believe it is immoral to teach children about basic human needs and desires, while others see sex education as important as any other basic class in school.  “SIECUS has pioneered a model for comprehensive sexuality education in which young people would receive, from kindergarten through high school, age-appropriate information on a range of topics such as human reproduction, anatomy, physiology, and sexually transmitted infections as well as issued including masturbation and homosexuality.” (Irvine 7)  People who believe sex should be taught in school agree with this program, which those whom oppose it believe it to be irresponsible.  America is divided by people’s morals and view of sexuality.

Research has related females reaching puberty early with internalizing symptoms and disorders.  But did hitting puberty early cause these problems in the females or vice versa?  In an assessment including “self-report instruments and structured diagnostic interview(s)”, researchers found that reaching puberty about five months earlier than most girls did in fact increase the risk of internalizing symptoms and disorders in adolescent girls.

== The open source software (OSS) movement ==
=== Introduction of the open source software (OSS) ===
The Open Source Movement, promoting that software should be produced altruistically, has been widely popular in recent years. In this movement, people are allowed to copy, modify, and redistribute the source code without paying any fees. Following the movement, the programmers who devoted themselves to improving the open source software should offer both original code and derived code for free sharing. In other words, the open source software is available at no cost for everyone interested in the certain software. The open source software can be fixed either by the support community or by the company. There have been famous open source software, including Apache (HTTP web server), Linux (operating system), and PHP (scripting language), etc.


Stallman (1996), founder of the Free Software Movement, claimed that the users of the software have the freedom to improve the program, and release their contribution to the public, so that the whole community benefits. In other words, anyone who shares his or her improvement of the program with the public comes together as a community with a common intent and interest to support the development of open source software. As a result, the community plays a vital role in the open source software movement. Through support and collaboration, people are able to create and revise the source code for a better purpose. For instance, Pranav Mistry gave a presentation on the thrilling potential of Sixth Sense technology on TED . At the end of the presentation, he mentioned he’d like to provide all the open source software to the public. Eventually, these actions gradually develop the culture of openness and sharing (Lerman, Miyagawa, &amp; Margulies, 2008).

=== The drivers of OSS ===
According to a technical evaluation report in China (Pan &amp; Bonk, 2007), the reasons to develop the OSS industry include lower cost, benefits to the local industry, and cultural and political value. Also, the open source movement is an excellent way to attract those talented and smart individuals all around the world to work together (Kapor, 2005). Those people must have strong technical skills and enthusiasm for bettering programs so that they could contribute themselves to the improvement of the software for the sake of sharing and benefiting more people for no reward or a different reward than money. 


Although some of those talented individuals might have an opportunity to become rich people like Bill Gates, when developing free or open source software, they did not take this advantage. Instead, they contribute because they feel the great goodness in their heart by contributing their skills to a big movement that benefits the public. As a result, they indeed earn a good reputation in the community, even in the world because of the increasing numbers of people adopting the program.

=== Comparison among famous OSS ===
Several famous open source software are presented below (See Table 1).


'''Table 1 Comparison of famous open source software'''

=== Importance of common-based peer production ===
Benkler (2006) coined the term networked information economy to describe a system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action. We are able to improve, distribute, and share the open source software through commons-based peer production. Take Wikipedia as an example: users as volunteers are allowed to contribute their knowledge to enrich and improve the quality of the content to help make information accessible and more comprehensive. Even though Wikipedia has been criticized for being an unreliable source of information, it cannot be denied that on-line information can be built, revised, and corrected openly through collective efforts at an amazing speed that is faster than what we could imagine. In the past, when there was no information technology available, a small group of scholars had to work on the paper-based encyclopedia. It took them a very long time to edit the encyclopedia and users had extremely limited access to it. 


Furthermore, there was a debate about whether the networked information economy threatens the current proprietor-like regulatory structure. On the one hand, proprietary production plays an important role in making the software more stable and reliable, because it takes responsibility for the product whenever users have difficulties or problems using it (Kapor, 2005). Peer production, on the other hand, like the open source software should continually be supported, because it could uphold the spirit and freedom of sharing and improving the product within the community for no cost, and it could also satisfy the needs of most people through self-selected, decentralized individual actions.

=== Importance of gift culture ===
Obviously, the concepts of openness and sharing are the foundation that open-source software is based on. For example, Apache server has been released under the Apache License (Wikipedia, 2010a). The original spirit of open-source is that, in fact, people who are capable of modifying the source code of the software program could devote themselves to making the programs better in order to meet people’s specific needs. At the same time, programmers who continue to improve the open source software should take the “openness” of that software extremely seriously. As a result, following the rules of open-source, on the one hand, we should provide people with both our original and derived source codes for free sharing. If we made efforts to successfully achieve some goals, people will appreciate what we have done for them. Consequently, such actions gradually develop the gift culture in which people are motivated and rewarded to help each other on the Internet (Wikipedia, 2010b).


Furthermore, in the gift culture, programmers make efforts to improve and extend the open source software. Although programmers do not receive any personal monetary reward, the only available non-monetary reward is reputation among one’s peers (Raymond, 2001). In other words, while programmers contribute themselves to the improvement of open source software, they try to prove that their ability or skill is better than others.

== The open education ==
=== Introduction of Open CourseWare (OCW) ===
It was not until 2001 when the open source software movement gave birth to the open courseware. The initiative of Open CourseWare (OCW), launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has opened up great opportunities for a new way of reusing content and for a new platform of collaboration among teachers (Freschi &amp; Calvo, 2006). Ever since then, institutions are increasingly adopting the open-source course concept to make their course materials freely available to the public, thereby developing a culture of open and free sharing.  


The development of the OCW has led increasing numbers of universities to get involved in offering their educational materials, such as course lectures, museum tours, and software for educational use. Thus, the OCW enables learners to gain access to the quality resources offered by universities around the world on the Internet.   


The open courseware, emphasizing the reuse and share of knowledge, has played a crucial role in educational revolution. It provides access to high-quality content and resources for learners around the world. In the past, for instance, it was difficult for us to imagine that we would be able to take courses taught by the well-known professors in certain subject areas, but nowadays we can easily access to these courses on the Internet anywhere anytime.

=== Influence of OCW on education ===
Open CourseWare enables learners all around the world to gain educational resources and acquire knowledge on the Internet. It is very easy and convenient for active learners to go through the whole learning process. Furthermore, the course materials can be easily reused and redistributed to other people. Also, it is useful for learners to gain a deeper understanding of content of a certain subject area through OCW. For instance, professors are able to share course contents with their academic community so as to reach a consensus on certain controversial issues (Materu, 2004).


Moreover, universities participating in offering its educational resources online could develop a better reputation of being able to offer quality education through an alternative new learning mode so that the university could reach out to students around the world and might attract more outstanding students to come to the university. 

=== Incentives and disincentives for the use of OCW ===
Regarding the users’ view of incentives and disincentives for the use of OpenCourseWare (OCW) as shown in Table 2, in addition to the cost and easiness, people could access course materials at any time and from anywhere. The OCW on the Internet allows learners to break down the barriers of time and place. Furthermore, MIT open courseware offers quality and reliable materials, because the content is designed and produced by experts in the field from a prestigious university. Therefore, it helps learners to improve their understanding of particular topics more effectively.


'''Table 2 The users’ view of incentives and disincentives for the use of OpenCourseWare''' 

'''(Arendt &amp; Shelton, 2009)'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|  || 1 || 2 || 3
|-
| Incentives || No cost for learning materials ||Available at any time|| Improving their understanding of particular topics
|-
| Disincentives || No certificate or degree awarded || Lack of professional support provided by subject tutors or experts ||Lack of guidance provided by specialists
|}


However, regarding to the disincentives for the use of OCW, some learners might become less willing to take the courses, because there is no degree, diploma, or certificate available for taking the OCW. As a result, offering a certificate or credit to the online learners through OCW might be an issue to be addressed in the near future (Morgan &amp; Carey, 2009).


Additionally, learners may need a subject tutor to help them, especially when facing difficulties or problems during their learning process. However, it might be difficult to solve this problem, for it requires spending a lot of time and money. Understandably, higher institutes could not afford to support this kind of additional online investment. In other words, although OCW learners have to play an active role in learning, there is no interaction between the instructor and the learner, because OCW simply offers learning materials in an asynchronous mode. Therefore, learners must be self-regulated and have to find a tutor or a subject expert on their own. As a matter of fact, OCW does not require any extra labor, because it just “dumps” existing educational content into an online repository without ‘gates’ (Huijser, Bedford, &amp; Bull, 2008). That is, the universities in the OCW community just offer their content to the public, but there is no obligation for them to take care of the remote learners who took the courses.

=== OCW on iTunes U (Podcasting) ===
The Apple launched a variant of iTune’s- the iTunes U (iTunes University). Since May 2007, Apple has been cooperating with a number of leading North American universities and educational institutions as well as European universities, including Harvard University, Stanford University, and University of Oxford etc., by offering this education portal in which students around the world are able to subscribe and download free content, such as course lectures, museum tours, and software for educational purposes.


iTunes U provides universities with free hosting capabilities for the lecture podcasts. In other words, universities do not need to be familiar with computer programming in order to put their content online (Hammond, 2006). Instead, they just need to concentrate on the content. Therefore, the participating universities and educational institutions could regularly offer their video or audio podcasts as well as text files as their own Open CourseWare via the iTunes U in such a way as to distribute digital lessons to the public (Nagi &amp; Vate-U-Lan, 2009), which enables students to easily download the course materials into any computer or portable video or audio device.   


The concept of iTunes U is based on the extension of RSS feeds, which enables automatic download of any update to the lecture content after it is posted on iTunes U. Thus, the lectures can either be synchronized to an iPod or other portable device. After downloading files from the iTunes U, students can listen to these lectures using traditional media players on the computers, laptops, or their mobile devices anywhere and anytime. In a word, students are engaged in an alternative way of ubiquitous learning.


Furthermore, using iTunes U as a resource in the classroom gives students a chance to make up a missed class session or learners could repeatedly listen to the desired lecture for mastery learning after the class session was over (McKinney, Dyck, &amp; Luber, 2009). Let’s put it another way; iTunes U could be used as an easy means to help students review or revise their lecture notes no matter whether they attended or missed a class session.

== Open Educational Resources ==

=== Introduction of Open Educational Resources (OER) ===

The term open educational resources was first adopted at 2002 UNESCO Forum on the Impart of Open CourseWare for Higher Education in Developing Countries. The term was defined as “the open provision of educational resources, enabled by information and communication technologies, for consultation, use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes” (UNESCO, 2002). 


With the advent of new technology, many higher educational institutions have been using the Internet and other technologies to distribute their educational resources for years. Yet, until recently, many of the learning materials were locked up behind passwords within the proprietary systems. The Open Educational Resources movement aims to break down such barriers and to encourage and enable free content sharing.  


The goal of this movement is to provide access to high quality academic content on a global scale as well as to help equalize access to knowledge and educational opportunities around the world. As a result, they can be an efficient way of promoting lifelong learning, both for individuals and governments, and bridging the gap between non-formal, informal, and formal learning (OECD, 2007).


Open Educational Resources (OER) has been inspired not only by the belief that it will advance human knowledge, creativity, and social welfare, but also by the growing success of open source software (Matkin, 2006). Currently, the most used definition of OER is “digitized materials offered freely and openly for educators, students, and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and research” (OECD, 2007).


The Open Educational Resources (OER) include (Johnstone, 2005):

* Learning content: Full courses, courseware, content modules, learning objects, collections and journals.
* Tools: Software to support the development, use, reuse and deliver of learning content, including searching and organization of content, content and learning management systems, content development tools, and online learning communities.
* Implementation resources: Intellectual property licenses to promote open publishing of materials, design principles of best practice, and the localization of content.

=== The drivers of OER ===

The reasons for institutions and individuals to produce, use, and above all share the educational content can be divided into basic technological, economic, social, and legal drivers. The basic technological driver includes helping improve information technology infrastructure to be more user-friendly. The economic driver includes content that is cheaper and easier to produce and distribute to the public. The social drivers include increased willingness to share. 


Most importantly, when it comes to the legal driver, the resource can be distributed under the Creative Commons licenses, which facilitates free sharing and reuse of content. For example, Wikipedia is one of the notable Web-based projects using one of its licenses.


Furthermore, altruism plays a viable role in motivating people to develop and share open educational resources. As we know from the open source software “What you give, you receive back improved,” by sharing and reusing, the cost can be cut, thereby making better use of available educational resources (OECD, 2007).

=== Advantages and disadvantages of OER ===

Based on the development of participants in the OER movement, the institutional benefits of joining the OER movement are identified (Matkin, 2006). The prestigious universities, such as MIT, Stanford University, and Harvard University etc., could provide access to a large storage of high quality free learning materials. Such resources are also a showcase of their outstanding courses and faculty. Thus, the learning materials not only could connect with non-matriculated lifelong learners, but also enhance faculty and student recruitment.


Moreover, from the perspectives of faculty members, they could increase their reputations in their subject area by offering excellent learning materials so as to become an active member of a dynamic intellectual community. Most importantly, OER could offer educational opportunities for learners who cannot be in the classroom so as to foster lifelong learning through easy access to resources. 


Although the Hewlett foundation--as one the primary sponsors of OER projects--emphasizes that making high quality educational materials available will be realized in most OER projects, it is obvious that most OER are not of high quality. Take one of the most successful projects as an example. The Open University with OpenLearn, mainly focusing more on self-study courses, did not concentrate on developing high quality materials. Instead, the Open University made a lot of efforts to develop beautiful interfaces.

=== Establishment of the OCW Consortium ===

The success of MIT OCW has led to the increasing numbers of universities participating in offering their educational materials online. More than 200 higher education institutions and associated organizations from around world have developed the Open CourseWare Consortium, using a shared model, with the aims to enrich people‘s learning experiences as well as extend the impact of OCW. 

=== Portals for learning ===

Several portals of open educational resources are presented in Table 3.

=== Shared online video ===

The use of shared online video content on YouTube, SciVee, or Google videos, etc. has become popular for years. We could use the video as a means to teach students knowledge so that students would be able to recall the knowledge through both verbal and visual channels. More importantly, the animation or action in the video makes the information come alive in such a way that students could be more engaged and immerse themselves in the visual learning environment.


According to the Dual Coding Theory (DCT), cognition involves the activity of two distinct subsystems. On the one hand, a verbal system is specialized for dealing with visual, auditory, and other forms of text. On the other hand, a nonverbal (imagery) system is specialized for dealing with nonlinguistic objects, including modality-specific images for pictures, sounds, and actions (Paivio, 2006; Teng, Bonk, Bonk, Lin &amp; Michko, 2009). Therefore, based on the presentation of videos, videos extend learning beyond text to visual memory, thereby fostering students dual coding of information (Paivio, 1986).


In addition to being able to enhance students’ comprehension and memory, videos can be rewound, paused, and advanced so as to facilitate discussion and debate (Leahy &amp; Cash, 2010). Regarding the reuse of videos, videos could be mash-up with other video in order to attract students’ attention in a decent and extraordinary way.


Moreover, as it was mentioned earlier, the dual coding theory plays a crucial role in visual learning. For instance, in order to introduce cognitive theory and the limits of each stages of human information processing, Dr. Bonk (2008) chose a series of quite fascinating videos on Daniel Tammet who is a savant from the United Kingdom with rare mathematical and language abilities. That is, interesting shared online videos are used as a powerful means to attract students’ attention. 


In addition, instructors could embed online video into classes when teaching students complicated ideas or principles that often frustrated and confused students. While instructors use the shared online video to teach abstract theories, timely use of the online video content related to those theories can help students grasp more of the concepts and provoke interest in learning other aspects of the theory (Bonk, 2008).   


When we recall prior learning experiences, we may find out that reading papers and being taught in a lengthy boring lecture might be the most frequently used way to build the basic understanding of educational materials. Eventually, it took times for learners to figure out the abstract concept of a certain term or a principle. As a consequence, if we as teachers could appropriately use the shared online videos and mash-up videos in order to introduce the abstract concept of learning theories to students, it might be much more helpful and easier for students to make sense, because the videos, carefully designed to foster interactive learning, enable them to better understand the content in more enjoyable and in-depth ways.

== Conclusion ==

In conclusion, when having those powerful tools, including iPod, Podcast, and mobile device, etc., as well as amazing movements, such as Open Source Software, Open Educational Resource, and Open CourseWare, etc., we as educators should take the potential impact which technologies may have on our education into consideration very carefully. In other words, we as educators should understand technologies, take advantages of them, and appropriately use technologies to meet more educational needs. More importantly, testing out new technologies to timely deliver right resources to the right learners through a well-designed mechanism will be much more crucial in making instruction more engaging, efficient, and effective in this information era.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BamHI ==

'''BamHI'''( from BAcillus amyloli) is a type II restriction enzyme that derived from ''B. amyloliquefaciens '', having the capacity for recognizing short sequences of DNA and specifically cleaving them at a target site. In order to understand how these restriction endonuclease bind to their specific sequence, BamHI became a popular research target. By crystallizing BamHI endonuclease, scientists understood how DNA binding proteins select their specific target from a variety of nonspecific sequences in the cell.

== Introduction ==

In order for restriction endonuclease to bind to their target sequence, they have to first bound to a nonspecific DNA. These nonspecific endonuclease-DNA complexes are believed to be more hydrated at their endonuclease-DNA interface, stabilized by electrostatic interactions and resulted a low heat capacity change during binding. Without strong interaction or  binding to the nonspecific sequence, these weak interactions contributed to the sliding ability of these endonuclease. Instead of steady bound to a sequence, the endonuclease slide along the sequence until a specific match of sequence is reached. The following is a summary of a research conducted by two scientists, ''Hector Viadiu'' and ''Aneel K. Aggarwal'' in 2000.

== Research ==

=== Background ===

The purpose of this research is to determine how BamHI binds to its nonspecific DNA sequence and interact with its target sequence. BamHI tends to bind to the following sequence at a particular cleavage site, as indicated below with the straight line.

&lt;center&gt;5'-G&lt;u&gt;|GATC&lt;/u&gt;C-3'&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;3'-CCTAG|G-5'&lt;/center&gt;

As a restriction enzyme, a change in the specific sequence, even a change as small as one base pair, is sensitive enough for the sequence to become nonspecific. The experiment starts by crystallizing nonspecific crystals with DNA sequence 5'-ATGAATCCATA-3' from solutions. In the sequence, GAATCC is similar to the target cleavage of BamHI. Study reveals the structure of BamHI in the presence of this similar sequence. 

==== Catalytic Mechanism ====
BamHI is a catalysis mechanism that involves three different states. The first state, which is before the reaction occurs, is called the pre-reactive state. Next it's the intermediate state, known as the transition state. The last state is the post-reactive state. The following are the steps that of how the mechanism occurs:
There is a water molecule and a glutamic acid present. This allows the glutamic acid to take a proton of water and extract the proton. This leaves a hydroxyl group which will have a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate atom. Since there are two metals, the negative charges get stabilized. Then, there will be a pentavalent phosphate, and the extra negative charge are stabilize by the metal ions. The phosphate will have an extra oxygen which causes the water in the solution to behave as a donor. This allows the tendency of phosphate to recover its coordination. Finally, the oxygen will attack the water molecule and the proton will go to the leaving group, resulting to the post-reactive state. Overall, when comparing the pre-reactive and post-reactive states, the slight movement phosphate is observed.

[[File:Catalytic Mechanism of BamHI.jpg|thumb|500px|center|'''Catalytic Mechanism''']]

==== Contact between BamHI and DNA backbone ====

[[File:BamHI.jpg|thumb|BamHI at free, nonspecific and specific state]]

Although the DNA sequence is similar, BamHI behaves completely different from a specific complex. Not only that the bottom of the BamHI dimer is loose, but the enzyme is also tilted 20 degree from its axis. As a consequence, substitution in base pair does not only affect interaction at that specific base pair, but the entire sequence and the conformation of the BamHI endonuclease. The change of conformation is indicated in figure1. In the specific complex, the alpha helix at the C terminus of one monomer unfold to interact with the other monomer. However, when the targeted sequence is altered, the complex becomes nonspecific. In a nonspecific complex, these monomers do not unfold and interact. Since there is no conformational change, amino acids from the BamHI sequence are far from the DNA and do not involve in any binding. Thus, cleavage does not occur.

[[File:BAMHI.jpg|thumb|Catalytic Mechanism of Restriction Endonuclease BamHI]]

==== DNA Cleavage ====
BamHI cleaves DNA in two ways. First, BamHI cleaves DNA by co-crystallizing with divalent cations. For example, BamHI will bind to two divalent metals. Second, BamHI cleaves DNA by directly binding to the DNA itself. In the active site, the charge of the enzyme is negative. The metals are positioned between the active site and DNA. Inhibitors of this reaction include calcium. BamHI cleaves the phosphodiester bond by donating a proton the to the second water molecule. There is a pre-reactive site and post-reactive site that indicates which sequences have been cleaved. The phosphate is in the 5' direction while the oxygen is in the 3' direction.

== Conclusion ==

Conformational change of BamHI is only triggered when it detects a specific DNA sequence. Otherwise, the BamHI, where active site residues are pointing outward, does not interact or bind with the nonspecific sequence. The specificity of this BamHI endonuclease is vital because it avoids lethal cleavages at similar DNA sequence.

Everytime DNA replicates in bacteria, it is methylated. Restriction endonucleases like BamHI cannot cleave DNA sequences that are methylated. However, DNA from viruses will not be methylated, so they will eventually be cleaved by BamHI. If bacteria want to survive, they have to be adept at recognizing which sequences are methylated. When the enzyme recognizes the right site, the DNA is in proximity. When the DNA changes conformation, it is far from the active site so catalysis is not carried out. Many residues carry the catalysis and many are close to the active site in order to recognize certain substrates and make sure they are the correct ones. 

BamHI is able to recognize particular sequences of DNA in a pool of millions of possible sequences by simply binding the any DNA. Then, they slide along the DNA strand to find the right sequence. When it finds the particular sequence, it will change conformation and embrace the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The results of researches in Structural biochemistry have made the subject to be greatly linked with Pharmacy, Pharmacology, and Medicine. This is due to its ability to determine the three dimensional structures of proteins by using X-ray Chromatography and other techniques.  These three dimensional structures say a lot about the functions of the proteins. Based on these structures, scientists are now able to find drugs and cures for different diseases. Gene therapy helps to correct mutated genes in human cells. &lt;br /&gt;

Genes are the building blocks of life, which are passed from the parent to the child. Genes are strung together to thread like structures called chromosomes. These human chromosomes are paired and hold innumerable genes. The genes and chromosomes are made up of tiny structures called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. The DNA is the blueprint of genetic information of previous generations. The genes determine the traits of an individual like physical features, habits, etc. There are approximately 25,000 – 35,000 genes in the human body.  Unfortunately, sometimes the genes also pass on certain hereditary disorders from the parent to the offspring, which can be difficult to treat. This is when gene therapy comes in to play.  &lt;br /&gt;
  
Gene therapy is a procedure where genetically mutated genes, which are the causative factors for numerous hereditary diseases, are corrected by injecting healthy genes into the body. The concept of treating these incurable diseases with the help of gene therapy was first proposed in the 1960’s. A group of scientists in the early 1970’s put forth a proposal where inherited disorders could be treated with the help of genes. The main aim of this therapy was to remove defective genes and replace them with healthy genes. In the year 1983, a few scientists from Baylor College of Medicine, Houston stated that a rare neurological disorder like Lesch Nyhan disease could be successfully treated with the help of gene therapy. A few years later, in 1990, an American doctor, W. Anderson conducted a study of gene therapy on a four year old girl who was suffering from a genetic disorder of the immune system.&lt;br /&gt;
 
With the help of gene therapy and embryonic stem cell research, many deadly and debilitating genetic disorders can be treated. The faulty genes undergo correction so that the coming generations are not carriers of mutated genes. Gene therapy has also come as a ray of hope for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and other such incurable genetic disorders. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ubiquitylation is the post-translational modification of proteins with ubiquitin, which is a powerful regulatory enzyme in eukaryotes. It can label proteins for destruction or activate gene transcription. Despite being versatile with its functions, ubiquitin is highly specific at sending signals for cellular events. Ubiquitin signaling pathway use multivalency, namely the coordinated use of multiple interaction surfaces. Multivalent interactions regulate each stage of ubiquitin signaling pathways, and appear within the ubiquitin signal, the ubiquitylated substrate, ubiquitin processing enzymes and ubiquitin recognition proteins.

==Importance of multivalency in ubiquitin signaling==

[[File:The multiple roles of protein ubiquitylation.jpg|400px|thumb|Figure 1: (a) In nucleus, proteasome-independent DNA repair. (b) Acting as a scaffold in kinase activation. (c) Proteasome-mediated degradation of key regulatory proteins. (d) Ubiquitylation signals for protein quality control to degrade misfolded proteins. (e) Ubiquitylation signals for vesicular trafficking between membrane compartments. (f) Ubiquitylation signaling regulates gene transcription.]]

Ubiquitin itself is a small 76 amino acid protein that use covalent bonds to attach to other proteins to exercise its regulatory functions. It is now known to communicate with more than 150 proteins, via discrete interacting surfaces. These proteins are labeled ubiquitin receptors, and together with ubiquitin through ubiquitylation, they regulate a vast array of cellular events including protein degration, protein trafficking, transcription, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. (Figure 1). The ubiquitin signal itself is diverse and often multivalent, as are ubiquitin receptors and substrates.

==The ubiquitin signal is diverse and multivalent==

[[File:Different forms of protein ubiquitylation.jpg|400px|thumb|Figure 2: Protein substrates can be (a) monoubiquitylated with a single ubiquitin, (b) multiubiquitylated or (c) polyubiquitylated. (c) Ubiquitin chains can form (i) extended or (ii) closed conformations of one or more linkage type or (iii) even forked chains with multiple ubiquitins attached to a common moiety. (d) Ubiquitin is activated by E1 activating enzyme, conjugated to its substrate through E2, and E3 ligase enzymes. Ubiquitin chain specificity is determined by E2 and E3.]]

Ubiquitin has a C-terminal glycine that is activated with ATP to form an isopeptide bond with the primary amino group of its substrate, which is usually the ɛ-amino group of a lysine, and also its amino terminus. Serine hydroxyl and cystein thiol groups can also be modified by ubiquitin. Substrate can be attached with a single or multiple ubiquitin (Figure 2). Polyubiquitylation takes place when ubiquitin is sequentially added to substrates to form ubiquitin chains. The chains can be of one linkage type, of mixed or forked with more than one ubiquitin attached. The multivalency provided by ubiquitin chains can greatly enchance their affinity for binding partners.

Ubiquitylation is a type of modification that is highy variable in length and linkage type. Different linkage result in different ubiquitin chain conformation and in unique binding epitopes, which can define downstream signaling events. When binding to ubiquitin chains of closed conformation, ubiquitin receptors must compete with the intra-chain ubiquitin packing interactions for access to binding surfaces.

==Diversity and multivalency of ubiquitin processing enzymes==

[[File:protein interactions (multivalency).jpg|400px|thumb|Figure 3: The diversity and specificity of ubiquitin signaling is relayed through different layers of coordinated protein–protein interactions (multivalency). (a) E3 ligases are tightly regulated to target a specific substrate at a specific time and location through multiple protein–protein interactions. (b) The moieties of a ubiquitin chain coordinate the simultaneous binding of multiple ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) from the same protein or from different ubiquitin receptors. This mode of multivalency can lead to preferences for chains of specific linkage type, to increased binding affinity and to the bridging of multiple ubiquitin receptors. (c) The consequence of a ubiquitin receptor binding to a ubiquitylated substrate is determined through multiple coordinated protein interactions. (d) Some ubiquitin receptors can be ubiquitylated and their UBDs can bind intramolecularly to ubiquitin. (e) In some cases, ubiquitylation is used to change binding affinities between protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions. In this example, interaction between covalently attached ubiquitin and a UBD leads to an increased binding affinity.]]

The use of ubiquitin as a diverse signaling mechanism is supported by three enzymes classes, E1 activating enzyme, E2 conjugating enzyme and E3 ligase (Figure 2), which catalyze substrate ubiquitylation and define the type of ubiquitin chain linkage. Their actions are often regulated
by multivalent interactions with each other and other signaling molecules and pathways. An E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme charges ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner to form a thioester bond with its catalytic cysteine. This modification induces structural changes in E1 that promote its binding to an E2 conjugating enzyme, to which ubiquitin is passed. E2 conjugating enzymes typically require E3 ubiquitin ligases to pass activated ubiquitin to a protein substrate; however, they can play defining roles in the ubiquitin chain linkage type.

The timing of substrate ubiquitylation is often relayed through multivalency effects of E3s (Figure 3). E3s can respond to their own phosphorylation status, to that of their substrate and to interactions with proteins that activate or suppress their activity. The use of multiple interactions to activate or suppress substrate ubiquitylation is exemplified through MDM2, the major E3 ligase for tumor suppressor p53, which promotes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, the protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) phosphorylates the E3 MDM2 at several redundant sites near its RING domain to prevent its oligomerization. Oligomerization of the RING domain ofMDM2 is required for its polyubiquitylation of p53, a signaling event that leads to p53 proteolysis; thus ATMmediated phosphorylation of MDM2 in response to damaged DNA stabilizes p53 protein levels.

Other MDM2 interactions stimulate p53 degradation, including its phosphorylation at Ser260 by polo-like kinase-1 and its interaction with death-domain-associated protein DAXX. DAXX enhances the intrinsic activity of MDM2 towards p53 and functions as a scaffolding protein to recruit the deubiquitylating enzyme HAUSP, which protects MDM2 from degradation by removing ubiquitin chains that were formed by MDM2 autoubiquitylation. In the nucleus, these actions are counteracted by the tumor suppressor RASSF1A (Ras association domain family protein 1A), which binds MDM2 and DAXX, but displaces HAUSP, thereby destabilizing
MDM2. The MDM2 example highlights the use of multilayered interactions to modulate E3 activity towards specific substrates in response to distinct cellular events. It is worth noting that phosphorylation of a substrate protein can also promote E3 recruitment or displacement.

==Ubiquitin chain variability provides receptor selectivity==

The variable length and linkage type of ubiquitin chains provides selectivity to the outcome of ubiquitylation, because some ubiquitin receptors have strong preferences for ubiquitin chains of certain linkage type or size. Receptor specificity for ubiquitin chains of distinct linkage type couples the activities of ubiquitin processing enzymes with downstream signaling events. More than 20 different ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) families, which exist in more than 150 human receptor proteins, have been identified to date. The mechanisms that they use to achieve selectivity for specific ubiquitin modifications have been comprehensively reviewed.

==Ubiquitin chain multivalency enables simultaneous interaction with multiple ubiquitin-binding domains==

The binding of multiple UBDs to ubiquitin chains provides a general mechanism for enhancing the binding affinity of ubiquitin receptors for ubiquitylated substrate (Figure 3). In humans, the proteasome component S5a has two UIMs, which are separated by flexible linker regions causing their relative orientation to be undefined. This flexibility is markedly restricted when S5a binds to Lys48-linked diubiquitin because each UIM binds a ubiquitin moiety of the same molecule simultaneously. The outcome of this coordinated binding is significantly increased affinity between S5a and diubiquitin, suggesting that its two UIMs are not used to recruit
multiple substrates to the proteasome simultaneously, but rather to increase affinity for each ubiquitylated substrate. It is worth noting that S5a and hHR23a can bind a
common ubiquitin chain, as can S5a and Rpn13, the other intrinsic ubiquitin receptors of the proteasome. The biological significance of these interactions is not yet clear; however, complexes of multiple ubiquitin receptors with a ubiquitylated substrate provide additional levels of multivalency, which most likely leads to a greater binding affinity. Such complexes also seem to operate during endocytic processes to enhance binding affinity. Although monoubiquitylation is sufficient for receptor internalization during endocytosis, quantitative mass spectrometry indicates that more than half of all ubiquitylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is conjugated with ubiquitin polymers (largely connected by Lys63). Most likely, modification with a polymeric ubiquitin chain enables more interactions with the UIMs of endocytic adaptors and in turn, interactions of higher affinity compared with that possible with only one ubiquitin subunit.

Multivalent interactions involving ubiquitin chains and multiple ubiquitin receptors can also transduce signals, as exemplified by the kinase activation mechanism in the NF-κB pathway.

==Multivalent interactions of ubiquitin receptors influence the fate of ubiquitylated substrates==

Surfaces of ubiquitin receptors that do not bind ubiquitin play key roles in the trafficking and processing of ubiquitylated substrates (Figure 3). Ubiquitin receptors associated with proteasomal degradation have regions that dock them into the proteasome or that enable transient interaction with its components. The UBD of one such receptor, Rpn13, assembles into the proteasome via a surface opposite to its ubiquitin-binding region and this protein contains another domain that binds and activates Uch37, one of the three DUBs of the proteasome. Before their degradation by the proteasome, substrates are deubiquitylated and unfolded for passage through a narrow chamber leading to the catalytic center of the proteasome. Rpn13 might perform a dual functionality in the capture and deubiquitylation of proteasome substrates through its multivalent interactions with ubiquitylated substrates and Uch37.

The integration of multivalent ubiquitin-dependent interactions with ubiquitin-independent interactions is used extensively for endocytic trafficking to direct proteins from the plasma membrane to multi-vascular bodies (MVBs) (Figure 1).

==Intramolecular interactions between ubiquitin-binding regions and covalently attached ubiquitin can inhibit ubiquitin receptor activity==

Ubiquitin receptors can be conjugated with ubiquitin, which in turn binds to their UBDs (Figure 3). Such intramolecular interactions can inhibit intermolecular interactions with their ubiquitylated substrates. This mode of regulation exists in the endocytic pathway. HGS, EPS15 and epsin undergo coupled monoubiquitylation, such that their UBD mediates their own ubiquitylation by binding to a ubiquitylated E3 or to an E3 with a ubiquitin-like domain. This modification leads to cis interactions with the attached ubiquitin, which inhibits trans interaction with ubiquitylated targets. The role of this so-called coupled monoubiquitylation in endocytosis remains poorly understood. It is possible that it weakens the interaction with cargo to enable ready passage of the substrate. The DUB UBPY (ubiquitin-specific protease Y) could relieve this autoinhibition by removing the conjugated ubiquitin from receptors, thus activating them towards new substrates.

==Substrates modulate the effects of their ubiquitylation==

Although the fate of a ubiquitylated substrate is largely determined by its interaction with ubiquitin receptors, some substrate features can modulate the effects of ubiquitylation even after their recognition by a receptor of a designated function. For example, interaction with the proteasome typically culminates in the degradation of ubiquitylated substrates; this mechanistic pathway is an effective means to control protein lifespan. Such degradation, however, seems to require substrates to harbor, or be ‘complexed’ with, a protein containing an unstructured region, and proteins that are not ubiquitylated can be proteolyzed simply by associating with those that are, so long as they contain an unstructured region. By contrast, folded domains within ubiquitylated proteins appear to protect substrates from degradation.

==Ubiquitylation can change binding affinities by adding multivalency to already existing interactions==

In the nucleus, ubiquitylation is widely used to change the affinity of already existing interactions by adding multivalency (Figure 3). For example, PCNA encircles DNA to serve as a ‘sliding clamp’ forDNApolymerases duringDNA replication. When a damaged site is encountered, replication is stalled and PCNA is monoubiquitylated at Lys164 (Figure 1). This modification is recognized by UBDs of trans-lesion polymerases to increase their affinity for PCNA and to promote their error-prone trans-lesion synthesis mode of replication [86,87]. After bypassing the lesion, the error-free, processive polymerase takes over. This switch might be due to PCNA deubiquitylation because the exchange back to the processive polymerase is prohibited when PCNA is monoubiquitylated at Lys164.

Protein ubiquitylation is also used to alter the DNAbinding affinity of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factor xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC).
Ubiquitylation is also used to weaken substrate interactions with binding partners. Histones H3 and H4 are ubiquitylated in response to UV-induced DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of NER machinery to damaged sites by weakening histone–DNA interactions.

==Conclusion: Future potential==

Ubiquitin-mediated signaling is enabled by a large repertoire of enzymes that control the timing of modification, create diversity in the ubiquitin signal itself and enable dynamic alteration of the modification throughout a signaling pathway or in response to new stimuli. These enzymes communicate through ubiquitin to downstream receptors that operate within a larger context to enable signaling specificity. Versatility and specificity become congruent in ubiquitin signaling pathways through multivalency. Ubiquitin-binding regions are typically just one of many functional surfaces present in the receptor, which can contribute to the binding interaction, subcellular localization or link ubiquitin signaling with other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Ubiquitin belongs to a family of ubiquitin-like proteins that resemble ubiquitin structurally and perform their own distinct signaling, which can cross-talk with ubiquitin signaling. The ubiquitin signaling network is of therapeutic importance because
parts of it are hijacked by pathogens or compromised in human diseases. It therefore is likely to have yet uncharted therapeutic potential and the manipulation of ubiquitinmediated protein degradation is actively being pursued for such purposes. Currently, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma; this inhibitor preferentially induces apoptosis in tumor cells. The underlying mechanisms of its greater cytotoxicity in tumor cells are complex, ranging from the specific accumulation of proapoptotic proteins such as NOXA (NADPH oxidase activator1) to the activation of apoptosis through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Perhaps not surprisingly, drugs targeting the proteasome suffer from unwanted side effects, because many physiologically important processes are regulated by proteasomal proteolysis. Targeting of specific E3s, DUBs or ubiquitin receptors might afford clinical efficacy with fewer side effects. It is foreseeable that the multivalent interactions that regulate E3 and ubiquitin receptor activities could ultimately be used to target ubiquitin signaling for specifically restricting viral budding, stabilizing tumor suppressors or promoting DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;Fen Liu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Kylie J.

'''The advances and pitfalls of protein structural alignment'''

==Small Introduction==

It is apparent that structural comparison can open a window into the past as proteins taken part in a sort of evolution process. Strictly using protein sequence comparison has provided limited information and sometimes generate contradictory information for even slightly distant structures. This has opened the eyes of scientists and researchers to engage in structure comparison methods that allow for more flexible procedures in terms of generating the most biologically meaningful alignments.It is indeed common knowledge that analysis of protein sequences and structures have paved the way for a higher understanding of proteins and their important functions. However, what is important to note is the fact that the variety of protein structures is far less than that of protein sequences, which is mainly due to physical limitations of natural proteins. The foundation for structural proteins has been placed by the concept of visual analysis through the illustration of known structures of proteins. Though there may not be a universal code as to when a protein is structurally similar, we all do know when we see it. The generation of three-dimensional structures has made visualizing proteins far easier. As a matter of fact, the most widespread use of structural alignments is the ability to identify homologous residues that are encoded by the same codon in the genome of a common ancestor. The field of protein structural alignment has maintained its active nature through the years and the number of new methods has actually doubled every five years.

==Advances and Technological Development==

In terms of scores, different scoring themes can be classified into different types depending on whether one is dealing with a three-dimensional, two-dimensional, or one-dimensional structure. When it comes to 3D structures, similarities are drawn from &quot;positional deviations of equivalent atoms upon rigid-body superimposition.&quot; The balance between the size of the common core and gap penalties can define sets of optimal configurations. Flexible aligners come into play and serve as the chief identifiers of proteins with large conformational changes by chaining together a series of substructures within the particular protein. When 2D structures are compared, the similarities are drawn from the relative distance differences of &quot;intramolecular C(alpha)-C(alpha) distances.&quot; In words we can understand, this essentially means that for the same level of similarity, larger deviations are allowed for tertiary contacts than local ones. Lastly, when it comes to 1D structures, profiles classify each residue according to its amino acid type and highly specific backbone conformational state. Once a score has been identified, the alignment is then determined by finding optimal sets of correspondences. Fragment assembly algorithms generate nonsequential alignments while consistent scoring has been utilized in the generation of multiple alignments from vast databases of pairwise alignments. New structures have been placed in a Protein Data Bank and there are certain parameters such as size and molecular shape of proteins that are initially considered before insertion into this data bank. Evaluations of structural alignments play a pivotal role, as they first measure the accuracy of the alignments, the ability of the alignment score to differentiate homologous from unrelated proteins in database-wide comparisons, and finally, the 'quality' of alignments. 

==Pitfalls of protein structural alignment==

A few empirically parameterized models of structural evolution have been previously proposed, but most structural aligners are based on &quot;ad hoc&quot; scores of structural similarity. However, it has been proven that some &quot;ad hoc&quot; scores have worked. In terms of evaluations of structural alignments, the problem with reference-independent evaluation is that it is simply a test of the similarity between scoring functions, rather than the observance of actual rotations that promote alignment optimization. It is also crucial to note that not all programs using the same type of score generated similar alignments. This results in the necessity for developers to pay special attention to the robustness of optimization protocols. Sure enough, despite the few pitfalls of the structural alignment process, the respective models' versatility does advance the study of interplay of sequence and structure evolution in the future.

{{B3D:N2P/NAV

|nextText=A User Interface For Your Addon
}}

An ''addon'' is a Python script that can extend the functionality of Blender in various ways. It can reside in a file within your Blender user preferences directory, or it can be stored in a text block within the Blender document. In the former case, the addon needs to be ''enabled'' in each Blender document where you want to use it, by ticking the checkbox in its entry in the Add-Ons list in the User Preferences window for that document. In the latter case, the script can be run by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}} in the Text Editor window; or you can tick the “Register” checkbox for that script in the Text Editor, to have the addon be automatically enabled as soon as the document is loaded into Blender.

The main thing an addon script typically does is define one or more new ''operators''. All the user-interface functions in Blender are performed by operators; these are invoked by being associated with menu items, buttons or hotkeys. Each operator is a subclass of the &lt;TT&gt;bpy.types.Operator&lt;/TT&gt; class. The name you give your class in Python is immaterial outside the script where it is defined; it will be referred to from the rest of Blender via its ''operator name'', which must be unique within the document. In the same way, your script can invoke other operators defined elsewhere via Blender API functions that take their operator name.

==Text Blocks==
A Blender document can contain ''text blocks'', which are not the same as ''text objects'' in a 3D scene (though the former can be converted to the latter). Besides generating text objects, a text block can serve any purpose you like; for example, use it to pass workflow instructions to a colleague along with the document; display a copyright or help message in the initial layout that a user sees on opening the document; or hold a Python script that can be run by the user to perform some useful action related to the document.

== Your First Operator ==
Open a new, empty Blender document. Bring up the Text Editor [[File:Blender269TextEditorIcon.png]] in any convenient window; you will see an empty, grey rectangle. Before you can type in text, you need to create a text block; do so by clicking the large button labeled “New” in the window header. As soon as you do this, you should see a popup menu appear listing all the text blocks in your document, with the current (only) entry named “Text”. You should also see a red insertion cursor appear at the top left, indicating that you can start typing.

Unlike the Console Window, nothing is automatically imported for you. So as in any other Python script, you need to mention every module you want to access.

You define your operator as a subclass of a subclass of the &lt;TT&gt;bpy.types.Operator&lt;/TT&gt;. It must have a &lt;TT&gt;bl_idname&lt;/TT&gt; class attribute which gives the operator name, while &lt;TT&gt;bl_label&lt;/TT&gt; gives the user-visible name that appears in the spacebar menu. The former must have valid Python syntax for a name, including a single dot; the part to the left of the dot must be the name of one of the valid categories of operators, which you can find by typing &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;dir(bpy.ops)&lt;/source&gt; into the Console Window.

Let’s define an operator that will add a new tetrahedron object to the document. The class definition should start something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class MakeTetrahedron(bpy.types.Operator) :
    bl_idname = &quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

It has to define an &lt;TT&gt;invoke&lt;/TT&gt; method, which starts off like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
    def invoke(self, context, event) :
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;TT&gt;invoke&lt;/TT&gt; method performs the actual function of the operator; after it has finished, it must return a value which is a set of strings, telling Blender things like whether the operator is still executing in a modal state, or whether the operation has finished, and if so whether it was successful or not. To indicate successful completion: end the &lt;TT&gt;invoke&lt;/TT&gt; method with this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        return {&quot;FINISHED&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Anyway, let us compute the coordinates of the vertices for the tetrahedron: with edges with a length of 1 Blender unit, suitable values are &lt;math&gt;(0, - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}})&lt;/math&gt;. Or in Python:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        Vertices = \
          [
            mathutils.Vector((0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3))),
          ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we create the mesh datablock, giving it the name “Tetrahedron”:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        NewMesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Fill it in with the above vertex definitions and associated faces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        NewMesh.from_pydata \
          (
            Vertices,
            [],
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
          )
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;TT&gt;Mesh.from_pydata&lt;/TT&gt; method is not currently well documented in the Blender API, but its first argument is an array of &lt;TT&gt;Vector&lt;/TT&gt; defining the vertices, the second argument is an array of edge definitions, and the third argument is an array of face definitions. Each edge or face is defined as a list of vertex indices (2 elements in each list for an edge, 3 or 4 for a face), 0-based in usual Python style, being indices into the array of vertex definitions that you passed. Note that you pass '''either the edge definitions or the face definitions, but not both''': the other one should be passed as the empty list. If this function is not used correctly, it will cause Blender to crash.

We also need to add the following, to tell Blender the mesh has changed and needs updating (as if it couldn’t figure it out itself):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        NewMesh.update()
&lt;/source&gt;

(Omitting this produces a minor quirk: right-clicking the newly-created tetrahedron does not highlight its outline in orange as with other objects, though the problem goes away if you enter edit mode on the object and exit again.)

Now to create the object datablock (I also give it the name “Tetrahedron”), and link it to the mesh:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        NewObj = bpy.data.objects.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;, NewMesh)
&lt;/source&gt;

But the object will not appear to the user until it is linked into the scene:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        context.scene.objects.link(NewObj)
&lt;/source&gt;

To recap, here is the complete script:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math
import bpy
import mathutils

class MakeTetrahedron(bpy.types.Operator) :
    bl_idname = &quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;

    def invoke(self, context, event) :
        Vertices = \
          [
            mathutils.Vector((0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3))),
          ]
        NewMesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
        NewMesh.from_pydata \
          (
            Vertices,
            [],
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
          )
        NewMesh.update()
        NewObj = bpy.data.objects.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;, NewMesh)
        context.scene.objects.link(NewObj)
        return {&quot;FINISHED&quot;}
    #end invoke
#end MakeTetrahedron

bpy.utils.register_class(MakeTetrahedron)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the addition of the &lt;CODE&gt;register_class&lt;/CODE&gt; call, to make Blender add your operator to its built-in collection.

Now execute your script by typing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}}. If all goes well ''nothing should appear to happen''; Blender will define the class and register it as a new operator as you requested, ready for use.

If you hit any syntax errors, Blender should display these in a popup window; go back and correct them, and re-execute the script with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}}.

== Invoking Your Operator ==

We haven’t (yet) defined any user interface for this operator; so how do we invoke it? Simple.

Go to a 3D View window. Delete the default cube to avoid it obscuring things, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}}. This brings up a searchable menu of every operator defined for the current document. Into the search box, type part or all of the string you defined for the &lt;TT&gt;bl_label&lt;/TT&gt; attribute above (typing “tetra” should probably be enough). This will restrict the menu to only showing items that contain that string, which should include the name of your operator; click with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on this or highlight it and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. If all goes well, you should see your tetrahedron object appear!

[[File:BlenderTetrahedronAddonOperator.png|center]]

== If You Hit An Error ==

If there is any error compiling or running the script, Blender should display this in a popup. For example, the following simple one-line script

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
raise RuntimeError(&quot;Uh-oh&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

displays this popup:

[[File:BlenderExamplePopupError.png|center]]

The full Python traceback message is written to Standard Error, and looks something like this:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;/Text&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 RuntimeError: Uh-Oh!

On Linux/Unix systems, the message will appear in the terminal session if you invoked Blender from the command line; otherwise it will be appended to your &lt;TT&gt;~/.xsessionerrors&lt;/TT&gt; file if you launched Blender from a GUI. On Windows the message appears in the console window.</text>

[[Image:Gluconeogenesis.png‎|thumbnail|300px|Gluconeogenesis pathway with key molecules and enzymes. Many steps are the opposite of those found in the glycolysis.]]
Gluconeogenesis is a process, in which Pyruvate (a product of Glycolysis) is backward-converted into sugar, glucose in particular. Which can then be stored in the form of glycogen in animals' cells or starch and cellulose in plants' cells.

==Process==
There are three basis steps involved in Gluconeogenesis:
# Pyruvate to Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): 
##The enzyme pyruvate carboxylase converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate by adding the CO2 from the bicarbonate ions with the support of ATP and the coenzyme biotin. 
## Then oxaloacetate is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)by the enzyme PEP carboxykinase in a process that uses GTP (guanosine triphosphate) as energy and releases CO2 as a waste product. Note that the released CO2 is actually the same CO2 molecule from the bicarbonate ion at the previous step.
# The next steps are just the reversed processes of glycolysis going from PEP back to Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, with released products in glycolysis being reactants/cofactors in gluconeogenesis.
# Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru 1,6-P) to Fructose 6-Phosphate (Fru 6-P): This is an irreversible hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the enzyme Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1). This reaction is heavily regulated by Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.
# Glucose 6-Phosphate to Glucose: Fru 6-P in the previous step is converted into Glucose 6-Phosphate by reversed step of glycolysis. Glucose 6-phosphate is converted into glucose by a hydrolysis reaction.

==Regulation==
The main regulatory factor is the concentration of Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P), which controls glycolysis (catabolic pathway) and gluconeogenesis (anabolic pathway).

# First, Fru 2,6-P is the conversion of Fructose 6-Phosphate (Fru 6-P) by the enzyme Phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2), which uses ATP as an energy source. This is a reversible reaction, thus the reversed reaction gives back Fruc 6-P. The reversed reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme Fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) in a process releasing an inorganic phosphate.
# Second, how can Fru 2,6-P regulates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis?
## In a breakdown pathway, because Fru 6-P is readily phosphorylated into Fru 1,6-P by the enzyme Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a high concentration of Fru 2,6-P will accumulate and promotes the activity of PFK-1 and inhibits FBPase-1. Note that PFK-2 is active and FBPase-2 remains inactive to stimulate the production of Fru 2,6-P
## In the synthesis pathway, Fru 6-P concentration rises, inhibits the activity of PFK-2, and stimulates FBPase-2 to reduce the concentration of Fru 2,6-P. As the concentration of Fru 2,6-P decreases over time, the activity of PFK-1 also decreases, thus stimulating FBPase-1 to convert Fru 1,6-P into Fru 6-P,which is later ultimately converted into glucose.

Note that in the case of low glucose level in the blood: the enzyme glucagon from liver can stiumulate the production of an enzyme called cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which stimulates the conversion of the PFK-2 (active)/FBPase-2 (inactive) into PFK-2 (inactive)/FBPase-2 (active). This process will inhibit glycolysis and promote gluconeogenesis to pump more glucose from liver into the blood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA’s many properties such as minuscule size, informational element, and amplification provides for the potential of DNA to produce unique materials. As a matter of fact, the DNA molecule is arguably one of the most promising functional nanomaterial to date.  DNA’s characteristic trait of self-assembly and molecular recognition makes it a key player in the bottom up construction of nanotechnology. The key factor in DNA’s role as nonmaterial lies in the molecule’s sticky ends.  A sticky end is the short single stranded overhang that protrudes from the end of a double stranded DNA molecule.  These sticky ends when paired with their complementary counterparts will cohere to form a diverse range of molecular complex.  Under lab conditions these sticky end sequences are programmable so that there is control over intermolecular interactions and predictable geometry at the point of cohesion. Such control in formation allows for the construction of artificial DNA structures. Over the years the use of DNA in nanostructures have expanded in three main directions. 

# The synthesis of artificial networks using DNA.
# The integration of DNA onto surfaces.
# The formation of metal or semiconductor nanoparticle assemblies along DNA.

==The Fabrication of Artificial Networks==	
Due to the fact that the DNA double helix runs along a single axis, the molecule is unbranched. This provides a problem with using DNA in the fabrication of nanomaterial because joining DNA molecules by sticky ends can only allow for construction in a single linear direction.  However branched DNA does occur naturally in nature as an intermediated formed when chromosomes exchange information during meiosis. This structure is formally known as the Holliday structure.  Over the years scientists have been able to feasibly design sequences that leads to stable synthetic variants of the Holliday junction.  This allows for the fabrication of artificial networks consisting of native DNA. 

==Attachment or Integration of DNA onto Solid State Surfaces.==	
The first step in DNA technology is to attach the molecule to the surface of interest.  There are three different methods that may be used for such attachments. 
# Electrostatic interaction between DNA and a substrate.
# Covalent binding of a chemical group attached to the DNA end.
# Binding of a protein attached to the DNA end to the corresponding antibody immobilized at the surface.
Due to the enhanced surface area and high surface free energy, nanoparticles can absorb biomolecules strongly and facilitate attachment. Generally the absorptions of biomolecules onto the naked surface of bulk material will result in their denaturation and loss of bioactivity. However the since nanoparticles have the ability to reduce the distance between the redox site of DNA and the working electrode surface, biomolecules are able to maintain their bioactivity. This is due to the fact that the rate of electron transfer is inversely dependent on the exponential distance between the two molecules. 

==Metal Nanoparticles==
Metal nanoparticles have the potential to revolutionize convention technology and experimental medicinal industries because of their electrical properties. There has been three main approaches in using DNA to assemble metals or semi-conducting nanoparticles. 
# Electrostatic binding of negatively charged DNA to positively charged colloids
# Chemical binding of colloids to DNA	
# Formation of nucleation sites along DNA molecules followed by metal or semiconductors deposition to allow for the direct growth of nanoparticles along the DNA.


=Structural DNA Nanotechnology=

==Prerequisites for Structural DNA Nanotechnology==
Before DNA can be used as nanomaterial it must be structured into the correct form, which can be achieved through three main ideas: 
# Hybridization 
# Stably branched DNA 
# Synthesis of designed sequences.

Hybridization mostly entails the use of sticky-ended cohesion, which combines pieces of linear duplex DNA together through Hydrogen bonding. Sticky-ended cohesion is very useful because we can predict how the sticky ends will cohere with one another due to affinity. The double-helix will be the ultimate structure formed, which helps us to eliminate the need to first establish the crystal structure.

[[File:DNA before ligase.PNG|DNA before ligase]]


Stably branched DNA in combination with hybridization is what allows for DNA to be construction material. DNA molecules that have branched self-assemble to form larger arrangements. So, where the DNA forms a junction, the sticky ends have come together in a complementary fashion. But, the DNA will have left over sticky ends which it will use to bind to other junctions to “self-assemble” into two-dimensional or three-dimensional lattices.
[[File:Multi-branch-dna.png|thumb|Multi-branch-dna]]

However, there is one major problem with junctions, they are unstable because of their sequence symmetry. The symmetry exhibited allows for a specific type of isomerization known as branch migration. Branch migration allows the branch point to relocate which makes our entire structure highly unstable. To make it so that DNA is a stable structure we must minimize sequence symmetry. Nature, though, is very symmetrical and we must therefore synthesize DNA molecules of arbitrary sequences. Luckily, we have had laboratories that do just that since the 1980’s and it is now possible to order DNA molecules known as “vanilla” DNA because they lack complexity. So, these DNA molecules are readily synthesized, making it possible to have DNA in a structural form that will aid us in using it as nanomaterial.

==Individual Steps==
===Motif Design=== 
This step involves the switching of the connections between DNA strands, it is very similar to recombinant DNA in that we do something close to crossing over by switching connections between two different DNA double helices, this ultimately gives us a new connectivity. It is important to note that this step is purely theoretical, it is a type of drawing stage similar to blue prints for the later sequence design.
Motif design is carried out through an operation called reciprocal exchange, if only a single reciprocal exchange is performed a conformer has just been made, and there is no difference. There must be at least two operations carried out for there to be a result of different topologies.
There are a few key motifs that have been generated:
# DX motif: has exchanges between strands of opposite polarity and is known for its length which is twice that of a conventional linear duplex DNA
# DX + J motif: has an extra domain which is usually perpendicular to the plane of the two helix axes which allows the domain to be a topographic marker, easy to distinguish through a atomic force microscope.
# TX motif: has three domains that are joined in a particular pattern known as 1-3 fashion (where the top helical domain of one is joined at the bottom domain of another). These three domains are useful because in 2D arrays created there will be useful cavities.
# PX motif: happens everywhere that two double helices can be juxtaposed
# JX2 motif: is the topoisomer of the PX motif and it lacks two of the exchanges that the PX has

===Sequence Design and Symmetry Minimization===
This step is where we use the motifs designed previously, and we go to the lab and literally design. The main goal is to get the molecules we are working with to become excited states. One effective method for achieving this is based on minimization of sequence symmetry, which of course has worked very well for the design of branched molecules. 

There are a few helpful guidelines to follow to avoid getting unstable molecules:
# prevent long stretches of Guanine, because these could form other structures near crossover points
# avoid certain tracts that look like they might be symmetric, such as: homopolymer tracts, polyprimidine tracts, alternating purine-pyrimidine tracts, or polypurine tracts

There are some situations where these previous tips don’t necessarily work, in the case of a 12-arm junction for example. Here it is impossible to flank the branch points with different base pairs. So instead of attempting to eliminate symmetry around the center of the junction, we take identical nucleotide pairs and space them at four-step intervals around the junction.
[[File:Face-smile.svg|thumb|Face-smile]]
There are a few situations where scientists have completely ignored sequence symmetry and have managed to design structures, such as with DNA origami. Scientists used a long single strand of viral DNA to scaffold a couple hundred shorter strands to produce a two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape. Two astonishing DNA origami pieces that they were able to create include a smiley face, and a map of the Western Hemisphere.

==Uses of DNA as a Nanomaterial==
[[File:DNA Furchen.png|thumb|DNA Furchen]]
DNA has a variety of amazing uses, one such use of this tiny molecule is that it can be used to make nanomechanical devices that are extremely unique in and of themselves. Such nanomechanical devices include molecules that self-assemble, change their own shapes, and walk along a DNA sidewalk. DNA can also be used to organize other cellular species, DNA can help to organize or move proteins, enzymes, and nanoelectronic components. Such remarkable uses for this dynamic molecule has spurred on others to begin investigating the possibilities for programming the information in DNA beyond the use of just its genetic code.

[[File:Bdna.gif|Bdna]]

=Other Types of DNA-based Nanomaterials=
DNA species is not only used for organizing, but can be used also with DNA-based systems.  Some of these systems are periodic assembly, using DNA to organize proteins and nanoelectronic components, algorithmic assembly, derived from DNA-based computation, and seminatural components. 

==Organization of proteins and nanoelectric components using Periodic Assembly==
DNA can be used to organize protein structures.  Protein to proteins can be bound using structural DNA nanotechnology.  For example, biotin groups can be attached to DNA arrays and then it was bounded to streptavidin.  Another focus of structural DNA nanotechnology is organizing nanoelectronic and nanophotonic component.  Multiple components can be used to organize metallic nanoparticles, such as gold. 

==Algorithmic Assembly== 
Structural DNA nanotechnology can be used to organize aperiodic matter, although it is not as simple, using algorithmic assembly.  One advantage of algorithmic assembly is its ability to generate complex algorithmic patterns using only a few tiles.  However, its disadvantage is that algorithmic assembly is extremely sensitive to errors, and it is more prone to error than periodic assembly.  

==Seminatural Constructs==
It is also possible to combine other chemical species with DNA in nanoconstructs.  Metallo-organic complexes were placed in junction sites, which led to different properties in presence or absence of metal.  It is also possible to stimulate G-tetrad formation by use of a square-shaped organometallic molecule.

=DNA-Based Nanomechanical Devices=
Because DNA can be combined with other molecular synthesized species, it is extremely valuable.  Therefore, it is also questioned whether the arrangement can be changed per time.  A fourth dimension is used in structural DNA nanotechnology.  

Devices can be based on Structural Transitions.  However, this system is limited to two states, as they ignore the programmability of DNA.  Also there are transitions that are sequence dependet, so many individually addressable devices can be in the same solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transgenic plants''' are genetically engineered to have genes from other organisms inserted into their genome. Transgenic plants are identified as a class of genetic modified organisms (GMO). The introduced genes do not have to be from the plant kingdom, but can come from animals, viruses, or bacteria as well. The uses of exogenous gene introduction include virus immunity, a replacement for pesticides, the ability to grow in acidic soil, and greater nutritional content. 

==Making Transgenic Plants==
[[File:Breeding transgenesis cisgenesis.svg|thumb|Breeding transgenesis cisgenesis]]
Transgenic plants are constructed by inserting genes from other organisms into the host plant's DNA sequence. For this to happen a desired gene must be isolated and cloned. A few changes must be made to the gene so that it can effectively be inserted into the plant. First, a promoter sequence must be added to the gene. The promoter sequence is an on/off switch that controls where and under what cues the gene is expressed. The gene must also sometimes be modified (e.g. The Bt gene for insect resistance has a greater amount of A-T nucleotide pairs than plants, which tend to have more C-T pairs. The A-T nucleotides can be substituted for with C-T pairs in a manner that does not significantly change the amino acid sequence, leading to greater protection of the inserted gene in plant cells.). A terminal sequence must also be added to signal when the end of the gene sequence has been reached. Finally, a selective marker gene must be inserted to identify plant cells which have successfully integrated the transgene.
===Agrobacterium System===
A method that is used to transform plants is the Agrobacterium method and the &quot;Gene Gun&quot; method. The Agrobacterium method uses
''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', a soil-dwelling bacterium that has the ability to
infect plant cells by introducing transfer DNA, or T-DNA of a tumor-inducing (Ti)
plasmid (i.e. a DNA sequence that can replicate independently of chromosomal DNA and
is often circular) to the host's nuclear DNA. The bacteria is part of the rhizobiaceae family which is responsible for many tumors found in plants. The Ti plasmid contains the T-DNA as
well as a series of vir (virulence) genes that direct the infection process.
''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' can be used as a vector for gene transfer into plants.
First, a hybrid plasmid that carries only the T-DNA from a Ti plasmid is cut open
with a restriction enzyme and a foreign gene is inserted, creating a recombinant
plasmid.  The recombinant plasmid is then transferred into an ''Agrobacterium
tumefaciens'' cell that contains a Ti plasmid that has had its T-DNA removed. The
Agrobacterium with the engineered plasmid is then used to infect a plant and
integrates the T-DNA with the foreign gene into the plant genome. For the
Agrobacterium to be used the DNA must be able to penetrate into the plant cells.
This is often done with electroporation, where brief high-voltage electrical pulses
are administered to naked protoplasts (i.e. plant tissues and DNA). The electrical
pulses open the pores in the plasma membrane allowing the DNA to enter the
protoplast (which can then be grown into a mature plant by treating it with
hormones). In the &quot;Gene Gun&quot; method, gold or tungsten microspheres (about 1
micrometer in diameter) are coated with the DNA or RNA from the specific gene of
interest. The microspheres are then accelerated into undifferentiated target cells
in a petri dish. Once inside the cells, the gene from the DNA coating the
microsphere is released and can be incorporated into the host plant genome. The advantage of this method is that a high percentage of a single copy of T-DNA can used to transform the plant. In addition, they are an abundant of vector system available to carry out this method.
===Biolistic Method===
This method delivers microprojectiles that are coated with DNA by accelerating it into the cell of interest. The microprojectiles are usually made up of tungsten or gold. To carry out the acceleration, an explosion is made with gunpowder under high pressure of helium. Plants that are made using the boilistic method have multiple copies of a gene that is still able to segregate in a Mendelian pattern. This method helps increase the diversity seen in plants. There are some advantages to the biolistic method compared to the Agrobacterium method. The plants that undergo the bombardment of genes in this method are still fertile. Other advantages includes this is the only reliable method to transform the chloroplast and this method does not need any transformation vector.

==Importance of Transgenic Plants==
The new methods developed to transform plants have opened a new field of interest. Transgenic plants are used to solve a lot of problems in the agriculture sector. In addition, transgenic plants can be used in the medical field 
===Nutrients of Transgenic Plants===
When people go to the supermarket, they often buy fruits that are not soft or overly ripened. The major problem in the agriculture field with fruits is that the fruits often become soft during processing and transporting because they are being ripened. Using one of the methods for creating transgenic plants, scientists are able to slow down the process of ripening. Three companies have been able to apply this technology to slow down the ripening of tomatoes. And now other companies are hoping to be able to do the same for other fruits such as mangos or papayas. 
Cereal grains and legume seeds are a big source of protein for many people. However, the cereal grains and legumes seed often lack certain amino acids such lysine in cereal grains and methionine in legume seeds. Many efforts have been put into creating seeds that are higher in nutritional values. Currently, transgenic tobacco and canola seeds have a 33% increase in methionine due to the transgenic technology. In addition, the nutritional values have potatoes have increased by transforming it with AmA1, a gene from amaranth. 

Increasing the nutritional values in plants and fruits can address many malnutrition problems and diseases. Vitamin A deficiency is a huge problem in Asia that affects around 124 million children and causes blindness. The main staple in Asia is rice, but rice does not contain any vitamin A. Researches are being performed in hope of developing rice that is rich in vitamin A. Currently, scientist have found the genes that encode for B-carotene (pro-vitamin A) enzymes in the endosperm of transgenic rice seed and they hope to use this information to engineer rice in a way that vitamin A can be produce through the rice.

==Uses of Transgenic Crops==
The use of transgenic plants for pathogen resistance has received the most attention from popular media. The use of GMOs has been a topic of debate since their introduction in the mid-1990s. The two best known cases were virus-immunity in papayas and insect immunity in crops such as corn through a gene from ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' (BT). The papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) that severely damages papaya trees was causing a major toll on the papaya industry in Hawaii. Genes for the protein coat of the virus were inserted into papaya tissue by using the gene gun. Some of the papaya cells incorporated the viral genes into their DNA, giving the plant immunity to PRSV. This saved the Hawaiian papaya industry. The introduction and use of BT crops is even more publicized. The BT gene codes for the Cry proteins which are toxic to and that specifically target and kill the larvae of butterflies and moths. By introducing this into plants, crops such as corn, rice, and potatoes were able to exhibit the Cry proteins, and have proved to be very effective at stopping insect pests such as the European corn borer caterpillar. The protein is very selective and does not harm other insects (e.g. beetles, flies, bees, wasps) and is also considered safe for human consumption. The use of the BT endotoxic has greatly reduced the use of pesticides on crops. However, issues concerning immunity of the pests to the BT corn are a problem, and refuge crops that do not contain the toxin are planted to reduce the evolution of the caterpillar immunity to the Cry proteins.

GMOs have also been bred to improve food nutritional quality, to induce a longer shelf-life by delaying senescence, to allow corn to grow in acidic soil, to protect strawberries from cold temperatures, and a variety of other uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sensory Systems ==

There are five major sensory systems that all humans exhibit those being: olfaction, taste, vision, hearing, and touch. Our senses provide us with the ability to understand and detect the environment around us. Each of these primary sensory systems contains specialized sensory neurons that transmit information through the form of nerve impulses or action potentials to the central nervous system. The action potentials that reach the brain from sensory neurons are called sensations. As the brain receives the information of sensations, the brain interprets them into colors, smells, sound, and tastes, which are also called perceptions, and gives stimuli. Sensations and perceptions are detected through sensory receptors. In human body, there are different specialized sensory receptors for different stimuli coming from inside and outside of the body. The sensory receptors that detect stimuli coming from outside of the body are called exteroreceptors, where as those that detect stimuli coming from inside of the body are called interoreceptors.
== Functions of Sensory Receptors ==

==== Sensory Transduction ====
Sensory Transduction is the conversion of stimulus energy into receptor potential, which is the change in membrane potential of a sensory receptor. As the ion channels in the sensory receptor's plasma membrane opens and closes, the ionic permeability of the membrane is changed, and results in receptor potentials. These sensory receptors can detect the smallest stimulus possible, which makes them really sensitive. 
==== Amplification ====
Amplification is when the cells in sensory pathway strengthens the stimulus energy in order for humans to have according reactions.
==== Transmission ====
After amplification, action potentials are transmitted to the CNS.
==== Integration ==== 
As the information is received in the CNS, through summation the receptor potentials are then being delivered to sensory receptors at different parts of the body are integrated. One type of integration is called adaptation, where it decreases the responsiveness of stimuli so we don't feel every stimuli that is there.

== Olfaction ==

Olfaction is very closely related to the sense of taste, since it has the ability to detect odors. A lot odorants are detected when they are carried as vapors into the nose. Many of these odorants are small organic molecules, which account for the smell of many familiar smells.

[[File:Odors1.jpg]]

Odorants are detected in a specific region of the nose, called the main olfactory epithelium, which lies at the top of the nasal cavity. Approximately 1 million sensory neurons line the surface of this region. The property that is responsible for the smell of these molecules is the shape of the molecule and not necessarily the physical properties.  The shape is the factor that matters the most because it determines how well it can bind to a specific surface, usually a protein receptor. Take for instance the molecule Carvone ((5R)-2-methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-en-1-one) which is chiral. Each enantiomer produces a different smell yet the only difference in the molecule is the way it is oriented, with no other physical differences.  The (R) enantiomer produces the spearmint smell while the (S) enantiomer produces the smell for the plant caraway.

[[File:Odors2.jpg]]

Biochemical research in olfactants suggested that G proteins played a role in detecting smells, and therefore it was determined that 7TM receptors were the cause. The seven-transmembrane-helix (7TM) receptors are responsible for transmitting information initiated by signals as diverse as photons, odorants, tastants, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Several thousand such receptors are known, and the list continues to grow. As the name indicates, these receptors contain seven helices that span the membrane bilayer, they are the largest class of cell receptors. The receptors are sometimes referred to as serpentine receptors because the single polypeptide chain “snakes” through the membrane seven times.

====Olfaction Receptor Cells====
There are neurons that line the upper part of the nasal cavity called olfaction receptor cells. When odorant molecules bind to these receptors, it triggers a signal transduction pathway that sends action potentials straight to the olfactory bulb of the brain. The odorant molecules only bind to specific receptor proteins. The different odors are determined by the binding of distinct odorants to selective receptors.

== Vision ==
[[File:EMSpec.jpg|thumb|Electromagnetic Spectrum]]
The sense of vision is based on the absorption of light by photoreceptor cells in the eye. Photoreceptor cells are sensitive to light in the region between 300-850nm in the electromagnetic spectrum. There are two types of photoreceptors, they are called rods and cones. A person’s retina contains around 3 million cones and 100 million rods cone receptors are responsible for colors and only function in bright light. Rods function in dim light and do not perceive color. The human retina contains two types of photoreceptors called rods and cones. Rods are light sensitive but cannot distinguish color. Cones, on the other hand, are able to distinguish color but are not as light sensitive as rods. Rods and cones both have visual pigments that contain the retinal, a light-absorbing molecule. Rods specifically contain rhodopsin, a pigment that is made up of the retinal attached to a particular opsin. When rods are exposed to light, the retinal molecule absorbs the light and it changes shape. In the retinal inactive state, the rod stays in the cis isomer. After the retinal of the rod absorbs light, it changes from cis isomer to the trans isomer. In the trans isomer, it also becomes unbound from the opsin. The outer segment of the rod is made up of disks that are stacked together. The rhodopsin is located within these disks. Once retinal absorbs light, this triggers a signal transduction pathway. First the rhodopsin gets activates by the absorption of light. The active rhodopsin activates transducing, a G protein. This G protein then activates the enzyme, phosphodiesterase. The activated phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP, which allows the cGMP to become removed from the sodium channel. Once the cGMP is removed, the sodium channels close and the rod hyperpolarizes as the membrane’s permeability to sodium decreases.

====In the Dark====
*Rhodopsin is inactive
*Sodium channels are open
*Rod is depolarized
*Rods and cones release glutamate, a neurotransmitter into synapses with neurons called bipolar cells
*Bipolar cell is either depolarized and hyperpolarized

====In Light====
*Rhodopsin is active
*Sodium chhanels are closed
*Rod is hyperpolarized
*No glutamate is released
*Bipolar cell is either depolarized and hyperpolarized

====Information Processing====
There are three types of neurons that aid in information processing in the retina. Ganglion cells are neurons that send signals from bipolar cells to the brain and contribute in long range signaling. Horizontal cells and amacrine cells help integrate information before it gets transmitted to the brain. Horizontal cells and amacrine cells participate in local signaling. The horizontal cells receive information from rods or cones and will reduce the effect of surrounding rods and cones, which helps to sharpen our image by increasing the contrast. Amacrine cells are activated by the bipolar cells and reduce the effect of surrounding bipolar and ganglia cells. Lateral inhibition is a specific type of integration that aids in creating a greater contrast in image. The optic chiasm is located near the cerebral cortex and is the area where the optic nerves meet and axons cross. The axons from the left visual field, in both the left and right eye, join and travel to the right side of the brain. Vice versa, the axons from the right visual field, join and travel to the left side of the brian.

== Taste ==
Usually when one has nasal congestion one can have difficulty tasting food. This is due to the fact that taste is a combination of senses that function by different mechanisms. The sense of taste can therefore be called the sister sense to olfaction. They are however very different in many ways. Tastants fall into five groups: sweet, salty, umami, bitter, and sour.

[[File:Tast1.jpg]]

The simplest of the tastants, the sodium ion, is perceived as salty while the hydrogen ion is considered sour. The salty taste is not caused by 7TM receptors, it is actually detected by the passage of sodium ion through channels expressed on the surface of cells in the tongue. Like salty tastes, sour tastes arise from the effect of hydrogen ions on channels. The taste called umami is caused by the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Usually one encounters glutamate as a salt called monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is used as a flavor enhancer. Glutamate and aspartate are the only amino acids that cause taste. The umami taste they emit is mediated by a heterodimeric receptor related to the sweet receptor. On the other hand, bitter and sweet tastants are caused by a wide range of different molecules. Many bitter tasting compounds are associated with being toxic. Most sweet compounds are carbohydrates, which are rich in energy and easily digestible. Some non-carbohydrate compounds such as saccharin and aspartame also taste sweet. Just as in olfaction, research pointed to the involvement of G proteins which, also meant that 7TM receptors detect the bitter and sweet taste.

[[File:Tast2.jpg]]

== Hearing ==
Hearing is based on the detection of mechanical stimuli. People can detect frequencies ranging from 200 to 20,000Hz, corresponding to times of 5 to 0.05ms. Our ability to hear noise is enhanced by the ability to detect where the noise is coming from. It the ability to detect time delay between the arrival of sound in one ear to the time it takes to reach the other. Sound waves are detected inside the cochlea, which is a fluid-filled membranous sac that is coiled like a snail. It is located in the inner part of the ear. Each cochlea has approximately 16,000 hair cells, which are responsible for sound detection. Within each hair cell there is approximately 20 to 300 hair-like projections called stereocilia.

=== Equilibrium ===
Not only do human ears can detect sound, the inner ear of humans can also detect body position and balance. hair cells in the utricle in inner ear respond when there is changes in head position due to gravity or movement. Different body positions can cause different hair cells and sensory neurons to be stimulated and send different message to the body. This is why some people get motion seasickness with the sudden change in movement or gravity.

== Touch ==
The sense of touch like other senses is a combination of many factors. Touch, detected by skin, senses pressure, temperature, and pain. Although currently biochemist do not necessarily know what exactly causes the sense of touch, it has been determined that specialized neurons, termed nociceptors transmit signals from skin to pain processing centers in the spinal cord and brain. It was determined that nociceptors play a role when studying spicy food. The molecule capsaicin activates nociceptors and is the molecule responsible for the “hot” taste. The capsaicin receptor, also called VR1, functions as a cation channel that initiates a nerve impulse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Proteases ==

Proteases are a protein-digestive enzyme that cleaves protein through hydrolysis, the addition of water to the peptide bond. Although hydrolysis of the peptide bond is thermodynamically favored, it is still a slow reaction without the enzyme. This is due to the fact that the peptide bond is very stable due to its resonance structure forming a partial double bond. The specificity of the peptide bond they hydrolyze is high.

A number of proteolytic enzymes participate in the breakdown of proteins in the digestive systems of mammals and other organisms. An example of a protein-digesting enzyme may be seen in the protease called pepsin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; Pepsin is one of two components of gastric juice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; Pepsin works by  attacking the exposed peptide bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; Unlike most enzymes which can be denatured when exposed to extreme pH, pepsin works at its optimal performance in a highly acidic environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; 

The 4 main class of proteases are: 
[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Serine Proteases|Serine Proteases]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cysteine Proteases|Cysteine Proteases]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Aspartyl Proteases|Aspartyl Proteases]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Metalloproteases|Metalloproteases]].

=== Serine ===

Serine Proteases use serine residue to create a nucleophilic amino acid that cleaves the peptide bond. They are responsible for various functions such as blood clotting, and digestion
One such enzyme, known as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]], cleaves peptide bonds selectively on the carboxyl terminal side of the large hydrophobic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine. Chymotrypsin is a good example of the use of covalent catalysis.

[[File:Serine protease mechanism by snellios.png]]

=== Cysteine, Aspartyl, Metalloproteases ===

Not all proteases utilize strategies based on activated serine residues. Classes of proteins have been discovered that employ three other approaches to peptide-bond hydrolsis:

1. Cysteine Proteases
2. Aspartyl Proteases
3. Metalloproteases

In each case, the strategy is to generate a nucleophile that attacks the peptide carbonyl group.

An example of a Cysteine Protease is papain, which is found in the papaya fruit. The catalytic mechanism that this enzyme uses to hydrolyze a peptide bond involves the activation of a cysteine residue by a histidine residue, both present in the active site. The result of this activation is a powerful nucleophile that is able to attack the carbon present in the carbonyl group present next to the peptide bond.

[[File:Cysteine Protease.jpg]]

Aspartyl proteases are a type of proteolytic enzymes classified under endonucleases. Aspartyl proteases are known to exist in vertebrates, plants, plant viruses, as well as in retroviruses. Aspartyl proteases is characterized by having a frequent sequence of Asp- Thr- Gly amino acid triad. Most aspartate proteases are found as monomeric enzymes consisting of two domains. Aspartyl proteases are important for the human body in regulating blood pressure, health, and digestion.

[[File:Aspartyl protease mechanism.png]]

An example of Metalloprotease would be Zinc Metalloproteases which include the digestive enzymes carboxypeptidases, various matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) that are secreted by cells, and one lysosomal protease. MMP's have the role of degrading extracellular matrix during tissue remodeling, cell signaling the release of cytokines or growth factors through cleavage of proteins.

=== Protease Inhibitors ===
Several important drugs are [[Structural Biochemistry/Antivirals|Protease Inhibitors]]. 
HIV protease is a type of aspartyl protease that can be inhibited.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction into Proteinase Cleavage Sites==
[[File:PBB Protein PRTN3 image.jpg|thumb|example of a proteinase]]Proteinases are important enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds in amino acids of proteins. They make up about 2% of all gene products and are significant in biotechnology and medicine because their effector function can be easily targeted by small peptide-based inhibitors. Many human diseases are caused by the malfunction of proteolytic activity, which can have very devastating consequences. 

Proteinases can be classified into six types according to their catalytic function. These six types include serine (S), cysteine (C), threonine (T), aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E) and metallo catalytic types. Another type of classification is seen on the basis of the kind of reaction they catalyze. These include endoproteinase, which hydrolyze interal alpha-peptide bonds in a polypeptide; and exoproteinase which require a free N-terminal group, C-terminal group or both in order to hydrolyze a peptide bond that is not more than 3 residues from the terminus. Endoproteinases and exoproteinases depend on pH. Exoproteinases are usually involved in the degradative processes such as food digestion, proteasome phagocytosis, and proteasomal digestion. Endoproteinases are usually highly specific for target sequences. 

In order for proteins to be cleaved, they must first bind to the active site of the proteinase. For those proteins that are involved in biological processes, the cleavage either activates, inactivates, or modifies the substrate in some pathway. The active site of proteinase has conterminous S pockets which will accommodate several consecutive amino acids from the substrate. The P1 site is termed as the amino acid that is C-terminally cleaved. Additional sites are N-terminal from P1 (labeled as P2,P3,etc.) which are accommodated by corresponding S sites in the catalytic pocket of the proteinase. For some proteinases, the specificity of the substrate is defined by the number of subsites in the active site and by the size, shape and charge of the side chains. The 3-D structure of the substrate guides the compatibility between the S sites in the substrate binding pocket.

==Cleavage Site Prediction Tools==
There are several tools that can be used to predict the possible substrates for the proteinases and most likely locations of cleavage. One tool is called PoPS which is used for modeling and predicting proteinase specificity. PeptideCutter is used for prediction of potential cleavage sites for proteases. GraBCas has been used for prediction of the sites cleaved by granzymeB and capsases. CASPredictor for caspase substrate prediction. GraBCas and CaSPredictor are two tools that are specific for certain proteins, making them limited in applicability. Other tools are very complex and have a really troublesome user interface. Therefore, the development of 'SitePrediction' has provided researchers with a user-friendly tool that helps to predict possible cleavage sites in specific substrates based on the cleavage sites that were found in literature or experiments. Other features have also been invested in SitePrediction, such as secondary structure prediction, solvent accessibility and PEST structure prediction. 

The main goal of all of these tools is to predict the location of cleavage sites in candidate substrates. There are three main steps in determining the applicability and reliability of these tools. First is the defining of which protease specificity should be utilized and which protein sequence needs to be analyzed. Second, the reliability of the prediction can be determined from the different calculation methods. Third, prediction value can be increased with the secondary features that are implemented in the SitePrediction.

===User Input===
In terms of the first step of the three main steps in determining applicability of these tools, two main decisions have to be made about the input itself: what is the protease of interest and which substrate should be used to predict possible cleavage sites? Some tools allow the user to enter the substrate sequences one by one in FASTA form, such as GraBCas, POPS, and PeptideCutter while other tools make the entry of a list of FASTA formats such as CaSPredictor and SitePrediction. SitePrediction allows the user to insert a list of common identifications such as SwissProt identifiers. 

However, one of the most important steps in cleavage site prediction is to define the specificity of the chosen protease. GraBCas and CaSPredictor only allow for certain proteases such as granzyme B and some caspases. PeptideCutter gives more room for options but only offers the use of fixed consensus sites. PoPS allows for the choice of a list of predefined protease. SitePrediction allows for the entry of 'known cleavage sites' from a list that is based on literature and experiments from database. These cleavage site-lists are used to calculate a relevant statistics profile. Cleavage site analysis can be seen through SiteProduction in two ways: a logo and a histogram.

===Scoring Methods===
The distinction among the several tools mentioned is the scoring method for prediction of cleavage sites in a substrate. The simplest tool (PeptideCutter) looks for occurrences of fixed consensus cleavage sites in the substrate. All of the other tools mentioned uses a frequency score that can indicate whether the amino acids of the cleavage sites are likely to happen at that position. The score will contain errors though. One example can be seen in CaSPredictor when it adds the frequency of each position instead of multiplying them. SitePrediction also uses a secondary score that is based on the similarity of the cleavage sites. This is done usually through BLOSUM 62 or other substitution matrices.

===Extra Features===
The extra features such as statistics, PEST sequences, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure are also important parts of the tools. SitePrediction and PoPS offer some of these extra features besides the common prediction of cleavage sites in substrates. These extra features are important in helping out the prediction mechanism of the cleavage sites and adding additional information. One important feature in SitePrediction is the statistics calculation. This gives the user a better look into the quality of the input sites and threshold scores the predicted cleavage sites by comparing the scores of experimentally known sites with those of the ones being tested or the random sequences. In addition, both SitePrediction and PoPS give extra predictions such as PEST region. These are regions that are rich in P, E, S, and T that could show that they are more susceptible to proteolysis and may affect the cleavage site prediction results by forming unstructured loops. An additional feature is added in the SitePrediction by integrating the SSPro package, which will help predict the solvent accessibility and secondary structures.

==Evaluation of Extra Features on SitePrediction==
===Statistics===
The SitePrediction tool was used to estimate the quality of the prediction with its statistical features. It was ran against input cleavage sites of both caspase-3 and calpain-2. [[File:Caspase 3.png|thumb|Caspase 3]]An effective means of evaluating the SitePrediction extra feature was with the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic). It is defined as the plot of the sensitivity versus its false positive rate. The accuracy of the ROC curve is measured by the AUC which is the area under the curve. The values of caspase-3 and calpain-2 came out to be 0.995 and 0.951, which shows that the calculations were very accurate under the input sites.

===PEST Analysis===
[[File:PDB 1mdw EBI.jpg|thumb|left|Calpain-2]]
PEST analysis extra feature of SitePrediction was applied on the predicted substrates of caspase-3 and calpain-2, granzyme-B and cathepsin-D. The percent of amino acids in PEST regions was calcualted for all of the substrates and they were compared to the translated transcripts of the human genome found currently in the NCBI. In theory, the human proteome has 3.46% of all amino acids that are calculated to be in the PEST sequences. By observing the percentage of the substrate that contain PEST sequences, a clear difference is revealed in that only 33% of the human proteins are predicted to contain PEST sequences. Compared to 58%, 50%, 58%, and 39% of the caspase-3, calpain-2, granzyme-B, and cathepsin-D substrates, respectively.

[[File:PDB 1lyb EBI.jpg|thumb|cathepsin-D]]
===Solvent Accessibility and Structure Prediction===
For caspase-3, a percentage of 53.9% of all amino acids of the known substrates were predicted to be 'exposed.' This is compared to 68.15% for the experimental cleavage sites. The predictions for the substrates of calpain-2 and granzyme-B showed an increase of exposed amino acid residues while cathepsin-D results revealed a minimal decrease. This meant that the cleavage sites may be available in protein regions that are more readily accessible to solvent than the rest of the substrate. However, when the solvent accessibility is used as an extra factor, caution must be taken in analysis of known substrates. 

SitePrediction also has a secondary structure prediction feature that can determine whether the presence or absence of a secondary structure would play a role in the prediction of potential cleavage sites. [[File:PDB 1fq3 EBI.jpg|thumb|left|granzyme-B]]The cleavage sites of caspase-3 and granzyme-B are situated in the unstructured sequences while that of calpain-2 is present equally in structured and unstructured. On a different note, cathepsin-D cleavage sites are present in structured regions. All of these observations are in agreement with the functions of these different proteases. This, in turn, could be a determining factor in the prediction of the likelihood of potential cleavage sites.

So you’ve defined a new operator in your addon. Now it would be nice to give that addon a proper interface, so the user doesn’t have to hunt through the spacebar menu to find that operator.

The nicest way to do this is to define a ''panel'' that shows up in a window somewhere, with controls in it that the user can click on to operate your addon. You can put the panel in all kinds of places, but here we will insert it in the Tool Shelf (which can be hidden or shown on the left side of the 3D View by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}}.

== Your First Panel ==

A panel is defined by subclassing the &lt;TT&gt;bpy.types.Panel&lt;/TT&gt; class. You set the value of various attributes (&lt;TT&gt;bl_space_type&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;bl_region_type&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;bl_category&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;bl_context&lt;/TT&gt;) to determine the context in which the panel will appear, and also give a title to the panel (&lt;TT&gt;bl_label&lt;/TT&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class TetrahedronMakerPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    bl_space_type = &quot;VIEW_3D&quot;
    bl_region_type = &quot;TOOLS&quot;
    bl_context = &quot;objectmode&quot;
    bl_category = &quot;Create&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Those first three attributes cause the panel to appear in the Tool Shelf, but only while the 3D View is in Object mode.The bl_category 
line determines the toolbar tab the addon is placed in, and only applies to the toolbars with tabs (added 2.7). Specify any existing tab, or define a new one.

Your class also needs to define a &lt;TT&gt;draw&lt;/TT&gt; method, which defines the items that go into the panel. This example creates a new column of UI elements for the panel, and inserts a single UI element which is a button that will invoke the operator with the name you previously defined when clicked:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
    def draw(self, context):
        TheCol = self.layout.column(align=True)
        TheCol.operator(&quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;, text=&quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;)
    #end draw
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding Undo Support ==

While we’re at it, go back and add the following line to the operator definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
    bl_options = {&quot;UNDO&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows the user to undo the addition of the tetrahedron in the usual way with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|Z}}, and redo it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|SHIFT|Z}}.

== Put It All Together ==

Here is the complete script for the addon as it stands now:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math
import bpy
import mathutils

class TetrahedronMakerPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    bl_space_type = &quot;VIEW_3D&quot;
    bl_region_type = &quot;TOOLS&quot;
    bl_context = &quot;objectmode&quot;
    bl_category = &quot;Create&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;

    def draw(self, context):
        TheCol = self.layout.column(align=True)
        TheCol.operator(&quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;, text=&quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;)
    #end draw

#end TetrahedronMakerPanel

class MakeTetrahedron(bpy.types.Operator):
    bl_idname = &quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_options = {&quot;UNDO&quot;}

    def invoke(self, context, event):
        Vertices = \
          [
            mathutils.Vector((0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3))),
          ]
        NewMesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
        NewMesh.from_pydata \
          (
            Vertices,
            [],
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
          )
        NewMesh.update()
        NewObj = bpy.data.objects.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;, NewMesh)
        context.scene.objects.link(NewObj)
        return {&quot;FINISHED&quot;}
    #end invoke

#end MakeTetrahedron

bpy.utils.register_class(MakeTetrahedron)
bpy.utils.register_class(TetrahedronMakerPanel)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the addition of another &lt;CODE&gt;register_class&lt;/CODE&gt; call for our custom panel.

As before, hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}} to execute it. Nothing should appear to happen; Blender processes your subclass definitions, and registers them for use, as requested, in the appropriate places.

But now, go back to the 3D View. Make sure you are in Object mode. Bring up the Tool Shelf if it isn’t visible, by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}}. At the bottom; in the tab you have specified, you should see your new panel appear:

[[File:BlenderTetrahedronAddonPanel.png|center]]

Note the triangle next to the title that Blender automatically gives you, to collapse or expand the panel without any extra work on your part. Get rid of any tetrahedron object that might have been created by following the tutorial on the previous page; now click your new “Add Tetrahedron” button, and watch the object be created again!

== Space Types, Region Types, Contexts, Oh My! ==

Those values for &lt;TT&gt;bl_space_type&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;bl_region_type&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;bl_context&lt;/TT&gt; are (partially) listed [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_68_release/bpy.types.Panel.html here] in the Blender API documentation, but not fully explained. Here’s a list of permissible values for each that I found from looking at source code:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

| &lt;TT&gt;bl_space_type&lt;/TT&gt; || &quot;EMPTY&quot;, &quot;VIEW_3D&quot;, &quot;TIMELINE&quot;, &quot;GRAPH_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;DOPESHEET_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;NLA_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;IMAGE_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;SEQUENCE_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;CLIP_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;TEXT_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;NODE_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;LOGIC_EDITOR&quot;, &quot;PROPERTIES&quot;, &quot;OUTLINER&quot;, &quot;USER_PREFERENCES&quot;, &quot;INFO&quot;, &quot;FILE_BROWSER&quot;, &quot;CONSOLE&quot; || &lt;TT&gt;space_type_items&lt;/TT&gt; in &lt;TT&gt;[https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/blender/source/blender/makesrna/intern/rna_space.c rna_space.c]&lt;/TT&gt;

Presumably, not all combinations will make sense.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
As we all have known that cellular energy is inevitably important for metabolism of the body in all organisms, one important factor controlling all those metabolic pathways is enzymes. Most enzymes are proteins, which are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The precursor for protein synthesis are amino acids, which are obtains from the translation of RNA's, which come from the transcription of DNA. Therefore, DNA and RNA play major roles in metabolism. In order to synthesize DNA and RNA, there is one important precursor, which is Pentose Phosphate. There is a pathway which produces Pentose Phosphate and NADPH (which has a phosphate group at 2'-C of NADH instead of the hydroxyl group)

==The Pathway==
The pathway has 6 steps:
# It starts with Glucose 6-Phosphate, Glu 6-P, which comes from other pathways, glycolysis for example.
# Instead of using the enzyme glucose 6-phosphate isomerase to isomerize the original reactant into fructose 6-phosphate for glycolysis, cells use another enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and one important cofactor, NADP+, to oxidize the Glu 6-P into 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone with NADP+ being reduced to NADPH.
# Next, the enzyme lactonase hydrolyzes 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone into 6-phosphogluconate.
# In this step, cofactor NADP+ is used again as an oxidizing agent to oxidize 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase with the reduced NADPH as another product and the release of carbon dioxide.
# Note that in every step of the pathway, an addition of Magnesium cation helps stabilizing the reactions, which involves releases of electrons and protons.
# In a ketose-aldose reaction catalyzed by the enzyme phosphopentose isomerase, ribulose 5-phosphate is isomerized into ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for later important reactions, such as DNA synthesis.

==Conclusion==
The Pentose Phosphate pathway produces to important precursors for basic building blocks of life:
# The production of ribose for the synthesis of some cofactors, DNA, RNA.
# The production of NADPH for the synthesis of fatty acids, steroids, and other oxidation-reduction reactions (some occur in photosynthesis, especially in the Calvin cycle)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{displaytitle|title=Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Blender Scripting/Adding A Custom Property}}

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

{{B3D:N2P/NAV
|previous=Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Addon User Interface
|previousText=A User Interface For Your Addon
|next=Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Separately Installable Addon
|nextText=A Separately Installable Addon
}}

Addons will commonly do more than unconditionally perform a single action; the user may be able to control their actions in various ways. We can add controls for adjusting settings to our addon panel, and associate these with custom ''properties'' that we define for the current scene; Blender will then take care of updating the property values as the user operates those controls, and our operator’s &lt;TT&gt;invoke&lt;/TT&gt; routine can fetch those property values when it runs.

== Defining A Property ==

Properties need to be defined at the same time our custom classes get registered. We previously did this in top-level statements, but now let’s gather it all together into a ''register'' method, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def register() :
    bpy.utils.register_class(MakeTetrahedron)
    bpy.utils.register_class(TetrahedronMakerPanel)
    bpy.types.Scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted = bpy.props.BoolProperty \
      (
        name = &quot;Upside Down&quot;,
        description = &quot;Generate the tetrahedron upside down&quot;,
        default = False
      )
#end register
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we are attaching the property as a new attribute of Blender’s &lt;TT&gt;Scene&lt;/TT&gt; class; Python lets us assign new attributes to just about any object, and Blender takes full advantage of that. Note that the property must be created using one of the property-definition routines provided in &lt;TT&gt;bpy.props&lt;/TT&gt;: choose the one that matches the type of property you want to create. Here we are defining a simple true/false toggle, which the user will control via a checkbox. Whatever name you use for your custom class attribute, an instance of that class will have an attribute with the same name, holding the actual value for that property.

The &lt;TT&gt;name&lt;/TT&gt; will be used as the name of a control for examining or changing this property, while the &lt;TT&gt;description&lt;/TT&gt; will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over the control. The &lt;TT&gt;default&lt;/TT&gt; is used as the initial value of the property.

Note also I tried to use a name, &lt;TT&gt;make_tetrahedron_inverted&lt;/TT&gt;, which is less likely to clash with names defined by other addons or parts of Blender.

Let’s also add an &lt;TT&gt;unregister&lt;/TT&gt; method, which undoes everything that &lt;TT&gt;register&lt;/TT&gt; does. This won’t actually be used for now, but it will become relevant later when we extract the addon for separate installation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def unregister() :
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(MakeTetrahedron)
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(TetrahedronMakerPanel)
    del bpy.types.Scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted
#end unregister
&lt;/source&gt;

To make the checkbox appear, add the following line to our panel’s &lt;TT&gt;draw&lt;/TT&gt; routine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
       TheCol.prop(context.scene, &quot;make_tetrahedron_inverted&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
The first argument to the &lt;TT&gt;prop&lt;/TT&gt; method must be an instance of the class to which we attached our property definition above; in this case, it is the current scene.

Finally, we need to finish off our script with the following bit of boilerplate which will invoke our registration routine in the situations (like the Text Editor) where Blender doesn't do it for us:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; :
    register()
#end if
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using The Property ==

Now we actually need to use the property in our operator’s &lt;TT&gt;execute&lt;/TT&gt; routine. We’ll use it to negate a scale factor which will be applied to the Z coordinate of the vertices of the tetrahedron:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        Scale = -1 if context.scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted else 1
&lt;/source&gt;

But only the last vertex has a nonzero Z coordinate, so this is the only one that needs a change in its computation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        Vertices = \
          [
            mathutils.Vector((0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0, 0, Scale * math.sqrt(2 / 3))),
          ]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Put It All Together ==

To recap all our changes, here is the complete updated script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math
import bpy
import mathutils

class TetrahedronMakerPanel(bpy.types.Panel) :
    bl_space_type = &quot;VIEW_3D&quot;
    bl_region_type = &quot;TOOLS&quot;
    bl_context = &quot;objectmode&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;

    def draw(self, context) :
        TheCol = self.layout.column(align = True)
        TheCol.prop(context.scene, &quot;make_tetrahedron_inverted&quot;)
        TheCol.operator(&quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;, text = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;)
    #end draw

#end TetrahedronMakerPanel

class MakeTetrahedron(bpy.types.Operator) :
    bl_idname = &quot;mesh.make_tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_label = &quot;Add Tetrahedron&quot;
    bl_options = {&quot;UNDO&quot;}

    def invoke(self, context, event) :
        Scale = -1 if context.scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted else 1
        Vertices = \
          [
            mathutils.Vector((0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0)),
            mathutils.Vector((0, 0, Scale * math.sqrt(2 / 3))),
          ]
        NewMesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
        NewMesh.from_pydata \
          (
            Vertices,
            [],
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
          )
        NewMesh.update()
        NewObj = bpy.data.objects.new(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;, NewMesh)
        context.scene.objects.link(NewObj)
        return {&quot;FINISHED&quot;}
    #end invoke

#end MakeTetrahedron

def register() :
    bpy.utils.register_class(MakeTetrahedron)
    bpy.utils.register_class(TetrahedronMakerPanel)
    bpy.types.Scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted = bpy.props.BoolProperty \
      (
        name = &quot;Upside Down&quot;,
        description = &quot;Generate the tetrahedron upside down&quot;,
        default = False
      )
#end register

def unregister() :
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(MakeTetrahedron)
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(TetrahedronMakerPanel)
    del bpy.types.Scene.make_tetrahedron_inverted
#end unregister

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; :
    register()
#end if
&lt;/source&gt;

As before, execute the script with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}}. Check the Tool Shelf in the 3D View, and your panel should now look like this:
[[File:BlenderTetrahedronAddonPanel2.png|center]]

Try executing it with and without the checkbox checked, and you should end up with two tetrahedra pointing in opposite directions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Nematodes=
Nematodes are one of the most diverse phylums of all animals. Half of the 28,000 different species of nematodes are parasitic. Nematodes, a type of roundworm, have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends. Found in nearly all parts of the world, nematodes have adapted to almost all ecosystems, characterized by varying levels of water salinity, temperature, and altitude. Not only have they adapted, nematodes have evolved to outnumber other animals that coexist in the same ecosystems. For example, nematodes constitute 90% of all life on the seafloor.

Although some nematodes are completely dependent on other types of animals for reproduction, some of the strategies used by nematodes seem rather advanced. For example, the parasitic tetradonematid nematode is hypothesized to induce fruit mimicry in tropical ants. Infected ants develop bright red gasters, tend to be more sluggish, and walk with their gasters in a conspicuous elevated position. These changes likely cause frugivorous birds to confuse the infected ants for berries and eat them. Parasite eggs passed in the bird's feces are subsequently collected by foraging Cephalotes atratus and are fed to their larvae, thus completing the tetradonematid life cycle. 

==The genomes of nematodes are distinct from other metazoans==
RNA regulation is an important and pervasive process, made possible by both RNA molecules and RNA-binding proteins. RNA molecules function as regulators and targets in diverse pathways pertinent to the proper decoding of the genome. RNA-binding proteins act as effectors of RNA stability and translation efficiency, guide transcripts to defined locations within the cell, control the fidelity of gene decoding, and function as cofactors to promote the activity of functional and structural RNA molecules.

===Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism===
The facile genetics of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans make it a useful  observational model organism for the study of RNA regulatory mechanisms. The function of specific genes in this organism can be disrupted in a relatively straightforward manner by RNA interference (RNAi). The use of RNAi allows researchers to determine the function of specific genes, by silencing their functions in certain ways. In another important application, it was discovered that this organism showed behavioral responses to nicotine, including acute response, tolerance, withdrawal, and sensitization.

===Nematodes contain an expanded genome===
A surprising discovery based on the laboratory study of C. elegans is that the genome of nematodes contains an expansion of putative RNA-binding proteins relative to other metazoans. The RNA-binding protein Pumilio has 11 homologs in, while it has only two homologs in humans. The CCCH-type tandem zinc finger (TZF) family, which includes the mammalian protein tristetraprolin (TTP) has 16 homologs in roundworms. Lastly, there exists 27 Argonaute homologs in nematodes.

A homologous trait is any characteristic of organisms that is derived from a common ancestor. Paralogs are homologs present in the same species, and usually differ in function. Paralogs arise from gene duplication. Orthologs are homologs present in different species, and usually are similar in function. Orthologs usually arise from speciation when one species diverges into two separate species. Homology among proteins, DNA, and RNA is often concluded on the basis of sequence similarity. It is more effective to compare amino acid sequences than nucleotide base sequences because there are 20 distinct amino acids and only 4 distinct nucleotide bases.

Forward and reverse genetic experiments have provided data, which highlight the basis for the expansion of  nematode homologs. Specifically, the data indicate that the RNA-binding family expansions may play roles in germline development, gametogenesis, and early embryogenesis.

===The PUF family of RNA-binding proteins===
The founding members of the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins are Pumilio and FBF, which together maintain the population of progenitor cells in the distal region of the germline. This group promotes the cellular switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis at the onset of adulthood. During the transition from mitosis to meiosis when the single-celled state becomes a syncytial region, the meiotic nuclei recellularize. Spermatocytes are formed first during the L4 larval stage and stored in the spermatheca, which are then converted to oocytes.

PUF-8 and PUF-9 are biochemically similar to enzymes, in that one of their RNA-binding properties includes a high level of specificity. For instance, the eight nucleotide (5’-UGURNNAUA-3’) that is recognized by the PUF domains differs by a single nucleotide from the nucleotide NRE (Nanos Response Element). NRE is only a single nucleotide shorter than FBE, yet the FBR is discriminated by the two PUF elements more than 30-fold.

The nematode TZF binding specificity is different than the nematode PUF binding specificity. MEX-5 is a TZF protein that binds with a high affinity but relaxed specificity to any uridine rich sequence. The relaxed specificity means that TZF binds to both uridine rich sequences and polyuridine, while TTP binds more that 80-fold more tightly to AREs than polyuridine.

==Conclusion==
The function of RNA-binding proteins, like all proteins, is dictated by their structure. Novel function of RNA-binding protein families, with a common domain characterized by a new binding specificity, is a based on structural changes. Biochemistry and genetics serves as a basis for the identification of critical sequence elements and structural changes, yet fails to provide a mechanistic explanation of how these elements directly relate to novel function. Evidently, further research is necessary in the area of structural studies in an RNA-binding family.

      <comment>/* Absorption and metabolism of nicotine */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Marlboro Cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Marlboro Cigarettes]]
Tobacco is a crop that is one of the main ingredients in cigarettes.  It is classified as a stimulant. Tobacco leads as the drug that produces the most dependence. This dependence stems from one of its ingredients, nicotine. The most common method of consumption of this drug is through smoking. Nicotine is the main psychoactive ingredient in tobacco. Although it is most commonly used as a recreational drug, it has been shown to have medical uses. Tobacco belongs to the plant genus Nicotiana. The nicotine in these plants evolved as a mechanism to defend against insects. Insects that taste the plant would get a dose of neurotoxin. Commercially, these plants have been cultivated and farmed as a recreational drug that acts as a stimulant to the brain.

==Pharmacodynamics==
[[File:Acetylcholine.svg|thumb|Acetylcholine]]
Nicotine has a very similar chemical structure to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Due to the similarity in structure, nicotine is able to bind to receptors and activate Cholinergic receptors, just as acetlycholine normally could. When acetlcholine binds to these receptors, it is thought to stimulate brain functions and help muscle control. It plays a large role in brain process speed. The structural similarity of nicotine allows it to activate these receptors much as acetlycholine can.

==Absorption and metabolism of nicotine==
When chewed, nicotine is absorbed readily in the lungs or through the oral mucosa. With frequent use of tobacco, levels of nicotine accumulate in the body during the day and remain overnight. Thus, tobacco users are exposed to the effects of nicotine for twenty four hours a day. Since the metabolism and the secretion of nicotine depend on a variety of factors, the drug may be detected in the body and urine even four days after the last cigarette smoked.

==Behavioral Effects==
Nicotine has the following behavioral effects: 
# Euphoria
# psychostimulant
# anxiousness
# muscle relaxation
# analgesic (reduces pain)
# decrease appetite.

Nicotine also has adverse effects if used during pregnancy. It is toxic and will affect the infant. If a woman is smoking, the toxin and chemicals enter her bloodstream and subsequently the baby will get them via the blood stream. It is one of the reasons for sudden infant death syndrome. SIDS means that a baby under the age of one suddenly dies without an apparent reason. Nicotine may also cause miscarriages and low baby birth weight. Therefore, it is not advisable to smoke during pregnancy because it can have adverse effects for the fetus.

==Nesbitt's Paradox==
Nesbitt's paradox is one of the famous experiments and observations about nicotine. Although nicotine is classified as a stimulant, and in most ways it acts like a stimulant, nicotine also has been shown to produce relaxation. Nicotine is sometimes described as having anti-anxiety and anti-stress properties. Yet at the same time, it stimulates functions in the brain.
==Stages of Tobacco Addiction==
There are three stages of Tobacco addiction:
{| class=&quot;Stages of Tobacco addiction&quot;
|-
! Stages !! Effect
|-
| Stage 1 || Psychosocial
|-
| Stage 2 || Pleasurable
|-
| Stage 3 || Negative Reinforcement &quot;hooked&quot;
|}

==Withdrawal==
The onset of Tobacco withdrawal occurs around: 12–24 hours. It can last up to 10 days. The major symptoms of tobacco withdrawal include: intense cravings, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, sleep disorders, increased hunger (Mainly for carbohydrates), decreased heart rate, decreased metabolism, and fatigue. These symptoms make sense when it is realized that the nicotine in tobacco stimulates human brain function. It increases heart rate and helps combat fatigue. Withdrawal would subsequently present converse adverse effects.

==Treatment Methods==
[[File:Varenicline.svg|thumb|Varenicline]]
Because tobacco is used by such a large number of people, methods of treatments also come in a wide variety. One of the ways addiction is teated for is through cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a psychotherapist method in which addicted patients have the chance to talk about their addictions. Another method people use (although less frequently) is called motivational enhancement. This is usually when therapists have sessions geared towards motivating the patient to quit. Although these therapeutic methods have been proven to work, there are also pharmacological aids that can be used to combat addiction. A few examples are listed here:
# Buproprion- Its trade name is Zyban. This is a typical antidepressant. It's main action is Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition. By blocking this, it acts as a nicotine antagonist. It doesn't allow nicotine to bind to the active site and start the normal behavioral changes associated with smoking or tobacco. Trials with placebos ahve shown that this drug significantly lowers cravings for nicotine and helps to stop the effects of withdrawal associated with tobacco. This drug is classified as having a low abuse potential.
# Varenicline- Its trade name is Chantix. This is a nicotine partial antagonist. It is presented as a tablet that can be taken once or twice a day with water. This drug essentially blocks nicotine's ability to activate the a4b2 receptors that is responsible for the effects of nicotine. This drug can also help block nicotine withdrawal. This benefit makes it one of the more used drugs when dealing with tobacco addiction. Recent studies have shown however, that some people may exhibit hostility, agitation, suicidal thoughts, and/or depressed moods why taking this drug. However, this is only shown in people who take Varenicline while still smoking. It is important to note that this drug does not work immediately and it may take up to 12 weeks for the complete removal of addiction.

Instead of pharmacological aids, substitutes for nicotine have also been shown to help treat for addiction:
# Gum- This gum helps to lower the cravings for nicotine and helps stop the adverse effects of nicotine withdrawal. This is a substitute because the gum contains small doses of nicotine. By following a preset plan, lower and lower amounts of nicotine is chewed and ideally leads to the cessation of cravings for cigarettes. However, in few cases, it has been shown that a switch to addiction for nicotine gum is possible.
# Patch- The patch is a method of treatment that is similar to gum. These patches release controlled amounts of nicotine through the skin which helps stop the craving for nicotine. Ideally, it will eventually lead to a stop in the desire for cigarettes.
# Non-smoke cigarettes- These are essentially cigarettes that have been 'made clean' by removing tar and other bad chemicals from the cigarette itself. However, the side effects of smoke entering the lungs and lung cancer have not been shown to be lowered by non-smoke cigarettes. Regardless, this is a method of substitution for real cigarettes.

==Potential Medical Uses==
* Alzheimer's treatment- Alzheimer is a disease that effects the brain. It can lead to problems with memory, thinking, cognition, and behavior. Tobacco has shown signs of improving cognitive performance. One of the ingredients in tobacco 'cotinine' has been researched and shown to protect brain cells. This is highly important because if scientists are able to protect brain cells, it will slow down or even prevent brain damage caused by Alzheimer and could potentially be one of the cures.

*Analgesic- Tobacco has been shown to be able to increase pain thresholds and decrease pain. It could potentially be used as an analgesic in the hospital to relieve patients of pain or increase their pain threshold before entering surgery.

*Weight control- As mentioned earlier, one of the behavioral effects of tobacco is a loss of appetite. Scientists are tying to study and create a non-addictive drug that will be able to lower the cravings for food through the use of tobacco.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Origin DNA melting and unwind in DNA replication
       Because of the development of structure biochemistry, we come up some different of opinions which are based on different helicases in different cells. We use some biochemical methods to find the function of helicases and the mechanisms of the intiation of the DNA replication.
There are two typical models, E1 and LTag. Because they have some differences in their structure, so they do their work in different ways.
  E1 mechanism: In the E1 hexammer, the six ß-hairpins in the central channel are arranged in a staircase-like structure. Two adjacent E1 trimers assemble ate the origins to melt the origin.Then a ring shaped E1 hexamer is formed around the melted ssDNA to from a fork.
    Ltag: The channel diameters of these hexamers vary between 13-17 A, and has planar ß-hairpins in the channel. The origin was pumping into the channel, and squeezing by the channel, so it remodeled, and the hydrogen between base pair are broken up. Then when the two subunits go to a relative large chamber, the melting region expanded. At last, the ssDNA go into the Zn-domain.
    Although, the two mechanism is built up on the structural data base, it still needs more experiments support. 
     As we know, there are really so many kinds of helicases. Now, we are working on the most simple helicases, and try to find the different mechanisms. They have some similarities, such as they all have the hexamer structure. However, they have some differences, either. For they always have some differences in their structures, contribute huge differences in their function and mechanisms.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to the CCN Family==
The CCN family consists of six secreted extracellular matrix associated proteins (CCN1 – CCN6). The CCN family was named as an acronym of the names of the first three CCN proteins discovered: Cyr61 (cysteine rich protein 61), CTGF (Connective Tissue Growth Factor), and NOV (nephoroblastoma overexpressed gene). The CCN family acts as key regulator of the ECM components and as signaling molecules involve in a variety of important biological functions. This includes adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, skeletal development and chrondrogenesis, angiogenesis and wound repair, and regulation of cell proliferation.

==CCN Structure and Domains==
[[File:CNNstructure.jpg|right|thumb|CNNstructure|This picture depicts the four domains that make up the CCN protein structure and the different molecules each domain binds to.]]
In terms of structure, contains an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, four similar functional domains, the same organization, a common intron/extron pattern, a similar primary structure (a 40 – 60% similarity). All six CCNs have five exons, with the first exon corresponds to a signal sequence and the rest a discrete protein module. The CCN family members feature four functional domains: 1)An insulin-like growth factor bind protein-like module (IGFBP), 2) a von Willebrand factor type C repeat module (VWC), 3) a thrombospondin type-1 repeat module, and 4) a cysteine-knot-containing module (except CCN5). Each domain is separated by linker regions which are susceptible to proteolysis. Proteolysis acts as a regulator of CCN protein activity by cleaving the linker regions resulting in the production of truncated molecules and individual modules. The six members also contain 38 conserved cysteine residues which vary in length and composition throughout the family. These residues are located right after the VWC domain and acts as a hinge between the first and second half of the protein. 

'''IGFBP''': The IGFBP family consists of IGFBPs that have a high affinity to and bind to insulin-like growth factors. This allows them to control the transport, localization and metabolic breakdown of the IGFs. IGFBP domains are typically multidomain proteins with distinct cysteine-rich N- and C-terminal domains linked by variable linker region. The N-terminal domains are globular in structure and have 12 conserved cysteine residues while the C-termianl domain has 6 conserved cysteine residues. N- and C –domain work together in concert to contain and bind IGF molecules with high affinity. 

CCN family’s IGFBP domain shares strong sequence similarity to the N-terminal domain of traditional IGFBP but lacks the C-terminal domain and thus binds IGF quite poorly. Scientists have created a model of the CCN’s IGFBP domain using a CPH model. To construct the model they used the 80 amino acid sequence residue of the N-terminal domain that both CCN and IGFBP shared 30% sequence identity with. The sequence is L-shaped and divided into two subdomains connected by a short stretch of coil. The first subdomain has a semi-folded with two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets and two parallel loops. The loops are stabilized by a series of disulphide bonds which form a flat plane with the beta sheets. The second subdomain is a globular domain containing the IGF-binding site and is surrounded by a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet stabilized by disulphide bonds.

'''VWC''':The von Willebrand factor C repeat domain contains a 70-100 amino acid sequence motif which is constantly conserved in most ECM proteins. The VWC domain can be repeated multiple times in a single protein, increasing its activity, but vary in growth factor affinity. This difference among proteins is through to be a means of regulation, accounting for the varying substrate specificity not only in CCN proteins but in others as well. One of the functions of the domain is regulating bone morphogenic proteins, which facilitate bone, cartilage and organ growth, along regulating TFG-beta signaling.

	The VWC domain in CCN proteins is made up of two sections. The upper section is made up beta-sheets while the lower section made up of fibronectin-like material held together by disulphide bonds. All the CCN proteins, except CCN6, have the VWC domain’s conserved cysteines. It results in a binding pattern of two disulphide bonds followed by the beta-sheets and then three more disulfide bonds. While the cysteines are conserved in the CCN proteins, their VWC domains vary in electrostatic surfaces. CCN1 and CCN5 have mostly negatively charged surfaces, CCN4 is mostly positively charged, and the rest are a mix of surface charges.

	VWC repeats in most proteins functions to regular bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) and TGF-beta signaling. Both BMP and TGF-beta work closely with CCN proteins. BMPs influence bone and cartilage growth, both of which when damaged results in TGF-beta facilitating increased expressions of CCN 1, CCN 2 and CCN 5 with decreased CCN 4 expression.

'''TSP-1''': This domain is made up of a 55 amino acid sequence residues. It has three distinct domain repeats: TSR-1 repeat, three epidermal growth factor-like repeats and seven aspartic acid-rich repeats, all inside a linear structure. The TSR-1 repeat is commonly found inside the human genome as well as in other eukaryotic organisms. It is composed mainly of small three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheets organized into a right-helical shape and mainly functions as cell attachment sites in signaling and adhesion, inhibition of angiogenesis (blood cell growth), protein-binding sites for various growth factors and other ECM proteins, and glycosaminoglycan-binding sites inside the TSP-1 domain. Similarly to VWC many TSRs bind TGF-beta, however the TSP-1 domain in CCN proteins lack the necessary RFK tripeptide sequence to perform the binding. The TSP-1 domain does however share a 60 amino acid sequence similarity with the TSR superfamilies as well as the conserved cysteine residues, CSxTCG motif, arginine and tryptophan residues at the N-terminal of the domain. 

	Unlike the original, the TSP domain in the CCN proteins has fewer CWR layers, residues that form hydrogen bonds, along the domain’s three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. Because of this they form fewer hydrogen bonds and only have a one tryptophan and two aginine residues. Three disulfide bonds are all present in the domain and hold the loops together around the beta-sheets. A positively charged domain surface is conserved in all six CCN proteins. Due to the ability of the TSP-1 domain to bind to glycoconjugates and its inhibition of angiogenesis, it may account for CCN proteins’ management of angiogenesis as well as their interactions with the ECM itself. CCN proteins, particularly CCN 1 and CCN 2, interaction with TGF-beta which facilitates their expressions, such in osteoblasts during bone fractures or breaks as well as to mediate angiogenesis. Their interaction with TGF-beta may be coordinated by their TSP-1 domain since original TSP domains also interact with TFG-beta. Mutant and missing TSP domains in CCN proteins are thought to be involved in the formation of colorectal and gastric carcinomas and Wilm’s tumours.

'''CT''': The CT domain contains a cysteine knot motif made up of six conserved cysteine residues. It is thought to mediate many of the CCN protein functions which can be heterodimeric, where both the CT domains of CCN 2 and CCN 3 interact in glutathione S-transferase pull assays, and is involved in heparin binding, one of the components of ECM. All CCN protein CT domains contain a collection of positively charged residues which surround the beta-sheet loops with the heparin-binding site at the N-terminal portion of their domain.One of the main functions of the CCN proteins is regulation and remodeling of the ECM as well as adhesion. Because TSP domains are thought to bind heparin sulphated proteoglycans, scientist think that CT and TSP domains may work in tandem by directing how CCN proteins control and manipulate adhesion processes and ECM composition. For example, in order to induce adhesion in vascular smooth muscle cells, CCN 3 interacts with the integrin cell surface receptors and heparin sulphate proeoglycans. 

	The CT domain also contains a cysteine knot that is made up of a ring of eight residues linked by two disulphide bonds with a third bond going through the center of the knot. Next to the 3D knot are two two-stranded anti-parallel beta-strands. It is the domain’s cysteine knot motif that scientist think allows it to act as a dimerization molecule similar to those of growth factors. In NGF and TGF-beta, it is the disulphide bond in the center of the knot which helps direct dimerization. While all CCN proteins have similar arrangements, they all slightly differ in electrostatic surfaces. Scientists believed that this different in charge and their diverse sequences, not including their conserved cysteines, may account for the differences in CT domain ligands and binding partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Mitochondria have been known to be the powerhouse of the eukaryotic cell, possessing the ability to produce ATP which is used as cellular energy for the cell.  However, mitochondria also fulfill other roles within the cell such as in metabolic pathways, apoptosis, cellular differentiation, and control of the cell cycle.  As a result, to these multiple functions, mitochondria have evolved to develop a double membrane that surrounds the mitochondria complex.  This double membrane functions as a high-traffic zone for the cell, possessing the ability to control what molecules go into the mitochondrion and what have to go out.  For example, low-energy metabolites such as ADP have to go inside while high-energy metabolites such as ATP have to go out.  This function of funneling ADP into mitochondria and ATP out of mitochondria is controlled by an integral membrane protein known as the voltage-dependent ion channel (VDAC), or also referred to as the mitochondrial porin.

The structure of VDAC has been examined for quite some time after it was discovered in 1975.  Many structures of VDAC were determined, but the spatial arrangement, the topology, of the structure for the beta-strand could not be determined.  However, in 2008, three long-term efforts to determine the three-dimensional structure of VDAC-1 were determined at atomic resolution.  Three structures of the isoform VDAC-1 were determined by different methods.  One was determined by using NMR spectroscopy alone, another by X-ray crystallography alone, and the last one using a combination of both NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.  The comparison of these three different structures of VDAC-1 is examined as well as the discussion of the importance of solution NMR to determine the structure of VDAC-1.

==Structure of VDAC-1 and Comparison of Three Structures==
[[File:Transmembrane receptor.svg|thumb|right|Picture of Integral Membrane Protein]]
The structure of VDAC-1 is very unique as it contains a very large beta-barrel.  For all three structures, the number of strands in this beta-barrel and the spatial arrangements of molecules is the same.  In studying the amino acid sequence of VDAC, it has been identified as being conserved from yeast to human.  As a result, the overall folding pattern of the structure is known to be the same in all eukaryotes.  In the three structures of VDAC-1, one of the structures is derived from a mouse while the other two structures are derived from humans.  When comparing the mouse form of VDAC-1 to the human form of VDAC-1, the two forms are highly identical, differing in only four amino acids.  Due to the very small changes in amino acid sequence between the mouse and human forms, the three-dimensional folded structures are very similar.  To further confirm the beta-barrel structure of VDAC-1, denaturation of the VDAC-1 protein was performed to allow it to refold into the detergent LDAO.  The refolded VDAC-1 structure was then placed into a different environment containing bicelles known as DMPC.  By placing the refolded VDAC structure in a different solution environment, the same beta-barrel structure was observed again, and it was concluded that this beta-barrel structure of VDAC-1 is the same no matter what type of environment solution it is placed in.

The beta-barrel structure of VDAC-1 is fairly unique because it is the only structure that is observed in any eukaryotic membrane protein, and it is also the only known beta-barrel membrane protein that contains an odd number of strands.  The rest of the beta-barrel proteins are observed to arrange into anti-parallel beta sheets, and because of this, an even amount of strands is needed to stabilize the entire beta-sheet structure through hydrogen bonding.  It is unknown why a beta-barrel structure is stabilized with an odd number of strands as the folding mechanism of this protein is not fully understood.  The structure of the beta-barrel is defined using two numbers that are the number of strands, n, and the shear number, S.  The shear number in the beta-barrel can be identified as the pairs of alpha-carbon atoms in adjacent strands that lie on a helical trace across the surface of the beta-barrel.  The side chains of the alpha-carbon atoms must be pointed to the same side of the sheet, and following the trace of the helix once around until it arrives back at the first strand a certain number of residues away from the starting point is known as the shear number of the beta-barrel.  In beta-barrels, the shear number is always even in order to have the hydrophobic residues of the protein on the outside of the complex.  Beta-barrel structures usually contain a shear number in the range of n and n+4.

Another comparison that is made to differentiate the three VDAC-1 structures is the residues that branch off the protein that is not part of the beta-barrel.  The 1-23 residues are compared between each of the three structures, but through the use of NMR, only residues 6-10 have been identified to be an alpha-helical structure.  Also, through the use of X-ray crystallography, the structure of mouse VDAC-1 was observed to contain three aliphatic residues: Leucine 10, Valine 143, and Leucine 150.  From the crystallized structure, it was observed that Valine 143 and Leucine 150 are the only hydrophobic side chains that point to the barrel interior from the barrel wall.  Residues 11-20 in the mouse structure and human structure appear to contain similar segments.  However, the conformation of these segments differs between these two structures.  Both structures were analyzed at cryogenic temperatures through the use of NMR.  The conformational changes between these structures are exposed through the use of NMR because as the conformations change, residues of the proteins will end up interacting with other different neighboring residues.  As a result, these conformational changes can lead to multiple resonance lines, reduced signal intensity, or line broadening on the NMR graphs for the structures.

==Solution NMR in Determining Structure of VDAC-1 and Other Integral Membrane Proteins==
In determining the beta-barrel structure of VDAC-1, researchers have stated that the combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography data were not enough in fully determining the structure.  As a result, the use of solution NMR techniques was used instead to solve the beta-barrel structure of this membrane protein.  In total, nine structures of integral membrane proteins have been solved using solution NMR.  In using solution NMR, two important techniques are used in determining membrane protein structures such as VDAC-1: protein refolding and deuteration of the detergent micelle.

The use of protein refolding from a denatured state has a very low success rate for most membrane proteins, but if the refolding process is successful, there are many benefits that help to study the structure of membrane proteins with much greater ease.  First, the process of protein refolding can lead to a very high yield of the newly folded structure of the protein.  In the case of VDAC-1, an average of 40 mg of VDAC-1 was obtained in a 1 liter solution of an E. coli cell culture.  Second, protein refolding helps to purify the membrane protein to an extremely high degree.  This is extremely important in studying the structure of VDAC-1 as the data obtained from X-ray crystallography and NMR would be accurate in examining the true structure.  Third, protein refolding has a high reproducibility, which goes together with the high purity.  Fourth, because high yield and high reproducibility can be done from protein refolding, efficient perdeuteration and selective isotope labeling can be done.  Finally, since the predeuterated protein goes through a denatured state in the in deuterated-water, all the amide compounds are readily protonated by the deuterated-water, and therefore, the structure of proteins such as VDAC-1 are much easier to identify due to the presence of D’s instead of H’s.

The use of deuterated detergent in solution NMR is the second technique that helps in identifying the structure of large membrane proteins such as beta-barrel of VDAC-1.  From other NMR studies, compounds not placed in deuterated solutions produce very broad resonance lines due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions between different atoms, causing the spectral sensitivity to be reduced an extremely significant amount.  By examining membrane proteins such as VDAC in deuterated solutions, a much more specific NMR graph is observed.  For example, when using the Nitrogen-15-resolved-NOESY spectra, when a deuterated detergent was replaced with a protonated detergent, a decrease of 10-30% in sensitivity was observed.  This decrease in sensitivity is clearly seen when analyzing the spectra of the methyl groups of the aliphatic residues of Isoleucine, Leucine, and Valine.  The NOESY spectra of these groups did not produce a clear spectra identifying these compounds in a protonated detergent, but when a deuterated detergent was used, clear images of these groups were able to be identified, concluding that the use of solution NMR in a deuterated detergent proved to be a powerful method in determining the structures of integral membrane proteins such as VDAC-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The ability of a protein to bind metal ligands is often essential to a protein’s function. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated the existence of a new type of protein-metal interaction in which the metal confers a particular function to the protein. Using the familiar example of hemoglobin and its heme group, this new type of interaction would be analogous to attaching a heme group to a protein not naturally possessing one to allow that protein to transport oxygen. In addition, many metals have the ability to induce a conformational change in the protein that they bind to, thus altering its function once again.  

==Applications==
===Amyloid Mimetics===
A practical application of this concept is the creation of amyloid mimetics. Because of their strength and mechanical stiffness, amyloids are attractive compounds for the construction of nanomaterials. This can be done by employing peptides with a secondary structure of alpha helices and a primary structure containing amino acids with metal-ligating side chains such as His and Cys. When metals such as Cu(II) or Zinc(II) are introduced, they will bind as ligands at the center of the helix to create the desired nanomaterials. This process can be taken further by creating a coil within a coil. This is usually done using heavy metals such as Pb and As, and results in a diverse array of nanomaterials. Alternatively, peptides can be designed to interact with a metal in a desired way, thus yielding different structures and functions. For example, addition of Cd(II) may induce a conformation in which there are four connections to the metal, whereas addition of Cu(I) may only form two connections with that same peptide.  

===Inorganic Substrates===
Another area of interest involving protein-metal interaction; is the for inorganic substrates in the solid state such as metals and carbon. This type of behavior has been observed in the formation of pearls, as well as in bones and tooth enamel in humans.  Although a definitive relationship between protein affinity and substrate identity has not yet been established, certain observations pervade this phenomenon. For example, proteins with an affinity for Ag substrates tend to contain proportionally larger amounts of Ser and Pro, whereas proteins with an affinity for C (nanotubes) tend to contain proportionally smaller amounts of Typ and His. Another observed trend is the affinity of unfolded proteins for Au and the affinity of folded proteins for Pt.

===GFP===
Protein-metal interaction is also being studied in green fluorescent protein (GFP). The concept is to create a “metal sensor” by combining the easy visibility of fluorescent compounds with the ability of proteins to bind metal ligands. Through modification of GFP, variations of GFP can be created that are specifically designed to bind a certain number of a certain metal atom, thus the amount of GFP will correspond to the unknown amount of metal ions in the sample solution. Recent studies indicate that the best results are with metals in the 2+ oxidation state, particularly Zn(II), with the exception of Ca(II) and Mg(II).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Sirtuin, a silent information regulator, increases the life span of model organisms. SIR2 has seven family members, SIRT1-SIRT7. SIRT1 is the closest to SIR2. Even though SIRT1 is the closest, the other family members show links to metabolism and aging. SIRT1- SIRT3 and SIRT5- SIRT7 conduct two enzymatic activities in vitro. The two enzymatic activities are NAD+ - dependent protein deacetylase activity and ADP-ribosyltransferase acitivity. SIRT4's only enzymatic activity is ADP-ribosyltransferase acitivity. The regulated metabolism and the survival of the cell depend on mammalian sirtuins.

===Founding Member: SIR2===

The functions of &lt;b&gt;SIR2&lt;b&gt;, a founding member of the protein family of sirtuins, may provide the link between aging and chromatin regulation. Chromatin is silenced at sub-telomeric DNA, silent mating-type loci and ribosomal DNA by SIR2. SIR2 is effected by its NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase activity. H4 lysine 16 and H3 lysine 56 are the lysine residues where deacetylation happens. This play a key role in SIR2’s silencing effect. The regulation of lifespan in budding yeast is done by SIR2. This is done through two chromatin-silencing activities. The first activity involves supressing the recombination between repeats of rDNA and thus promoting genomic stability (by preventing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence senescence]-inducing extrachromosomal rDNA circles from being cut out and accumulated). The second activity involves decreasing the Sir2 protein levels by an increase in H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; acetylation levels in telomeres. In response to nutrient deprivation or mutation, SIR2 can also block lifespan extension in model organisms. 

====SIR2 in Yeast and Other Organisms====
In yeast cells, SIR2 has the same function as SIRT6 in human cells. It also segregates damaged proteins which leads to the cell aging due to toxic cell aggregates. In response to lack of nutrients and other cell mutations, SIR2 blocks lifespan extension in yeast cells. Furthermore, in model organisms such as ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' and ''Drosophila melanogaster'', SIR2 acts to promote longevity through different pathways. Another action promoted by SIR2 is extension of cell lifespan by inducing dietary restriction adaptions.

==Location of Sirtuins==
Nucleus: &lt;b&gt;SIRT1&lt;b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SIRT6&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;SIRT7&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Cytosol: &lt;b&gt;SIRT2&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Mitochondria: &lt;b&gt;SIRT3&lt;b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SIRT4&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;SIRT5&lt;b&gt; 

==Sirtuin in the Nucleus==

===SIRT1===
SIRT1 is one of the seven Sir2p homologues of yeast called sirtuins. SIRT1 along with SIRT6 and SIRT7 are found in the nucleus. SIRT1 requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).  SIRT1 is the closest homologue to SIR2. Both control replicative senescence. SIRT1 can block oncogene-induced senescence if over expressed. While SIR2 exclusively deacetylates histones, SIRT1 deacetylates more than 40 different substrates. SIRT1 effects the structure of chromatin directly by deacetylating chromatin-regulating enzymes such as TIP6o and SUV&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Among other things, SIRT1 also helps regulate many other physiological processes such as apoptosis, metabolism, and stress resistance. SIRT1 is the most studied of the seven SIR2 family members.

===SIRT6===
For many years after its initial discovery, SIRT6 was thought to not have any deacetylase activity and it wasn't until later that SIRT6 was discovered to be a histone deacetylase that is very substrate-specific. It is in charge of regulating chromatin function, promoting its proper function in telomere and genome stabilization, gene expression, and DNA repair. The function of SIRT6 in humans parallels the function of SIR2 in yeast. Experimentation with SIRT6-deficient mice revealed that these mice are born completely normal but begin to have phenotypic abnormalities at around two weeks. They develop spinal curvature abnormalities, osteoporosis, and other systemic problems that result in death at around one month of age. At the cellular level, lack of this protein results in genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Ionizing Radiation (IR), methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, problems with base excision repair have been noticed. This revealed the important role SIRT6  plays in maintaining homeostasis, metabolism, and the life span of the organism.

==Roles of SIRT6==

====Telomeric Chromatin Regulation====
One of the most important roles of SIRT6 in relation to telomeres, is its job in maintaining telomeric chromatin integrity. SIRT6 deacetylates H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;. In SIRT6 deficient cell, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt; are hyperacetylated which leads to stochastic replication-associated telomere sequence loss, accumulation of telomeric DNA damage, and genomic instability with chromosomal end-to-end fusions. With these problems, cell senescence is brought on prematurely in the cell. This discovery has implications in future cancer research because chromosomal instability is corollated with cancer and the healthy function of telomeres plays a large role in maintaining genomic stability in chromosomes.

====DNA Repair====
SIRT6 has been linked to involvement in DNA repair in humans by allowing efficient DNA DSB repair (DNA double-strand break repair). It was discovered that SIRT6 reacts with proteins(DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80) that are involved in the pathways called non-homologous end-joining pathways (NHEJ). SIRT6's association with chromatin increases drastically in response to DSB in order to decrease the levels of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Ac. The SIRT6 structures were found to be useful in flanking chromatins near the breaks and stabilizing the DNA-PKcs required to perform DSB. When SIRT6 is deficient in the cell, DSB in cells is impaired, leading to instability in the cell.

====Gene Expression Regulation====
Studies have shown a relationship between SIRT6 and the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)which is in charge of gene expressions related to aging, proliferation,and inflammation. A lack of SIRT6 promotes hyperactivation of this transcription factor leading to over-expression of these genes. This is further seen in experiments on SIRT6-deficient mice where these mice were noticed to have metabolic and degenerative defects. In addition to NF-κB regulation, SIRT6 also plays a role in the transcription factor, HIF1α, which is important in glucose regulation that has been connected with lifespan regulation and even cancer.

==Mitochondrial Sirtuin==
&lt;br&gt;'''Sirtuin and Fatty Acid Oxidation'''&lt;br&gt;
During fasting, SIRT3 protein expression is increased as well as its levels and enzymatic activity. The phenotype overlap of SIRT3, AceCS2, and Acadl shows that SIRT3 regulate LCAD and AceCS2 acetylation.

&lt;br&gt;'''Sirtuin and the Electron Transport Chain'''&lt;br&gt;
Deacetylates Complex I subunits and Succinate Dehydrogenase (Complex II) interacts with SIRT3. Mitochondrial translation is regulated by ATP synthase binding with SIRT3 in proteomic analysis There are less information about the  roles of SIRT4 and SIRT5 in the electron transport. A substrate for ATP synthase is created when SIRT4 binds with adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) which than transports ATP into the cytosol and ADP to the mitochondrial matrix. SIRT5 interacts with cytochrome c. The biological significance of SIRT4 and SIRT5 are unknown

&lt;br&gt;'''Sirtuin and the Kerb Cycle'''&lt;br&gt;
Mitochondrial matrix is the location of kerb cycle enzymes. The compartmentalization of the mitochondrial matrix provides the cell to utilize metabolites from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Several kerb cycle enzymes interact with SIRT3 including succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (ICDH2). With deacetylation and activation of AceCS2 and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), SIRT3 influence the kerb cycle indirectly. The carbon entry into the kerb cycle are increased by increasing acetyle-CoA and amino acid utilization. SIRT3 activity may provide the general mechanism of these increases. SIRT4 inhibitates GDH via ADP-ribosylation, and SIRT4 via GDH interacts with the kerb cycle.

A group of proteins called sirtuins can help postpone the death time of certain model organisms (non-human organisms that are studied to better understand biological life). To be more specific, sirtuins are the (Sir)2 (silent information regulator) and its orthologs, which are homologs with the same function from different species. 

Seven sirtuins, SIRT1-7, are found in mammals and they change a variety of pathways dealing with metabolism and responding to stress. The sirtuin domain has the devices used to bind a co-substrate involved in metabolism, NAD+. In a controlled environment, all sirtuins perform two important enzymatic processes: NAD+-dependent protein deactylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase. However, SIRT4 cannot recognize specific substrates for acetylation, but it can identify ADP-ribosyltransferase. Because the enzymes rely on NAD+, they can perform their functions with the organism’s excited state and are possibly involved with recognizing metabolism. Furthermore, extensive scientific research on mammals’ sirtuins, specifically SIRT1, has shown that they control metabolic processes and the lifespan of cells. To do these, sirtuins specifically focus on different acetylated protein substrates and are put in separate locations. For example, SIRT1, 6, 7 are located in the nucleus. 

Three sirtuins, SIRT3-5, are found in the mitochondria and they help by being an important location for metabolism involving oxidation. Compared to SIRT1, SIRT3-5 are smaller in size. Though intense research has been performed on sirtuins, sirtuins of mitochondria have not been studied to the extent of others such as SIRT1. However, reports and information regarding mass spectrometry have been speculating that SIRT3-5 may play an important role in controlling a wide range of activity in the mitochondria, such as making energy, intracellular signaling, and partaking in apoptosis.

==NAD+ Metabolism and Sirtuin Activity==
Sirtuins are absolutely dependent on NAD+, meaning the excess of free NAD+ and its biosynthetic and broken down products in the cells are important to how the activity of the enzyme of the sirtuins work. There are essentially two primary ways to the NAD+ biosynthesis in yeast and mammals. One is the a de novo kynurenine pathway, which is formed from tryptophan. The other one is a known as a salvage pathway that is usues nicotinamide that is created from NAD+ by sirtuins in addition to ADP-ribosyl-transferases and polymerases or exogenous nictoinic acid. Two researches Bieganowski and Brenner recently found a special pathway to NAD+ in yeast and humans. It is initiated from nicotinamide riboside, which is provided from the outside. In addition, aonoter significant discovery is that mammalian cells operate differently at a basic level in terms of their pathways compared to bacteria and yeast. In yeast, nicotinamide is deaminated by the enzyme Pnc1p, which transforms to nicotinic acid. Then the nicotinic acid is changed to NaMN by the nicotinic phosphoribosyltransferase. Nicotinamide in mammalian cells, on the other hand, are changed directly to nicotinamide mononucleotide by the Nampt. The level of expression of Nampt in response to a variety of stresses makes the levels of cellular NAD+ higher. In effect this regulated catalytic activity of Sir2. Recent studies have found that changes in the NAD+ metabolites potentially possess tissue-specific effects. Take NAD+ for example. NAD+ makes the level of nuclear neurons higher which prevents axonal degeneration in a SitT1-dependent way. In addition, mammalian de novo biosynthesis is also organized in a different manner compared to plants and prokaryotes.

==Sirtuins, caloric restriction, and aging==
The relationship between Sir2 proteins, caloric restriction, and aging have been studied in detail. Evidence has shown that sirtuns are associated in encouraging longer life, especially longevity dealing with CR regimens, in a few organisms. There are two key early discoveries that support this in that the discovery that excess amounts of sirtuins encourage longevity in C. elegans. The relationship of yeast mother cell longevity with Sir2 interactions and SIr poteins has been shown that there is a correlation. When the yeast cells dvide, they divide in an asymmetric way. The mother cells have only the ability to divide a certain amount of times, which isa bout 20-30 times. Mutants that don't have Sir2 have a decreased life span in the respect that they divide less time. Sir2 mutant mother cells that age prematurely were found to build up extrachromasal rDNA circles, which build up because rDNA combinated is not regulated anymore in the Sir2 mutant. 

==Possible Link to Cancer==
Due to the large role that sirtuins, particularly SIRT6, play in aiding in genome stability and the regulation of the metabolism, problems with SIRT6 function and availability are thought to be linked to oncogenic transformation and tumorigenisis. For example, certain cancers such as myeloid leukemia have breakages at the SIRT6 chromosomal locus. Furthermore, cancer cells exhibit a change from aerobic  respiration to glycolysis that is seen in the Warberg effect which causes cancer cells to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Other studies have shown that acetylation of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt; is increased in many cancers such as skin, thyroid, breast, liver, and colon cancers.

[[File:PDB 2b4y EBI.jpg|thumb|This is NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-5]]

&lt;br&gt;'''SIRT3 and Oral Cancer'''&lt;br&gt;
It has been studied and reported that SIRT3 has a connection to the beginnings of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cancer formation, that is, it inhibits cell growth and induces early cell death. When this sirtuin is produced in excess in breast cancer, it modifies how the protein p53 to prevent cell arrest and deterioration in bladder cancer cells as they age. When compared to human oral keratinocytes, SIRT3 levels were higher than what it should have been and this was evidence for overexpression of SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis. From there, the sirtinol and nicotinamide inhibitors were tested, which resulted in a blockage of cell growth and induced cell death in OSCC cells, which furthers evidence for SIRT3 overexpression in these cells. But people have also studied and reported that SIRT3 does the complete opposite, that is, it helps keep cells alive. It decreases stress on the cells and keeps them away from inducing of cell death and apoptosis. For example, Nampt, which regulates the response to stress and diet, requires SIRT3 to keep cells alive when they are exposed to harmful substances that alter the gene. It also works to keep the heart from failing and protects from other cardiac problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General==

Integrin proteins are receptor molecules that are adhesive to cells that mediate attachment between a cell and the tissues surrounding it, which include other cells or the extracellular matrix. Integrin proteins get their name from their ability to integrate the extracellular and intracellular environments by binding to ligands outside the cell and signaling molecules inside the cell. They also play important roles in the immune system, cell signaling, phagocytosis, cell migration, extracellular matrix assembly, and regulating the cell cycle. Integrin proteins are known to transmit information about how the cell is doing internally to and from the extracellular matrix. This allows the rapid response to changes in the external environment, which allows the maintenance of homeostasis. A good example of this is blood coagulation by platelets. Usually, receptors inform the cell of molecules near its environments so that the cell can initiate a response, integrin proteins perform this outside-in signaling but they can also perform inside-out signaling. Inside-out signaling is when they transduce information from the extracellular matrix to the cell and also reveals the status of the cell to the outside allowing quick responses to changes in environment. Integrins are usually found in an inactive state where they are not currently binding to receptors until needed. There are many types of integrin proteins, and many cells have multiple types on their surface. Integrin proteins can be found in just about any animal cell, and they have been exhaustively studied in humans especially.

==Structure==
Integrins are heterodimeric molecules that are associated noncovalently.  18 α subunits and 8 β subunits form 24 known αβ pairs in vertebrates.  This diversity accounts for the diversity in ligand recognition (Figure 1), binding to cytoskeletal components and coupling to downstream signaling pathways.  The β2 and β7 integrins are only expressed on leukocytes, whereas the β1 integrins are expressed on a large variety of cells throughout the body.

Priming, also known as inside-out signaling, dynamically regulates the adhesiveness of integrins by receiving stimuli from cell surface receptors which detect chemokines, cytokines, and foreign antigens which results in intracellular signals to be sent which will alter adhesiveness for extracellular ligands.  Also, ligand binding transduces signals form the extracellular domain to the cytoplasm in the outside-in direction.  These properties are the key to their proper function in the immune system.

==Integrin α I Domains==
===Structure===
Half of integrin α subunits include a region of 200 amino acids known as inserted (I) domains, or a von Willebrand factor A domain. The α I domain is the major ligand binding site in the integrins which contain this region.  This domain was the first domain to be crystallized. The α I domain favors the dinucleotide binding with α-helices surrounding a central β-sheet.   Beta strands and alpha helices usually alternate in secondary structure resulting in alpha helices wrapping around the domain in a counter clockwise order when viewed from the top face. The top face of the domain is defined by a divalent cation-bidning site which physiologically binds Mg 2+.  The Mg 2+ becomes ligated by 5 side chains located in three different loops. The first loop contains three coordinating residues in a signature sequence of I domains: Asp, Ser, Ser.  The second loop donates a coordinating Thr residue and the third loop donates an Asp.  This site is called the MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site).

===Conformational Regulation of α I Domains===
I domains have been crystallized in three conformations: Closed, Intermediate, Open.  These demonstrate the coordination of the metal in MIDAS, the arrangement of the beta six and alpha seven loops, and the axial repositioning of the C-terminal alpha seven helix along the side of the I domain.  Oxygen is donated to the primary and secondary coordination spheres surrounding the metal via the five residues and several water molecules.  In the open conformation of MIDAS, two serines and one threonine occupy the primary coordination sphere and two aspartic residues occupy the secondary coordination sphere.  The glutamic acid residue donates only negatively charged oxygen to the primary coordination sphere in the open conformation.  A hypothesis exists which states that the strength of the metal-ligand bond is enhanced because of the lack of any charged group in the primary coordination sphere that is donated by the I domain. The closed conformation of the alpha I domain results in the threonine from the primary coordination sphere to switch with the aspartic acid residue from the secondary coordination sphere.  The backbone and side chain rearrangements are followed by a 2.3 angstrom sideways movement of the metal ion away from the threonine and closer to the aspartic acid which is on the opposite side of the coordination cell. The closed and open structures follow the idea that an energetically favorable MIDAS requires at least one coordination to a negatively charged oxygen. When there is no ligand, a pseudoligand, and the remainder of the integrin ectodomain crystallize in the closed conformation. This closed conformation is the low energy conformation, which is verified computationally.  However, through an engineered disulfide bond, the alpha L I domain is crystallized in the open confirmation and is stable in the absence of ligand-mimetic lattice contact.  As a result, interactions with other integrin domains might be capable of stabilizing an unliganded I domain in the open conformation and priming it for ligand binding.

===Allosteric α I Domain Inhibitors===
Small allosteric inhibitors provide further support for the role of the alpha seven helix in alpha I domain regulation.  Alpha I allosteric antagonists are a class of small molecule inhibitors which binds underneath the C-terminal α-helix of the αL I domain.  These antagonists stabilize the closed conformation of the I domain by stopping the downward axial movement of the alpha seven helix and preventing the MIDAS rearrangements necessary for efficient ligand binding. The action of these antagonists is confirmed by finding that a mutant alpha L I domain which stabilizes the open conformation of the C-terminal alpha seven-helix with an engineered disulfide bond is resistant to inhibition by alpha I allosteric antagonists.

===Integrin Activation===
[[File:Nihms258051f1.jpg|thumb|Integrin Activation]]
Chemokine in leukocytes, thrombin in platelets, and T-cell receptor engagement in T-cells are certain examples that cause integrin activation. Once activated, there is an increase in calcium and diacyl glycerol (DAG) levels which causes activation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Rap1 is then activated, causing GDP/GTP exchange. Once Rap1 has been activated, it works together with RIAM, an interacting adapter molecule which helps connect the membrane targeting sequences in Rap1 to talin, and talin is then bound to the plasma membrane where it causes the β-TM helix to tilt, leading to full integrin activation. A complex formed by the β-tail, talin and the cell membrane is an important part of inside-out integrin activation in the cell, and thus the formation of this complex is regulated to ensure that integrin activation is under control. Β-tail and talin affinity is also controlled by environmental conditions, as well as competition from other proteins that compete for interaction with the β-integrin tail. 
A certain type of proteins called kindlins also aid in talin activation of integrins. Kindlins contain FERM domains that are similar to talins with their N-terminal Fo domain and a large flexible F1 loop. Unlike talin which binds to the first NpxY motif in β-integrin tails, Kindlins bind to the second motif. However, Kindlin has also been known to be able to also inhibit integrins as well.

      <comment>/* Sequence Alignment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Homology==
When scientists study the relationship between proteins between different species they must determine whether or not these proteins are homologous to one another. Homologous proteins are proteins that have a common ancestor. There are two classes of homologs. They are ortholog and paralog. Orthologs are homologous proteins that are found among different species but have similar function. Orthologs occurs due to speciation. Paralog are homologous proteins that are found within the same species. They have very similar structure but serve different functions within the organism. Paralogs are due to gene duplication within the specie.  Scientists finds out whether the proteins are homologous or not by studying the DNA sequence, amino acid sequence, the tertiary structure of the protein.  In other word, they study the sequence alignment and structural alignment of the protein. 

==Sequence Alignment==
When analyzing the DNA sequence or the amino acid sequence similarity and differences , scientists study the alignment of the DNA sequence or the alignment of the amino acid alignment of the protein. Alignment of DNA sequences is less sensitive to that of the alignment of amino acid. DNA sequence only consists of 4 bases. This means that the chance that both residues are the same is 1 out of 4. For the amino acid sequence, the chance that both residues are the same is 1 out of 21. The scoring of the degree of similarity of the alignment of each case is determined by Matrix.
There are a variety of methods in order to determine the optimal alignment of nucleotide sequences. One famous method is determined by the Needleman Wunsch algorithm.

==Matrix==
Matrix is a method used to determine the degree or similarity between the sequences (DNA or Amino Acid). Matrix takes account of two factors which are conservation and frequency.  

Conversation determines whether or not a certain residue can substitute for another residue by comparing the residue’s physical factors such as their hydrophobicity, charge, and size. For example if two residues are both hydrophobic they may substitute for each other. If two residues have different charges, chance that they can substitute for one another is very slim.  

Frequency states how often a residue occurs.  For example, if sequence A has a 20% of residue A and 30% of residue B and if sequence B has 21% of residue A and 35% of residue B, these residues A and B prevalence may indicate that these sequences are related to one another.

The techniques used by matrix are the sliding between sequences, the gap introduced within the sequence, and the deletion of certain residues within the sequence. This method is used in order to improve the alignment’s similarity.   In sliding, one sequence is sided in reference to the other. For example after the sliding the sequence by one residue, the similarity between the sequences may increase because more residues are identical or similar to one another.   Gaps are introduces within the sequence in order to increase the residue similarity. For example if a sequence A have this particular range of residues that are not important or critical to its function or structure but have an important residue rang after the non-important residue range and the other sequence B lacks the sequence unimportant  residue range but does have the same important residue range of sequence A. Then a gap is introduces in sequence B in order to make for the non important residue range.    For deletion, certain residues are omitted in the sequence. Unimportant residues are usually deleted in order to increase the similarity between the sequences.

There are two types of matrices. They are identity matrix and substitution matrix. Identity matrix only assign points to residues that are identical where as substitution may assign points to residues that are different yet alike in a conservative perspective.  Substitution matrix are more accurate than that of identity matrix because in taking account for conservation substitution, substitution matrix give large positive score to the sequence where frequent substitution occur and large negative score where rare substitution occur . Hence substitution matrix is more sensitive to that of the identity matrix.

==Structural Alignment==
Structural alignment is the analysis of the degree of similarity between primary, secondary and tertiary structure. In protein, the tertiary structure is more conserved than that of primary structure because tertiary structure is more closely related to the protein’s function. The purpose of structural alignment is to improve sequence alignment (method discussed before this) by creating a sequence template. Since some regions are more conserved than other, sequence template is template that maps out the conserved amino acid residues that are structurally and functionally important to a particular protein family member.   Hence sequence template helps find protein that belongs to certain family member.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''DNA Packaging''' ==
DNA packaging is an important process in living cells. Without it, a cell is not able to accommodate large amount of DNA that is stored inside. For example, a bacterial cell which ranges from 1 to 2um in length contains amount of DNA that is 400 times as big (Becker et al. 530). Eukaryotic cells face even bigger challenges. A typical human cell has enough “DNA to wrap around the cell more than 15,000 times” (531). Therefore, DNA packaging is crucial because it makes sure that those excessive DNA are able to fit nicely in a cell that is many times smaller. 

The DNA in bacterial cells are either circular or linear. To accommodate the size of bacterial cell, supercoiled DNA are folded into loops with each loop resembles shape of bead-like packets containing small basic proteins that is analogous to histone found in Eukaryotes (533). 

In eukaryotic cells, DNA packaging is more complicated because they contain amount of DNA that is much larger than that of bacterial cells. More proteins are therefore required for the process with histone being the most important one. This protein is consisted largely of positive amino acids like lysine and arginine which make the overall structure positive. Thus, histone interacts favorably with the negative phosphate groups from DNA. There are five main types of histone, H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (533). Two of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 joins to form an octamer wrapped around by DNA of 146 base pairs like a bead on a string. This bead, consisting of eight histone molecules and 146 DNA base pairs, is known as the nucleosome. Each nucleosome is connected by a DNA linker of 50 base pairs to form a fiber like structure called chromatin. H1 is believed to be found in these DNA linkers. Chromatin fibers can be further compacted to form higher order of structures called heterochromatin or euchromatin depending on the degree of packing. Ultimately, DNA packaging in eukaryotic cells can lead to the formation of chromosome which is only present during cell division or several other situations (533-535). In eukaryotic cells, DNA packaging is not only in the nucleus but is also in mitochondria and chloroplast. The overall shape of their DNA resembles that of bacteria instead that of eukaryotes.

== '''Histone chaperones and the nucleosome assembly processes''' ==
Histones are proteins that allow DNA to be tightly packaged into units called nucleosomes. The DNA wraps itself around the histones.

Chromatin is made of DNA and proteins (Histones). Chromatin is used to give structure to a chromosome.

Nucleosome consists of the acidic chromatin and the basic histone proteins.

Histone chaperones
Histone chaperone guided folding pathways, assists in the folding and unfolding of the DNA around the histone.

Organization 
The tight coiling of DNA allows easier access to the DNA which makes sequencing faster. 

Need for histone chaperones
Nucleosomes can be assembled or disassembled and are done in stepwise function. Histone chaperones guide the pathway process, they control and regulate.

Structural forms of histone chaperones
Since histone chaperones participate at each step of the nucleosome assembly processes, there are different chaperones needed for each different step.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Das, Tyler The histone shuffle: histone chaperones in an energetic dance&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The action potential is the brief electrical impulse that is responsible for the propagation of information down the axon of a neuron. Some important concepts involved with the action potential are the membrane potential, resting potential, threshold. The membrane potential is the difference in electrical potential inside and outside the cell. The resting potential is the membrane potential of a neuron when the neuron is at rest and not receiving any excitatory or inhibitory signals. In many neurons, the resting potential is approximately –70 mV. The threshold is the membrane potential that has to be reached to produce an action potential. An action potential is an all or nothing phenomenon. It either reaches the threshold and produces an action potential or it doesn’t.

== Process ==
[[Image:jac040 action potentia.jpeg|thumb|alt=Picture of a action potential that I drew.|Picture of a Action Potential.]]
The first step in the action potential is for the neuron’s membrane potential to reach the threshold. This change in the membrane potential can be caused by a variety of factors including excitatory stimulation by another cell or neuron. An increase in the membrane potential is also called a depolarization. After the threshold is reached, voltage-gated sodium channels open, and sodium ions enter the cell, increasing the resting potential. As the voltage continues to increase, the voltage-gated potassium channels open as well, and potassium ions leave the cell. However, the membrane potential continues to increase as the sodium ions are still entering the cell. When the membrane potential reaches its peak, the action potential is attained, and the sodium channels become refractory and no more sodium ions enter the cell. Potassium ions continue to leave the cell, and the membrane potential slowly decreases towards the resting potential. This decrease in the resting potential is called a hyperpolarization. At the resting potential, the potassium channels close and the sodium channels “reset” so that they can open again if the threshold is reached. Since all the potassium channels don’t close as soon as the resting potential is reached, extra potassium ions leave the cell, decreasing the membrane potential past the resting potential. The membrane actually undergoes an afterhyperpolarization, a drop in the membrane potential past the resting potential. Eventually, the membrane potential returns to the resting potential as the potassium ions diffuse back into the cell as the cell membrane is quite permeable to potassium ions. Sodium-potassium transporters pump sodium ions out of the cell and pump potassium ions into the cell.

'''Mechanism'''
(Refer to diagram)

The resting potential is set by the sodium potassium pump which pumps 3 Na+ and 2K+ in using the energy of 1 ATP. This energy is required because the ions are being pumped against their concentration gradient. Resting potential lies between -60 to -80 mV. At resting potential, no signals are being sent across the membrane. Depolarization is the second step in this mechanism and occurs when the cell becomes less negative because Na+ voltage gated channels have opened and Na+ ions are now entering the cell causing a reduction in the magnitude of the membrane potential. Once the membrane potential reaches -55 mV, it has reached threshold which will trigger an action potential. The third step is called the rising phase where more Na+ voltage gated channels open which causes the cell to become less negative. It brings a positive charge to the cell which further enhances depolarization. More sodium channels open, resulting in a positive feedback loop. The following step is called the falling phase because eventually, Na+ voltage gated channels get deactivated and block additional sodium from entering. Mean while, the K+ voltage gated channels start to open and hyperpolarization takes place. Hyperpolarization causes an increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential resulting in making the cell more negatively charged. The last part of this mechanism is called the undershoot because the Na+ voltage gated channels close completely while K+ channels also begin to slowly close. And this returns the membrane potential back to rest just as in the first step of the mechanism. 

'''Na+/K+ Pump Mechanism'''
The ion pumps, with bound to ATP, binds 3 intracellular Na+ ions. The ATP is hydrolyzed, leading to phosphorylation of the pump and subsequent release of ADP. There is a conformational change in the pump takes place exposing the Na+ ions to the outside. The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for Na+ ions, so they are released. The pump then binds 2 extracellular K+ ions, which causes the dephosphorylation of the pump, reverting it to its previous conformational state, transporting the K+ ions into the cell. The dephosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for Na+ ions than K+ ions, so the two bound K+ ions are released. ATP binds, and the process starts again.


'''Conduction of Action Potential'''

As an action potential travels down an axon, it is regenerating the depolarization. The action potential is transferred to neighboring regions, conducting action potential throughout the entire axon. While an action potential is being conducted in a particular region of the axon and is undergoing falling phase, the area behind it is hyperpolarizing and undergoing the falling phase. This area is known as the repolarized zone caused by the outflow of potassium ions. As a result, the inactivated Na+ channels behind the area of depolarization prevent any action potentials from traveling backwards, making them uni-directional.

'''Properties'''
&lt;br&gt;
1. Action potential is always depolarizing.
&lt;br&gt;
2. Action potential's amplitude is independent of stimulus pathway.
&lt;br&gt;
3. Action potential has all or none response. If the frequency reaches or passes the threshold, action potential occurs. If it falls under the threshold, no action potential occurs.
&lt;br&gt;
4. Amplitude does not decay with distance. It is indeed transferred equally, without any loss, across the axon.
&lt;br&gt;
5. There is an absolute refractory period and a relative refractory period.
&lt;br&gt;
6. At rest channels for sodium and calcium are closed
&lt;br&gt;
7.Membrane is selectively permeable to potassium the most
&lt;br&gt;
8.Osmotic pressure is opposed by electrostatic pressure to reach equilibrium for balancing the concentration ions.

==Effects of Axon Structure==

The diameter of an axon influences the speed of an action potential. The larger the width of an axon, the less resistance it provides to the current of an action potential. It acts analogous to how a water hose would, the wider the diameter of a hose offers less resistance to the flow of water. As a result, action potentials are conducted much faster. Another factor that contributes to the speed of action potential are myelin sheaths. Myelin sheaths are made by two types of glia, Schwann Cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system.  Myelin acts as an insulator for the axon and increases the length over which an action potential can be effective. This form of insulation allows the depolarizing current of an action potential to reach threshold sooner. The only problem with insulation is that axons now no longer have access to the environment or extracellular space. The only areas on an insulated axon that do allow for interaction are gaps in the myelin sheaths called Nodes of Ranvier. Action potentials are only formed at these nodes because this is the area where the exposed Na+ voltage gated channels are located. One node will undergo the rising phase of an action potential and the current produced will travel immediately to the next node where the membrane will then be depolarized and action potential will be regenerated. The process in which the action potentials and depolarization jump from node to node is called salatatory conduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=

Apotosis is a normal process during development and removing cells. These cells can develop to be cancerous cells. 

Apoptosis is the programmed death of a cell.  It occurs naturally in multicellular organisms and is used to regulate dead cells. Apoptosis occurs daily in human beings destroying naturally anywhere between 20 to 70 billion cells and those cells end up being replaced by newer cells.

During Apoptosis, cells will:
* Shrink
* Develop bubble-like blebs on their surface
* Have the chromatin in their nucleus degraded
* Have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c
* Break into small, membrane-wrapped, fragments
* Release ATP and UTP
* Their nucleotides will bind to receptors on phagocytic cells and this will serve as a signal to attract dying cells
* The phospholipid phosphatidylserine will be exposed on the surface
* The exposed phospholipid will serve as a “eat me” signal, which will induce the phagocytes to engulf the cell fragments
* The phagocytic cells secret cytokines that inhibit inflammation
This orderly pattern of events is called programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/A/Apoptosis.html&lt;/ref&gt;


Apoptosis was discovered by German scientist Carl Vogt who first detailed the events of apoptosis.  This discovery was then later given a more precise definition by Walther Flemming.  Since the 1990s apoptosis has started to become more in the mainstream and being investigated more.  It truly started in the 1960s when it was seen occurring under the microscope.  The picture below is mouse liver cells and the one stained is going through apoptosis.

[[File:Apoptosis stained.jpg|Apoptosis stained]]

Since the pathway through apoptosis is very long if one biochemical reaction is not carried out it can eventually lead to cells that do not die and go on creating havoc in the organism.  If the cells do not go through this natural phase in their life cycle they can end up causing diseases and/or disorders.  This problem can be linked to the creation of cancer by a malfunctioning cell being able to reproduce and pass on any bad organelles or incorrect DNA sequences.

Below is a picture from the Wikimedia Commons briefly showing a depicted drawing of how the apoptosis occurs in the cell:

[[File:Apoptosis.png|Apoptosis]]

Apoptosis was studied in roundworms and in the final stages of its cell death, there discovery of the death-inducing protease CED-3 activation became the cause of the apoptosis. In order to regulate these proteases, CSP-3 was discovered to block CED-3 autoactivation and ultimately, to decrease signs of apoptosis during the developmental stages of roundworms. CSP-3 is a capspase homolog which only works in somatic cells. Therefore, germ cells are not affected by the CSP-3.

==Necessity of apoptosis in cells== 
* Apoptosis is needed for the proper development and formation of body parts. For example, the formation of fingers and toes of a fetus is made possible by apoptosis of the tissue between them.
* Apoptosis is needed to destroy cells that pose threats to the well-being of the organism as a whole. For example, the destruction of cell with damaged DNA.

==Required factors for cell's apoptosis to occur==

* There is a withdrawal of positive signals. Cells need to receive continuous stimulation, positive signals, from other cells or they need a continuous adhesion to a surface in order to survive.
For example: The withdrawal of growth factors of neurons will cause apoptosis because the growth factors serve as positive signals and are crucial for cell development
* There is a receipt of negative signals.
For example: The increase of oxidants inside the cell or the accumulation of misfolded proteins.

==The mechanism of apoptosis==

There are 3 different mechanisms for cell apoptosis.

===Apoptosis triggered by internal signals: the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway===

* In a healthy cell, the protein Bcl-2 is displayed on the surface of the mitochondria’s outer membrane. This protein inhibits apoptosis.
* Internal damage to the cell causes the protein, Bax, to migrate to the surface of the mitochondria and inhibits the effect of Bcl-2 and stick to the outer membrane surface of the mitochondria. Bax punches holes in the outer membrane and causes cytochrome c to spill out.
* Cytochrome c uses the energy provided by ATP and proceeds to bind to the protein Apaf-1 (“apoptotic protease activating factor-1”).	
* The binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 forms apoptosomes.
* Apoptosomes bind to caspase-9 and activates it. Caspase-9 is a protease that cleaves proteins.
* As caspase-9 cleaves proteins, it activates other caspases from its family. Such as caspase-3 and caspase-7.
* A cascade of proteolytic activity is created by the activation of caspases. These proteolytic activities lead to the digestion of structural proteins in the cytoplasm, the degradation of chromosomal DNA, and the phagocytosis of the cell.
http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/caspase9.png

===Apoptosis triggered by external signals: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway===

* Integral membrane proteins, such as Fas and TNF receptor, have receptors that are exposed at the surface of the cell.
* Binding of the complementary death activator, such as FasL and TNF, sends a signal to the cytoplasm that leads to the activation of caspase-8.
* Caspase-8, similar to caspase-9, activates a cascade of proteolytic activities, which leads to the phagocytosis of cell.
http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CTL_Fas.gif

===Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF)===

* Neurons undergo apoptosis without the use of caspases.
* AIF is a protein that is located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria.
* When a cell receives its death signal, AIF, which is released from the mitochondria, migrates into the nucleus and binds to the DNA, which then triggers the destruction of DNA.
* Beside programing cell death, AIF also plays a important mitochondrial role in healthy cells. &quot;A segment of AIF which is dispensable for its apoptotic function carries an NADH-oxidase domain that regulates the respiratory chain complex I and is required for cell survival, proliferation and mitochondrial integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000022&lt;/ref&gt;

====Researched results in Mitochondrial functions of AIF====

Recent researches using mutant mice have helped in understanding of mitochondrial functions of AIF. For example, AIF-deficent mice are used as a model of complex I deficiency which shows a general reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Pospisilik et al.  Targeted deletion of AIF decreases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and protects from obesity and diabetes  Cell, 131 (2007), pp. 476–491&lt;/ref&gt;. In human, the deficiency of complex I causes &gt;30% of mitochondrial diseases&lt;ref&gt;S. Koene, J. Smeitink  Mitochondrial medicine: entering the era of treatment  J. Intern. Med., 265 (2009), pp. 193–209&lt;/ref&gt;, and it mainly affects on infants which shows a variety of symptoms such as epileptic seizures, blindness, deafness, axaxia, cognitive deficiency, myopathy and cardiomyopathy.  

Researches have shown that the uncharacterized splice isoforms of AIF whose tisue and cell type-specific expression pattern can be the cause of some tissue-specific effects in AIF deficiency. In addition, the failure in detecting AIF mutations might lead to the embryonic lethality of AIF deficiency, which observed in mutant mice&lt;ref&gt;N. Vahsen et al.  AIF deficiency compromises oxidative phosphorylation  EMBO J., 23 (2004), pp. 4679–4689&lt;/ref&gt;.

Research have also shown than a 80% reduction in the AIF expression allows the development of Hq in mice and affects on health of adult animals due to an aggravating complex I deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000022&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role of AIF in the survival, proliferation and metabolism of cells====

Mutant mice are used in studies of role of AIF in survival, proliferation and metabolism of cells.
If level of AIF presence is low, it will not affect the inheritance of Hq mutation and has no major effect in exhibit growth retardation. An reduction of AIF level over time reduces major effects on the health of aging adult mice&lt;ref&gt;P. Benit et al.  The variability of the harlequin mouse phenotype resembles that of human mitochondrial-complex I-deficiency syndromes  PLoS ONE, 3 (2008), p. e3208&lt;/ref&gt;.  The complete loss of AIF would cause the incompatibility with intrauterine development, and also tend to cause AIF-null mice due to the failure of homologous recombination&lt;ref&gt;N. Joza et al.  Essential role of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor in programmed cell death  Nature, 410 (2001), pp. 549–55&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Applications=

==Apoptosis and Organ Transplants==

-	Certain body parts, such as the testes and the anterior chamber of the eye, are not susceptible to antigen invasions. It turns out that these cells produce FasL at high rates, therefore, antigens, which produce Fas, would be killed as soon as they enter these sites.
-	This discovery will potentially aid transplant recipients greatly, because the transplanted organs will less likely be susceptible to the attacks of the host body’s cell-mediated immune system if artificial cells made to produce high levels of FasL can be effectively inserted into the transplanted organs.
-	So far, clinical trials on animals have been conducted. Allografts synthesized to express FasL have shown increases survival rate for kidneys but not for hearts.

==Apoptosis in Plants==

-	Plants too undergo programmed cell death. Apoptosis may aid the plant in halting the spread of a virus infection.
-	The mechanism of apoptosis in plants also involves caspases, which cleaves at the Asp residue. However, the activation of caspases destroys the central vacuole, which disintegrates the rest of the cell, and not the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hormonal Signaling ==
Hormone is an important signal molecule that is used by both plants and animals. “Hundreds of hormones can regulate a wide variety of physiological functions, including growth and development, rates of body processes, concentrations of substances, and responses to stress and injury” (Becker, et al. 416). Distance traveled by hormones can vary depending on hormones’ life span. Some hormones can last only seconds in blood stream, indicating short distance regulation. Hormones that are long distance traveler can have life spans ranging from minutes to even hours. Hormones also have different chemical properties. Generally, “hormones can fall into four different categories: amino acid derivative, peptides, proteins, and lipid-like hormones such as steroids” (416). Difference in their chemical properties allows hormones to bind to different receptors thereby regulating different pathways. For example, adrenergic hormones bind to a family of G proteins to increase the concentration of glucose in muscle cells (416-417).

Hormonal signaling follows the following steps:
# Biosynthesis of a particular hormone in a particular tissue
# Storage and secretion of the hormone
# Transport of the hormone to the target cell(s)
# Recognition of the hormone by an associated cell membrane or intracellular receptor protein.
# Relay and amplification of the received hormonal signal via a signal transduction process: This then leads to a cellular response. The reaction of the target cells may then be recognized by the original hormone-producing cells, leading to a down-regulation in hormone production. This is an example of a homeostatic negative feedback loop.
# Degradation of the hormone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an important biological process. It helps body to get rid of cells that are superfluous or potentially harmful. In addition, it helps to shape our feature by removing cells that are no longer needed. When a cell undergoes apoptosis, its DNA is cleaved into fragment by an “apoptosis-specific DNA endonuclease” known as DNase. “Eventually, cell is dismantled into small pieces called apoptotic bodies” which will be engulfed by the specialized cells nearby (Becker et al. 419-420). The process is carried out by chromatin condensation and fragmentation; it is executed by the formation of multi-protein complexes that involve the binding of extracellular death ligands to death receptors. The complexes generate and activate initiator caspases, which then trigger and cleave effector caspases that then target and focus on specific cellular substrates for the process of proteolysis. Caspases is the key enzyme involved in apoptosis and it is catalytically active only during this time.They are directly inhibited by members of the IAP family. The inactivated form of this enzyme is called procaspases which is activated by a different caspases through proteolytic cleavage. Once it is turned on, caspases will cleave the inhibitory protein on DNase to induce cell death (420). 

There are two major types of signals that can trigger apoptosis in human, death signals and withdrawal of survival signals (420). In the death signal pathway, a cell that is infected with virus or bacterial will accumulate CD9 or similar proteins on its surface. These proteins are called death signals that will attract procaspases to cell’s surface. Once procaspases is turned on, it will activate more procaspases to initiate apoptosis. In the survival factor pathway, mitochondria play an important role in programming cell death. Proteins called anti-apoptotic proteins reside on the outer membrane of mitochondria. The function of those proteins is to prevent apoptosis as long as the cells are exposed to survival factors (421). Another type of proteins called pro-apoptotic proteins which can promote apoptosis exist in balance with anti-apoptotic proteins. Once the survival factor is withdrawn from cell, this balance will be broken, causing equilibrium to shift more toward pro-apoptotic proteins. As a result, there is an increasing in chance for cell to undergo apoptosis (421).

==Apoptosis in Neurons==

All neurons have suicide genes, and these genes are influenced by brain chemistry and activation patterns.
Fetal development is a very competitive process because at this stage, the nervous system massively overproduces cells (produces more than 50% the amount that survive). As this huge amount of cells compete for connections, those who are not able to make a connection die off because their suicide genes are activated. This competition for connections consists of axons fighting for space on the Post-Synaptic cell: axons begin by branching widely and connecting to many sites, and the few that are strengthened through positive feedback (in this case, recurring signals between the axon and the post-synaptic cell) are the ones that are maintained. As a result, each cell makes fewer and more selective connections as prenatal development progresses. On the other hand, the others who lose the competition and fail to receive positive feedback go through apoptosis (suicide genes are activated)

Apoptosis and necrosis differ in the sense that necrosis results in messy byproducts from injury or toxins, which can cause contamination or inflammation. This sort of cell death is injurious and deleterious, whereas apoptosis is an essential and neat process where cell death does not leave byproducts or unnecessary material behind.


==Apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans==


Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans, are a type of nematode where research is undergone to better understand apoptosis in multicellular organisms.  Research can be done with the C. elegans by the fact that throughout the C. elegans' development, the cell numbers are regulated and controlled in about all adult worms.  Therefore, all the adult worms contain about the same number of cells in each mature organ.  The executioner caspase in C. elegans is CED-3, which in turn triggers the apoptosis. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The apoptosis in C. elegans rank similar to apoptosis in higher organisms because the CED-3 caspase in C. elegans contain homologs to the caspases in mammals, e.g. caspase -3 and caspase-8.  CED-3 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen; dimerization and autoproteolysis generate the active components (the large and small subunits) from the N-terminal prodomain.  The oligomerized CED-4 bring together and active the before inactive CED-3 monomers, a parallel process of mammalian caspase-9 activation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A way for C. elegans regulates the activation of CED-3 and apoptosis is recently found to be CSP-3; a cytoplasmic protein that mimics the CED-3 small subunit, binding to and sequestering the CED-3 zymogen.  Before, CSP-3 was found to be a negative regulator of apoptosis in cells that should survive, but it did not block the appropriate induction of apoptosis in cells that should die.  Therefore, CSP-3 was considered a caspase-like gene and scientists were still clueless on the true origin of regulation.  Recent research shows on the other hand that the CSP-3 is able to bind the CED-3 zymogen in vitro and in vivo, and that CSP-3 is a modulator of CED-3 activation instead of a true caspase inhibitor.  This demonstrates that CSP-3 does prevent inappropriate CED-3 dimerization and autoactivation.  On a side note, CED-4 is a gene that can override the CSP-3 and its effects on CED-3 and apoptosis.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Cellular Apoptosis and Mitochondria==


ATP production is not the only invaluable skill mitochondria possess.  They are a vital component of the cell’s cellular transduction network that is capable of triggering apoptosis, or programmed cell death.  The primary proteinic signal that initiates this process is cytochrome-c, an electron transporting membrane protein, which releases chemical messengers that activate caspases and lead the cell to following an apoptotic program that shuts it down.  So, even though mitochondria are constantly providing the cell with energy through maintaining an ionic gradient that converts ADP into ATP by way of ATP Synthase, the organelle is also capable of inflicting cellular suicide by over-expressing the same membrane proteins that perform electron transport to maintain that ionic gradient.  To prevent unintentional initiation of apoptosis, the organelle relies on the expression of bcl-2 to counteract the effects of cytochrome-c by preventing its translocation from the mitochondria.

==Additional Forms of Cell Death==
====Autophagy====
Autophagy is a process described as a pro-survival pathway that is considered essential for cellular homeostasis and stress responses. It accompanies cell death and is capable of leading to cell death under certain circumstances. This process is carried out by the Atg genes; during this period, intracellular contents are consumed by either double or multi-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase is necessary for the progression of autophagy because the rapamycin kinases release its inhibitory effects on the ULK1 kinase complex. Autophagy is in charge of the turnover of long-lived proteins, the elimination of misfolded proteins and some damaged organelles, and also the recycling of cellular building blocks after nutrient depravation. Therefore autophagy is an essential pro-survival pathway in cellular homeostasis and also stress because it can actually carry out cell death.

====Necrosis====
Necrosis was originally categorized as accidental cell death, but due to recent research, it is now recognized as a genetically controlled event. This process involves various characteristics such as: cell swelling, organelle dysfunction, and cell lysis. Necrosis does not have precise mechanisms identified, but a few regulators such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase, apoptosis inducing factor, death-associated protein kinase, and reactive oxygen species have been identified and associated with necrosis. A sub-category of necrosis is known as necroptosis, which is triggered by death receptors in cells that are apoptosis incompetent.

==Regulators of Necrosis==

===Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF)===



Although AIF is one of many regulators for programmed cell death (PCD), it has other unique functions that allows itself to be differentiated from other apoptosis factors shown in the picture. It was at first discovered as a caspase-independent death effector but later studies have shown that it is directly related to programmed cell death pathways that particular types of cells take. AIF performs its deadly function when it is signaled to be released from mitochondria and is translocated initially to the cytosol then to the nucleus of the targeted cell. At the nucleus, it can induce apoptosis related features such as DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. AIF’s effect is entirely dependent on its intrinsic DNA binding abilities as well as the cell type of the target cell because AIF has later been discovered to have crucial mitochondrial roles in healthy cells that are not tagged to have programmed cell death. AIF has a role in DNA binding as well. These studies lead to many questions as to AIF’s essential role in the body and if proper functions can be carried out in its absence.

====Structure and Function====

[[File:AIF factor.png|thumb|AIF protein]]

Mitochondrial AIF proteins, as mentioned above, have a lethal purpose to facilitate programmed cell death. It does so upon mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), after which it will be released into the cytosol and eventually to the nucleus where it condenses chromatin and degrades DNA fragments to carry out PCD. Primary AIF transcripts go through very tissue-specific splicing and create two exons: exon 2a and 2b. The two exons allow for production of two splice variants and create two isoforms that show a small and limited difference found in the inner membrane-sorting signal (IMSS). The N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) is absent in these variants, but the C-terminal domain remains unaffected. The C-terminal domain is where the pro-apoptotic segment is located, and upon transfection (or more commonly termed transformation) the variant genes (AIFsh) are expressed in the nucleus and activate apoptosis. There are variations of the AIFsh that include isoforms that do not have the C-terminal domain with the apoptotic features or another form that lacks the mitochondrial localization signal and essentially is rendered to have similar functions as the AIFsh lacking the C-terminal domain.

X-ray crystallography has provided pictures of the AIF structure that has led to another way that AIF carries out its function. The structure shows that AIF possesses positively charged amino acids that are distributed throughout its surface; this distribution of positive charge is very similar to that of DNA-binding histones. This discovery explains and is consistent with the observation of AIF’s intrinsic DNA-binding capabilities and how effective it is as an apoptosis regulator. A few of the positive residues are required for AIF-nucleic acid binding and for inducing nuclear apoptosis due to the overexpression of AIF. The recombinant AIF genes induces DNA condensation through direct, sequence-independent interactions with the DNA, whether it be single- or double-stranded. The DNA condensation can be amplified by adding reduced pyridine nucleotides, NADPH, or NADH. 

====Evolutionary Family====



Other regulators of apoptosis come from the same larger mitochondrial flavoprotein family that AIF belongs too. They have common structural and functional features in eukaryotic versions of the protein. But AIF has a slightly different biosynthesis and finalizing processing than the other members of the family. The AIF gene consists of over 16 exons and is located on the human chromosome X. AIF1, variant AIF gene with the C-terminal domain, is the most common and abundant transcript. It is translated in the cytoplasm and sent to the mitochondria of healthy cells. Its N-terminal part is required for the import of the AIF protein through the membrane (outer and inner) of the mitochondria. This N-terminal part is encoded by the first exon of 35 amino acids that make up the gene. As the fully processed AIF protein is inserted in the inner membrane, it matures and folds into its quaternary structure using its co-factor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Because of AIF’s dependence on its cofactor, it has similar folds as the bacterial NAD and contains two FAD-binding segments. These features were conserved through the evolution of these different proteins. 
 
====AIF Regulation====

AIF can be both triggered and inhibited (or regulated) by other metabolic processes or proteins. AIF expression has been correlated to the sensitivity of anti-cancer drugs. Its reduced expression has also been seen when hepatocyte growth factors have been added to the cell, which increases cisplatin resistance. Increased cisplatin sensitivity is often seen with increased expression of AIF. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack FAK (focal adhesion kinase), it is observed that there’s a smaller amount of HGF which exhibit the aforementioned correlations. Most of these studies are only clinical and have been performed on only mice. 

The amount of AIF proteins are also regulated after translation. Its concentration is positively regulated by scythe, also referred to as BAT3. BAT3 is a protein used in the regulation of cell death and cell proliferation. Scythe has been known to prolong the half-life of AIF, and when its levels are low it promotes AIF breakdown. Other inhibitors of apoptosis have been known to trigger the degradation of AIF. However, these occurrences have little to no effect on the AIF proteins found in the inner mitochondrial membrane which have yet to be modified to be released into the cytosol. 

====AIF and the Mitochondria====



Lack of AIF expression leads to a defect in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, especially in complex I. This observation again was only experimented on mice. A significant detection of malfunction in the respiratory chain was located in various tissues such as the cerebellum, cortex, retina, and skeletal muscles. Malfunction, however, could not be detected on tissues of the heart, liver, and testis of male mice. Researchers are still perplexed at how tissue-specific the defect is. Analyses do show that the deficiency in complex I activity in mouse and human cells that lack AIF is due to a decreased expression of various other nuclear-encoded protein subunits found in the respiratory chain. There are 46 total protein subunits that make up complex I, and 39 of which are nuclear-encoded to be translated int the cytosol and taken into the mitochondria. It has been shown that overexpression of a mitochondrion-localized AIF fixes the malfunctions in complex I subunits that are caused by endogenous AIF proteins. Although this evidence shows valuable insight, mechanisms that lead to inefficiencies of complex I are still up to greater debate and research. Results of various recent experiments have shown inconsistent observations that may or may not link AIF directly to the complex I. 

Many hypotheses have been made about AIF’s relation to complex I:

*AIF levels affect the high level of complex I proteins through post-transcriptional mechanisms
*AIF is an integral part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, not just related to complex I
*Physical interactions of the AIF proteins with the respiratory chain subunits could affect their assembly or stability
*AIF could be a part of the maintenance of the active complex I due to its redox-regulated activity which is inherent because of AIF’s outer and reactive positive charge distribution 


====AIF’s Role in Development/Survival====

Although AIF has been known for years of its function to induce apoptosis, it also has essential functions in cell survival because of its role in the metabolism of cells and in the mitochondria. As of recently, studies of AIF’s role in survival have been exclusively done on mice. Having low continuous amounts of AIF throughout an aging adult’s lifetime can have dire health consequences. An approximate 80% decrease in AIF gene expression in mice has shown continual neurodegeneration that affects the mice’s various brain regions. When a complete absence of AIF proteins in the mice was observed, apoptosis still occurred in its usual fashion. This leads to the conclusion that AIF in terms of apoptotic function is dispensable, especially during embryonic neural tube closure. 

Rather than using AIF, the triggering of programmed cell death was done by defective activity of the mitochondria’s respiratory chain complex I. Lack of AIF expression in the brain is directly linked to the inefficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Because of its malfunction, the midbrain and cerebellum of the mice at early stages of brain development were observed to have defects such a cerebellar hypoplasia. The Purkinje precursor cells of these embryos undergo apoptosis even in the absence of AIF as well. Granule cells also show defective cell cycle transitions (particularly from G1 to S steps). AIF in skeletal muscle and the myocardium causes organ-specific complex I malfunction. Although these mice look normal for the first 2 months since birth, they develop muscle atrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and have a dramatic reduced body weight. Decreased expression of AIF leads to oxidative phosphorylation complications that affect the body’s entire metabolism. Mice with absence of AIF in either their muscles or life (called AIF knockout) display higher glucose tolerance, increased sensitivity to insulin, and overall reduced fat mass. These observations imply that no AIF expression in one organ leads to it being fully resistant to obesity and diabetes even when put on a diet high of lipids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Beta-Cantenin gets jaded and von Hippel-Lindau is to blame==

This research papers delves into the idea of the von Hippel-Lindau protein that is negatively regulated by beta-Catenin and Jade-1 via various mechanisms. One must first understand the proteins to connect the significance of their partnership. 

===Proteins Discussed===
Von Hippel-Lindau is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the VHL gene. The inactivity of the protein is associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease. The VHL protein works through E3 ubiquitin ligase activity which targets specific proteins for degradation. However, the inactivity of the protein may cause an excess growth of cells, or a tumor.
	
Beta-Catenin, or β-catenin, is part of a series of proteins that constitute adherens junctions and maintain epithelial cell layers in organs. The protein is used to regulate the production of VHL through negative feedback. This research paper focuses on Wnt- β-catenin which undergoes signal transduction. Wnts in particular “comprise a conserved family of secreted” (Berndt).

	Jade-1 binds to β-catenin to “negatively regulates β-catenin levels in the absence of the Wnts stimulation” (Berndt). The expression of Jade-1 is what primarily determines the reduction of β-catenin. In some cases, the over expression of Jade-1 can reduce the presence of β-catenin by 50-60%. Jade-1 may be used in conjunction with VHL to regulate the production of β-catenin. 
	

Summary of process:


Increase VHL =&gt; Increase Jade-1 =&gt; Decrease β-catenin 

Decrease VHL =&gt; Decrease Jade-1 =&gt; Increase β-catenin

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although much work has been done on protein folding &quot;in vitro&quot;, few research has significantly advanced the work contributing to &quot;in vivo&quot; protein folding.  The importance of the latter comes as a consequence that protein folding is presumably guided by a molecular mechanism instead of a protein independently folding according to the lowest energy conformation.  Although it has proven that proteins are highly successful at reaching their native state only by chaperone proteins, it seems that at the creation of a new protein, something must assist the development of the secondary and tertiary structure.  The authors of a current opinion article in Structural Biology, Lisa D. Cabrita, Christopher M. Dobson, and John Christodoulou have published an update on the recent discoveries of how the nascent chains of a newly synthesized protein emerges in the article entitled, &quot;Protein Folding on the Ribosome.&quot;

== Folding on Ribosome ==
The place where the protein chain begins to fold is a topic that is greatly studied. As the nascent chain goes through the “exit tunnel” of the ribosome and into the cellular environment, when does the chain begin to fold? The idea of cotranslational folding in the ribosomal tunnel will be discussed. The nascent chain of the protein is bound to the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) at its C terminus and will emerge in a vectorial manner. The tunnel is very narrow and enforces a certain rigidity on the nascent chain, with the addition of each amino acid the conformational space of the protein increases. Co translational folding can be a big help in reducing the possible conformational space by helping the protein to acquire a significant level of native state while still in the ribosomal tunnel. The length of the protein can also give a good estimate of its three dimensional structure. Smaller chains tend to favor beta sheets while longer chains (like those reaching 119 out of 153 residues) tend to favor the alpha helix. 

The ribosomal tunnel is more than 80 ampere in length and its width is around 10-20 ampere. Inside the tunnel are auxiliary molecules like the L23, L22, and L4 proteins that interact with the nascent chain help with the folding. The tunnel also has hydrophilic character and helps the nascent chain to travel through it without being hindered. Although rigid, the tunnel is not passive conduit but whether or not it has the ability to promote protein folding is unknown.  A recent experiment involving cryoEM has shown that there are folding zones in the tunnel. At the exit port (some 80 ampere from the PTC), the nascent chain has assumed a preferred low order conformation. This enforces the suggestion that the chain can have degrees of folding at certain regions. Although some low order folding can occur, the adoption of the native state occurs outside the tunnel, but not necessarily when the nascent chain has been released. The bound nascent chain (RNC) adopts partially folded structure and in a crowded cellular environment, this can cause the chain to self-associate. This self-association, however, is relieved with the staggered ribosomes lined along the exit tunnel that maximizes the distances between the RNC.

The current understanding of protein folding has come from ''in vitro'' studies of renaturation of proteins through a variety of different environments as well as ''in silico'' computer simulations.  These studies can only help to extrapolate fractions of the in vivo process of protein formation.  Protein folding is initiated following the synthesis of the nascent polypeptide chain as it is synthesized by the ribosome.  The start of protein folding is therefore coupled with the continuing synthesis of the polypeptide chain.

Currently, protein folding is view as a process that takes place as a consequence of interactions been the amino acid of that protein which can take certain paths to achieve a lowest energy state, the native state.  However, there are certain paths a protein may start to fold by and lead to a conformation that is of low energy but not the native state.  The protein has not way of coming of this conformation without a significant amount of energy input.  This non-native state is a way a protein can be misfolded and lead to aggregation.  Another factor that can influence the likelihood of obtaining the native state is the fact that larger proteins have more possibilities of folding, this decreases the likelihood of forming the most energetically favorable state.  Proteins us the &quot;co-translational folding' to reduce the extent of conformational space available to the protein.  Adding to this, molecular chaperones help to further assist proteins in achieving their native conformational state.

===Generation of RNC for studies===
One technique of generating RNC and taking snapshots as it emerges from the tunnel is to arrest translation. A truncated DNA without a termination sequence is used.  This allows for the nascent chain to remain bound until desired. To determining the residues of the chain, they can be labeled by carbon-13 or nitrogen-15 and later detected by NMR spectroscopy. Another technique is the PURE method and it contains the minimal components required for translation. This method has been used to study the interaction of the chains and auxiliary molecules like the TF chaperone. This method is coupled with quartz-crystal microbalance technique to analyze the synthesis by mass. An in vivo technique in generating RNC chain can be done by stimulating it in a high cell density. This is initially done in an unlabeled environment, the cells are then transferred to a labeled medium. The RNC is generated by SecM. The RNC is purified by affinity chromatography and detected by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting.

By generating the RNCs, many experiments can be done to study more about the emerging nascent chain. As mentioned above, the chain emerges from the exit tunnel in a vectorial manner. This enables the chain to sample the native folding and increases the probability of folding to the native state. Along with this vectorial folding, chaperones also help in favorable folding rates and correct folding.

==Ribosome Structure and Co-translational Protein Folding==
In E. coli the 70S ribosomal particle is composed of 50 proteins and three RNA molecules.  The most interesting structural feature in the 70S ribosomal particle in regards to protein folding is the ribosomal exit tunnel.  This is a channel that links PTC(peptidyl transferase centre) with the cellular environment.  The dimensions include a length of 80 angstoms, width between 10-20 angstroms.  70S is lined with a large RNA molecule and L4 and L22 ribosomal proteins.  Also L23 serves as a docking point for other molecules to assist in the folding process.  L4 and L22 proteins in the ribosomal exit tunnel have been shown by recent cryoEM studies that they can interfere with proteins synthesis along with other interactions with the nascent chain.  In addition, arginine residues have been observes to stop the translation process by changing electrostatic potentials. 
Although ribosomal exit tunnel is presumably to have a more or less rigid structure, it seems that it does partake to a degree support nascent chain folding.  This is evidence by the fact that on average the tunnel is able to accommodate about 30-40 residues, which is considerably more than a polypeptide chain sequence that is fully extended.  The degree to which a nascent chain folds seems to vary depending on the kind of protein being synthesized.  Certain nascent chains transmembrane protein sequences appear to possibly already construct an alpha-helical structure inside the tunnel.
Studying nascent chains emerging from the ribosomal exit tunnel has proven to be a significant challenge for any of the current methods of structural and cellular biology.  One idea presented in this paper is to take be able to have &quot;snapshot&quot; of the elongation process.  In order to due this, translation must be arrested artificially which would involve engineering DNA strands that lacks a stop codon.  Another issue is also in focusing on  the particular residues of interest on the nascent chain within the sea of other residues form the ribosome.

==Understanding Co-translational Folding by Biochemical and Biophysical Studies==
Once examples illuminated in the article is using SDS-Page on the risbosomal bound nascent chains(RNCs) of influenza haemagglutinin which showed they can form disulfide bonds and undergo glycosylation.  Also, using monoclonal antibodies, it has been discovered that there is variability in the emergence of the nascent chain from the tunnel.  These examples among others demonstrate that not only can nascent chains acquire structure but also activity while still being attached to the ribosome.  The speed of folding for nascent chains seems to be related to the number of stop and rare codons present.  The reasoning is that a discontinuous translation rate will slow down the folding process.  However, slower rates seem to produce more efficient folding since the nascent chain has more time to develop its native structure.  Most of the biochemical and physical methods illuminating the understanding of co-translational folding has been eluded by x-ray crystallography because of the dynamic nature of the folding process which in crystallography is very difficult to obtain.

==Auxiliary Factors in Co-translational folding==
As the nascent chain starts emerging from the tunnel, it has to opportunity to interact with molecules that will assist int eh folding process.  These include molecular chaperones, peptide deformylase, and the signal recognition particle. The first molecule in assisting the nascent chain in folding is the 48kDa TF which docks on L23.  This protein in the absence of a nascent chain will dock on and off however iwth the presence of the nascent chain its affinity to bind to L23 increases.  TF undergoes a conformational change in a where a protective cavity is formed for the nascent chain.  TF enables enough of the polypeptide chain to emerge such that a significant degree of folding can be achieved.  It does this by binding to hydrophobic segments of the chain even after is has released from L23.  Once hydrophobic regions of chain are no longer exposed, TF seem to unbind and allow further helper molecules to assist in protein folding.  TF seems to increase folding efficiency but at the expense of being slower to fold.  Protein translocation is then done by SRT which shuttles the TF to a heterotrimeric integral membrane protein.  This then allow further processing and folding.

==Ribosome subunit in prokaryote cells and eukaryote cells==

The ribosomes catalyze peptide bond formation, in a process called [[#Peptidyl Transfer Catalysis By Ribosome|peptidyl transfer catalysis]], and synthesize polypeptides by reading the genetic code of the mRNA.  The ribosome is composed of a large and a small subunit both in prokaryote and eukaryote cells. Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit. Eukaryotes have 80S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (40S) and large (60S) subunit. Due to the differences in their structures, the bacterial 70S ribosomes are vulnerable to these antibiotics while the eukaryotic 80S ribosomes are not. Within the cellular structure, mitochondria have ribosomes similar to the bacterial ones; however, mitochondria within eukaryote cells are not affected by these antibiotics because they are surrounded by membrane around its organelle. The initiation of the translation process in bacteria was found to locate on 30s subunit. This process requires the increase of both the incubation temperature and ionic strength in order to assemble into the correct tertiary structure contained with its amino acid sequence. The research experiments done by Dr. Masayasu’s research on the synthesis of ribosomes and ribosomal components in E-coli, also found that the correct assembly of the ribosomal particles is locating in the structures of their own molecular component and not by other nonribosomal factors.  

A ribosome is the essential contributing factor in protein synthesis where it is assembled on the translation initiation region (TIR) of the mRNA during the initiation phase of translation.  The mRNA is decoded as it slides through the large ribosomal subunit and places the a polypeptide chain in the other subunit of the ribosome. Newly synthesized protein will then dissociate once the stop codon is reached in the ribosome. In the final ribosome recycling phase, the ribosomal subunits dissociate and the mRNA is released. The main events of the translation process are relatively similar in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Major differences in the detailed mechanism of each phase exist. Bacterial translation involves relatively few factors, in contrast to the more complex process in eukaryotes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ebola virus operates via an envelope glycoprotein (GP) which is solely responsible for the virus’ ability to infect new cells.  The virus’ genome consists of only seven genes; however, one of these genes is responsible for the generation of two proteins via transcriptional editing.   The first protein, known as sGP, is primarily produced during the early stages of infection.  Its purpose is structural and it does not come in contact with the surface of the cell.  The second protein, GP, contains a hydrophobic tail, and thus is present on the surface of the envelope, making it responsible for the infection of new cells.  To complicate things further, the immune response is mitigated by the presence of sGP.  In fact, immune response demonstrates a preference for sGP over GP, allowing the virus to replicate more quickly.  For this reason, the goal is to create an antibody that will target the GP while ignoring sGP.  

X-ray crystallography of GP has allowed biochemists to understand its structure.  GP contains 676 amino acids broken up into two subsections covalently connected by disulfide bonds.  The first subsection is responsible for attachment to the host cell.  The second subsection integrates the viral envelope into the host cell membrane.  The most promising method for foiling the virus involves the creation of a specific monoclonal antibody that targets GP1 or GP2.

The carbohydrate is attached by a process called [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Glycosylation|glycosylation]]. Proteins that have extending segments in an extracellular manner are often glycosylated. Glycosylation occurs in one of two modes:

N-Glycosylation where the carbohydrate adds onto the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Amide|amide]] Nitrogen of an [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|asparagine]].

O-Glycosylation where the carbohydrate adds onto the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Hydroxyl|hydroxyl]] Oxygen of a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|serine]] or a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|threonine]].

Note that these glycosylation reactions of a protein will only occur when the protein has the following order: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr. X in the sequence can be any protein except [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|proline]]. Glycoproteins are often important [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Integral Membrane Protein|integral membrane proteins]], such that they allow cell-cell interactions.

[[File:Pepsin.jpg|thumb|Pepsin]]

Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910-1994) is credited with being the founder of protein crystallography. In addition to further developing and refining the technique of [[Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/X-ray_Crystallography|X-ray crystallography]], she determined the three dimensional structures of pepsin, cholesterol, lactoglobulin, ferritin, tobacco mosaic virus, penicillin, vitamin B-12, and insulin, among many others. She was the first person to discover the shape of a globular protein (pepsin), and she won the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determining the molecular shape of hundreds of molecules. 


Dorothy Crowfoot graduated from Somerville College of Oxford in 1932 with a degree in chemistry. She began her doctoral work at Cambridge in 1933 with Dr. J.D. Bernal, where she first studied the structural arrangement in atoms of crystals. Realizing that she could use X-ray crystallography to study more complex molecules, she determined that proteins should be studied with the “mother” matrix surrounding them and not air dried, as was standard procedure at the time. 


[[File:Cholesterol.svg|thumb|Cholesterol]]


Further improvements she devised for the technique of X-ray crystallography occurred during her study of cholesterol iodide and over one hundred other steroids. Her accomplishments include the reporting of unit-cell dimensions, recording of reactive indices with respect to their crystallographic axes, which showed the molecules crystal packing, and the elucidation of the hydrogen-bond scheme among atoms. These techniques were a major breakthrough for legitimizing X-ray crystallography as an accurate analytical technique because her analyses were the first that were based on three dimensional calculations and that established the stereochemistry at each carbon atom.  


[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|Penicillin core]]


In 1934 she returned to Oxford on a research fellowship, where she crystallized and X-ray photographed insulin. To determine its structure, she worked with an isomorphous crystal, a derivative molecule where a single atom is replaced by a heavier one. Thirty four years later, she would finally find success in determining the structure of insulin. Meanwhile, she received her doctorate from Cambridge University and married Thomas Hodgkin in 1937 and began her work on determining the structure of penicillin. She determined that there were three derivatives of benzylpenicillin, sodium, potassium, and rubidium. She used the techniques of isomorphous replacement, optical analogs, and difference maps to elucidate the structure. She also used the first IBM analog computers to do the X-ray calculations, which was the first use of an electronic computer to solve a biochemical problem. Penicillin was instrumental in treating wounded soldiers during World War II, and saved many lives. Knowing penicillin’s structure enabled the synthesis of chemically modified penicillin, crucial for the high demand encountered during the war. While completing her penicillin research, Dr. Hodgkin was named a fellow of the Royal Society, Britain's premiere scientific organization, in 1947.


[[File:VitaminB12.png|thumb|VitaminB12]]

From 1955 to 1961 she worked on determining the structure of vitamin B-12 by locating the positions of the heavy atoms, using direct Patterson methods, and then calculating the three-dimensional Fourier series using observed F values and phases based only on the heavy atom's positions. By pioneering the use of Patterson maps, Dorothy was able to approximate the correct electron density series.



In addition to receiving the Royal Medal, she also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1964, making her the third woman to win the Nobel. She was named by Queen Elizabeth II as a member of the Order of Merit, the United Kingdom's highest royal order, in 1965.  



Without Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin’s pioneering techniques and contributions to structural biochemistry, it is doubtless that the field would not be as advanced as it is today.

The fatty acid synthase is composed of acetyl CoA, malonyl CaA, and NADPH. The enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. In bacteria, the fatty acid synthase dossociates into individual enzymes when cells degrade. 

The formation of acetyl ACP and malonyl ACP take part in the elongation of fatty acids through two enzymes, acetyl transacylase and malonyl transacylase. Acetyl transacylase tranfers acyl group, and malonyl transacylase is highly specific. The two ACP molecules react to form acetoacetyl ACP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Membrane Protein Folding ==

The study of membrane protein folding has been complicated by several factors.  Historically, membrane proteins have been very difficult to crystallize due to their large amounts of hydrophobic residues.  Proteins that reside in these biological membranes have different surface properties than water-soluble proteins.  The proteins are more so affected by the lateral forces and elastic forces from being within the membrane.  Duplicating these conditions in order to observe a membrane protein in vitro has been difficult due to the fact that once the membrane protein has been separated, it either unfolds or no longer stays functional.

=== Approaches to Study Membrane Proteins ===
==== Manipulating Lipid Bilayer ====
Maniuplating the lipid bilayer to observe proteins has been increasingly successful.  Studies used on smaller water-soluble proteins are very effective with this method.  The combination of kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the small water-soluble proteins have been feasible to observe the helical proteins which contain a lot of alpha helices.

==Consequences of incorrect protein folding==
Incorrectly folded proteins are associated with prion-related illnesses such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), amyloid-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and familial amyloid cardiomyopathy or polyneuropathy, as well as intracytoplasmic aggregation diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. These age onset degenerative diseases are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins into insoluble, extracellular aggregates and/or intracellular inclusions including cross-beta sheet amyloid fibrils. While it is not completely clear whether the aggregates are the cause or merely a reflection of the loss of protein homeostasis, the balance between synthesis, folding, aggregation and protein turnover, the recent European Medicines Agency approval of Tafamidis or Vyndaqel (a kinetic stabilizer of tetrameric transthyretin) for the treatment of the transthyretin amyloid diseases suggests that it is the process of amyloid fibril formation and not the fibrils themselves that causes the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue in human amyloid diseases.[18] Misfolding and excessive degradation instead of folding and function leads to a number of proteopathy diseases such as antitrypsin-associated emphysema, cystic fibrosis and the lysosomal storage diseases, where loss of function is the origin of the disorder. While protein replacement therapy has historically been used to correct the latter disorders, an emerging approach is to use pharmaceutical chaperones to fold mutated proteins to render them functional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Light Reaction converts light to ATP and NADPH, an electron carrier. This reaction occurs in the thylakoid, and it requires visible light for the chlorophyll (a type of molecule known as pigment that absorbs light) to absorb all visible light except for green. Chlorophyll are organized in the thylakoid membrane (in the photosystems).

Then the electron gains energy from light and jumps up to a higher electron shell; this excited state is unstable and temporary, and so it jumps back to the original position. As it returns to its ground state, it gives off energy in the form of heat, and this heat is then absorbed by a neighboring chlorophyll, which passes on the heat to another neighboring chlorophyll and so on until the heat reaches the reaction center chlorophyll. At this point, the reaction center chlorophyll's electron gets excited and passed on to the primary electron acceptor, and the reaction center chlorophyll results with a missing electron that is regained from H2O (electron donor). Before this stage, H2O is converted to 2e- + 2H + 1/2 O2 and this is how it is able to donate an electron. The primary electron acceptor now has an extra electron, which is donated to the electron transport chain that has H+ pumping. The ATP synthase pumps the H+ back in to the stroma and converts ADP + P → ATP. All of this occurs in Photosystem II. Then, the final electron acceptor is the reaction center chlorophyll of PhotoSystem I. PS I receives an electron from PS II, and the primary electron acceptor of PS I donates the electron to another electron transport chain. This electron transport chain has no H+ pumping and no ATP; instead, it generates NADPH from NADP+. Thus, the purpose of the light reaction is to convert light to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH &lt;ref&gt;http://dirac.ruc.dk/~thm/thylakoid.html&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Thylakoid membrane.svg|thumb|Photosystem II and I]]

There are three steps in converting Light energy to ATP and NADPH
#To capture the light energy from the sun
#Undergo Photosystem II and I to convert ATP and NADPH
#The converted ATP and NADPH is used to reduce CO2 to sugar

The photosystems undergo in the internal membrane called Thylakoid membrane. Thylakoid membrane is membrane full of collections of pigments and proteins. There are four types of pigments they are: chlorophylls, carotenes, xanthophylls and phycobilins. The light reaction uses the light power to create ATP and NADPH2 to provide reducing energy to undergo the chemical reaction to reduce the CO2 to sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Basic N-glycan.jpg|thumb|A basic N-glycan structure (fr)]]
Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are also known as glycans. Glycans usually possess O-glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides. Cellulose, for example, is a glycan with β-1,4-linked D-glucose. Chitin is another glycan with β-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Glycans can be homo or heteropolymers of monosaccharide residues. They can have linear or branched features. Glycan may also refer to carbohydrate portions of glycoprotein, glycolipid, or a proteoglycan. Glycans can also be modified by a variety of different substituents, such as sulfation and acetylation. A variety of modifications of glycan enhances their diversity in nature and often serves as mediators of specific biological functions. For example, because many glycan are on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, they are in charge of a wide variety of events in cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-molecule interactions that are important in the development and functions of a cell. Another function of these glycan is to act as a mediator in the interactions between different organisms.

===Human Milk Oligosaccharides===

Human milk oligosaccharides are complex glycans that can be found in breast milk. One of the most important factors in infant’s diet is from breast milk, which pertains one of the most complex group of oligosaccharides known as Human milk oligosaccharides(HMOs). They are found in three, four, five, or even six chain sugars. For example, some of the HMOs include raffinose, 2’-fucosyl-lactose, 3’-fucosyl-lactose, 3’-sialyl-lactose, 6’-sialyl-lactose, and Lacto-N-tetraose. These HMOs differ in their size, structure, and specific linkages. There are more than 150 distinct Human Milk Oligosaccharide structures out there that are identified so far. Also, these HMOs are distinct in their structure, acidity, and functions. The backbone of Human Milk Oligosaccharides is the disaccharide lactose, which is formed by the linkage between galactose and glucose sugars. The final structure of HMO all depends on whether the backbone, lactose, is fucosylated or sialated, in either beta or alpha configurations or at a different carbon. For example, 2’-fucosyl-lactose has a fucose group at the alpha-1-3 position of the glucose monosaccharide of the lactose. Being sialated means the addition of a sialic acid group and formation of an acidic HMO.

==Introduction to Glycobiology==
Chemical glycobiogly deals with how glycans are formed and broken down. It deals with what glycan's biological roles are when they are settled and how the roles can be modified. To understand these issues, scientists have used a cooperative strategy of interrogation and perturbation. The interrogation strategy main purpose is to study and understand endogenous reactions and interactions between natural glycans and their binding complements. To be able to possess naturally forming and special glycans will enable researches to study protein-glycan and enzyme-glycan interactions. Arrangements made up of glycoconjugates, also known as lectins are useful tools for finding out more about protein-binding specificity or cellular glycosylation patterns. Along with the perturbation approach, using inhibtors, analaogs and substrates that are not natural can find out more about biosynthesis and how glycans function biologically. Both different oligosaccharides that are not natural and synthetically produced glycoconjugates can discourages or promote certain biomolecular interactions within the cells and organisms. In addition, there are compounds that are found to close off important steps to the process of the glycan biosynthetic pathways. 

Another important subjects to cover is carboyhdrate analogs, which are carbohydrates of similar structures with just different substituted groups. Carbohydrate analogs are used with glycans in many different ways. One example is imaging glycans. Another one is cross linking them to binding partners. Using these tools and chemical strategies, the molecular mechanisms that deal with glycan function can be better understood.

===Glycan Synthesis===
Pinpointing and defining oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates are important for understanding how glycans operate and function. To get these things from natural soruces is very hard because when these substances produce, it deals with the interaction of multiple transporters and enzymes. This makes the whole process very complex. It is very complex as shown by the pathway for eukaryotic glycoprotein synthesis. The materials that form saccharides need to be produced and then sent to the correct cellular place. This place is where they are utilized for glycosyltransfereases. The speediness and optimization of making certain glycans are dependent upon how concentrated the building are, the type of glycosyltransferases and different biosynthetic enzymes in addition to the Km value of the these building blocks that are responsible for the glycosyltransferases that utilize them. The pathways that create N-glyocporteins, O-glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosylphosphatidlyinositol anchors, proteoglycans, and polysacchardies are affected how easily the nucleotide donors can be obtained. However, the mechanims that control the governance of these pathways are currently in the process of being figured out. Therefore, is extremely hard to get enough amounts of glycans to examine and study from their biological sources. 

Chemical strategies are now being utilize to deal with this issue. The strategy for dealing with this is providing the means to produce growning amounts of a variety of glycans. Glycans that occur naturally can be synthesized just like derivatives. This is significant because important relationships between the structure and activity can be examined further. Two basic strategies for synthesizing oligosaccharides are chemical and enzymatic.

Embedding a script inside a Blender document is useful for some special purposes, but often you want to be able to reuse an addon across any number of Blender documents, and perhaps distribute it to others for use with their Blender projects. To do this, you will need to save the script as a text file that can be copied into your Blender user preferences. It will also need to have some additional information inserted.

== The Addon Info Dictionary ==
In order for the addon to be installable by Blender, it will need to define a global called &lt;TT&gt;bl_info&lt;/TT&gt;, the value of which is a dictionary. This contains various information about compatibility with versions of Blender, and also descriptive information to be shown to the user as they browse through the list of installable addons.

Here’s what the info should look like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
bl_info = \
    {
        &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Tetrahedron Maker&quot;,
        &quot;author&quot; : &quot;J Random Hacker &lt;jrhacker@example.com&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;version&quot; : (1, 0, 0),
        &quot;blender&quot; : (2, 5, 7),
        &quot;location&quot; : &quot;View 3D &gt; Edit Mode &gt; Tool Shelf&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot; :
            &quot;Generate a tetrahedron mesh&quot;,
        &quot;warning&quot; : &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;wiki_url&quot; : &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;tracker_url&quot; : &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;category&quot; : &quot;Add Mesh&quot;,
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Most of the fields are informational. The “category” value must be one of the predefined ones that you will see listed in Blender’s User Preferences window when you switch to the “Add-Ons” tab; the addon display is sorted by category and by name within category, and the user can list scripts in all categories or in just one category.

The “version” field indicates the version of your script, and can be a tuple of any number of integers; the numbers are shown to the user joined with decimal points (e.g. “(1, 0, 0)” is displayed as “1.0.0”). The “blender” field indicates compatibility with versions of Blender; Blender versions older than this are supposed to reject the script. (Though what happens when a ''newer'' version introduces a backward-incompatible API change is not quite clear...)
== Making The Addon Installable ==

The contents of your addon script are now complete. In the Text Editor, find the “Save As” option under the “Text” menu, and choose a filename for saving your script—perhaps call it &lt;TT&gt;TetrahedronMaker.py&lt;/TT&gt;.

That’s it. This saved text file is your complete addon, ready for installation into your Blender user settings, or distribution to others for installation in their settings.

== Installing The Addon ==

To install the addon into your Blender user settings, go to the User Preferences, and bring up the Add-Ons tab. (It doesn’t matter what document you might have open at this stage.) In the window header, click the “Install Add-On...” button, and find the &lt;TT&gt;TetrahedronMaker.py&lt;/TT&gt; file you previously saved; select that, and click the “Install Add-On” button in the file selector. This copies the script file into your personal addons directory, which in Unix/Linux is &lt;TT&gt;~/.blender/2.5&lt;/TT&gt;''x''&lt;TT&gt;/scripts/addons/&lt;/TT&gt;. You can also directly copy your script file into this directory, instead of using the “Install Add-On...” button. To uninstall an addon, use the Remove button that appears in its info panel (see below) or delete the script from this directory, together with its &lt;TT&gt;.pyc&lt;/TT&gt; (compiled) version (which you will find in the &lt;TT&gt;__pycache__&lt;/TT&gt; subdirectory).

== Using The Installed Addon ==

To make use of the installed addon, open a new Blender document. Go to the User Preferences window, and bring up the Add-Ons tab. Browse through the list of addons (feel free to restrict the display to the “Add Mesh” category as specified above) until you find your Tetrahedron Maker. You can click the white triangle to the left of the name to expand the list item display to show all the details:

[[File:BlenderTetrahedronAddonEnable.png|center]]

Note the buttons that may appear along the bottom: the “Remove” button appears for your own user-installed scripts, not for ones installed systemwide; the “Link to the Wiki” button is only visible if you provided a URL in the “&lt;TT&gt;wiki_url&lt;/TT&gt;” field of your bl_info; and “Report a Bug” comes up only if there is something in the “&lt;TT&gt;tracker_url&lt;/TT&gt;” field.

Click the checkbox in the top right corner of the item display to enable the addon for this document.

Now switch to the 3D View, bring up the Tool Shelf if it’s not already visible, and you should see that familiar panel appear:

      <comment>/* Dipole Induced Dipole */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background Information==

A noncovalent bond is a type of chemical bond that typically bond between macromolecules. They do not involve sharing a pair of electrons. Noncovalent bonds are used to bond large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Noncovalent bonds are weaker than covalent bonds but they are crucial for biochemical processes such as the formation of double helix. There are four commonly mentioned fundamental noncovalent bond types. They include electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. Each type differs in geometry, strength, and specificity.

==Types of Noncovalent Bonds==
===Electrostatic interactions===
The energy of an electrostatic interaction is given by Coulomb’s Law:
E = kq1q2 / Dr2 
where E is the energy, q1 and q2 are the charges of two atoms, r is the distance between the two atoms, D is the dielectric constant, and k is a proportionality constant. k = 1389 for energy that’s measured in kilojoules/mol or k = 332 for energy that’s measured in kcal/mol.
A charged group on a molecule can attract an oppositely charged group from another molecule. By contract, an attractive interaction has a negative energy. The dielectric constant is important for the medium.

===Hydrogen bonds===
[[File:Hydrogen-bonding-in-water-2D.png|150px|thumb|right]]
A hydrogen bond is the interaction of a hydrogen atom with an electronegative atom. The electronegative atom can be nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine that comes from another chemical group. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for specific base-pair formation in the DNA double helix. The hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond is shared by two electronegative atoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. A hydrogen-bond donor is the group that includes an electronegative atom where the hydrogen atom is more tightly bound to and a hydrogen-bond acceptor is when an electronegative atom is less tightly bound to the hydrogen atom. The electronegative atom where the hydrogen atom covalently bonds can pull electron density away from the hydrogen atom creating a positive electronegativity charge. The hydrogen atom can also interact with an atom that has negative electronegativity charge.

===van der Waals interactions===
Van der Waals interaction is the distribution of electronic charge around an atom that fluctuates with time. It is the sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules. The charge distribution is not perfectly symmetric. The attraction increases as two atoms come closer to each other, until they are separated by the van der Waals contact distance. When the distance of the energy is shorter than the van der Waals contact distance, a very strong repulsive force becomes dominant.

===Hydrophobic interactions===
Hydrophobic interaction is the physical property of a molecule that is repelled from a mass of water. They are also called hydrophobic exclusions. It is the tendency of hydrocarbons to form intermolecular aggregates in an aqueous medium, and analogous intramolecular interactions.

===Ion Induced Dipole=== 
An ion induced dipole is a noncovalent bond interaction that results when the approach of an ion induced a dipole in an atom or in a nonpolar molecule by distributing the arrangement of electrons in the nonpolar species.
 
===Dipole Induced Dipole===
A dipole-induced dipole interactions results a nonpolar molecule has it's electron density shifted by a charged molecule. If a negatively charged species described by its electron density (for example, in water electron density is centralized on the oxygen atom) is brought near a species with an evenly distributed charged molecule, the electrons go towards the side where the positive species is, and away from the opposite side, creating an artificial dipole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Combining cryo-electron tomography and 3D image classification together allow for better opportunities to determine the structure of membrane proteins in undisturbed cells. It relies on averaging a vast array of images of identical copies of a complex to determine its structure.
 
==Tomography==

Tomography is a technique used to assemble a 3D view, called a tomogram, from several images of the structure. First, the cells are frozen very quickly and embedded in plastic. The plastic is then thinly sliced. Using a specialized high-voltage electron microscope, several images of these samples, at different angles (caused by tilting the stage of the microscope) are collected. The assembled images are called the tomogram.

Some protein membranes can be crystallized when they are in the lipid bilayer plane. Electron crystallographic techniques are able to determine structures of these proteins. It combines information from images of thin crystallized proteins whose images are taken at different angles. For proteins high in symmetry that can be purified, single particle cryo-electron microscopic techniques are used to help build 3D structures of these complexes. 

Electron tomography is used to determine 3D density of microscopic objects. To minimize damage from electron irradiation, the images captured in this technique are done at cryogenic temperatures. Averaging the 3D images can be used to create density maps of macromolecular complexes. X-Ray Crystallography is also used to determine atomic structures of individual components. Currently, only low resolution images of protein membranes are able to be recorded. Higher resolution images, however, are also possible as this technique gets further developed as there are no significant barriers preventing this.

This technique can also shed light on the conformation of membrane proteins in their native environment. Combining cryo-electron tomography and 3D image classification and averaging also allows for ''in situ'' structure determination of non-symmetric viruses.
Though X-Ray Crystallography is advancing and getting better at determining the structure of integral protein membranes, it is still very challenging to determine their structure when they are still in the cell.


==Role in Cell Function==

A computer assembles these images into the 3D view called the tomogram.  A tomogram can help us understand cell function because it allows us to view small organelles like the Golgi.  You can even produce a movie of a virtual journey through the cell.  Howell’s research of the Golgi for example, shows that there are several pathways for proteins and other molecules to exit the Golgi.  The findings are revealing, as earlier studies using different methods had suggested that there was only one road out of this organelle.

      <comment>/* Cytoplasm vs. Cytosol */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The intracellular fluid of inside a cell called the cytosol. It is separate from certain cell organelles such as the nucleus and the mitochondria. In eukaryotes, the cytoplasm is the content within a cell membrane minus the content in the cell nucleus. It is where many metabolic reactions occur, there are still others within organelles. In prokaryotes, cytosol is where most metabolic chemical reactions occur. These reactions also occur in the membranes or in the periplasmic space but to a lesser extent. 

A complex mixture of substances dissolved in water forms the cytosol even though water is the large majority of the mixture. Sodium and potassium concentrations are different in the cytosol compared with the concentrations in the extracellular fluid. The difference in ion levels are important for osmoregulation and cell signaling. Besides ions, the cytosol also has macromolecules.

==Cytoplasm vs. Cytosol==

There is often much confusion between the cytoplasm and the cytosol. The cytoplasm is the fluid contained in my bum and within the cell that holds and surround the cell's organelles in a liquid environment which is necessary for many of the cell's vital functions to occur. Some of the organelles that are held within the cytoplasm include the mitochondria, the golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and other organelles. One thing to note is that the nucleus isn't considered to be part of the cytoplasm because it contains its own type of fluid-like material that is referred to as the nucleoplasm. The materials that are found within the cytoplasm are also typically found within the cell membrane. Typically, the cytoplasm contains materials that are known as cytoplasmic inclusions. These inclusions are typically starch granules, mineral crystals, or lipid droplets that are floating around within the cytoplasm. 

When looking at the two, the cytosol is often confused as being the cytoplasm itself, and many individuals view the two as being synonymous. However, they cytosol is in fact just a part of the cytoplasm. The gel-like translucent fluid is what the cytosol really is. It is typically not enclosed within the organelles found within the cell. The cytosol is responsible for suspending the other elements contained within the cytoplasm, like the cytoplasmic inclusions and the cell organelles. Consisting of around 75% of the cell's total volume, the cytosol is composed of many different cellular components. Concentration gradients, cytoskeletal sieves, protein complexes, protein compartments, water, salts, organic compounds, and dissolved ions all consist of the contents of cytosol. Structurally, the cytosol consists mostly of water. However, it does house cytoskeleton filaments, which are necessary for maintaining the overall structure of the cell. In regards to function, the cytosol is also the location where many of the cell's chemical reactions occur. Transportation of metabolite and cell communication are among some of the important functions that occur within the cytosol.

'''Cytosol and Importing tRNA into Mitochondria'''

It has been observed that the mitochondria compensate for its lack of mitochondrial tRNA genes by taking in tRNA contained within the cytosol of the cell.  The organelle does this by co-importing tRNA along with mitochondrial precursor proteins that intercepts the organelles pathway for traditional protein importing.  This method also illustrates the complexity of mitochondrial protein importing, because specific modifications and mitochondrial precursor proteins are required to carry out imports for certain proteins; and with the variety of proteins that the organelle imports, this method possesses a unique set of problems.  Another, more direct method, of obtaining more tRNA can be directly importing the tRNA without the help of mitochondrial precursors; a method that is seen in even earlier protozoa.

'''Macromolecules'''

Commonly seen, protein molecules that do not bind to cytoskeleton or cell membranes are simply because they dissolve in the cytosol. Since the amount of protein in cells approaches up to 200 mg/ml, it is known to be very high. Protein also occupies approximately 20-30% of the volume of cytosol. However, even with this many protein occupying cytosol, some proteins with the membranes or organelles in cells are known to be very weak and are eventually released into solution upon cell lysis. 

If given ATP and amino acids, cells are able to synthesize proteins. This shows that many of the enzymes in cytosol are bound to the cytoskeleton in the cell. In cells such as prokaryotes cell, the cytosol within nucleoid contains the cell's genome. This is known to be an unusual mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the replication and transcription of the bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. 

On the other hand, cells such as eukaryotes cell the cytosol containing the cell's genome is held within the cell nucleus, which then separates from the cytosol by nuclear pores that blocks the free diffusion of any kind of molecule that is larger than 10 nm in diameter. 

The effect of macromolecular crowding is cause because of too high concentration of macromolecules in the cytosol. In other words, this happens when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This squishy effect can cause the position and rate of chemical equilibrium of the cytosol's reactions. Sometimes in the genome forming protein complexes or DNA binding proteins occurs to the favor the association of marcromolecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Protein design''' is the design of new proteins, either from scratch or by making calculated variations of a known structure. There is hope that by designing lattice proteins, or highly simplified computer models of proteins that are used to investigate protein folding and secondary structural modification of real proteins, one can develop better applications in medication and bioengineering.

While the possible amino acid sequences are enormous, only a subset will fold reliably and quickly to a single native state. Protein design involves identifying these sequences through observing their free energy minimum, and the molecular interactions that stabilize proteins. Protein design can be accomplished using computer models, which are able to generate sequences that fold to the desired structure. Using computational methods, a protein with a novel fold—Top7&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kuhlman |first=Brian |last2=Dantas |first2=Gautam |last3=Ireton |first3=Gregory C. |last4=Varani |first4=Gabriele |last5=Stoddard |first5=Barry L. |last6=Baker |first6=David |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |title=Design of a Novel Globular Protein Fold with Atomic-Level Accuracy |journal=Science |pmid=14631033 |volume=302 |issue=5649 |pages=1364–1368 |doi=10.1126/science.1089427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, an artificial 93-residue protein—has been designed, as well as sensors for unnatural molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Asthma is a lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways or bronchial tubes. 
Asthma causes periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. In an asthmatic person, the muscles of the bronchial tubes tighten and thicken, and the air passages become inflamed and mucus filled, making it difficult to breathe. Factors that trigger asthma are allergens found in dust, animal fur, mold, dustmites, pollen from, grass, and flowers. Other factors are irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemicals or dust in the workplace, and sprays such as hairspray also trigger asthma symptoms.All these factors contribute to constriction of our airways.

The airways of the lungs called bronchi (or bronchial tubes), are tubes with muscular walls that contract when irritated. Along the lining of the Bronchi there are cells with microscopic structures called G protein coupled receptors. These G protein coupled receptors are called beta-2 adrenergic receptors and cholinergic receptors. The beta-2 adrenergic receptors respond to chemicals such as epinephrine to make the muscles relax and thus opening the airways and increasing airflow. Cholinergic receptors on the other hand respond to a chemical called acetylcholine making the muscles contract, thereby decreasing airflow.

During an Asthma attack constriction of the Bronchi are caused by abnormal sensitivity of the cholinergic receptors, which cause the muscles of the airways to contract when they should not. There are cells in the Bronchi called mast cells which are held responsible for this cellular response. These mast cells release substances such as histamine and leukotrienes, which  activate the cholinergic receptors cellular response for smooth muscle contraction, mucous buildup, and white blood cell migration to certain areas. Eosinophils, a type of white blood cell is found in the airways of asthmatic people, also release substances that contribute to airway constriction. 

There’s no cure for asthma, however there are Albuterol inhalers for keeping asthma symptoms in a controlled state. There are several inhalers such as Albuterol, Ventolin and Proventil. Albuterol inhalers also known as a bronchodilater is a quick-relief or rescue medication used to decrease asthma symptoms.

Albuterol is a  beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist How albuterol works is that when Albuterol is inhaled to the lungs, it acts on the Beta2-adrenergic receptors which activates the Gs protein. The Gs protein then activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then converts ATP to cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP then activates a protein kinase A which continues the rest of the cyclic AMP pathway.
The pathway is continued until the cell responds by relaxing the smooth muscles in the Bronchi, thus reducing inflammation and allowing oxygen to be inhaled

== Revised Outline? ==

Hello everyone,

There are a number of us (with slightly different topics) expanding this chapter, so I propose we flesh out how to organize it so that the end result is coherent.

At present, we have:

==== Current Outline ====

* Background
* Supporters
* Detractors
* Social Implications
All of which focus purely on hand sanitizer. 

I propose the following:

==== Proposed Outline ====

Introduction
* Point out that we're basically doing 2 case studies, and analyzing their commonalities and differences

Overview
* Hand Sanitizer
** Function and Effectiveness //all the factual info
** Perceptions and Practices
* Deodorant
** Function and Effectiveness  //all the factual info
** Perceptions and Practices

History
* Hand Sanitizer
* Deodorant

Participants
* Hand Sanitizer
** Advocates
** Opponents
* Deodorant
** Advocates
** Opponents

Analysis
* General
** Scare Tactics
** The Power of Habit
** Negative Reinforcement
** Some other stuff….
* Hand Sanitizer
** whatever analysis
* Deodorant
** Appeal to Major Drives
** Big but Believable Claims
** Deodorant as a Dominant Strategy

I'll basically write everything I've listed for the analysis section, since a lot of it is psychology stuff I already have notes on and sources for.

Feel free to propose expansions, modifications, etc, for all of this. Just figured I'd get the ball rolling.

Davis, this all sounds good, we'll fill in where you've left space for the hand sanitizer group. Thanks for taking the lead.

An '''[[w:author|author]]''' is broadly defined as the originator of a work or idea. Authorship usually determines responsibility for what is created. Authors may also have rights to their works that others do not. Where you and the author are might affect what rights and responsibilities authors have for their work and what rights you have to an author's work. Wikibooks is not the author for any works, but the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|license]] authors agree to when contributing to Wikibooks allows you to link back or include the URL for works as a means of attributing the authors' work

Wikibooks also cannot give you permission to use works or parts of works under different conditions because Wikibooks is not the author. For that you must get permission from each person who has copyrights to the work or the parts of the work you wish to use in your jurisdiction, which may or may not be the author or person associated with a revision in the page history.

Some books may build on prior works in which permission to use under the [[Wikibooks:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA license]] was obtained from the author or current copyright owners before inclusion. Books which build on prior works must include an Authors page with a list linking to each prior work used. The Authors page must not be used to include the names of people contributing directly to Wikibooks because the criteria for authorship claims varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When you add prior work used with permission under the [[Wikibooks:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA license]], you should link to the prior work in the edit summary to allow people to know when they may need to acknowledge the authors of prior works.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Heat Flow==
Each year we spend millions of pounds heating our houses, but much of this heat escapes through our windows and roofs. We can use our understanding of temperature and heat flow to help us reduce our energy usage and save us money. 

==Temperature==
'''Temperature''' is a measurement of how '''hot''' something is using a '''chosen scale''' usually '''degrees Celsius, °C''' (but sometimes Fahrenheit, °F).

'''Heat''' is a measurement of '''energy''' on an '''absolute scale''', always '''joules, J'''.

If there is a '''difference in temperature''' between an object and its surroundings then this results in the '''flow of heat energy''' from the '''hotter''' region to the '''cooler''' region.

If an object's '''temperature rises''' it is '''taking in heat energy'''. For example, if you take a can of cola out of the fridge it will soon warm up to room temperature because the can takes in heat energy from the air in the room.

If an object's '''temperature falls''' it is '''giving out heat energy'''. For example, a hot cup of tea will soon cool down. If you hold it in your hands you will feel the heat energy flowing from the cup into your hands.

      <comment>/* Great Awakening */ bolding italics: improving grammar ~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Church of England==

The use of the American colonies as a pressure valve for Great Britain meant that the official faith was poorly represented there, despite the presence of The Book of Common Prayer. The Church of England had prelates: the Church of England in America had none. Even in colonies such as Virginia, which were officially Anglican, the churches were what later ages would call &quot;low,&quot; without incense or great pomp. The weak religious ties of England and America were like one more mile added to the miles of ocean between them.  

==Great Awakening==
The Great Awakening was a period of religious revivalism in America.  Historians view the Great Awakening in four distinct stages.  The first stage started in New England in the 1730s and lasted roughly thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, Frederick A. The Story of American Methodism&lt;/ref&gt;  There were two parts of the movement, the Puritan and the Methodist.

One of the major figures of colonial America, a scientist, a humanist, and a divine, was the Puritan minister '''Johnathan Edwards'''. Like his peers, he was upset about what was seen as a drifting away from the faith of the Pilgrims. More English immigrants were bringing more lukewarm observance, and a greater adherence to form, rather than feeling. Unlike many of those contemporaries, he embraced evangelism, an attempt to convert others to his own faith. Some of his sermons sent people to their knees in tears, or to their feet, cheering for joy. One of his most notable sermons is titled &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; where he used his scientific knowledge (he had written a treatise on spiders) and his spectacular gift for delivery to woo his audience.

The Methodist side of this Awakening was ignited by John Wesley, and his former schoolmate, '''George Whitefield'''. Wesley came to Georgia in 1735, and first met with disappointment. However, Whitefield, friend to both Edwards and Wesley, was able to hazard seven trips to America. He also preached to African-American slaves, unlike many of his contemporaries.

==Mennonites==
At the invitation of William Penn, some Mennonites came in 1683 to settle in Pennsylvania. This group was another attempt to get to the truth of the Bible. They angered their contemporaries in German-speaking countries by not baptizing infants, but only confessing adults. They also practiced a radical form of pacifism, not paying taxes, bearing arms, or serving in any army. Later groups of Mennonites came to the U.S. and Canada from Switzerland, Prussia, the Ukraine, and Russia, with their own hymns and Psalters. Among the branches of the Mennonites are the Amish, who like their coreligionists use shunning as a form of discipline.

==Methodism==
John and Charles Wesley are credited with creating Methodism in the 18th century. ''John Wesley'' was a cleric for the Church of England. He and his brother led groups of Christians throughout England, Ireland, and Scotland. These groups were part of what is called the Wesleyan Movement.  These small groups came to form what is known as Methodism. It began as a society of the Church of England, not a church in itself. It was resented and feared because it put its emphasis on the laity, rather than a church hierarchy, and because it saw emotional conviction as a confirmation of conversion. &quot;Who is a Methodist[ . . .]?&quot; John Wesley asked in a sermon. &quot;I answer: A Methodist is one who has 'the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given unto him' [. . .]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Character of A Methodist&quot; (title assigned by the anthology), extract from a sermon by John Wesley. Kerr, Hugh E., Editor, &lt;u&gt;Readings In Christian Thought.&lt;/u&gt; Second Edition. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1990(1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists focused on bible study and living a life free of frivolity and luxury. They were called Methodists because of their methodical approach to religious study.

==Methodism in Colonial America==
Methodism spread to America in the late 1760's. Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmore were both preachers appointed by John Wesley, that traveled to the new world in 1769 to start American Methodist societies. Pilmore started working in Philadelphia, while Boardman worked in New York to spread Methodism. Pilmore was more effective spreading the cause in Philadelphia and even traveled into the south to preach and promote the society.  Others traveled across the Atlantic as well; Robert Williams and John King came to America without being appointed by Wesley.  Francis Asbury and Richard Wright arrived in 1771.  Francis Asbury went onto become a very prominent leader in American Methodism.  George Shadford and Thomas Rankin came to America in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, Fredrick A. The Story of American Methodism&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike their Church of England contemporaries, Methodists were willing to preach in fields, especially in areas where no church had yet been built. Also unlike them, most of the missionaries named above were lay ministers, men ordained after a period of heartfelt conviction, rather than years of seminary training. These helped spread Methodism along the east coast leading up to the American Revolution.

==Moravians==
The Moravians arrived with John and Charles Wesley in America in 1735.  The group left Moravia and Bohemia due to harsh persecution for their religious beliefs and practices.  The Moravians wished to serve as Christian Missionaries for the different ethnic groups in America.  They first settled in Georgia, then moved to Pennsylvania, and also North Carolina.  The Moravians were deeply involved with music.  They practiced hymn singing daily, and some even wrote instrumental music.

''John Antes'' was the first American born Moravian composer.  Antes was born in 1740 in Pennsylvania.  He composed several religious anthems.  The anthems were more complex than hymns, with the intentions of a trained choir or soloist performing them, rather than the congregation.

==Judaism==

The first group of non-Christians to enter the American colonies were Sephardic Jews. This group of emigrants from Spain and Portugal had first settled in Recife, Brazil, then landing in New Amsterdam (the Dutch colony which later became New York City) in 1654. Though Holland had a well-regarded Jewish minority, the governor of New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, did not want these Jews on his land. He wrote a letter to the Dutch West India Company stated that the Jews threatened to &quot;infect and trouble this new colony.&quot; In response, the Jews wrote a letter to the company explaining that Jews respected the Dutch and were long-established citizens of their homeland. Indeed, some of the Company were Dutch Jews. The Company ruled that the Jews could stay, as long as they took care of their own poor and did not expect Christians to give them charity. 

During the colonial period, Jews settled along the East Coast and in several southern colonies. There were established communities of Jews in Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Newport, Rhode Island. The oldest synagogue to this day was built by the Sephardi Jews from the community in Newport. This Touro Synagogue, sanctified in 1763, is still extant today. This building houses the Jeshuat Israel congregation. 

The Jewish people found it hard to maintain education, worship, and dietary practices with so few people. A woman by the name of Rebecca Samuel even wrote to her parents explaining that &quot;Jewishness is pushed aside here. There are here [in Petersburg, Virgina] ten or twelve Jews, and they are not worthy of being called Jews. . . . You can believe me that I crave to see a synagogue to which I can go.&quot; More Jews did come to America, and all of them learned English and found their places in American society. Yet they found it hard to go to Sabbath on Saturday when their neighbors were going to church on Sunday. In some colonies, they could not vote, hold public office, or own property. They stood out, and they were afraid of persecution as in Europe. But here they could earn some money. There was no knock at the door at midnight, no torture or forced conversion by the Christian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Judaism- Stone, Amy. Jewish Americans. Milwaukee: World Almanac Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholicism==

Catholicism first came to the colonies in the ''Maryland Experiment''. After the British civil war, King Charles I issued a generous charter to ''Lord Cecil Calvert'', a prominent Catholic convert from Anglicanism, for the colony of Maryland. That colony's tolerance of Catholics was preserved by Calvert until 1654, when Puritans from Virginia overthrew Calvert's rule. However, he regained  control of the colony four years later. In Great Britain in 1689, the ''Glorious Revolution'' overturned Charles's successor, bringing in the reign of William and Mary. A new anti-Catholic revolt was ignited in Maryland, and the rule of the Calverts was ended. In 1692 the Religious Toleration Act officially ended, and the assembly of Maryland established the Church of England as the official state religion, supported by tax levies.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, Andrew M. An Ugly Little Secret. 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no Catholic was known to have lived in the Massachusetts Bay in the first twenty years of the colony's existence, this did not deter the Puritan government from passing an anti-clerical law in May of 1647. This threatened with death &quot;all and every Jesuit, seminary priest, missionary, or other spiritual or ecclesiastical person made or ordained by any authority, power or jurisdiction, derived, challenged or pretended, from the Pope or See of Rome.” When Georgia, the 13th colony, was established in 1732 by a charter granted by King George II, it's guarantee of religious freedom was promised to all future settlers of the colony, &quot;except papists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Horvat, Marian T. Let None Dare Call it Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions were immediately restrictions were imposed on Catholics for public worship. and it was a punishable offense for a priest to say Mass. Catholics were denied the right to vote or otherwise participate in the government of the colony that their ancestors had founded.&lt;ref&gt;Horvat.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Neither the Dutch nor English were pleased when, in 1672, the Duke of York converted to Catholicism. The Duke's appointment of Irish-born Catholic Colonel Thomas Dongan as governor of the colony of New York was followed by the passage of a charter of liberties and privileges for Catholics. Proceeding the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688, Jacob Leisler, a staunch anti-Catholic, began to spread rumors of &quot;Papist&quot; plots and false stories of impending French and Native American attacks upon the English colonies. By the end of 1688 Leisler had overthrown Dongan and taken the post of lieutenant governor for himself. He then ordered the arrest of all &quot;papists&quot;, abolished the franchise for Catholics, and suspended all Catholic public office holders. &lt;ref&gt;Horvat.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deism==
There was another faith which was influential, despite being hard to see by its contemporaries. Many of the institutions of American society were influenced by the English belief of Deism. Yet, &quot;In fact, most early deists opposed attempts to disseminate their views[ . . . ], because they felt that only the intellectually qualified could understand religion rationally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, George C., Leo Sandon, Jr., Charles T. Wellborn. Religion in America. Second edition. New York: Macmillan, 1982 (1975). P. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tenets of Deism were also held by many Christian churches, including the belief in a well-ordered nature which revealed its Creator, and belief in human reason. But unlike Christians, Deists did not believe the Bible had any relationship to the Divine. They believed that God did not speak to anyone; that nature was set up like a watch, and set to run without further intervention; and that belief in miracles was madness. The list of known American Deists is short. Benjamin Franklin was one for a brief time. Others include James Madison, Ethan Allen, and Thomas Paine. (A notable writing of this last-named is ''The Age of Reason'', which said that it was idiotic to believe in miracles.) Thomas Jefferson was influenced by Deism, as we can see from the Declaration of Independence's referral to &quot;Nature and Nature's God.&quot;

== Questions For Review ==

1. Link each of these individuals to his faith: John Wesley, Jonathan Edwards, Cecil Calvert.

2. Name a minority Christian faith from German-speaking countries. Name a minority Christian faith from Great Britain. Name a minority Christian faith from the modern-day Czech Republic.

- consider the use of text messaging in underdeveloped vs. developed countries

- consider the impact of text messaging on the greeting card industry

- consider other similar technologies such as AIM and email in more depth

- how has twitter affected SMS language? since it imposes a character limit once again...

- compare impact on English to other languages

- consider in detail the medical consequences, like blackberry thumb

- discuss in more detail how the definition of literacy is changing

- consider other demographics: business people, older people, parents, universities, emergency response systems (like universities or 911)</text>

== Methodism ==
The Methodist society continued to develop through the Revolutionary War, although with setbacks due to the connection with the Anglican Church.  The third Annual Conference took place in Philadelphia in May of 1775 at the same time as the Second Continental Congress took place.  The Annual Conferences were known as the &quot;Christmas Conferences&quot;.  They were held annually on December 24.  The Methodists followed the Church of England so they were in a predicament during the Revolution.  Wesley believed in obedience to the divine governance of God.  Many restrictions were placed on the society by various colony governments.  Colony governments feared the Methodism connection to the Anglican Church.  Francis Asbury, the general assistant, was the head of the Methodist movement in America.  Asbury moved to Delaware to seek refuge during the war.  In 1778, Judge White was arrested for being a Methodist with connections to Asbury.  Weslyan influence over the society declined over the course of the war.

===Independence and Separation from the Anglican Church===

The Baltimore Christmas Conference in 1784 resulted in the formation of the Episcopal Church.  The American Methodists were now members of their own church, rather than a society that follows the Church of England.  Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke were the superintendents of the Church.  In 1778, Asbury changed his title from Superintendent to Bishop of the church.  John Wesley was outraged with this and wrote Asbury a letter to have him change his title back.  Asbury did not and this led to the complete separation of Weslyan with the Episcopal Church.  Francis Asbury was a salesman of Methodism, he traveled constantly and was deeply involved in the spread of Church.  He and others whom he selected to be circuit riders traveled with the expansion of as America was expanding, so was Methodism; Asbury and circuit riders traveled along with the expansion to spread their influence.  Asbury was very successful in spreading the religion across the country.  Methodism appealed to the lower classes and outcasts of society.  It also was quite popular on the American frontier, where circuit riders preached in rural areas.

== Judaism ==

By 1800, there were about twenty-five hundred (mostly Sephardic) Jews in the U.S. and Charleston had about five hundred -- the largest Jewish community at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Amy. Jewish Americans. Milwaukee: World Almanac Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of Napoleon's rule, a series of progroms roiled the collection of states which would later become Germany. A new wave of Jews from Northern Europe (the Ashkenazim) came to the United States. These were somewhat assimilated men and women, who knew of the Enlightenment. These people, in Europe and America, would come to create Reform Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, George C., Leo Sandon, Jr., and Charles T. Wellborn. ''Religion in America.'' Second edition. New York: Macmillan, 1982 (1975). Pp. 214-215&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the men became peddlers, selling goods from door to door, including second-hand clothing, cheap jewelry, dishes, buttons, needles, and thread. As the Sephardim had built congregations and schools in America, so did the Ashkenazim.

== Transcendentalism ==

In the early 1800s, while the Second Great Revival was shaking the country, some people in New England chose another way to faith. Many of them were reading the German Idealists and the Higher Criticism, and some of them had read new English-language translations of Hindu scripture. They were descendants of the people who had come to America to purify their faith. Some of these decided to go further. They called themselves ''trascendentalists'', because they thought they &quot;transcended&quot; any petty doctrine. The Transcendental Club was founded in 1836.

The writer Ralph Waldo Emerson was a major theorist in the movement. He held that God was one, and not the three persons seen in Christian theology. Nor was God a personal being. The great ideas and loves of human beings persisted after their deaths, creating a vast Oversoul. There was no perpetuation of the individual soul. Individuals could move toward the inevitable perfection of their species, and to become one with the Oversoul. Other individuals who held some of Emerson's beliefs included the feminist Margaret Fuller, Bronson Alcott (whose daughter was the author Louisa May Alcott) and Henry David Thoreau. Different members of the group experimented with vegetarianism, communism, pacifism, and other non-mainstream practices. Although they differed widely from their revivalist neighbors, many of them also held  millenarist views: if only human beings became truly kind and wise, they could create an earthly paradise.

==Catholicism==

The Second Great Awakening was not a Catholic movement. The English and Scots immigrants were antagonistic to the Old Faith, many states remained hostile, and such religious leaders as Lyman Beecher saw Catholicism as anti-democratic. Despite this, it continued to grow in America. Some of this was due to the territorial expansion of the Louisiana Purchase. Priests had helped to found settlements in Minnesota and Louisiana, and their incorporation into the United States meant only that Protestant churches moved within their precincts. Some of this was caused by conversion, as with the Transcendentalist Orestes Brownson. And some of this was also the result of immigration from the German states. The United States had kept its Colonial-era reputation as a place of relative safety for differing faiths. 

Georgetown University in the District of Columbia opened in 1789, the first Catholic college in America. New Orleans provided an early home for Catholic parochial education. But at first it was enough for Catholic school children to be sent to the new public schools.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Catholic Schools in the USA, http://www.internationalstudent.com/student-news/articles/catholic-schools-usa/ . Retrieved June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

That changed after the Irish Potato Famine of 1845. Suddenly a wave of predominately poor Irish Catholics found passage to America. Even before the Famine the Irish had been oppressed by the British government, and many of these newcomers were illiterate. The result was a movement for schools which would treat Catholics fairly. In 1852, the First Plenary Council of Baltimore urged every Catholic parish in the country to establish its own school.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Catholic Schools in the USA.&lt;/ref&gt; This influx of poor Catholics provoked renewed discrimination from the Protestants, boiling over into politics with the Know Nothing Party.

[[Image:Flag of Moldova.svg|border|250px|thumb|left|The national flag of Moldova.]]
[[Image:Location_Moldova_Europe.png|border|250px|thumb|right|Location of Moldova in Europe]]
'''Moldova''' is a small country in eastern Europe bordering [[Wikijunior:Europe/Romania|Romania]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ukraine|Ukraine]].  The capital city is [[w:Chişinău|Chişinău]].  Other large cities are Tiraspol (located in the breakaway region of ''Transnistria'') and Bălţi.  Moldova is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]] and uses the '''[[w:Moldovan leu|Moldovan leu]]''' as its currency.

==Moldova's History==

Until 1991 Moldova was part of the USSR.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Soviet Union|This was a massive country consisting of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and many other countries.  It was a super power until it ended in 1991}}
[[Image:Moldova.jpg|border|300px|thumb|left|Dniester river]]
The area east of the Dniester river, known as '''Transnistria''', contains a majority of ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who did not wish to be part of Moldova.  In 1992 military conflict occurred between Transistria and the Moldovan government and '''Transnistria''' declared itself independent although most countries in the world still recognise it as being part of Moldova.  Transnistria's capital is '''Tiraspol'''.  Since independent, the Communist Party has been the most popular party in Moldova until 2009 when a coalition took control.

Moldova is the poorest country in Europe.  The average income in the country is about $1,900 per year, far lower than central and western Europe and lower than other parts of eastern Europe.
==Moldova's Geography==
Moldova is located very close to the Black Sea but it does not touch the sea so it is one of Europe's landlocked countries.  The country is hilly but contains no mountains - the largest hill is '''Bălănești Hill''' at 430 metres.

Because Moldova is close to the Black Sea it has warm and sunny summers but winters can be cold with average temperatures of −4 °C in mid-winter.  The country has many rivers including Dniester (which separates Moldova from Transnistria) and Prut.  Central Europe's largest river, the Danube, enters Moldovan territory for only half a kilometre.
[[Image:Căpriana monastery in Moldova.jpg|border|300px|thumb|right|Căpriana monastery]]
==Moldova's People==
Moldova has a population of about 3.5 million.  The official language of Moldova is Moldovan which is recognized as a dialect of [[Wikijunior:Languages/Romanian|Romanian]].  A large number of people, especially in the Transnistria region, speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]].

The vast majority of Moldovans are [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Orthodox Christians]].  Moldova has many beautiful churches and monasteries.  Because of poverty many Moldovans, as many as 25% of the population, work in other countries in Europe and send money home to their families.

==Moldova's Sights==

Tourism is increasing in Moldova especially since 2007 when new laws meant that EU citizens no longer need visas to visit the country.  Wine-making holidays, especially near the capital are the most popular activity for tourists in Moldova.  Monasteries like '''Căpriana monastery''' are also popular with Moldovan and foreign tourists.  Moldova has one [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]: Rudi Geodetic Point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Women's History of the Period ==
=== Canterbury School ===
Prudence Crandall opens her private school in the fall of 1831. Controversy ensued two years later when in 1833 she admitted a 17-year-old African American female student; the school is soon regarded as the first integrated classroom in the United States.

=== Lydia Marie Child ===
In 1833 Lydia Marie Child publishes the first anti-slavery book in the United States. She published many works over the years. Most of which took on controversial issues such as that of male dominance and white supremacy. Child is also remembered for her poem &quot;Over the River and Through the Woods.&quot;

== Unnecessary duplication of the period ==

Hey, didja notice there are two chapters on Adams's election? I don't feel both are needed. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 11:11, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

== Move the Second Great Awakening? ==

The Second Great Awakening technically began in 1790. May I move it to the short chapter on Jeffersonian Democracy? It would put it in closer context, and shorten the War, Nationalism, &amp; Division chapter. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 11:07, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

== Mormonism ==

I know that this book is deficient on the history of the Mormon Church. The 1820-1840 period is a crucial one for this faith and this history text. I find myself unable to write this in proper terms. Any takers? [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 22:58, 17 August 2014 (UTC)</text>

Some content you added was out of place and I moved it to [[Talk:US History/War, Nationalism, and Division]] and [[Talk:US History/Exploration]].  It may be better to create a new page in the book linked from [[US History]] specifically addressing women's history rather than splitting it up across multiple pages and having the content seem out of context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{draft|WB:UP|WB:USERPAGES}}

{{nutshell|title=This proposal|&lt;p&gt;User pages are for communication and collaboration. While considerable leeway is allowed in personalizing and managing your user pages, they are community project pages, [[WB:HOST|not a personal website, blog, or social networking medium]]. They should be used to better participate in the community, and not used to excess for unrelated purposes nor to bring the project into disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;}}
{{namespaces}}

Wikibooks' '''user pages''' are pages made available to its users for anything that is compatible with the Wikibooks project and agreeable to the community. Their main uses are communications, discussions, notices, trial workings and drafts, notes, and (limited) self disclosure if desired. It is a mistake to think of user pages as a homepage such as may exist on some websites. [[WB:BLOG|Wikibooks is not a blog, webspace provider, or social networking site]] and its user pages are provided mainly for project purposes. Moreover the same general expectations exist as on any other Wiki pages.

As such, user pages are more of a way of organizing and keeping notes about the work that you are doing on articles in Wikibooks, and also a way of helping other editors to interact with and understand those with whom they are working.

{{TOC|float=none|limit=2}}

== Terminology and page locations ==
:''Note: &quot;''Your''&quot; in this context means associated with you, not belonging to you.''

* Your '''user page''' has a name like this: '''User:Example''' {{nowrap|('''[[Special:MyPage|quick link to yours]]''')}}. Its normal use is to give basic information ''if you wish'', about yourself or your wiki related activities. You don't have to say anything about yourself. If you prefer to put nothing here then you can [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirect]] it to your user talk page for the convenience of other editors. 

* Your '''user talk page''' (sometimes abbreviated to your '''talk page''' or '''user talk''') has a name like this: '''User talk:Example''' {{nowrap|('''[[Special:MyTalk|quick link to yours]]''')}}. Its normal use is for messages from, and discussion with, other editors. For more information on using talk pages see [[Help:Talk page]].

* '''Subpages''' - You can create subpages of these, such as ''User:Example/draft page on violins'' or ''User:Example/test'' and their related talk pages, by navigating to the red-linked (non-existent) page and clicking on the ''Start the ___ page'' link. A list of existing subpages can be seen using [[Special:PrefixIndex]] (for example, [[Special:PrefixIndex/User talk:Example/]]). You can usually have anything on a subpage that you might have on a user or user talk page, except for a few items (see below) that must be visible to other users if posted. Hierarchies of subpages are also possible.  You can have as many subpages as you want but keep in mind that Wikibooks is [[WB:HOST|not a free web host]], please use subpages within reason.

* '''User pages''' or '''user space''' - All of these pages taken together are your ''user pages'' or ''user space''. While you [[WB:OWN|do not &quot;own&quot; them]], by custom if used reasonably and within these guidelines, you will mostly be left to manage and set them up entirely as you wish.

You also have subpages ending {{nowrap|in &lt;tt&gt;.js&lt;/tt&gt;}} {{nowrap|and &lt;tt&gt;.css&lt;/tt&gt;}} to store any scripts and skin customizations that you may wish to have when you edit Wikibooks. Only you and administrators can edit such pages, although anyone can view them.

== User talk notification ==
You will be notified if anyone edits your user talk page or leaves you a message there. The alert and links below are automatically displayed on all pages until you view the page.

{| style=&quot;background: transparent;&quot;
| &lt;div class=&quot;usermessage plainlinks&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-left:40px;padding-right:300px&quot;&gt;You have '''&lt;font color=#002CC8&gt;new messages&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=#002CC8&gt;last change&lt;/font&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;
|}

The links [[Special:MyPage]] and [[Special:MyTalk]] are shortcuts that take any user to '''their own''' user and user talk pages. If someone is to visit ''your'' (or someone else's) user or user talk pages a proper page link will be needed (e.g., &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User talk:Example]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). In practice, user and user talk pages are mostly visited by clicking on [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|user signatures]] in discussions, and links shown in [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page histories]] and [[Help:Tracking changes#Viewing diffs|diffs]].

== Options available from user pages ==
In addition to the usual information accessible from a page such as [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page history]], &quot;[[Help:Talk page|Discuss this page]]&quot; and the like, users visiting user and user talk pages can also click &quot;[[Help:Tracking changes#User contributions|User contributions]]&quot; (in the sidebar or at the bottom of the page) to see what contributions you have made at Wikibooks over time, and &quot;Logs&quot; to see records of other events related to your editorship, done by yourself and by others.  (Note that having your user page deleted does '''not''' delete any list of your wider contributions.)

Visitors to your user page can also click &quot;E-mail this user&quot; if you have opted in [[Special:Preferences|your user preferences]] to be able to send and receive email. Your email address will remain private unless you reveal it yourself, select the option to reveal it (in preferences), or reply using an email system outside Wikibooks.

== {{anchor|What may I have on my user page?}}What ''may'' I have in my user pages? ==
There is no fixed use for any of your user pages, except that in the vast majority of cases your user page traditionally has something about you, and your talk page will be where messages can mainly be found and will appear. Provided other users can quickly and easily find the pages they need, you are free to organize any of these within reason.

To start with, you might include a userpage notice on your user page, talk page, or both. The text &quot;{{tl|user page}}&quot; will generate a tag which looks something like the one below. This can be helpful to clarify pages that are not part of books (your user page, or other drafts). It also helps if people find your page in copies of Wikibooks elsewhere and want to locate the original.
{{user page}}

You might also want to give your contributions wider licensing, for example by releasing them into the [[w:public domain|public domain]] or multi-licensing them, by putting a notice to this effect on your user page, or on a subpage linked from it. Note that you cannot give them '''narrower''' licensing: '''all''' of your edits on Wikibooks, including all userspace edits, are licensed for free use under the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] and the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License]] as part of Wikibooks. 

User pages are often [[w:mirror (computing)|mirrored]] by other sites as well. If there is material you would not want copied, reposted or reused '''do not post it on the site'''.


Besides brief personal information and communication, other uses of user space include (but are not limited to):
: ''Note that certain kinds of material must not linger indefinitely in user space, see below.''

| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* Things other editors may find helpful to understand, such as [[Wikibooks:Sockpuppets|alternative accounts]] (if publicly disclosed)

|}

You are also welcome to include a simple link to your personal home page, although you should not surround it with any promotional language.

User pages are also used for administrative purposes, to make users aware of [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|blocks]], warnings, or other sanctions if they happen, and to notify of matters that may affect books you have worked on or editorial issues you have been involved with. Others may also edit your user pages, for instance awarding you an award or leaving notes and images for you, or adding comments and questions. Although you have wide leeway to edit your user pages, a few of these matters should not be removed (see below).

=== Userspace and mainspace ===
Details about yourself should '''not''' normally go in the main [[WB:NS|namespace]] (reserved for books '''only'''), and books should '''never''' link to any userspace pages.

In the rare case that you or something closely connected to you may have a related book at Wikibooks, that is always treated as '''completely separate''' from you '''as an editor'''. You should avoid a conflict of interest and generally '''avoid''' editing about yourself or matters closely related to you in any book.

=== Personal and privacy-breaching material ===
Some people add personal information such as contact details (email, instant messaging, etc.), a photograph, their real name, their location, information about their areas of expertise and interest, likes and dislikes, etc. Once added this information is unlikely to ever become private again. It could be copied elsewhere or even used to harass you in the future. '''You are cautioned to think carefully before adding non-public information to your user page because you are unlikely to be able to retract it later, even if you change your mind'''.

Privacy-breaching non-public material, whether added by yourself or others, '''may be removed''' from any page upon request, either by administrators or (unless impractical) by purging from the page history and any logs by [[m:Oversight|Oversighters]].

== {{anchor|What may I not have on my user page?}}What may I ''not'' have in my user pages?  ==
Generally, '''you should avoid substantial content on your user page that is unrelated to Wikibooks.''' [[WB:HOST|Wikibooks is not]] a general hosting service, so your user page is not a personal website. Your user page is about you as a Wikibookian, and pages in your user space should be used as part of your efforts to contribute to the project.

In addition, there is broad agreement that '''you may not include in your user space material that is likely to bring the project into disrepute''', or which is likely to give widespread offense (''e.g.'' pro-pedophilia advocacy).  Whether serious or [[w:Internet troll|trolling]], &quot;[[WB:SOAP|Wikibooks is not a soapbox]]&quot; is usually interpreted as applying to user space as well as the textbook space, and &quot;[[WB:CENSOR|Wikibooks is not censored]]&quot; relates to textbook pages and images; in other namespaces there '''are''' restrictions aimed at ensuring relevance, value, and non-disruption to the community.  You do have more latitude in user space than elsewhere, but don't be inconsiderate.  ''Extremely offensive material may be removed on sight by any editor.''

The Wikibooks community is generally tolerant and offers fairly wide latitude in applying these guidelines to regular participants. Particularly, community-building activities that are not strictly &quot;on topic&quot; may be allowed, especially when initiated by committed Wikibookians with good edit histories.  At their best, such activities help us to build the community, and this helps to build the collection of textbooks.  But at the same time, if user page activity becomes disruptive to the community or gets in the way of the task of building that collection, it must be modified to prevent disruption.

=== Excessive unrelated content ===
Unrelated content includes, but is not limited to:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#e4e4ff&quot; |  Writings, information, discussions, and activities '''not closely related''' to Wikibooks' goals
| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* A [[WB:BLOG|blog]] recording your non-Wikibooks activities.
* Extensive discussion not related to Wikibooks.
* Extensive personal opinions on matters unrelated to Wikibooks, wiki philosophy, collaboration, free content, the [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]], etc.
* Extensive writings and material on topics having virtually no chance whatsoever of being directly useful to the project, its community, or a textbook. (For example in the latter case, because it is [[WB:OR|pure original research]], is in complete disregard of [[Wikibooks:Original_research#Verifiable_information|reliable sources]], or is clearly not related to a [[WB:WIW|textbook]] for other clear reasons.)
* Communications unrelated to Wikibooks, with people uninvolved with the project or its related work.
* Games, roleplaying sessions, secret pages and other things pertaining to &quot;entertainment&quot; rather than &quot;writing an textbook&quot;. Such activities are generally frowned upon by the community.  Games of no educational value relevant to the project are routinely deleted at [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]].
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#e4e4ff&quot; |  Promotional and advocacy material and links
| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* Advertising or promotion of an individual, business, organization, group, or viewpoint unrelated to Wikibooks (such as commercial sites or referral links).
* Extensive self-promotional material, especially when not directly relevant to Wikibooks.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#e4e4ff&quot; |  Very divisive or offensive material not related to textbook editing
| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* [[w:Polemic|Polemical]] statements unrelated to Wikibooks, or statements attacking or vilifying groups of editors or persons (these are generally considered divisive and removed, and reintroducing them is often considered [[Wikibooks:Be civil|disruptive]]).
* Material that can be viewed as attacking other editors, including the recording of perceived flaws. The compilation of factual evidence (diffs) in user subpages, for purposes such as preparing for [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes|resolving disputes]], is permitted ''provided'' it will be used in a timely manner. 
* Users should generally not maintain in public view negative information related to others without very good reason.  Negative evidence, laundry lists of wrongs, collations of diffs and criticisms related to problems, etc., should be removed, blanked, or kept privately (i.e., not on the wiki) if they will not be imminently used, and the same once no longer needed.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#e4e4ff&quot; |  Personal information
| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* Personal information of other persons without their consent.
* Inappropriate or excessive personal information unrelated to Wikibooks.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#e4e4ff&quot; |  Wikibooks content not suited to userspace
| style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot; | 
* Images which you are not free to use (usually [[WB:FU|fair use]] images; see below).
* Categories and templates intended for other usage, in particular those for textbooks and guidelines.
|}

In general, if you have material that you do not wish others to edit, or that is otherwise inappropriate for Wikibooks, it should be placed on a personal web site.  Many free and low-cost web hosting, email, and weblog services are widely available, and are a proper place for content unrelated to Wikibooks. For wiki-style community collaboration, you can download the [[mw:|MediaWiki]] software and install it on your own server if you want full control, or use one of many online [[w:wiki farm|wiki farm]]s.

=== Advocacy or support of grossly improper behaviors with no project benefit ===
Statements or pages that seem to advocate, encourage, or condone the following behaviors:

: [[Wikibooks:Vandalism|Vandalism]], [[WB:COPYVIO|copyright violation]], [[Help:Glossary#edit war|edit warring]], harassment, privacy breach, defamation, and acts of violence (includes all forms of violence but ''not'' mere statements of support for controversial groups or regimes that some may interpret as an encouragement of violence).

These  may be removed, redacted or [[:Template:Hidden begin|collapsed]] by any user to avoid the appearance of acceptability, and existing [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion criteria]] may apply. To preserve traditional leeway over userspace, other kinds of material should be handled as described [[#Handling inappropriate content|below]] unless otherwise agreed by consensus.

=== Categories, templates, and redirects ===
Do '''not''' put your userpage or subpages, including work-in-progress books, into categories used by Wikibooks textbooks (example: [[:Category:Physics study guides]]).  

Especially, note that templates and stub notices often add categories themselves. You can prevent this while a book is being drafted, by putting '''&lt;tt&gt;tlx|&lt;/tt&gt;''' between the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the template name, like this: '''{{tlx|tlx|stub|any parameters}}''' 

You can also force a portion of text to be ignored by adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/code&gt; in front of it and &lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after it, or by adding a colon before &quot;Category&quot;, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Bridges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to temporarily force a category link to act like a plain wikilink.

User talk pages '''should not redirect to anything other than''' the talk page of an account controlled by the same user.

===Pages that look like textbooks, copy pages, project pages===
Userspace is [[WB:HOST|not a free web host]] and should not be used to indefinitely host pages that look like textbooks, old revisions, or deleted content, or your preferred version of disputed content. Private copies of pages that are being used solely for long-term archival purposes may be subject to [[WB:RFD|deletion]]. Short term hosting of potentially valid textbooks and other reasonable content under development or in active use is usually acceptable. When a userspace page reaches a point where it can be included as an book consider [[WB:MOVE|moving]] it into mainspace or using its content appropriately in relevant textbooks.

Userspace is also not a substitute for project space (''Wikibooks:...''), nor should a userspace page be used as primary documentation for any Wikibooks policy, guideline, practice, or established concept. If your user page related to the project becomes widely used or linked in project space, or has functional use similar to a project page, consider moving it into project space or merging it with other similar pages already existing there.

=== Images ===
Do '''not''' include non-free images (''copyrighted images lacking a free content license'') on your user page or on any subpage thereof (this is [[WB:FU|official image use policy]] and the usual wide user page latitude does not apply). Non-free images found on a user page (including user talk pages) will be removed (preferably by replacing it with a link to the image) without warning and, if not used in a Wikibooks book will be deleted entirely). 

There is also broad consensus that you should not have any image in your userspace that would bring the project into disrepute and you may be asked to remove such images. Content clearly intended as sexually provocative (images and in some cases text) or to [[w:shock image|cause distress and shock]] that appears to have little or no project benefit or using Wikibooks only as a [[WB:HOST|web host or personal pages]] or for [[WB:SOAP|advocacy]], may be removed by any user (or deleted), subject to appeal at [[WB:RFU|deletion review]]. Context should be taken into account. Simple personal disclosures of a non-provocative nature on sexual matters (such as [[w:LGBT|LGBT]] userboxes and relationship status) are unaffected.

=== Copyright violations ===
The same rules for [[WB:COPYVIO|copyright]] apply on userpages as in mainspace.  Text must either be non-copyright or out of copyright, otherwise only a short quote can be used.  If you use text from another source on your userpage, it should still be credited to the author, whether or not it is in current copyright.

===Simulation and disruption of the MediaWiki interface===
The Wikibooks community strongly discourages simulating the [[w:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] interface, except on the rare occasion when it is necessary for testing purposes.

CSS and other formatting codes that disrupt the Wikimedia interface, for example by preventing important links or controls from being easily seen or used, making text on the page hard to read or unreadable (other than by way of commenting out), or replacing the expected interface with a disruptive simulation, may be removed or remedied by any user. Inappropriate internal or external links that unexpectedly direct the reader to unreasonable locations may also be removed or remedied by any user. Text, images, and non-disruptive formatting should be left as intact as possible. Users of such code should consider possible disruption to ''other'' skins and to [[WB:DIFF|diffs]] and [[WB:PH|old revisions]].

== Ownership and editing of user pages ==
: ''This section applies to all pages within your user space.''
Traditionally Wikibooks offers wide latitude to users to manage their user space as they see fit.  However, pages in user space belong to the wider community. They are '''not''' a personal homepage, and do not belong to the user. They are part of Wikibooks, and exist to make collaboration among editors easier.

Other users and bots may edit pages in your user space or leave messages for you, though by convention others will not usually edit your user page itself, other than (rarely) to address significant concerns or place project-related tags. Material that clearly does not somehow further the goals of the project may be removed (see below), as may edits from banned users. Most community policies including [[WB:NPA|no personal attacks]] and [[WB:CIVIL|be civil]] will apply to your user space, just as elsewhere. (Purely content policies such as [[WB:OR|original research]], [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] etc., generally do not, unless the material is moved into mainspace.)

As with all other edits, user space contributions are irrevocably licensed for copying and reuse under the [[WB:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License]] and [[WB:GFDL|GNU Free documentation license]]. 

Finally, a small number of notices and tags, if placed, may not be moved to a less visible subpage or deleted without discussion.

=== Removal of comments, notices, and warnings ===
Policy does not prohibit users, whether registered ''or anonymous'' users, from removing comments from '''their own''' talk pages, although [[WB:ARCHIVE|archiving]] is preferred. The removal of material from a user page is normally taken to mean that the user has read and is aware of its contents. There is no need to keep them on display and usually users should not be forced to do so.  It is often best to simply let the matter rest if the issues stop. If they do not, or they recur, then any record of past warnings and discussions can be found in the page history if ever needed, and these [[WB:DIFF|diffs]] are just as good evidence of previous matters if needed.

A number of important matters may '''not''' be removed by the user – they are part of the wider community's processes or exist to prevent gaming of the system:
:* Declined unblock requests, blocks, validly imposed edit restrictions, and confirmed [[Wikibooks:Sockpuppets|sockpuppetry]] related notices (while any sanctions are still in effect)
:* [[WB:RFD|Requests for deletion]] tags (while the discussion is in progress)
:* [[WB:SPEEDY|Speedy deletion]] tags and requests for uninvolved administrator help (the patrolling administrator will quickly determine if these are valid or not; use the discussion page to object and post a comment, do '''not''' just remove the tag).
:* For IP editors, templates in [[:Category:User talk header templates]] and notes left to indicate other users may share the same IP address.
:* &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; added to user pages and subpages under this guideline (except with agreement or by consensus). Note this '''can''' safely be removed from talk pages and subpages where it has no effect. (''see [[#On others' user pages|below]]'')

=== Editing of other editors' user and user talk pages ===
In general, it is usual to avoid substantially editing another's user and user talk pages other than where it is likely edits are expected and/or will be helpful. If unsure, ask. If a user asks you not to edit their user pages, it is probably sensible to respect their requests (although a user cannot avoid administrator attention or appropriate project notices and communications by merely demanding their talk page is not posted to).

=== Handling inappropriate content ===

==== On your user pages ====
If the community lets you know that they would rather you delete some content from your user space, you should consider doing so&amp;mdash;such content is only permitted with the consent of the community. Alternatively, you could move the content to another site, and link to it.

Although other editors will aim to respect your user space, if corrective action is needed and not undertaken the inappropriate content will eventually be removed, either by editing the page (if only part is inappropriate), by redirecting the page to your main user page (if entirely inappropriate), or by community discussion at [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]].

==== On others' user pages ====
The best option if there is a concern with a user's page is to draw their attention to the matter via their talk page and let them edit it themselves, if they are agreeable.  In some cases a more experienced editor may make non-trivial edits to another user's user space, in which case that editor should leave a note explaining why this was done. This should not be done for trivial reasons. If the user does not agree, or does not effectively remedy the concerns, or the matter is unsure or controversial, then other steps in this section can be taken including uninvolved user opinions or proposing the page for deletion.

If the material must be addressed urgently (for example, unambiguous copyright, attacks, defamation, etc.), the user appears inactive, the edit appears unlikely to cause problems, or you are quite sure it is appropriate, then [[WB:BOLD|remove or fix]] the problem material minimally and leave a note explaining what you have done, why you have done so, and inviting the user to discuss if needed. If the entire page is inappropriate, consider '''blanking''' it, or '''redirecting''' the subpage to the userpage, or to the most relevant existing mainspace or project space page. 

Unsuitable pages, media, and images in userspace may also be nominated for deletion or (if appropriate) [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deleted]], but special care should be taken as the user may be expecting leeway and take it personally, and there are a few exceptions. Users with a strong editing record and/or most of their contribution edits outside their user space should be given a little more leeway in this regard than users whose edits consist solely or mostly of user space edits or promotional-style activity. See [[#Deletion of user pages|deletion of user pages]] below.

Editors may add &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a userspace page that is a source of concern, which will remove it from search engines and can also provide a lightweight alternative to deletion, or prevent external indexing during discussion. It will not affect the page for legitimate userspace purposes or on the [[WB:SEARCH|internal search engine]], and should not be used to make a point, nor removed without discussion or consensus.

===User pages and leaving Wikibooks===
When a user leaves Wikibooks, their user and user talk pages are usually unaffected and may be edited again at any future time.  Some users place the {{tl|retired}} template on their user and talk page to let others know that they are away for an extended period or permanently. Blanking user and user talk pages (i.e. overwriting with a blank page) is always acceptable provided non-removable notices (if any) are left intact.

== Protection of user pages ==
As with article pages, user pages are occasionally the targets of [[Wikibooks:Vandalism|vandalism]], or, more rarely, [[Help:Glossary#edit war|edit wars]].  When edit wars or vandalism persist, the affected page should be protected from editing.

Most user page vandalism occurs in retaliation for a contributor's efforts to deal with vandalism.  Administrators may protect their own user pages when appropriate, and are permitted to edit protected pages in user space.  Sometimes a non-administrator's user page may be the target of vandalism.  Such pages should be listed at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]] and may then be protected by an administrator.

In cases in which semi-protection is insufficient to prevent vandalism to a non-administrator's user page, an editor may create a .css suffixed sub-page containing their user page content within their user space, transclude the sub-page into their main user page, then request that an administrator fully protect their user page. (for instance, create User:Example User as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Example User/userpage.css}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.) This method will completely prevent further vandalism by limiting user page editing to yourself, and administrators. Note that the addition of inappropriate content to your user page after locking other editors out is considered a serious offense.

Repeatedly inserting copyrighted content or other inappropriate material on your own user pages after being notified not to do so, or misusing user space following a block (e.g., for [[WB:NPA|personal attacks]]) are both considered disruptive and may lead to the pages being [[WB:PROTECT|protected]] to prevent further disruption. User pages may also routinely be protected in the event of a [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|ban]].

Vandalism of talk pages is less common.  Usually such vandalism should merely be reverted.  [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|Blocks]] should be used for repeated vandalism of talk pages, where policy permits.  In rare cases, protection may be used but is considered a last resort given the importance of talk page discussions to the project.

== Deletion of user pages ==
: ''The usual deletion processes are [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]] and (if within speedy criteria) [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]].''
: ''For issues only affecting specific revisions on a page (where other page versions are fine) revision deletion is usually more appropriate.''

===Deleting others' user pages ===
In general other users' user pages are managed by that user. Except for blatant or serious matters, it is preferable to try contacting the user before deletion (see above). However, '''unambiguous''' copyright violations, attack pages, promotional text, and privacy violations can be [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deleted]] using a suitable [[Wikibooks:Templates/Deletion|template]], such as {{tl|delete}} or {{tl|copyvio}}, other pages likely to require deletion (or where remedial action is not taken) may be submitted to [[WB:RFD|deletion discussion]].

Take special care to [[WB:BITE|speak appropriately]] and explain the concern; many users will take it as a personal affront or [[WB:NPA|attack]] if an unknown user announces they are going to delete a userspace image or page and an [[WB:CIVIL|uncivil]] or [[WB:AGF|heavy duty]] approach can discourage new users who are unaware of expectations and might enjoy contributing. Remember that a limited amount of personal information (perhaps a ''short'' biography) and a freely licensed tasteful personal photograph or two are usually allowed if the page reasonably complies with other requirements.

Simple use as a personal web page is '''not''' in itself a [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion criterion]], although clear advertising and promotional use is. The only exceptions are that test edits and the re-creation of deleted material (within limits) are permitted in user space. '''A user's contributions that consist solely of a lone edit to their user page should not normally be speedy deleted unless it consists solely of spam or other speedy deletable material.''' They may have simply created their page as their first edit, and could return at any time. Such pages should be sent to [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]] and the user notified as normal.

=== Deleting your user page or user talk page ===
{{see also|Help:Pages#Archiving}}
Unless they meet the [[WB:SPEEDY|criteria for speedy deletion]] (copyright violations, attack pages, unambiguous promotion, no other significant contributor, etc.) or you are permanently leaving Wikibooks, it is unlikely that your main user page or user talk page will actually be deleted. However they can be blanked which has the same effect, and specific offending revisions can usually be selectively deleted or [[wikt:redaction|redacted]] if required.

User ''talk'' pages and user talk archives created by [[WB:MOVE|page move]] are generally '''not''' deleted; they are usually needed for reference by other users. Individual revisions, log entries, and other user space material '''may''' be deleted or redacted for privacy reasons, or due to harassment, threats, gross offensiveness and other serious violations. Exceptions to this can be and are made on occasion for good reason, including a wish to permanently leave Wikibooks. In addition, nonpublic personal information and potentially libelous information posted to your talk page may be removed as described above.

=== Deleting your user subpages ===
You can freely blank any subpages in your user space yourself (other than the few items that must not be removed) and request the deletion of '''subpages''' that have not had other significant contributors (by adding {{tl|delete}} to the top of the page). Alternatively, you might consider simply making the page [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]] to your user page. This is normally sufficient for most people's needs. Subpages tagged for deletion will be deleted if there is no overriding reason the page must be kept.

Blanking of user subpages may be interpreted as a deletion request. If you want to keep the page history, leave a note to that effect on the blank page (e.g. &quot;blanked to page history – please do not delete&quot;). If you want it deleted completely then use {{tl|delete}}.

Pages which were moved into your user space from somewhere else, and user talk archives created by [[WB:MOVE|page move]], may '''not''' be deleted in this way.  These must be listed at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]. To move them back where they came from, ask at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

This is the {{tl|nutshell}} message box.

This template presents a concise summary at the top of [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Wikibooks policy and guideline]] pages.  

* Use the nutshell summary to make Wikibooks more inviting to new users.
* Nutshell entries must be brief overviews, with a very high [[w:Signal-to-noise ratio#Informal use|signal to noise ratio]].
* Make sure each word in the nutshell carries significant weight; &quot;make every word tell&quot;.
* Wikilink to other pages to create a &quot;nut trail&quot; of pages with nutshells.

This template can also be used on other pages, for instance on how-to guides. But it should not be used in books.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to allow users to search your site using a tool such as the search boxes in the upper right corner of many web browsers.  You want to publish your search interface using standardized documents.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Note that this has not been made to work yet.  It is currently in development.&lt;/span&gt;

== Example of OpenSearch XML Configuration File==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;OpenSearchDescription xmlns=&quot;http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/&quot;&gt;
   &lt;ShortName&gt;Search Shakespeare Plays&lt;/ShortName&gt;
   &lt;Description&gt;Use local exist to search for keywords in demo Shakespeare plays that are included in the eXist demos.&lt;/Description&gt;
   &lt;Tags&gt;example web&lt;/Tags&gt;
   &lt;Contact&gt;yourname@yoursite.com&lt;/Contact&gt;
   &lt;Url type=&quot;application/application+xml&quot; 
        template=&quot;http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/search/search.xq?q={searchTerms}&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/OpenSearchDescription&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This file will tell the search tool to take the search terms out of the search text field and perform an HTTP get on the local XQuery on your default eXist running on your local system.  If you change your hostname, port or path you just need to update the URL in the XML configuration file.

   please define some symbols and words.

 Is this part of a complete c++ tutorial? If so, may I have the address? Thanks, [[User:Johndur|Johndur]] ([[User talk:Johndur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Johndur|contribs]]) 03:58, 4 July 2011 (UTC)

== Exercise 7 ==
How can u(0)=3. Doesn't this essentially mean u * 0 = 3? And anything multiplied by zero always equals zero.

:No, the intention is that u is a mathematic function that should result in 3 when input variable is 0. In your rational what would u mean ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:43, 4 October 2011 (UTC)

::Ahh I see, what I thought it meant was that u was a variable and u(0)=3 was shorthand for u multiplied by 0 = 3. [[User:Dopple|Dopple]] ([[User talk:Dopple|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dopple|contribs]]) 18:26, 10 October 2011 (UTC)

good site brosephs, bachem, brahs and bros

I'm struggling with the math a bit here. How do you get u(n)=(3*f(a-1)+4)? [[User:Fir3tree|Fir3tree]]) 15:49, 5 August 2014 (UTC)

== in how many years the population of one country exceed another ==

5 * 1.03 ** n = 7 * 1.02 ** n
where n is the number of years

log (5) + n * log (1.03) = log (7) + n * log (1.02)
log everything. any base will do but here it is 10.

0.698970004 + n * 0.012837225 = 0.84509804 + n * 0.008600172
scientific calculator
n * (0.012837225 - 0.008600172) = 0.84509804 - 0.698970004
not good to retype the answer from a calculator
so restate the problem as

n = (log7 -log5)/(log1.03 - log1.02)
copy and paste the above into your scientific calculator
n = 34.488130697 years or 35 years.
Thank you Lord Napier.</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|nowrap begin}} template.

This template prevents word wraps (line breaks) in text and links with spaces in. It is designed to handle the really tricky wrapping cases where you need full control. For instance in very complex long link lists. It works similarly to {{tl|nowrap}} and {{tl|nowraplinks}}.

This template takes no parameters, instead it works in pair with {{tl|nowrap end}}.

=== Helper templates ===

This template has a number of helper templates which allows you to tell the web browser exactly where line breaks may occur:

'''Note!''' These helper templates may only be used in sections surrounded by {{tl|nowrap begin}} and {{tl|nowrap end}} or they may cause weird behaviour of your page.

* {{tl|wrap}} - Marks where a wrap may occur.
* {{tl|·wrap}} or {{tl|·w}} - Looks like this: &quot; '''·''' &quot;. For dotted lists. Renders a bold middot surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the middot.
* {{tl|•wrap}} or {{tl|•w}} - Looks like this: &quot; • &quot;. For dotted lists that use small font and thus need a bigger dot. Renders a bullet surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the bullet.
* {{tl|–wrap}} or {{tl|–w}} - Looks like this: &quot; &amp;ndash; &quot;. For dashed lists. Renders a ndash surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the ndash.
* {{tl|—wrap}} or {{tl|—w}} - Looks like this: &quot; &amp;mdash; &quot;. Renders a mdash surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the mdash.
* {{tl|!wrap}} or {{tl|!w}} - Looks like this: &quot; &amp;#124; &quot;. For pipe separated lists. Renders a pipe surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the pipe. The pipe used is not a real pipe but the code &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/code&gt; so should work within wiki tables etc.
* {{tl|\wrap}} or {{tl|\w}} - Looks like this: &quot; / &quot;. For slash separated lists. Renders a slash surrounded by spaces and then marks that a wrap may occur ''after'' the slash. The &quot;\&quot; in the name leans the other way than the rendered slash &quot;/&quot; for wiki-technical reasons.

=== Usage ===

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{nowrap begin}}

'''Salt''' and{{wrap}} '''Pepper''' and{{wrap}} '''Curry''' 
and{{wrap}} '''Saffron'''.{{wrap}} 
'''Salt''' and{{wrap}} '''Pepper''' and{{wrap}} '''Curry''' 
and{{wrap}} '''Saffron'''. 

{{nowrap end}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It will render something like this:

:'''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' and '''Curry''' and 
:'''Saffron'''. '''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' and 
:'''Curry''' and '''Saffron'''. 

But it will ''not'' render like this:

:'''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' and '''Curry''' 
:and '''Saffron'''. '''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' 
:and '''Curry''' and '''Saffron'''. 

To make your code readable and easy to edit, you can put each wrappable &quot;line&quot; on its own line. And let's use some dots too. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{nowrap begin}}

'''Salt''' and '''Pepper'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Pepper''' and '''Curry'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Curry''' and '''Saffron'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Saffron''' and '''Salt'''

{{nowrap end}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It will render something like this:

:'''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' '''·''' '''Pepper''' and '''Curry''' '''·''' 
:'''Curry''' and '''Saffron''' '''·''' '''Saffron''' and '''Salt'''

But it will ''not'' render like this:

:'''Salt''' and '''Pepper''' '''·''' '''Pepper''' 
:and '''Curry''' '''·''' '''Curry''' and '''Saffron''' 
:'''·''' '''Saffron''' and '''Salt'''

=== Examples ===
Here are the above examples in actual running code in a table. Try dragging the width of your web browser window so it becomes smaller and smaller and watch how the line wrapping behaves:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
{{nowrap begin}}
'''Salt''' and{{wrap}} '''Pepper''' and{{wrap}} '''Curry''' 
and{{wrap}} '''Saffron'''.{{wrap}} 
'''Salt''' and{{wrap}} '''Pepper''' and{{wrap}} '''Curry''' 
and{{wrap}} '''Saffron'''. 
{{nowrap end}}
|
{{nowrap begin}}
'''Salt''' and '''Pepper'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Pepper''' and '''Curry'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Curry''' and '''Saffron'''{{·wrap}} 
'''Saffron''' and '''Salt'''
{{nowrap end}}
|}

An example demonstrating all the helper templates:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
{{nowrap begin}}
'''Salt'''{{wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{wrap}} '''Curry'''{{·wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{·wrap}} '''Salt'''{{•wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{•wrap}} '''Curry'''{{–wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{–wrap}} '''Salt'''{{!wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{!wrap}} '''Curry'''{{\wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{\wrap}} '''Salt'''
{{nowrap end}}
|
{{nowrap begin}}
'''Salt'''{{wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{wrap}} '''Curry'''{{·wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{·wrap}} '''Salt'''{{•wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{•wrap}} '''Curry'''{{–wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{–wrap}} '''Salt'''{{!wrap}} '''Pepper'''{{!wrap}} '''Curry'''{{\wrap}} '''Saffron'''{{\wrap}} '''Salt'''
{{nowrap end}}
|}

=== Technical details ===

The actual code that does the job is this HTML+CSS code:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt; Text and links &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt; More text and links &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

It means that wraps may only happen in the unprotected space between the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span ...&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That's what {{tl|nowrap begin}} and its helper templates are packaging in an easy to use way.

{{tl|·wrap}} and the other helper templates should not have any spaces or newlines before them or they will render two spaces before the dot. They tolerate anything from no to several spaces and even a newline after them and they will still only render one space after the dot. If a wrap occurs then the wrap will come after the dot, even if there are spaces before the helper template.

The {{tl|·wrap}} causes problems if inside sections of bolded and/or italicized text. Do end the bold text before the {{tl|·wrap}} and continue the bold text after it to avoid the problems. {{tl|•wrap}} and the other helper templates only have this problem if the section is bolded and italicised at the same time.

=== See also ===
* {{tl|nowrap end}} - The other end of this template.
* {{tl|nowrap}} - A template with similar purpose.
* {{tl|nowraplinks}} - Prevents wraps inside links and only allows wraps between the links and in normal text. Very useful for link lists and usually easier to use than this template.
* {{tl|·}} and {{tl|•}} - If you need dots/bullets when not using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap begin}}+{{nowrap end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|This section may be a bit bewildering on first reading. If you don’t understand it right away, don’t worry too much; but as you work more and more with Blender, making copies of objects, or sharing settings between objects, feel free to come back and re-read this and hopefully it will make some subtleties of Blender’s behaviour clearer.}}

==Datablocks And Users==
It is helpful to understand how Blender manages memory. Just about everything in a Blender document—objects in scenes, scenes themselves, materials, textures, whatever—is stored in a ''datablock''. Each datablock has a name, which must be unique among datablocks of the same type. Each datablock may be referenced from one or more places, mostly in other datablocks—in Blender parlance, it has one or more ''users''. For example, several different objects might share the same material, so when you change the characteristics of the material, it automatically changes the appearance of all those objects.

If the number of users of a datablock drops to zero, it still stays around in memory, but ''it will not be saved when the document is saved''. Thus, if you save and reload the document, all the datablocks with zero users will disappear. (In some cases you may need to save and reload a couple of times before all zero-user datablocks disappear.)

But up until that point, the datablock will continue to appear in the relevant popup menus, so you can reassign it to more users.

You can also assign a ''fake user'' to a datablock; this is what the “F” button is for in the popup menus that list datablocks of that type. This ensures that the user count never goes to zero, so the datablock always gets saved in the document even if it has no real users. This is useful for “library” documents, which can contain collections of useful materials and textures, say, that can be linked or imported into other documents, without also having to include dummy objects in the library just to ensure those materials and textures get saved.

For example, here is the widget that lets you choose the material for an object:

[[File:Blender259ObjectMaterial.png|center]]

The main part shows the name of the current material, which is editable. The '''X''' button breaks the link to this material and decrements its number of users by one, while the '''F''' button assigns a fake user to this material. The '''+''' button lets you create a new material.

The material symbol on the left pops up a list of existing materials to choose from, plus a search box to search all existing materials:

[[File:Blender259ObjectMaterialMenu.png|center]]

Note the entry with the '''0''' symbol next to it; that currently has a user count of zero, and will disappear when the document is saved and reloaded, if it is not further used.

The widget also displays the current user count if it is greater than 1:

[[File:Blender259ObjectMaterialUsers.png|center]]

In this case the count was incremented because the '''F''' button was selected.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Clicking the number (if it’s greater than 1) makes a copy of the object, attached only to this particular user. The copy has a user count of 1, while the original has its user count decremented by 1.}}

This is the basis of the (slightly confusing) distinction in Blender between ''object datablocks'' and ''object '''data''' datablocks''. Object datablocks contain the information common to all the ''types'' of objects in the 3D scene, regardless of whether they’re mesh objects, lamp objects, camera objects or whatever; whereas the object ''data'' datablocks contain the information specific to that ''instance'' of the type of object, e.g. the vertex, edge and face definitions for this particular mesh you might be using, or the colour and energy of a lamp you've set up for your project, or the field of view of a camera you have.

Which leads us to the difference between the two object duplication commands, {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|D}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|D}}: the former duplicates both the object datablocks and the object ''data'' datablocks (though this can be controlled in your User Preferences), while the latter only duplicates the object datablock.  What that means is that in the first case the two objects are truly independent, but in the second case the new object continues to share the same object ''data'' datablock so a change in one will result in a change in both of them. So, for instance, if you use {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|D}} on a mesh object and edit the vertices, edges or faces on one copy, the other copy will also be affected.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

Embedding a script inside a Blender document is useful for some special purposes, but often you want to be able to reuse it across any number of Blender documents, and perhaps distribute it to others for use with their Blender projects. To do this, you will need to save the script as a text file that can be copied into your Blender user preferences. It will also need to have some additional information inserted.

==The Script Header==
In order for your script to be installable, it needs to have the following as its first line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
#!BPY
&lt;/source&gt;
Following this, add a multiline Python string to define a name and other information for the script to appear in the Scripts menu:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Name: 'Add Tetrahedron'
Blender: 249
Group: 'Add'
Tooltip: 'Creates a tetrahedron object'
&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The “Blender:” line specifies the minimum required version of Blender that the script is compatible with; here we specify “249” to indicate that it wants Blender version 2.49. The “Group:” indicates which of the submenus of the Scripts menu that the script will appear in: it must match one of the existing submenu names, otherwise the script will go into the “Misc” submenu. The “Name:” is the name of the menu item that will be added for invoking this script, and the “Tooltip:” will appear when the user pauses with the mouse over that menu item.

==Put It All Together==
So now your complete script looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
#!BPY
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Name: 'Add Tetrahedron'
Blender: 249
Group: 'Add'
Tooltip: 'Creates a tetrahedron object'
&quot;&quot;&quot;

from __future__ import division
import math
import Blender
 
NewMesh = Blender.Mesh.New(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
NewMesh.verts.extend \
  (
    [
        (0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0),
        (0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3)),
    ]
  )
NewMesh.faces.extend \
  (
    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
  )
TheObj = Blender.Object.New(&quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
TheObj.link(NewMesh)
TheScene = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
TheScene.link(TheObj)
TheScene.update()
Blender.Window.Redraw()
&lt;/source&gt;

==Making The Script Installable==
The contents of your script are now complete. In the Text Editor, find the “Save As” option under the “Text” menu, and choose a filename for saving your script—perhaps call it TetrahedronMaker.py.

That’s it. This saved text file is now ready for installation into your Blender user settings, or distribution to others for installation in their settings.

==Installing The Script==
To install the script, simply copy the file you previously saved into the user-scripts directory within your Blender user settings.

For different operating systems this is:
*Linux/Unix: ~/.blender/scripts
*Windows XP: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Windows XP (alt): C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Windows Vista: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Mac OS X:
**Under Mac OSX the path is actually hidden in the blender.app so to know the path you would have to know that the script folder is actually hidden in the blender.app itself. Assuming that Blender is in the applications directory the path would be &quot;/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts&quot; If you try to open the .app contents from the finder you will notice that .blender section of the path is not visible, while blender will still be able to navigate to this folder.
** Right-click (or ctrl-click) the file &quot;blender&quot;, and select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; in the popup-menu.  It will display all the hidden files under blender's folder, and select &quot;scripts&quot; folder inside it.
** To see this folder from the OSX terminal use the ls -a command (lists all folders/files even hidden) in the MacOS folder of the listed path. It is probably a good idea to create an alias to the scripts folder in the &quot;/Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc&quot; folder so that scripts can be easily manipulated through the finder. I know that its confusing that Blender should have its script folder buried inside the app but it is necessary to keep the app portable and not require an install.
**A safer approach than the one above consists in keeping your scripts somewhere in your home folder: with this scheme, there is no risk of deleting your scripts when you upgrade your blender application, as they are not contained within its folder.  A method that follows this principle is as follows: create a folder that will contain your scripts (or some of them) inside your own home directory; then, instead of putting your files directly in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder discussed above, simply add a ''link'' to your script directory in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder (for instance with the &quot;ln -s&quot; Unix command, or by doing &quot;open /Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts/&quot; [adapted to your version of blender] and then creating a link through the Finder, with File-&gt;Make Alias).  Blender will now find all the scripts that you put in your home directory: it will follow the link you created in its .../.blender/scripts/ folder and go to the corresponding folder in your own directory, and find all the python scripts you put there.

==Using The Installed Script==
To make use of the installed script, open a new Blender document. Get rid of the default cube to avoid it obscuring things. Split the 3D View into two horizontally, and change one of the two into a Scripts Window. Go to the “Scripts” menu, and see if your “Add Tetrahedron” item appears in the “Add” submenu; if it doesn’t, select “Update Menus” (the last item in the “Scripts” menu) and have another look. Select your new menu item, and watch your tetrahedron object appear in the 3D View!

__TOC__

The easiest way to contribute is to enhance existing content by correcting misspelled words, or restructuring sentences or paragraphs to make them more readable. You are also very welcome to add new content by expanding pages that are under development, or by adding completely new pages if your text doesn't fit any of the other pages. As grsecurity is being actively developed and features are added and removed, help with keeping the content up to date is much appreciated.

On this page you will find background on why a particular structure was chosen for the book, who this book is for, and what style and formatting should be used.

== Book Structure ==

The book's structure follows the original documentation of the grsecurity project that had three main chapters: Installation, Configuration and Specification, and Using gradm and the Learning Mode. Configuration and Specification was retitled as Policy Configuration. Using gradm and the Learning Mode was retitled as Administration and was also moved before the Policy Configuration, because you must know how to manage grsecurity before you configure the policy. This is how we ended up with the core structure: Installation, Administration, Policy Configuration.

== Target Audience ==

The book is meant for people who are capable of solving hardware and software problems of varying complexity on their own and who actually read the manual. They know their way around their favorite Linux distribution and are familiar with configuring and building software from source.

== Objectives ==

The purpose of this book is to provide comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date documentation of grsecurity and related tools. In addition to teaching how to do something, the book provides information about best practices and common pitfalls learned in practice. This is the main objective.

Each chapter has additional objectives that define what the reader should know after they've read it. These objectives were defined after most of the book's core content was in place, so at the time of writing some chapters might not fulfill all of their objectives.

'''Introduction''' - The reader must learn on a basic level what grsecurity is, what are its goals and how those goals are realized. If he does not belong to our target audience he should still get a rough idea what grsecurity is about.

'''Installation''' - The reader must learn:
* Where to get grsecurity, its administration tool gradm and the Linux kernel source.
* How to verify the authenticity of each package.
* How to apply the grsecurity patch properly.
* How to configure grsecurity's kernel configuration options (this includes PaX settings) and what he needs to consider before doing so.
* How to build and install a grsecurity-enabled kernel using his chosen distribution's tools.

'''Administration''' - The reader must learn:
* How to install gradm, the administration tool.
* How to use gradm and especially the learning mode.
* How to configure grsecurity's features at runtime.
* What other useful tools are available, where to get them, and how to install and use them.
* How to troubleshoot application incompatibilities and problems with grsecurity.

'''Policy Configuration''' - The reader must learn:
* What an RBAC system is and what is not, what it can provide when properly configured.
* What makes a secure policy.
* The policy structure and rules; he must be familiar with every configuration element and their parameters and configuration inheritance.

'''Reporting Bugs:''' The reader must learn how to report bugs; what information is required, how to gather it, and where to send the reports.

== Style and Conventions ==

* Headers should be [[wikt:title case|title cased]].
* Use the [[Help:Editing#Show_As_Typed|&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;]] tag to display long commands, example program output, and file contents.
* Use the [[Template:XWarning|XWarning template]] when you need to point out an important security consideration or a possibly dangerous operation. It is easier to spot than the classic [[Template:Warning|Warning template]] when scrolling.
* Use the [[Template:Info|Info template]] when you need to point out something that's related to the surrounding text.
* The name grsecurity should be written in lowercase and without special formatting unless it begins a sentence. This is how it is written on the grsecurity website.

=== Formatting ===

'''Note:''' This is still work in progress, and will change in the future. It will be finalized soon.
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Italic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Used for file and directory names.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Boldface&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Used for occasional emphasis, such as when introducing a new term.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Constant Width&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Used in text for program and command names. Blocks of pre-formatted text is used in examples show what commands to execute and what their output should be.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

== Generating Content Automatically ==

Some content in this book can be generated automatically from grsecurity's source files. Scripts and programs that do this are listed here. Fixes and improvements to any of the scripts and programs are welcome, as are complete rewrites.

{{XWarning|As this page and the scripts can be modified by anyone, take care to inspect all code before running it.}}

=== ''Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options'' and ''Sysctl Options'' ===
Below is a [[w:Python (programming_language)|Python]] script that outputs two files, one with content for the [[../Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options|Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options]] page and another for the [[../Appendix/Sysctl Options|Sysctl Options]] page.

The script takes an absolute path to the kernel source patched with grsecurity as input, reads the ''grsecurity/grsec_sysctl.c'', ''security/Kconfig'', and ''grsecurity/Kconfig'' files, and outputs two files named ''Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options.wiki'' and ''Sysctl_Options.wiki''. The contents of ''Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options.wiki'' can copied as it is to the wiki. ''Sysctl_Options.wiki'' only contains categorized lists of links that can be shown in the table on the [[../Appendix/Sysctl Options|Sysctl Options]] page. The  links in the ''Sysctl_Options.wiki'' file point to anchors on the [[../Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options|Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options]] page, so the contents of these two files are linked.

The script uses [https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib Kconfiglib] by Ulf Magnusson for reading the Kconfig files.

Feel free to replace the script with a Perl one-liner or a single command line.

def get_sysctl_opts(kern_src_dir):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Returns a dictionary of sysctl variables related to grsecurity.

    Parameters:
    kern_src_dir    (string) Absolute path to a kernel source directory
                    (e.g. /usr/src/linux-3.2.48.)

    The key of each item is the name of a kernel configuration symbol (e.g.
    GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN) and the value is a list of sysctl variable names
    (e.g. [enforce_symlinksifowner, symlinkown_gid]).
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    file_name = os.path.join(kern_src_dir, &quot;grsecurity&quot;, &quot;grsec_sysctl.c&quot;)
    options = {}
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        cur_symbol = None
        for line in f:
            if line.startswith(&quot;#ifdef&quot;):
                start = line.find(&quot;GRKERNSEC&quot;)
                cur_symbol = line[start:].strip()
                options[cur_symbol] = []
            elif line.startswith(&quot;#endif&quot;):
                if cur_symbol in options:
                    options[cur_symbol].sort()
                cur_symbol = None

            if cur_symbol is not None and line.find(&quot;.procname&quot;) &gt;= 0:
                a = line.find('&quot;') + 1 
                b = line.rfind('&quot;')
                sysctl_var = line[a:b].strip()
                options[cur_symbol].append(sysctl_var)

    return options


def get_categorized_sysctl_opts(sysctl_opts):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Returns a list of lists or tuples.

    Parameters:
    sysctl_opts     (dict) Dictionary of sysctl variables. This would be the
                    return value of get_sysctl_opts().

    Each index in the returned list specifies a category. The categories are
    [0] Audit/logging variables
    [1] Chroot variables
    [2] Network variables
    [3] Misc. variables

    The categorization is based on the name of the sysctl variable, and is
    not entirely accurate. But it's &quot;good enough.&quot;

    Each category consists of a list of tuples. The first element of a tuple
    is the name of a kernel configuration symbol (e.g. GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN)
    and the second element is a sysctl variable that is related to that
    symbol. If a symbol is related to more than one sysctl variable, the list
    will contain multiple tuples that have the same first element.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    audit_opts = []
    chroot_opts = []
    net_opts = []
    other_opts = []

    for item in sysctl_opts.iteritems():
        for opt in item[1]:
            if opt.find(&quot;audit&quot;) &gt;= 0 or opt.find(&quot;log&quot;) &gt;= 0:
                audit_opts.append((opt,item[0]))
            elif opt.find(&quot;chroot&quot;) &gt;= 0:
                chroot_opts.append((opt,item[0]))
            elif opt.find(&quot;socket&quot;) &gt;= 0 or opt.find(&quot;ip&quot;) &gt;= 0:
                net_opts.append((opt,item[0]))
            else:
                other_opts.append((opt,item[0]))

    audit_opts.sort()
    chroot_opts.sort()
    net_opts.sort()
    other_opts.sort()
    all_opts = [audit_opts, chroot_opts, net_opts, other_opts]

    return all_opts


def write_wikified_sysctl_opts(kern_src_dir, out_file_name):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Writes a categorized list of sysctl variables wrapped in MediaWiki links
    construct.

    Parameters:
    kern_src_dir    (string) Absolute path to a kernel source directory
                    (e.g. /usr/src/linux-3.2.48.)

    out_file_name   (string) Path and file name or just the file name of the
                    output file.

    The links point to anchors on the Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options
    page. The links are written in alphabetical order by the sysctl variable.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    sysctl_opts = get_sysctl_opts(kern_src_dir)

    link_fmt = &quot;* [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX&quot;\
        &quot;_Configuration_Options#{0}|{1}]]\n&quot;

    with codecs.open(out_file_name, 'w', &quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:
        f.write(&quot;Category: Audit/logging\n&quot;)

            f.write(link_fmt.format(prompt, opt[0]))


def get_prompt(item):
    &quot;&quot;&quot; 
    Return the first prompt text of the specified symbol or choice.

    Parameters:
    item        (Kconfiglib.Symbol or Kconfiglib.Choice) The object whose
                prompt is to be returned.

    Kconfiglib does not expose the prompt(s) of a Symbol or Choice. They have
    to be extracted from the string representation of a Symbol object. This
    function only returns the first prompt. There may be more prompts and
    they may or may not be identical.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    s = str(item)
    prefix = &quot;Prompts:&quot;
    i = s.find(prefix)
    prompt = None
    if i &gt;= 0:
        a = s.find('&quot;', i + len(prefix)) + 1
        b = s.find('&quot;', a)
        prompt = s[a:b]

    return prompt


def write_wikified_item(f, sysctl_opts, item, level):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Write the given Kconfiglib.Item in the specified file.

    Parameters:
    f               (file) Output file object open for writing.

    sysctl_opts     (dict) Dictionary of sysctl variables. This would be the
                    return value of get_sysctl_opts().

    item            (Kconfiglib.Item) Item that should be formatted.

    level           (integer) Heading level (number of '=' characters before
                    and after a heading). Items are hierarchial and this
                    function will increment the level when it calls itself
                    recursively to process child Items.

    This function wraps certain properties of item and related content from
    sysctl_opts in MediaWiki markup and writes the output to the specified
    file object.

    If item is a Menu, it is formatted as a heading and it's child Items
    are iterated and formatted.

    If item is a Choice, its prompt text is formatted as a heading and
    help text as preformatted text.

    If item is a Symbol, its prompt text is formatted as a heading, name as
    teletype text, help text as preformatted text and all related sysctl
    options as intended lines below a sort of heading that's regular
    unformatted text.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

I more thorough description of the project would be good.  I would say that I try to do a lot of work &quot;behind the scenes to improve and maintain the usability and welcoming atmosphere of Wikibooks&quot; but so far most of the content here is related to technical aspects.  I could see this project encompassing the help namespace as well with just that generic description. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:44, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

: I want it to encompass the help namespace and a lot of work that isn't included yet too. I think most of the behind the scenes stuff goes hand in hand even if often times people are working alone and without a common goal in mind. I was adding things to start with that relate to my more immediate goals with the hope that other people would add in any behind the scene stuff they want to work on and felt was left out. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:00, 5 December 2010 (UTC)
: Or if other people didn't, I would add more later as my focus shifts. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:03, 5 December 2010 (UTC)
: I am not sure how to more thoroughly describe this project. Many people have lists of things they want to do, or would like to see get done that relate to Wikibooks in general like the Working on list you have on your user page, often people have similar lists with perhaps little time to work on them alone, often these lists get very little attention or public visibility, sometimes people give up on their lists, and there hasn't been a place to share these lists and discover that other people want to do the same things. That is what this project is intended to change. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:30, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

== [[Japanese History]] ==

{{user|David L Davis}} has been making significant changes to this book.  I tried to ensure that existing pages you worked on were still linked from the contents and that similar topics contained the content and history that you added.  However, you should take a look at the main contents' history and verify that you agree with the changes.  My last edit to the main page added back in some links that were simply removed by this user, without requesting any history merges or content merges or speedy deletion requests.  {{tl|Japanese HistoryTOC}} will also need to be updated.

:If you'd like to rearrange that's fine - currently they do depend on stuff that's later!  I think the SAS ASA SSA pages as they are now are very scrappy.  What I'd really like to have is enough explanation on them that a student ends up with the confidence to 'do the construction and work out the maths' for themselves, when presented with such a problem, rather than relying on a formula to help them out...  Not sure what the right solution is going to look like, but any improvements to what we currently have are welcome.  --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 21:26, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

==German==
===Stuka===
The Stuka is short for Sturzkampfflieger which leterally means dive attack airplane in the German language. Even though the name Stuka applies to dive bombers in general, it is attached to a particular airplane called the Junkers Ju-87 which was called Stuka because it was also a dive bomber and the name stuck to this airplane due to its phenomenal initial successes against the Allies during World War II. It was a twin seater, single engined, inverted gull winged monoplane built by the German aeronautical firm Junkers. During the initial air wars over Poland in 1939 and France and the Low countries in May 1940 it did very well in providing advance air raids over the following infantry as a vital element in Blitzkrieg (Lightning attack), the term coined by the Germans for a lightning speed attack with airplanes bombing the opposition and the army advance following it. But later during the Battle of Britain in August- September 1940 for control of the skies over Britain as a prelude to the German invasion of Britain, it failed miserably due to its inferior speed and the resultant losses it suffered at the hands of the British fighter pilots. Later in the war it again proved its mettle in skies where the Germans had air superiority to a limited extend or when escorted by German fighter planes and did well in the Mediterranian, Russians fronts etc.,

==Italian==

==Japanese==
===Mitsubushi Zero===

==American==
&lt;u&gt;'''Curtiss P-40 Warhawk'''&lt;/u&gt;: One of the first U.S. fighters of the war.  Made famous by the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better know as the Flying Tigers, commanded by Claire Chennault, during the Sino-Japanese war--the lead-up to WWII. The P-40 was equipped with the Allison engine that gave it a top speed of about 350 mph at 15,000 feet.  However, the high altitude performance of the &quot;Hawk&quot; was hindered by weight constraints, and the fact that the Allison engine was not supercharged.  The Flying Tigers took the Warhawk, with her limitations and created tactics that were devastating to the Japanese aircraft.  The Warhawk sported four Browning .50 cal. machine guns.

&lt;u&gt;'''North American P-51 Mustang'''&lt;/u&gt;: Great Britain contracted with NAA to build P-40's for their campaigns against the Germans.  NAA engineers stated that they could build a better fighter, in a shorter time period.  The first P-51's were powered by the same engine used by the P-40, the Allison engine.  Due to poor altitude performance, the British engineers proposed to outfit the Mustang with the more powerful Merlin 1750, V-12, two-stage supercharged engine.  The supercharged Merlin boosted the Mustang's high altitude performance, and brought the top speed to 460 mph at 35,000 feet.  Due to the design of the wing, called a &quot;laminar flow&quot; wing, speed and endurance of the &quot;Pony&quot; was increased.  The laminar flow wing puts the thickest part of the wing to a point 60% behind the leading edge of the wing.  
The early Ponies sported four .50 cal. Browning machine guns.  With the deployment of the D-model Mustangs, the pilots now had the addition of two-more .50 cal. guns, for a total of six.  The Mustang's firepower was devastating to both German and Japanese aircraft.  
The P-51 created the opportunity for heavy bombers to enjoy fighter escort from England, to targets as far away as Berlin, and back to England.  This was made possible because of the laminar flow wing, which created a smoother, more efficient airflow over the airfoil, thereby reducing drag.  The Mustang could also carry two spare wing fuel tanks that could be jettisoned in the event of a dogfight, or other combat activities.  With the development of 108 gallon, pressed-paper droptanks (by the British), the Mustang's range was increased, over the 75 gallon, aluminum tanks.

==British==
===Hawker Hurricane===
===Supermarine Spitfire===
The Supermarine Spitfire was designed by Reginald Mitchell, taking its inspiration from racing float planes of the same company. During the Battle for Britain, Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes drove back the Nazi air fleet. The air defence system was stretched to its limit, and the pilots of the RAF won fame as the saviours of the island. Later in the war, advanced Spitfires fought in Africa, France, and over Germany. The Spitfire has been titled &quot;Most Beautiful Airplane&quot; and pilots took advantage of its high maneuverability and speed.

Leaves ratio of British, American and Japanese navies at 5:5:3. This causes resentment in Japan.

==Japanese Invasion of Manchuria==

===The Manchurian Crisis===
Japanese Militarists staged an explosion of the Japanese controlled South-Manchurian railway, near Mukden. They blamed the Chinese for it and the Kwantung army invaded Manchuria, and set up a puppet government.

===Japan Leaves the League of Nations===
Japan's disregard for the League of Nations's authority, undermines it. This example is copied by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany.

==Anti-Comintern Pact==
The Anti-Comintern Pact was pact against Communist International. The Communists were the enemies of the Fascists. The Pact was signed by three powers. The Germans, the Japanese and later the Italians. This formed what was later known as the Axis Powers.

      <comment>/* Infantry Weapons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Infantry Weapons==
The U.S. infantry used weapons such as the M1 Garand, browning automatic rifle,Thompson, and colt m1911

==Tanks==
The Sherman and Stuart tanks where used alot during the war.

==Planes==
===Fighters===
====Mitsubushi Zero====

Thought of as the most advanced fighter in its time, the Mistubishi Zero broke many records and it could out-maneuver most of the allied fighter planes at the beginning of the war, although it was outclassed by later model allied fighters. 
It proved its worth, during the attack on Pearl Harbor in which it destroyed U.S. aircraft on the ground and closely guarded the slow moving Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot;

===Bombers===
====Boeing B-29====
The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was a major development of the B-17 Flying Fortress. Design started in 1937 and the prototype flew five years later. B-29s were mainly used to bomb Japan in the later stages of the war. On August 6, 1945, a Superfortress of the 509th Bombardment Wing dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, another bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. The B-29 was the mainstay of the US bomber fleet for several years after WWII, and many were used in Korea.

==Ships==
===Yamato-Class Battleships===
The Japanese superbattleships ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were the largest battleships ever launched. They were intended for use in a major fleet engagement not unlike Jutland or Tsushima. The main armament of these leviathans were nine 18-inch naval cannon that could hurl a shell up to twenty-five miles. The Yamatos were not used until the later stages of WWII, when Japan launched a massive counterattack in the Battle of Letye Gulf. ''Musashi'' was sunk by US carrier planes in this engagement.
In April of 1945, ''Yamato'' was fitted out for a suicidal strike against the US fleet gathering around Okinawa. Her mission was to shell and possibly ram American carriers and transports supporting the Okinawa invasion. Two hundred miles from her goal, US carrier planes attacked and sank her.

===Carriers===
===Submarines===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jews in Europe ==
Its neighboring countries of Russia, Austria, and Prussia conquered Poland in the 18th century. The Jews feared these countries and were now forced to live under the harsh rule of Russia. The Russian Czars (Kings) did not like the Jews or their way of life, so they allowed them the opportunity to become more life Russians. Yet, once Czar Alexander II died in 1881, which was more accepting of the Jewish culture, mayhem rose again causing Jews to flee the country after being attacked multiple times (Charing pg. 22). Charing, Douglas. Judaism. New York, NY: DK Pub., 2003. Print.

== Education ==
Education had been previously served as a private personal advancement. Now schooling would serve as a public purpose. If young people could resist of evil habits and become good individuals that were prepared for self-government, they would need a good education. At this point the survival of the nation depended on it. In the 1780s and 1790s there were two major changes in the educational practice. First off, the northern states would begin to use tax money to support public elementary schools. In 1789, Massachusetts became one of the first states that would require towns to offer free public elementary education to their citizens. Next, schooling for girls was improved. They recognized that if mothers were to instruct their children adequately, they would need to be properly educated. Therefore, Massachusetts insisted that town elementary schools teach girls as well as boys. Throughout the United States, there were private academies that would give the opportunity for girls to advance in schooling. The academies trained them in History, Geography, Rhetoric, and Math. Along with fancy needlework, the only kind of art work that seemed appropriate for women. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
In well off families both boys and girls went to a form of infant school called a petty school. However only boys went to what you call grammar school. Upper class girls and sometimes boys were taught by tutors. Middle class girls might be taught by their mothers. Moreover during the 17th century boarding schools for girls were founded in many towns. In the boarding schools girls were taught subjects like writing, music and needlework. 
In the grammar schools conditions were hard. Boys started work at 6 or 7 in the morning and worked to 5 or 5.30 pm, with breaks for meals. Corporal punishment was usual. Normally the teacher hit naughty boys on the bare butt with birch twigs. Other boys in the class would hold the naughty boy down.
In the 17th and early 18th centuries women were not encouraged to get an education. Some people believed that if women were well educated it would ruin their marriage prospects and be harmful to their mind. Protestants believed that women as well as men should be able to read the bible. Only the daughters of the wealthy or nobility could get an education. By the mid 17th century young women were allowed to go to school with their brothers. Sometimes if you had the money you would be placed within a household of a friend and within the household and you would be taught various things. Some of the things you would learn would be to read and write, run a household, and practice surgery.

== I Want To Add More About The Articles Of Confederation. ==

In order to see why we needed to get the Constitution, one needs to see the deficits of the Articles. And the Whiskey Rebellion -- why isn't that here now? -- shows the conflict between state and government resolved by the Constitution.

== Can't find the Camera panel ==

The description of where and when the Camera panel appears is too vague to be useful, and I can't find it anywhere.
----
I had the same problem. Turns out you have to select the Camera object (in the 3d viewport), and then search in the properties window the &quot;Object Data&quot; button, which should have the same symbol it now shows on the book. It's not called &quot;Camera Context&quot;, and it doesn't mention that you have to select the camera.

I've modified the article slightly to show this more clearly.

== Poor Example of FOV ==

I suggest changing the example photo to a more appropriate representation of FOV.

FOV represents the volume of space the camera is able to capture or visualize.  The camera, and thus the FOV, can be relocated to capture different imagery from a scene.
Due to the pyramidal shape of the FOV, many objects can be seen from a distance (e.g. landscapes shots), but as the camera moves closer to any one object, fewer objects can be seen by the camera (e.g. closeup shots).

: Your comment only says what happens when the camera is moved without changing the FOV. The page explains what happens when you also change the FOV. It already says as much; do I need to say so more than once? [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ldo|contribs]]) 12:36, 9 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

EXCEPT when an ‘a’ is at the end of the word, it can also be pronounced like an ‘e’. Both ways are correct, but native speakers normally pronounce it as an ‘e’. For example:

''Apa'' (what) can be pronounced as are-per instead of are-par|

''Dua'' (two) can be pronounced as do-er instead of do-are|

''Bahasa'' (language) can be pronounced as bar-ha-sir instead of bar-ha-sa

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Help planning ==

I've added several potential avenues for improvement in the help planning section of this page.  If anything strikes you as objectionable, please let me know. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:46, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

I'm open to the idea of using subpages for help pages. My only concern is that Wikibooks has tried to do that in the past and it actually made things worse rather than better. I think the FAQs might of been collected together under a FAQs subpage at once time too. I think I contributed to the reduction in the use of subpages in the Help namespace as one of the ways to provide some order to the namespace. I think subpages were used inconsistently and perhaps sometimes overused. I don't see the harm in enabling subpages even if its decided later not to use them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:14, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

===On structure===
There seems to be some inconsistency with some help pages being singular and others plural.  I think the use of singular was so people could use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[help:table|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[help:table|]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the pipe trick interchangeably without redirecting.  Additionally, some of the merge suggestions seem as though they'd create pages that are too large, especially if there are other help pages we're missing in the same subject area.  There seems to have been a desire for organic linking where you could simply slap &quot;help:&quot; in front of a term to get a page on it. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:00, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

: Yes singular would allow the pipe trick without redirects, but I find myself assuming the names are in plural form often enough that if its not in plural form I create a redirect as a convenience so I don't have to keep reediting pages to fix the fact I accidentally got it wrong. I imagine other people have done the same. I think both should exist and it shouldn't matter which form is used. What merges do you think would create pages that are too large? I think a lot of the pages if merged together could also be edited for simplicity. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:33, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

: For some of these pages I can imagine having organic Help: shortcuts throughout like is the case with WB:WIW or WB:DELETE. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:41, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

Editing might help and certainly redirects could be made to sections.  Another option is to leave them as separate pages and group the concepts you've designated for wiki tools (for example) on a subpage of [[Help:Contents]] with links.  For instance, similar to [[w:Help:Contents/Browsing Wikipedia|Help:Contents/Browsing Wikipedia]].  That would avoid lengthy pages, continue to permit organic linking, and avoid overwhelming new users by cutting down the number of links shown at [[Help:Contents]].  Thoughts on that option? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:48, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

: I'm not sure why new users would find Wikibooks' help overwhelming, or English Wikipedia's help less overwhelming than Wikibooks'. Wikibooks did at one time use English Wikipedia's subpage and grouping of related pages approach. I think it was a contributing factor to why Wikibooks had many missing and duplicate pages, and why many people turned to community discussions for their help instead. I went looking around at many wikimedia projects both English projects and across languages editions for inspiration before deciding to dive right in with a hacksaw and a torch. My visits to other help spaces left the impression on me that English Wikipedia's help structure should be seen as guide of what not to do. With Wikipedia new users must travel at least two pages away and hope they followed the right links to find what they are looking for without getting lost in the jungle of help pages. I think the need to do a lot of looking around and to dedicate a bit of time to finding the help one needs is more overwhelming than a list of links all in one spot. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:37, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

=== On Help:Contents layout ===
I can definitely agree the layout could eventually benefit from changes. The current layout is a direct knock off from [[q:Help:Contents|Wikiquotes]] with a few additions I thought were worth using from other projects. I had thought to base the layout and some of our help pages on [[:it:Aiuto:Aiuto|Italian Wikibooks]] too. Now that our main page has a very basic and simple design, I think this is a good time to consider doing so again, with a 3 column layout though to match the main page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:35, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

:I have no attachments to the current layout.  I'd imagine it'd look like three vertical lists then, rather than horizontal link lists on the current page.  That will look better and allow the additional links that would be necessary if we're not using subpages of [[Help:Contents]] to organize.  Feel free to dive in on that front.  I'm very much a left-brain person and would have trouble designing my way out of a paper bag. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:22, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

:: When I changed the layout before I tried to use the old subpages as a bases for the groups of links and headings seen at [[Help:Contents]]. It will probably be awhile before I change the layout again, because I need to see where the short term reorganization is going to have a better idea of what to do. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:39, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

:::On that last note, I'll note that I'll be updating some pages that have been marked as possible merger candidates.  That shouldn't be construed as a rejection of the merger on my part.  It's simply easier for me to see whether the mergers would be workable once the content is current.  Some of the pages that were pulled from Meta include technical aspects that aren't of note to readers so cutting out those portions will make them smaller and more conducive to merging.  On the other hand some may be missing content and so they would become larger.  Some pages that are red links were deleted as not being relevant to Wikibooks but I'm pretty sure we do reverting, have bullet lists, etc and so I plan to create those, if only temporarily, to get the content sorted out. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:57, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

::: Some of the pages were probably deleted by me because I had merged their content into [[Help:Editing]]. I encourage you to read that page and the section below before deciding whether to go through with creating them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:02, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

::::All the ones I saw were deleted by Jguk.  I see that there is &quot;minor edit&quot;, &quot;edit conflict&quot;, and &quot;reverting&quot; on [[Help:Editing]] but those sections are only a sentence long and don't do the topic justice.  I don't really like the content of the page right now and so I do think updating its content through merges will be good, especially if as noted below you don't want to duplicate the help now in the edit toolbar (with the wiki markup section and special characters sections).  It seems to try to skim over everything at once and cover nothing well. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:51, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

::::: I have improved [[Help:Editing]] over time and I agree it is still far from doing the topic justice. You may notice the page repeats what is covered a few times as well. That is from adding contents from several pages to the end of the page and not having decided yet whether to combine sections or have a brief overview followed by more detailed sections later. I also was thinking about whether I should combine the editing page with the how to contribute page. Many thoughts on what to do next kept me from making any progress alone. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:54, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

When I have merged FAQs, I did so with the intent to keep the FAQs focused and relevant to the needs of different audiences. I never intended to suggest all the FAQs be merged or to remove any questions, but I suspected that might come up eventually. Looking at [http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fit.wikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FAiuto%3AAiuto&amp;act=url Italian Wikibooks' FAQ] suggests merging them all might not necessarily be a bad idea, if people think cutting down on questions is acceptable. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:15, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

:The Editing FAQ has many points that are redundant with [[Help:Editing]] and just fixing some links in a few of them I notice they are very outdated.  Keeping them separate is fine for now though Editing getting merged with Contributing and the duplicate content with the help page being removed would be good.  The content on them is the bigger issue. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:58, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

=== Editing Help ===
I noticed some more links to pages that don't exist yet were added which I think relate to editing. The new edit toolbox includes built in help already for a lot of the editing topics. I think we should be able to forgo repeating it and focus instead on things specific to Wikibooks and on how to use the toolbox's built in help. I have also been reading up some on how to extend and modify the new toolbox for possible additions and improvements. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:54, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

:I agree we should forgo [[w:Help:Edit toolbar]] now that I look at it, since it's still referencing the Monobook version.  However, looking at the edit toolbar help for lists, for instance, as compared to [[w:Help:Lists]], it would seem that topics such as lists-in-lists and other nuances are not covered.  It's good for basics and I like that they added it, but it may not go into enough depth. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:01, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

: Lists-in-lists is covered by [[Help:Editing]] currently. I think keeping what isn't covered makes sense. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:07, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

== Possible mergers ==

I noticed that at Commons, the bottom link on pages goes to [[commons:Commons:Welcome|Commons:Welcome]].  Thoughts on combining [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] and [[Wikibooks:About]] and changing the link to point to [[Wikibooks:Welcome]]?  The about page has a lot of links that duplicate the current navigation template. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:08, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

: I think the only part of Help:About that might be worth keeping is the top part (section 0). The rest either duplicates the current navigation template, whats on the main page, whats in the site navigation, or whats at the [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|community portal]]. You can take that as a sign of support for merging or deleting, whichever you prefer. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:05, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

[[Help:What is a module]] is pretty slim.  Most of its content is at [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]].  I wonder if we could simply expand the [[Help:Glossary#module|glossary entry]] for it and redirect to it instead. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:12, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

: &quot;A module is a page of a book to be read by readers. Chapters and books are separated into many modules.&quot; Of course if you keep getting rid of the term module everywhere, the need to define it continues to decrease as well. My intent in proposing a merger with how to contribute is to allow contributors to understand its meaning a bit better than what a glossary definition may provide. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:27, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

in the relations part it would be a good idea to write about dumbledore having fallen in love with grindelwald, but it is unclear whether grindelwald returned these feelings or not !

:Um, no. Well, maybe... but it was not love, but infatuation. Let me see if I can find a way to word that. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:17, 29 December 2010 (UTC)

== Difference between + variable and , variable ==

Hi,

I was wondering if someone could explain, maybe in the text, the difference between these two different statement, which seemingly produce the same result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Halt!&quot;)
user_input = input(&quot;Who goes there? &quot;)
print(&quot;You may pass&quot;, user_input )
&lt;/source&gt;

Compared with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Halt!&quot;)
user_input = input(&quot;Who Goes there? &quot;)
print(&quot;You may pass, &quot; + user_input)
&lt;/source&gt;

Difference being: print(&quot;You may pass&quot;''', user_input''') compared with print(&quot;You may pass,&quot;''' + user_input''')
:The difference is that one prints out a &quot;,&quot; between pass and user_input, and the other prints out a space &quot; &quot; Python puts a space between the arguments (or parameters) in print.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 17:17, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

==Quotation marks==
Is there a reason for the (&quot; and ') at the end of this sentence?  I am totally new to programming and python, so I don't want to delete it if it is serving some function that I am missing.
Remember that variables are used to store a value in, they do not use quotation marks (&quot; and ')
:I think the author is just itemising the single (') and double quotes (&quot;) - these are the quotation marks. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 01:14, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

==Pointers==
I think when teaching python it should be emphasized that python's variables are all pointers. They are not boxes. They are labels assigned to things. If a thing hasn't got labels anymore, it is lost.
I remember when I couldn't figure out why a list isn't copied when I assign it to a new variable. And even after that it took me a long time to start thinking the right way.
I think there should also be an example that shows that the variable is not needed in the first piece of code because variables are complicated.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Books on Japan==
If just want to read up on some more Japanese history there are some good books here. For further reading there are some good articles on Wikipedia, which might just be worth a look. If you are serious about Japanese History, or simply want to learn another language, there are some good Japanese lessons [[Japanese|here]]. It may just be worth knowing what the Kanji mean so you can get some literal meaning out of place names etc. For further reading I also recommend you visit some other books on Wikibooks which overlap with this book slightly, such as the book on [[WWII|World War II]] which has more context on Japan's place within History as a wider topic.

==The Early Heian Period==
There is a surprising shortage of material on the Heian period in English. Most of the important literary works have been translated and can be used as entry points into the lives of aristocrats. The early Heian period is particularly poorly served, mainly because the sources are sparse, leaving little for the historian to investigate. In the middle Heian and after diaries and other forms of unofficial writing become available, but that only begins to appear near the end of the time covered here.

      <comment>/* Booting */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ArosNav}}


==Introduction==

AOS does call Forbid() when dos list is locked and Permit() when unlocked. (also mentioned in Guru Book that it is 1.x compatibility &quot;feature&quot;) 

Currently there is following comment:
&lt;pre&gt;
/* This came from MorphOS source code, however looks strange.
   Commented out but left for reference.   
    if (dl)
    Forbid(); */
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remove comments or put it inside #ifdef _mc68000 or do nothing? It is AOS semi-undocumented feature after all. I think we should Forbid() on LDF_WRITE, but leave it open on LDF_READ. 



Time to move handlers from DEVS: to L:. They are now packet handlers just like AOS handlers in L:. 
End of June 2011, now with DOS packets in place, file handles and locks aren't the same thing anymore. Code like this: 
&lt;pre&gt;
    fdesc *desc = __getfdesc(fd);

    if (!desc)
    {
        errno = EBADF;

    return -1;
    }

    return __stat(desc-&gt;fcb-&gt;fh, sb);
&lt;/pre&gt; 

in compiler/clib/fstat needs to create a lock from the file handle. What's the best way to do it, NameFromFromFH and then Lock? Do we need a completely different approach for parts of clib? There is LockFromFH/DupLockFromFH() and OpenFromLock() - which covers both directions. Not needed, we can use ExamineFH and NameFromFH inside of __stat(). 


fib_FileName stores as AROS_BSTR. So if AROS_FAST_BSTR is defined, then it's a C ASCIIZ string, and if not, it's a BSTR. 

Since fib_FileName and fib_Comment are guaranteed to be BPTR aligned, it's perfectly safe to use the AROS_BSTR_* macros on MKBADDR(&amp;fib_Filename[0]), which will wrap it all for you. 





===Devices===

Suggest to rewrite these two ps/2 bus drivers and then use timer.device for all required delays ( added a lot of busy loop delays in the code. Especially in interrupt code...). 

* Separate serial mouse driver. 
* Merge  PS/2  mouse driver with keyboard driver (they use the same lowlevel  functions  and  need  to  be linked together, this is why i
still link x86-64-pc board support package into ELF). 



Under AmigaOS 3.1 an application would query the [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4618&amp;forum=7&amp;post_id=40434#forumpost40434 printer.device ]which would read the printer prefs file(s) and talk to the selected printer driver (which was custom for each printer) for that info and give it to the application program. Along with consulting its own prefs for page setup, etc., the application program would then use some controls given by the printer device to control the actual printer driver and feed it the right commands, binary bitmaps or ASCII text data to do the print job. 
I'd recommend starting with creating for AROS standard (ASL like) printing support requesters and developing a new printer prefs file standard and printer.device that could integrate well with CUPS, Ghostscript, etc., which are currently developed and supported open software projects. 

* create a printer.device OS31 compatible - The device has to call the appropriate functions in the printer driver e.g. init(), dospecial(), render(), transfer(), density() and deal with various CMD calls e.g. CMD_FLUSH, RESET, START, STOP, WRITE, DUMPRPORT, PRTCOMMAND, QUERY, RAWPRINT etc. and call the appropriate functions, also try and make it RTG compatible as well. 
* create a spooler task in it
* create a driver to test my network printer

Then add:
* a spooler monitor
* create the prefs app (maybe with printer.device v44 prefs messages, don't know much yet)
* a driver calling ghostscript (if the actual gs port is usable)
* a driver for my PS printer and add support for the USB link 
* a driver for my PCL printer (the same one)
* the idea of Sonic: gfx device context for printing
* a driver calling something else like cups binaries

Support needed:

The page setup would have standard options (plus user customizable ones) for selecting orientation, page sizes and media types. (a starting point would be the ones listed in the [www.pwg.org/ipp/index.html IPP] (Internet Printing Protocol) standards documentation. 

Print options should have place to select which pages of a document to preview, print or print to disk as a file (all, current, range) print file types could be PDF, SVG, PNG, JPEG. It should have settings for N-Up, duplex, add job-sheets, finishing features like staple, punch, cut(roll type media).

Color Management with queuing and job management. 

Implementing drivers that can render to bitmaps and feed it to printers using umpteen different formats to handle low end inkjets that don't support PCL or PS, many of which don't have documented protocols (e.g. you'll likely have to reverse engineer CUPS drivers anyway)



==Filesystems==

Improved hostdisk.device design, merged some common code. Implemented handling 64-bit image file length on Windows. Use flat LBA by default instead of fake geometry which might not fit. 

IIRC single-block cylinders are a problem. I think some partition/FS structures need at least two blocks per cylinder, maybe more. See Poseidon massstorage.class, where I ran into problems with this.

I'll  check  Poseidon  code.  However,  at  the  other hand, flat LBA addressing  seems  to  be  the  only reasonable choice to coexist with other OSes who already ignore cylinder alignment for a while.
I  wonder  why  AmigaDOS creators use cylinders at all, since on both low  and  high  level AmigaOS uses LBA addressing. Filesystems just do cyl * sectors * heads. This is more likely Poseidon flaw. 



==Booting==

according to the RKM's scsi.device section, it appears that device drivers themselves need to parse the RDB and generate bootnodes, which is quite different from the current AROS methods, where &quot;Boot Strap&quot; takes care of RDB parsing. 

So, here's a plan. It should be more like AOS, and will result in 'hotplug' support for RDB volumes - ie RDB CDROMs and CompactFlash devices. So basically the code in bootstrap that recursively scans a disk's
partition tables will be moved into a function in partition.library that will be called from device drivers? That sounds good, and would also eliminate the duplication of this code in the massstorage class. 

Some points:

How will the DOS device for a partitionless volume be handled? Currently, ATA devices start out as HDx and ATAPI devices as CDx. If the HD has a partition table, HDx is removed and replaced with whatever partitions are own IO. In the same way. If there are no partitions, then a 'bootblock' style node is created (HD0), otherwise, you get just the partitions. partition.library will be handling all the DOS details for block devices - they just need to call the function on disk change. 

It appears that most of our filesystems *do* handle ACTION_INHIBIT and ACTION_DIE (mostly) properly. 



----- partition.library -------------

* Add a 'BOOL MakeDosPartitions(CONST_STRPTR device, IPTR unit)' to
partition.library

  - Enumerates through all partitions (RDB or MBR), and
    MakeDosNode() a list of DOS nodes (dnlist), generating unique
    DOS device names if needed. (ie &quot;HD0.1&quot; if &quot;HD0&quot; exists)

The bootstrap already includes code to generate DOS device names where necessary, so there should be a good reason before we change the format used. 

  - If the new partition list doesn't match an old dnlist in the
    partition.library's current 'everything I've seen since boot'
    database:

    * Calls RemDosEntry() on all DeviceNodes in the old dnlist
      for this device/unit (if any).

    * Removes all the old dnlist entries from Expansion-&gt;Mountlist

    * Remember the new dnlist as one seen by partition.library

  - But if it *does* match an existing list, use that instead of
    the new one we just made.

  - Call AddBootNode() on all the DeviceNodes in the new list,
     with appropriate (bootable &gt; -128, or nonbootable = -128) priorities.

----- every foo.device that can have an RDB/MBR/GUID parition ------

* Modify ata.device, usb massstorage.class, etc:
- calls Partition/MakeDosPartitions(..)
   on every diskchange event.

----- trackdisk.device ----

* Create DeviceNode entries with DosType = 0, no handler, and
  DE_BOOTBLOCKs etc. set correctly for a BootBlock style BootNode.

* AddBootNode(5, 0, dn, NULL)



----- Boot Strap ----

Initial boot device selection menu (from dosboot.resource) is now moved to here, and can be used to adjust the order of the entries in ExpansionBase-&gt;Mountlist, among other things. 

Since the partition.library maintains the device's partition to volume mapping, we can remove the partition code from strap. 

1) Scans through ExpansionBase-&gt;Mountlist, and:

  * If not a valid BootNode (node type is not NT_BOOTNODE), ignore it.

  * If BootNode-&gt;bn_Pri == -128 (non-bootable), ignore it.

  * If any of the following are true, ignore it:
     - (dn = BootNode-&gt;bn_DeviceNode ) == NULL
     - (fssm = BADDR(dn-&gt;dn_Startup)) == NULL
     - (de = BADDR(fssm-&gt;fssm_Environ)) == NULL

  * bootblocks = (de-&gt;de_TableSize &lt; DE_BOOTBLOCKS) ? 0 : de-&gt;de_BootBlocks;

  * If the node is a valid BootPoint node (bootblocks == 0): (m68k only)
     - (cd = (struct ConfigDev *)BootNode-&gt;bn_Node.ln_Name) != NULL
     - (da = cd-&gt;cd_Rom.er_DiagArea) != NULL
     - (da-&gt;da_Config &amp; DAC_CONFIGTIME) != 0

     -- If *all* the above is true, then:
        if da-&gt;da_BootPoint(configDev, register A2 = bn) returns,
            then booting from this device failed.

  * If the node is a valid BootBlock node (bootblocks &gt; 0): (all archs)
     - OpenDevice(fssm-&gt;fssm_Device, fssm-&gt;fssm_Unit, &amp;io, fssm-&gt;fssm_Flags ) == 0 
     - Read a bootblock as described in the RKM BootBlock section,
       and verify that the checksum is correct.

     - If de-&gt;de_DosType == 0:
        * Update the BootNode's de-&gt;de_DosType with the DosType in the
          bootblock

     - If de-&gt;de_DosType != bootblock's de_DosType
        * Ignore this device, continue to the next one in the Mountlist

     - m68k ONLY: Actually call the bootblock code
       If the BootBlock's init() routine returns, assume booting from this
          device failed.

     - non-m68k ONLY: Simulate calling the bootblock code
       - InitResident(FindResident(&quot;dos.library&quot;, BNULL));

2) No valid bootblocks? Then try to start up dos.library, and see if there are any 'DOS bootable' nodes.

  * InitResident(FindResident(&quot;dos.library&quot;, BNULL));
    /* If we return here, then DOS couldn't mount a SYS: volume */

3) Show a cycle of the boot animation, and go back to (1)



----- dos.library -----

The major change here is that dos.library *can fail*, and *can exit* with a return code of FALSE if it doesn't find a SYS: volume.

After basic DOS library initialization:

  1) While ExpansionBase-&gt;MountList is non-empty {

      * Remove the first entry (highest priority) off of the MountList

      * If a valid boot node, try to DeviceProc() it.

      * If DeviceProc() succeeds, this is the SYS: node - exit the loop

      * Otherwise, add the node to a temporary list (bn_unbootable)
    }

  2) If no SYS: node:
        * Re-add bn_unbootable to the Mountlist
        * clean up DOS allocated memory
        * return FALSE from this init of dos.library - This is safe, as no DOS volumes have been mounted

  3) Otherwise, we have a bootable SYS: node!

  4) (non-Amiga) If the SYS:AROS.boot file exists and is *NOT* valid for this machine, Intuition up a      requestor to tell the user about it, and allow the user to reboot or continue into the weeds of danger.

     - Since we can't safely dismount SYS: at this time, there's no easy way to handle this case without a reboot.

Finding a partition with a non-matching AROS.boot file isn't an error condition. We need to support 32-/64-bit dual boot systems. That is not possible at the moment, as far as I can tell. A 32 bit Exec
won't run 64 bit code, and a 64 bit Exec won't run 32 bit code. The ABIs are completely different. 

Supporting that would be.. an interesting undertaking, to say the least, and not withing the scope of this proposal. 

  5) Add bn_unbootable to the Mountlist - NOTE: The SYS: device node wil *not* be in the Mountlist anymore

  6) Foreach node in the Mountlist:

     * If a valid bootnode (NT_BOOTNODE and bn_Pri &gt; -128):
         - If ADNF_STARTPROC is set, DeviceProc() it.

  7) Execute the dosboot.resource
      DOSBootResource = FindResource(&quot;dosboot.resource&quot;)
      InitResident(DOSBootResource, 0)
      /* If we return from here, ALERT! */


---- dosboot.resource ----

This resource is no longer autoinitted.

All the boot menu stuff have been moved to &quot;Boot Strap&quot;

All the mounting has been moved to dos.library

All we have to do is create the initial assigns, and start the shell

Maybe we move this into dos.library, too?

* Create &quot;Initial CLI&quot; process:

     Create intial assigns

     InitCode(RTF_AFTERDOS, 0)
        - This is, I belive, more like AOS, in that the initial
          assigns and CLI are up during RTF_AFTERDOS, and
          RTF_AFTERDOS code is called in the &quot;Initial CLI&quot; context

     Execute S:Startup-Sequence or Shell

* RemTask(NULL);





There are several 'malicious edge cases' that can only be solved by making sure that all handlers can properly deal with ACTION_DIE, and stale FileLocks and FileHandles when they are restarted. 

Not sure of the need for a partition.device. There is already a mechanism to handle hot swapping of USB drives from one port to another while preserving the volume's locks and notification requests (I don't
think it matters whether the two ports are on the same controller or not). It works the same way as the mechanism that lets you swap a floppy from DF0: to DF1: etc. in AmigaOS. This is already implemented for fat-handler. The idea here is to make a single code point that handles this for all existing filesystems, without having to have each filesystem hook into the device's diskchange mechanics. 

If the handler gets a new message (ie trying to write to an existing filehandle), it's raw block IOs would go to the partition.device unit for that volume, and if Inutition isn't available, that IO would block (ie WaitSignal()) until the volume is remounted. 

All of our handlers should support ACTION_INHIBIT and ACTION_DIE properly so that will the handler will not think the volume is still present when it's actually been removed. 

Alternatively, partition.library could issue a pop-up (ie &quot;The volume BigDog: is no longer available. [Wait for Volume] [Return Error to Application]&quot;) and either Waitsig() for the volume to come back, or 
return an IO error to the filesystem. 

In either case, yes, the handler will probably stick around.


If we want to make a big push to support ACTION_INHIBIT in all the filesystems, then we don't need the partition.device proxy device. ..  but, as they will remain bound to the same Exec Device/Unit when
uninhibited, we will still need the partition.device proxy to handle hotplugging a partition set (since the USB stick or AHCI hotplugged drive could move to a different unit or even different Exec device). 
[ACTION_INHIBIT is kinder, as this should prevent the pile up of 'offline' volumes if we attempted to ACTION_DIE ejected partition sets' handlers while they have Locks or FileHandles open. At least AFS appears to be able to resume volumes that it finds again.] The partition.device proxy is not needed,
just the automatic sending of ACTION_INHIBIT as needed on disk changes. 

Was it ever needed in conjunction with offline volumes in AmigaOS? Yes, it's critical to the implementation of the DosList volume management in AFS. See the ACTION_INHIBIT: section of afs/main.c, and follow the code paths. 

What's wrong with having offline volumes? They can stick around after their handler dies and be adopted by another instance of the handler when re-inserted. Fat-handler and massstorage.class serve as a good
proof-of-concept IMO, as all this hot-swapping and offline volume stuff works/worked fairly well (I haven't tested this functionality since the packet switchover). 

[Yes, you can eat up all your memory by hotplugging a zillion different USB sticks, even with ACTION_INHIBIT working, but I consider that a non-interesting edge case right now. If it becomes interesting, we should make sure that at least afs-handler and fat-handler properly deal with ACTION_DIE].


===Steps===

# When an Exec block device (ie trackdisk.device unit 0) is first mounted, it is assigned a Dos Device node (DLT_DEVICE) that has a handler (ie FFS), and that handler knows that it will, until it ACTION_DIEs, be attached to the Exec device specified in its DosEnviron (ie trackdisk.device, unit 0 (for brevity, 'td-0') 
# Suppose a floppy is inserted. At this time, the td-0 handler (FFS) probes the floppy and, having detected a FFS disk, creates a new DLT_VOLUME for it, and sets the volume's dol_Task to the handler's dol_Task. Don't think FFS determines if the filesystem is FSS, think it &quot;assumes&quot; it is - and if it cant read it, it assumes it just hasn't been formatted or is corrupt. 
# New locks are attached to the DLT_VOLUME's dol_LockList. (maybe lazily, but this is the theory). Sort of. They are usually only attached to dol_LockList once the volume goes offline (the media is removed). 
# Suppose the floppy ie ejected. At this time, the td-0 handler (FFS) probes the floppy device, finds no disk present, and performs ACTION_INHIBIT/TRUE on itself. The ACTION_INHIBIT sees some locks open, sets the DLT_VOLUME's dol_Task to NULL, and leaves the DLT_VOLUME in the DosList. More or less. The handler receives indication of the floppy's absence with the commands Toni mentioned. It is at this point that the volume's outstanding locks are attached to dol_LockList. 
# If IO is attempted on a lock/filehandle on the ejected DLT_VOLUME, Dos detects that the Lock's fl_Volumes' dol_Task is NULL, and pops up the 'Please insert volume XXX' requester. Version 1.0 had a difference here between DOS and FS. If DOS needed a file from Volume Vol:, but it found it wasn't present, it would ask the user to insert it anywhere. But if the FS was trying to locate another block on a disk, then it would ask to replace the disk in that specific drive. (Yes, I think, it did just say &quot;disk&quot;, rather than giving its name, which was a major irritation if you'd just done three disk-swaps.) I can't recall how far this was improved over time, though. 
## A new floppy is inserted. The td-0 handler performs the same action as (2). Something will have to inhibit DOSFALSE, or nothing is going to happen. If td-0 is waiting for reinsertion, it'll now probably return the requested data. The handler is actually waiting for a IOHF_MEDIA_CHANGE, and will rescan the device to determine what the new volume is, at least that's how AROS has it implemented. In AROS the probing is done in the FFS handler itself on media insertion. From the best I can tell, AOS does the same. 
# The floppy originally on td-0 is now inserted in td-1. After probing, the td-1 handler finds the same volume on the DosList, and sets the volume's dol_Task to td-1's dol_Task. The original volume is now available. Yes. Additionally, the td-1 handler grabs the volume's locks from dol_LockList. Available to the DOS, that is. You can open the files on that volume again. If td-0 had a file open on it, it will continue to ask to reinsert it (unless AOS or AROS improved on that). Handler uses device driver's TD_ADDCHANGEINT/TD_REMCHANGEINT (older code used TD_REMOVE, or in worst case polls) io commands to detect media changes. 


The basic summary is that the DOS DeviceNode is bound to that device for the lifespan of the DeviceNode (until it receives ACTION_DIE), and that it manages the generation, detection, ejection, and resurrection of any volumes it sees, _of_its_filesystem_type_, _for_that_exec_device_. 


If so, here's where I think this model breaks down:

1) When an Exec RDB capable block device (ie ata.device 0) is first seen, the partitions are scanned, and DOS devices are created for each partition, and assigned handlers. Each of those handlers is bound to the Exec device, unit, and block ranges specified by their DosEnviron vectors. 

2) Each of those DLT_DEVICEs expects to be able to communicate with its underlying Exec device until it receives either a ACTION_INHIBIT or ACTION_DIE.

3) Assume now that the multiple partitions have created their DLT_VOLUMEs, and we have some open locks on some, and others have no locks.

4) The ata-0 device is then ejected. Each of the existing DOS Device handlers will get IOHF_MEDIA_CHANGE events, and detect that no media is present, and, just like case 4, set up their volumes to be dismounted or 'not available. They shouldn't get MEDIA_CHANGE; they should get INHIBIT. The medium that's changed is not theirs; theirs just disappears because the medium it's on is changed. Compare with diskfiles.: You have mounted a diskfile from an USB-stick. You pull the stick; the diskfile doesn't suddenly get a different volume inserted, it just can't access its volume any more. Reinsert Volume AOSDMS: into device DFile1:. 

Points 1 to 4 are correct, [http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0062.html but additional steps may be taken during 4], depending on the type of drive we're talking about. Assuming we're talking about a hard drive on a hot-pluggable interface, e.g. a typical USB hard drive or flash drive. For USB, step 4 corresponds to the HD's USB plug being removed from the system. All handlers using the HD would be sent ACTION_DIE. Those handlers with outstanding locks would put them on their volume's dol_LocksList before dying. After the handlers are gone, the Exec block device for the removed HD will be destroyed. 

If we consider a handler returning DOSFALSE for ACTION_INHIBIT or ACTION_DIE when it has no open locks a bug. 

Or is it an even stronger requirement, that (so long as there are no in-process IOs) a Dos Device handler should always properly handle
ACTION_INHIBIT and ACTION_DIE, and migrate their locks to the offline volume, and a new handler should be able to resurrect those locks
once the volume comes back online? 

If there are active IOs, and the handler returns DOSFALSE for action ACTION_INHIBIT and ACTION_DIE, then the handler should hang around,
and wait for the device to be reinserted, correct? 


5) A new MBR device is inserted. The existing DOS handlers, which still are allocated to the old partition layout, see the OHF_MEDIA_CHANGE, and try to probe for new volumes on the new disk in their old ranges. Hopefully they won't find any. 
Where is the new MBR volume inserted? If it's another USB HD, new handlers will be set up, as with the previous RDB HD. The RDB's handlers will already be gone, so they won't cause any trouble. New MBR volume, in the same physical hotplug slot as the old one
(device &amp; unit). The Exec device needs to do the partition rescan on reinsertion, correct? And *not* pass IOHF_MEDIA_CHANGE to any 'stale' handlers until it has verified that those handlers match the original RDB they were opened on, right? They don't see the disk-change, and the insertion of the new volume will create new DOS Devices for each new partition. There is indeed a problem here, in whether we want to Action_Die and reuse device numbers. There are probably advantages to both. 

So... What now? Should the ata-0 device rescan for new partitions? Yes. 
Some other task/handler? 

Should the old Dos Devices hang around (ACTION_INHIBITed), until we see something that looks like the old RDB again?
Not in the case I described above (USB HDs). A more interesting situation would be something like a DVD-RAM drive that accepts partitioned removable media. IMHO the handlers should be sent ACTION_DIE when partitioned media is removed, but the Exec block device
would stay. This would probably work for SATA HDs too. Yes, at least those that were inhibited. Here comes the effect of the question about reusing the numbers. If we reused those that had no lock, then reinserting the stick may give them different device numbers.

What if they won't inhibit? But we'd better not pull the stick, because they are busy writing to it. Should we ACTION_DIE the DOS Devices from the old RDB? Yes, since they were created dynamically for a situation that no longer exists. No, because we may want to reinsert that volume. We'll have to weigh that one. Does any one know a reference? 

What if they won't die? Then there's a bug in that OS component.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Final Judgment is a key component of Chapter 20 and has caused many different religious scholars to ponder the books described in this chapter.  The Book of Deeds is believed to be a book that holds a record of every action, good or bad, of everyone who has ever lived.  This book is used to show that God will never forget what every person has done in their individual life.  The Book of Life is the second book discussed and many scholars believe that this book lists the people who believe in Jesus.  Most scholars believe that this book was made possible when Jesus died for our sins.

There is much debate over the relevance of the Book of Deeds.  In verse 15 John states that those whose names are not listed in the Book of Life will be thrown into the lake of fire.  Does this mean that only one’s belief in Jesus matters and not their actions in life? If this is the case why did John mention the Book of Deeds?  This topic is under much debate in the eyes of religious scholars.  What do you believe?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout Chapter 19 the scene is being set for a huge battle between good and evil.  The righteous and his army on one said of the battlefield and the beast and his army on the other side.  It describes the rider of the white horse having a sword that is coming out of his mouth.  Then all of a sudden the Beast and the false prophet are captured and thrown into the lake of fire.  The Beast’s army is said to be killed by the sword of the rider of the white horse.  

This battle seemed to end quite quickly without a real battle.  This seems to bring up the question of how did the Beast and the prophet get captured?  Did they just give up on the sight of the rider on the white horse?  Or did God use his divine power to end the battle before it even began?  This also raises the question of how did the Beast’s army die?  Did the word of God kill them on the spot?  Chapter 19 makes the reader ponder many questions, but what do you think happened?</text>

SPM is '''not''' supported under Octave and there is a number of known limitations (no graphical interface and no batch system) but feel free to contact [mailto:fil.spm@ucl.ac.uk fil.spm@ucl.ac.uk] if you are interested. In most situations, the [[SPM/Standalone|standalone version of SPM]] might be a sufficient alternative.

You need to use latest version of [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/ SPM12] and [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html GNU Octave (3.8)].

For compilation of the MEX files for Octave, run the following:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm12/src
make distclean PLATFORM=octave
make PLATFORM=octave &amp;&amp; make install PLATFORM=octave
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== How to contribute ===

You can contribute to improve the support of SPM on GNU Octave in several ways:
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/bugs.html ''Report bugs:''] using the development version of Octave, report problems you encounter when using SPM to [mailto:fil.spm@ucl.ac.uk SPM] or [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/support-expectations.html Octave] developers. Make sure to only report a bug in Octave when it's something that should not be fixed in SPM instead. Try to isolate the problem as much as possible.

== Compatibility issues observed so far in SPM with Octave ==

=== Requires changes in SPM ===

* Compilation of MEX files: use '''&quot;mkoctfile --mex&quot;''' and the MEX-file extension is &quot;.mex&quot; on all platforms.
* It is not possible to create a '''function handle''' with a function name that does not exist (eg, x = @sdlkjfhg fails, see [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?31821 this]).
* '''do''' is a reserved keyword in Octave (for a do-until loop) so cannot be used as variable name.
* '''disp''' should be called instead of '''display''' for standard variables (in OO programming).
* '''builtin('display',obj)''' does not work on user-defined objects (MATLAB returns 'classname object: x-by-y', i.e. it calls disp.m).
* '''class''' can only be called from the class constructor (and not in any other method function) (class(obj,'myclass') =&gt; myclass(obj)).
* The short-circuit '''&amp;&amp;''' and '''||''' operators should be used in if statements, instead of binary operators &amp; and |. This is reported by MLINT.
* MEX files should include &quot;mex.h&quot; but not '''&quot;matrix.h&quot;''', see [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Getting-Started-with-Mex_002dFiles.html this]
* '''cd''' does not return current directory in Octave (unlikely to change, see [https://mailman.cae.wisc.edu/pipermail/bug-octave/2010-November/017273.html this thread]). Call '''pwd''' beforehand instead.
* &lt;s&gt;Line continuation &quot;'''...'''&quot; does not ignore anything that appears after it, unless there is a comment sign '''%''' (MATLAB [http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f0-5789.html#f0-5857 does]).&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?38653 fixed]

=== Requires changes in Octave ===

* &lt;s&gt;'''strrep.m''' works on strings but not cell arrays&lt;/s&gt; [https://mailman.cae.wisc.edu/pipermail/bug-octave/2010-January/016627.html fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''isdeployed.m''' does not exist (function X=isdeployed, X=false;)&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32151 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''textscan.m''', '''strread.m''' and '''textread.m''' do not exist (in 3.2.4; available in devel, see [http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/textscan-wanted-td3002808.html this] and [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?31380 this]). Note that in MATLAB, textscan should be preferred and replace strread and textread. The devel function crashes on ''textscan('aaa.bbb','%s','delimiter','.')''&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32066 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;A subfunction of a private class method does not access fields directly (i.e. it's a step further from [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?30909 this]) and calls subsref/subsasgn instead.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32060 fixed]
* '''which.m''' does not support the -ALL option (see [http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/which.html this]). [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32088 in progress]
* &lt;s&gt;trailing '''filesep''' in '''addpath'''/'''rmpath'''&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32181 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;''a='a';b={};c='''cellfun'''(@(x)strcmp(a,x),b);'' crashes with Octave (devel, not 3.2.4) while MATLAB returns c=[].&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32067 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;Same error with ''b='''get'''(findobj(0,'Tag','xxx'),'a')'' which should return [], i.e. problem with functions that return empty output.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32067 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''save.m''' (and perhaps '''load.m''') have trouble with MATLAB binary MAT-format&lt;/s&gt; (&lt;s&gt;when some variables are not double precision (e.g. ''clear a;a.field1=single(1);save a.mat a -v6;load a.mat'' crashes on Octave dev (&quot;error: load: invalid element type = 0&quot;)&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?31942 fixed]). [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32090 fixed]
* '''dialog, errordlg, helpdlg, inputdlg, listdlg, msgbox, warndlg''' do not exist in Octave.
* &lt;s&gt;'''gco.m''' now exists in Octave but creates a figure if none exists.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?37211 fixed].
* '''fcnchk.m''' does not exist in Octave (can usually be replaced by '''str2func.m''')
* &lt;s&gt;'''isequal.m''' does not work with objects (''error: find: wrong type argument `class', __isequal__.m at line 147'').&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32071 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''logm'''(eye(3)) crashes, MATLAB returns zeros(3).&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32075 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''logm''' sometimes returns complex numbers.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32121 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''mat2str''' fails on logical inputs&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32102 fixed]

* &lt;s&gt;Assignment error with non-preallocated '''sparse''' matrices (''clear a; a(1,:)=sparse(1,3,1,1,3);'' returns ''A(I,J,...) = X: dimensions mismatch''.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32263 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''tic/toc''' do not handle input/output arguments as in MATLAB (''tStart=tic; any_statements; tElapsed=toc(tStart);'').&lt;/s&gt; [http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/f8d5095fa90d fixed]
* '''str2num'''(',1,1') returns [1 1] in MATLAB and [] in Octave, [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?34346 won't fix]
* &lt;s&gt;Objects not converted as structure when loaded from a MAT-file if class definition is not in path.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?3264 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;Accessing graphics object properties from an empty handle displays obscure warning (''get([],'x')'').&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?32642 fixed]
* &lt;s&gt;'''nargchk'''(1,1,1,'struct') returns a 1x1 struct with no fields in Octave and a 0x1 struct with fields ''message'' and ''identifier'' in MATLAB.&lt;/s&gt; [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?33808 fixed]
* '''''[[];{'a'}]''''' returns ''{[];'a'}'' instead of ''{'a'}'', [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?37086 won't fix]

=== Undecided yet ===

* mkoctfile's option to define output file name is &quot;-o&quot; or &quot;--output&quot; while mex's option is &quot;-output&quot;. If used, no file extension ('.mex') is appended.
* MEX object files &quot;*.o&quot; are not automatically deleted after compilation (they are with MATLAB's mex).
* '''computer.m''' returns different strings than on MATLAB (PCWIN, GLNX86, PCWIN64, GLNXA64, MACI64), e.g. x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.
* '''load.m''' and '''save.m''' automatically add a ''.mat'' file extension if not provided with MATLAB (Octave doesn't).
* Octave buffers output, which can be blocking. '''fflush(stdout)''' or [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Paging-Screen-Output.html page_screen_output] has to be used.

=== Miscellaneous ===

* '''exist('OCTAVE_VERSION','builtin')''' can be used to detect if running in Octave or MATLAB.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ada/Navigation|Attributes|'Aft}}

S'Aft is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where S is a fixed point subtype.

S'Aft returns the number digits needed after the decimal point to accommodate the precision of the subtype S, unless the delta of the subtype S is larger than 0.1, in which case the attribute returns a value of 1.

Hiragana are one of the 3 scripts of the Japanese Language. It is the one that is usually learned first. If you are serious about learning Japanese you should learn the Hiragana and Katakana until they are second nature to you.

see [[Japanese/Kana]] [ [[Japanese/Kana chart]] ]

Katakana are used in Japanese generally for foreign words. These along with Hiragana are basic letters which should be learned.
See [[Japanese/Kana]] [ [[Japanese/Kana chart]] ] for the list of standard katakana and their combinations.

      <comment>Fixed mistakes in sample data</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a tree of data and you want to limit the results to a given level of a tree.

== Sample Data ==
Assume we have an org chart that has the following structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;position title=&quot;President&quot; name=&quot;Peg Prez&quot;&gt;
   &lt;position title=&quot;Vice President&quot; name=&quot;Vic Vicepres&quot;&gt;
      &lt;position title=&quot;Director&quot; name=&quot;Dan Director&quot;&gt;
          &lt;position title=&quot;Manager&quot; name=&quot;Marge Manager&quot;&gt;
              &lt;position title=&quot;Supervisor&quot; name=&quot;Sue Supervisor&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;position title=&quot;Project Manager&quot; name=&quot;Pete Project&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;/position&gt;
          &lt;/position&gt;
      &lt;/position&gt;
   &lt;/position&gt;
   &lt;position title=&quot;CFO&quot; name=&quot;Barb Beancounter&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;position title=&quot;CIO&quot; name=&quot;Tracy Technie&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/position&gt;
&lt;/source &gt;

To display an org chart you only want to display the individual and their direct reports.

== Approach ==
We will use computed element and attribute constructors.
let $positions := doc('/db/my-org/apps/hr/data/positions.xml')/position

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
{for $subelement in $positions/position
    return
       element {name($subelement)} 
       
       {for $attribute in $subelement/@*
          return attribute {name($attribute)} {$attribute}
       ,
       $subelement/text()}
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:openscad_new.png|thumb|OpenSCAD after starting]]
Open one of the many examples that come with OpenSCAD (''File'', ''Examples'', e.g. ''example004.scad''). Or you can copy and paste this simple example into the OpenSCAD window:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|'''Usage example 1 - example004.scad:'''
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
difference() {
 	cube(30, center=true);
 	sphere(20);
 }
 translate([0, 0, 30]) {
 	cylinder(h=40, r=10);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
|[[File:openscad_first_steps.png|thumb|OpenSCAD after pasting the example code and pressing F5]]
|}

Then '''press F5''' to get a graphical preview of what you typed (or '''press F6''' to get a graphical view).

You get three types of movement in the preview frame:

# Drag with left mouse button to rotate the view. The bottom line will change the rotate values.
# Drag with an other mouse button (or control-drag under OSX) to translate (move) the view. The bottom line will change translate values.
# Use the mouse scroll to zoom in and out.  Alternatively you can use the + and - keys, or right-drag with the mouse while pressing a shift key (or control-shift-drag under OSX). The Viewport line at the bottom of the window will show a change in the distance value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For our first model we will create a simple 2 x 3 x 4 cuboid. In the openSCAD editor, type the following one line command:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|'''Usage example 1 - simple cuboid:'''

cube([2,3,4]);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Compiling and rendering our first model ===

The cuboid can now be compiled and rendered by pressing F6 while the openSCAD editor has focus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen how to create a simple cuboid. Our next task is to attempt to use the translate positioning command to place an identical cuboid next to the existing cuboid:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|'''Usage example 1 - positioning an object:'''
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
cube([2,3,4]);
translate([3,0,0]) {
  cube([2,3,4]);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|[[File:OpenSCAD_Positioning_an_Object.png|thumb|OpenSCAD positioning an object]]
|}

=== There is no semicolon following the translate command ===

Notice that there is no semicolon following the translate command. This is because the translate command relates to the following object. If the semicolon was not omitted, then the effect of the position translation would end, and the second cuboid would be placed at the same position as the first cuboid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ATS is a programming language that unifies specification and implementation. It is equipped with a highly expressive type system rooted in the framework Applied Type System, which also gives the language its name. In ATS, a variety of programming paradigms are supported, including functional programming, imperative programming, (a restricted form of) object-oriented programming, modular programming, etc. In addition, ATS contains a theorem-proving component ATS/LF that allows proofs to be constructed as total functions. With this component, ATS advocates a programmer-centric approach to program verification that combines programming with theorem proving: ''How do we know that a program is correctly implemented? We ask the programmer implementing the program to also construct a proof attesting to that the program meets its specification''. Furthermore, the theorem-proving component ATS/LF may be used as a logical framework for encoding various deduction systems and their (meta-)properties.

What makes ATS distinctive is its emphasis on employing types and proofs to ensure program safety. For example, dereferencing null-pointers can be ruled out in ATS statically, i.e., at compile-time; out-of-bounds array subscripting can be ruled out statically; improper handling of memory such as leaking and double-freeing can be ruled out statically; etc. More importantly, ATS offers the programmer a great deal of flexibility in designing a type-based approach to capturing specific safety violations that he or she is interested in.

This wikibook is aimed to introduce you to the ATS programming language, from the basics to the most advanced features and is positioned be an alternative presentation of [http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/TUTORIALATS/HTML/book1.html the official tutorial]. We do not aim to teach you programming, for which you should consult other books (e.g. [http://htdp.org/ HtDP]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">hi
i want to know the reason why people cant make cars not to crash .
so many people have died in many accident.
 can we  protect not to be died in any accidents ?
everything that can drive has damaged people when they have been developed.
i hope people can make them not to be anything that can give people trouble.
thank all.it is impossible but people can make everything .</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Differentiation is the opposite to integration and you use dy/dx. you drop the power in the front of the equation and you decrease the power by 1.

E.g. &lt;math&gt;y = 3x^2 + 4x^5&lt;/math&gt; becomes

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^1 + 20x^4&lt;/math&gt;
or
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 20x^4&lt;/math&gt;

Quite easy when you know how!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the ATS programming language system.
[[User:WIKIBKhwxi|WIKIBKhwxi]] ([[User talk:WIKIBKhwxi|talk]]) 18:10, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

The page [[Using Wikibooks/How To Structure A Wikibook]] has a recommendation to make a plan for a book up-front, so I'll try to summarize who is this book going to be for, and outline its overall structure. If you find any of this incomplete or unsound, please do not hesitate to discuss your thoughts.

The intended audience is programmers having experience with
* structured, procedural programming using type-safe and unsafe languages (Pascal, C/C++)
* functional programming using descendants of ML (SML and OCaml mainly, and Haskell to a smaller extent)

So this book isn't intended teach you when to use abstractions and how to derive them, why modular code is superior to monolithic code (in many cases) and others questions in this vein -- these questions are to be explored elsewhere. I'd like to concentrate on the actual usage of the language for doing various tasks (as Matthias Felleisen put it, &quot;to count sheep&quot;).

The book should cover these broad topics:
* informal syntax and operational semantics of ATS (I don't think we need to be very precise here, i.e. no formal models, just description of what individual parts of programs do and what happens when they are combined)
* discussion of types and programs, propositions and proofs, and formal specifications (not very pragmatic, I know -- at least not directly applicable -- but should ease understanding of use of type system in ATS)

Here's the proposed outline (somewhat influenced by &quot;Functional Programming in CLEAN&quot;, P. Koopman et al):
# Preface
# Purely functional programming
## Constants, arithmetic and functions
## Data structures
# I/O and imperative programming
# Types
## Why types? (a little bit of theory about type safety and related things)
## Singleton and dependent types
## Views and viewtypes
# Programming with theorem proving
## Formalizing deductive systems
## Explicit resource management

(we go from least complicated to most complicated things: &quot;calculator&quot; evolves into a language with support for functional, imperative and typeful programming)

Preface is meant to clearly state to the audience what they should (and should not) expect of the book.

Introduction to functional programming is given in the first chapter: we are to treat the basic aspects of programming in ATS (functions, data structures, I/O and type-system). The idea is to allow readers to write simple functions and applications as soon as possible, and there is no intention to treat all available features, but only the most important ones (the most commonly used). In contrast to books on other ML-derivatives, we will have to cover types more thoroughly. A complete description of said features is to be left to the manual.

It would be nice, I suppose, to make the book as linear as possible: every term or notion introduced only depends on those introduced before.

      <comment>/* Declarative XML Representation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a &quot;digital dashboard&quot; that displays several key performance indicators using a graphical presentation.

== Bullet Bars ==

From this article [http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/creating-bullet-bars-with-goog.html Bullet Bars with Google Charts] we can see that it is easy to create bullet bars using the Google Charts API.

Here is the template that we would like to customize:

== Sample URL ==
  http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chs=150x30&amp;chd=t:70&amp;chm=r,ff0000,0,0.0,0.5|r,ffff00,0,0.5,0.75|r,00A000,0,0.75,1.0|r,000000,0,0.8,0.81&amp;chco=000000&amp;chbh=10

== Sample Screen Image ==
[[Image:Bullet-bar-screen-image.png]]

[[Image:Bullet-bar-terms-key.png|frame|center|terms used in dashboard gauge]]

=== Declarative XML Representation ===
An XML representation of this might be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;chart data-source=&quot;my-data.xq&quot;&gt;
   &lt;type&gt;bar-gauge&lt;/type&gt;
   &lt;height&gt;30&lt;/height&gt;
   &lt;width&gt;150&lt;/width&gt;
   &lt;danger-threshold&gt;50&lt;/danger-threshold&gt;
   &lt;danger-color&gt;red&lt;/danger-color&gt;
   &lt;warning-threshold&gt;75&lt;/warning-threshold&gt;
   &lt;warning-color&gt;yellow&lt;/warning-color&gt;
   &lt;target-value&gt;90&lt;/target-value&gt;
   &lt;target-color&gt;green&lt;/target-color&gt;
   &lt;current-value&gt;{70}&lt;/current-value&gt;
&lt;/chart&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This represents the &quot;specification&quot; of the gauge.  It can be queried for each value using XPath.  Note that
the current-value will be put in by the data-source service.

=== Google Chars Representation ===
Which must be transformed into the following URL:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?
 cht=bhs&amp;
 chs=150x30&amp;
 chd=t:70&amp;
 chm=r,ff0000,0,0.0,0.5|
   r,ffff00,0,0.5,0.75|
   r,00A000,0,0.75,1.0|
   r,000000,0,0.8,0.81&amp;
chco=000000&amp;chbh=10
&lt;/source&gt;

== Input Parameters for the Bullet Bar ==
Here are the parameters:
   '''width''' of the bar in pixels
   '''height''' of the bar in pixels
   '''danger-value''' width value in pixels of the red part of the gauge
   '''warn-value''' width value in pixels of the yellow area in pixels
   '''ok-value''' width value in pixels of the yellow area in pixels
   '''target-value''' distance to the vertical black target bar
   '''actual-value''' value of the central black line

== Sample XQuery Function ==

Note that the width of the danger, warn and ok bars (red, yellow and green) are expressed
as a percentage digit from 0 to 100.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:bullet-bar(
    $height as xs:decimal,
    $width as xs:decimal,
    $danger as xs:decimal,
    $warn as xs:decimal,
    $ok as xs:decimal,
    $target as xs:decimal,
    $actual as xs:decimal
) as xs:string {
let $danger-width-percent := $danger div 100
let $warn-width-percent := $warn div 100
let $ok-width-percent := $ok div 100
let $target-width-percent := $target div 100
let $target-plus-one := $target-width-percent + 0.01
 return concat(
   'http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;amp;chs=',
    $width,
    'x',
    $height,
    '&amp;amp;chd=t:', $actual, 
    '&amp;amp;chm=r,ff0000,0,0.0,', $danger-width-percent,
    '|r,ffff00,0,', $danger-width-percent, ',', $warn-width-percent,
    '|r,00A000,0,', $warn-width-percent, ',', $ok-width-percent,
    '|r,000000,0,', $target-width-percent, ',', $target-plus-one, 
    '&amp;amp;chco=000000&amp;amp;chbh=',
    round($height * 0.6)
  )
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* CGAL Grid Only */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{incomplete}}

The openscad model view window provides a variety of view options.

== CGAL Surfaces ==

The surface view is the initial model view that appears when the model code is first rendered.

== CGAL Grid Only ==

The Grid Only view presents only the &quot;scaffolding&quot; beneath the surface, also known as a wireframe.  Think of the Eiffel Tower.

A wire frame is a visual presentation of a three dimensional or physical object. Using a wire frame model allows visualization of the underlying design structure of a 3D model. Since wireframe renderings are relatively simple and fast to calculate, they are often used in cases where a high screen frame rate is needed (for instance, when working with a particularly complex 3D model, or in real-time systems that model exterior phenomena). When greater graphical detail is desired, surface textures can be added automatically after completion of the initial rendering of the wireframe. This allows the designer to quickly review changes or rotate the object to new desired views without long delays associated with more realistic rendering. The wire frame format is also well suited and widely used in programming tool paths for DNC (Direct Numerical Control) machine tools. Wireframe models are also used as the input for CAM (computer-aided manufacturing). Wireframe is the most abstract and least realistic of the three main CAD models. This method of modelling consists only of lines, points and curves defining the edges of an object. (From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire-frame_model)

== The OpenCSG View ==

This view mode utilizes the open constructive solid geometry library to generate the model view utilizing OpenGL.  If the OpenCSG library is not available or the video card or drivers do not support OpenGL, then this view will produce no visible output.

== The thrown together view ==
The thrown together view provides all the previous views, in the same screen.

The neon sign is an evolution of the earlier Geissler tube, which is an electrified glass tube containing a &quot;rarefied&quot; gas (the gas pressure in the tube is well below atmospheric pressure). When a voltage is applied to electrodes inserted through the glass, an electrical &quot;glow discharge&quot; results. Geissler tubes were quite popular in the late 1800s, and the different colors they emitted were characteristics of the gases within. They were, however, unsuitable for general lighting; the pressure of the gas inside typically declined in use. The direct predecessor of neon tube lighting was the Moore tube, which used nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas and a patented mechanism for maintaining pressure; Moore tubes were sold for commercial lighting for a number of years in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |urlhttp://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm |title=Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Claude1913&gt;{{cite journal |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=The Development of Neon Tubes |journal=The Engineering Magazine |date=November 1913 |pages=271–274 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=erpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of neon in 1898 included the observation of a brilliant red glow in Geissler tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint) |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |page=287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following neon's discovery, neon tubes were used as scientific instruments and novelties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=J.

However, after 1902, Georges Claude's company in France, ''Air Liquide'', began producing industrial quantities of neon, essentially as a byproduct of their air liquefaction business.&lt;ref name=Claude1913 /&gt; From December 3-18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two 40-foot (12 meter) long bright red neon tubes at the Paris Motor Show.&lt;ref name=vanDulken /&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;The dates of the show are listed at {{cite web |url=http://et.mercedes-benz-clubs.com/mediawiki/index.php/Chronik_1901_-_1910/en |title=Chronik 1901 - 1910/en |publisher=Mercedes Benz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration lit a peristyle of the ''Grand Palais'' (a large exhibition hall).&lt;ref name=Testelin&gt;{{cite web |title=Reportage - Il était une fois le néon No. 402 |last=Testelin |first=Xavier |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/photo-402.html |accessdate=2010-12-06 }} Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting lit the peristyle of the ''Grand Palais'' in Paris; this webpage includes a contemporary photograph that gives an impression of it. It is part of an extensive selection of images of neon lighting; see {{cite web |title=Reportage - Il était une fois le néon |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/sujet-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude's associate, Jacques Fonseque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth &quot;Cinzano&quot; illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the Paris Opera was adorned with neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; Over the next several years, patents were granted to Claude for two innovations still used today: a &quot;bombardment&quot; technique to remove impurities from the working gas of a sealed sign, and a design for the internal electrodes of the sign that prevented their degradation by sputtering.&lt;ref name=Claude1913 /&gt;

In 1923, Georges Claude and his French company Claude Neon, introduced neon gas signs to the United States, by selling two to a Packard car dealership in Los Angeles. Earle C. Anthony purchased the two signs reading &quot;Packard&quot; for $1,250 apiece.&lt;ref name=vanDulken /&gt; Neon lighting quickly became a popular fixture in outdoor advertising. Visible even in daylight, people would stop and stare at the first neon signs for hours, dubbed &quot;liquid fire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;These anecdotes and the phrase &quot;liquid fire&quot; are often used regarding the neon tube lights in Los Angeles, but the primary source may be lost.

The next major technological innovation in neon lighting and signs was the development of fluorescent tube coatings. Jacques Risler received a French patent in 1926 for these.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; Neon signs that use an argon/mercury gas mixture emit a good deal of ultraviolet light. When this light is absorbed by a fluorescent coating, preferably inside the tube, the coating (called a &quot;phosphor&quot;) glows with its own color. While only a few colors were initially available to sign designers, after the Second World War (1939-1945) phosphor materials were researched intensively for use in color televisions. About two dozen colors were available to neon sign designers in the 1960s, and today there are nearly 100 available colors.&lt;ref name=Thielen /&gt;&lt;!--The following sentence sounds interesting, but has been tagged long enough to remove from public view. Phosphor coating manufacturers have developed high efficiency triphosphor coatings  for neon lamps that rival the best fluorescent tubes for efficiency, especially when used at small diameters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}--&gt;

== Fabrication ==
Neon tube signs are produced by the craft of bending glass tubing into shapes. A worker skilled in this craft is known as a glass bender, neon or tube bender. The neon tube is made out of 3-4 foot (1 meter) straight &quot;sticks&quot; of glass tubing, which are sold by sign suppliers to neon shops worldwide. The shops typically fabricate individual, custom-designed and manufactured signs. Manufacturing is a cottage industry and an eclectic art, in most cases, and is often a small family business. Neon signs are hand made and labor intensive, even today; the shop equipment is normally custom assembled from scratch by the craftsmen themselves from parts. There are many dozens of colors available. The color is chosen by the type of tubing used, and the gas filling.

Clear glass tubing with outer diameters (OD) ranging from about 8–15&amp;nbsp;mm is most commonly used; the tubing normally has a  wall thickness 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm. 6 mm tubing is also commercially available in colored glass tubes. The tube is heated in sections using several types of burners that are selected according to the amount of glass to be heated for each bend. These burners include ribbon, cannon, or crossfires, as well as a variety of  gas torches. Ribbon burners are strips of fire that make the gradual bends while crossfires, when used, make the sharp bends.

After bending, the interior of the tubes may be coated with a thin phosphorescent powder coating, affixed to the interior wall of the tube by a binding material. The tube is filled with a purified gas mixture, and the gas ionized by a high voltage applied between the ends of the sealed tube through cold cathodes welded onto the ends. The color of the light emitted by the tube may be just that coming from the gas, or the light from the phosphor layer. Different phosphor-coated tubing sections may be butt welded together using glass working torches to form a single tube of varying colors, for effects such as a sign where each letter displays a different color letter within a single word, such as shown in the sign in the photo above right. 

&quot;Neon&quot; is used to denote the general type of lamp, but neon gas is only one of the types of tube gases principally used in commercial application.  Pure neon gas is used to produce only about a third of the colors. The greatest number of colors is produced by filling with another inert gas, argon, and a drop of mercury (Hg) which is added to the tube immediately after purification. When the tube is ionized by electrification, the mercury evaporates into mercury vapor, which fills the tube and produces strong ultraviolet light.  The ultraviolet light thus produced excites the various phosphor coatings designed to produce different colors.  Even though this class of neon tubes use no neon at all, they are still generically denoted as &quot;neon.&quot;  Mercury-bearing lamps are a type of cold-cathode fluorescent lamp. 

Each type of neon tubing produces two completely different possible colors, one with neon gas and the other with argon/mercury. Some &quot;neon&quot; tubes are made without phosphor coatings for some of the colors.  Clear tubing filled with neon gas produces the ubiquitous yellowish orange color with the interior plasma column clearly visible, and is the cheapest and simplest tube to make. Traditional neon glasses in America over 20 years old are lead glass that are easy to soften in gas fires, but recent environmental and health concerns of the workers has prompted manufacturers to seek more environmentally safe special soft glass formulas. One of the vexing problems avoided this way is lead glass' tendency to burn into a black spot emitting lead fumes in a bending flame too rich in the fuel/oxygen mixture.  Another traditional line of glasses was colored soda lime glasses coming in a myriad of glass color choices, which produce the highest quality, most hypnotically vibrant and saturated hues. Still more color choices are afforded in either coating, or not coating, these colored glasses with the various available exotic phosphors. A complete sign consists of several electrically connected separate tubes,  with different interior phosphor coatings and different gas fills needed to produce the entire range of colors desired in the sign.

===Long lifetime===
It is the wide range of colors and the ability to make a tube that can last for years if not decades without replacement, that makes this an art. Since these tubes require so much custom labor, they would have very little economic viability if they didn't have such a long lifetime when well processed. The intensity of neon light produced increases slowly as the tube diameter grows smaller, that is, the intensity varies inversely with the square root of the interior diameter of the tubing, and the resistance of the tube increases as the tubing diameter decreases accordingly, because tube ionization is greatest at the center of the tube, and the ions migrate to and are recaptured and neutralized at the tube walls. The greatest cause of neon tube failure is the gradual absorption of neon gas by high voltage ion implantation into the interior glass walls of the tubes which depletes the gas, and eventually causes the tube resistance to rise to a level that it can no longer light at the rated voltage, but this may take 7–10 years.  

The actual cause of 80% of neon sign failures is the burnout of the high voltage electrical wires connecting the tubes inside of metal conduits. A very common type of neon sign is made from a formed metal box having a colored translucent face, called &quot;channel lettering.&quot;  Newer channel letter signs are being replaced by high brightness LEDs. 

This long lifetime has created a practical market for neon use for interior architectural cove lighting in a wide variety of uses including homes, where the tube can be bent to any shape, fitted in a small space, and can do so without requiring tube replacement for a decade or more.

===Tube Bending===
A section of the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a pattern containing the graphics or lettering that the final product will ultimately conform to.   This is where the real art of neon comes in that takes some artisans from a year up to several years of practice to master. A tube bender corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses a small amount of air in order to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully along the length of the tube.  One tube letter may contain 7-10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be absolutely vacuum tight in order to operate, and it must be vacuum clean inside.  Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube had, or should, be started over again, because breathing heated mercury impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer.  Extreme ends of the electrical circuit must be isolated from each other to prevent tube puncture and buzzing from corona effect.

===&quot;Bombardment&quot;===
Neon and Argon are inert noble gases, pure elements. As long as there are no other gases left in the pre-filled tube, neon will maintain its life for long periods of time, subject only to the long process of ion implantation that gradually absorbs the gas over many years. But there are metal electrodes and, in the case of argon tubes, mercury beads inside the tube that can burn quickly in a very few seconds destroying the tube if any remnants of reactive atmospheric gases are left over, and it is necessary to &quot;convert&quot; the cold cathode powder coatings in these electodes from BaCO2 to low work function BaO2 by heating them to an incandescent temperature, and to drive out and evacuate the oxygen, carbon dioxide and water which clings to the walls of the tube after being exposed to the atmosphere. This is done in a vacuum heating process known commercially as &quot;bombardment.&quot;

A cold cathode electrode is fused by heating with a natural gas/compressed air hand torch(or welded) to each end of the tube as it is finished. The electrodes are also traditionally lead glass and contain a small metal shell with two wires protruding through the glass to which the sign wiring will later be attached. All welds and seals must be perfectly leak-proof to high vacuum before proceeding further. 

The tube is attached to a manifold which is itself attached to a high-quality vacuum pump. The tube is then evacuated of air until it reaches near-vacuum. During evacuation, a high electrical current is forced through the tube via the wires protruding from each electrode (in a process known as &quot;bombarding&quot;). This current and voltage is far above the level that occurs in final operation of the tube.  The current depends on the specific electrodes used and the diameter of the tube, but is typically in the 450 mA to 800 mA range, at an applied voltage usually between 22,000-26,000 V. The bombarding transformer acts as an adjustable constant current source, and the voltage produced depends on the length and pressure of the tube. Typically the operator will maintain the pressure as high as the bombarder will allow to ensure maximum power dissipation and heating. 

This very high power dissipation in the tube heats the glass walls to a temperature of several hundred degrees Celsius, and any dirt and impurities within are drawn off in the gasified form by the vacuum pump.  The greatest impurities that are driven off this way are the gases that coat the inside wall of the tubing by adsorption, mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, and especially water vapor. The current also heats the electrode metal to over 600&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, producing a bright orange incandescent color.  The cathodes are prefabricated hollow metal shells with a small opening (sometimes a ceramic donut aperture) which contains in the interior surface of the shell a light dusting of a cold cathode low work function powder (usually a powder ceramic molar eutectic point mixture including BaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, combined with other alkaline earth oxides, which reduces to BaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when heated to about 500 degrees F, and reduces the work function of the electrode for cathodic emission. Barium Oxide has a work function of roughly 2 whereas tungsten at room temperature has a work function exponentially 100 times more, or 4.0.  This represents the cathode drop or electron energy required to remove electrons from the surface of the cathode.  This avoids the necessity of using a hot wire thermoelectric cathode such as is used in conventional fluorescent lamps.  And for that reason, neon tubes are extremely long lived when properly processed, in contrast to fluorescent tubing, because there is no wire filament as there is in a fluorsecent tube to burn out like a common light bulb. The principal purpose of doing this is to purify the interior of the tube ''before'' the tube is sealed off so that when it is operated, these gases and impurities are not driven off and released by the plasma and the heat generated into the sealed tube, which would quickly burn the metal cathodes and mercury droplets (if pumped with argon/mercury) and oxidize the interior gases and cause immediate tube failure.  The more thorough the purification of the tube is, the longer lasting and stable the tube will be in actual operation. Once these gases and impurities are liberated under pre-filling bombardment into the tube interior they are quickly evacuated by the pump.  

While still attached to the manifold, the tube is allowed to cool while pumping down to the lowest pressure the system can achieve.  It is then back-filled to a low pressure (a few Torr (T)or about 1 kilopascals (kPa)) with neon, argon, or one of the other inert gases, or a mixture of them, and sometimes a small amount of mercury. This gas fill pressure represents roughly 1/100th of the pressure of the atmosphere (nominally 760 Torr or 100 kPa). The required pressure depends on the gas used and the diameter of the tube, with optimal values ranging from 6 T (0.8 kPa) for a long 20&amp;nbsp;mm tube filled with argon/mercury) to 27 T (3.6 kPa) for a short 8&amp;nbsp;mm diameter tube filled with pure neon. Neon or argon are the most common gases used; krypton, xenon, and helium are used by artists for special purposes but are not used alone in normal signs.  A premixed combination of argon and helium is often used in lieu of pure argon when a tube is to be installed in a cold climate, since the helium increases voltage drop (and thus power dissipation), warming the tube to operating temperature faster. Neon glows bright red or reddish orange when lit. When argon or argon/helium is used, a tiny droplet of mercury is added. Argon by itself is very dim pale lavender when lit, but the droplet of mercury fills the tube with mercury vapor when sealed, which then emits ultraviolet light upon electrification. This ultraviolet emission allows finished argon/mercury tubes to glow with a variety of bright colors when the tube has been coated on the interior with ultraviolet-sensitive phosphors after being bent into shape.

===Heat processed neon tubes===
An alternate way of processing finished neon tubes has also been used.  Because the only purpose of bombardment by electrical means is to purify the interior of tubes, it is also possible to produce a tube by heating the tube externally either with a torch or with an oven, while heating the electrode with a Radio Frequency Induction Heating coil (RFIH).  While this is less productive, it creates a cleaner custom tube with significantly less cathode damage, longer life and brilliance, and can produce tubes of very small sizes and diameters, down to 6 mm OD. The tube is heated thoroughly under high vacuum without external electrical application, until the outgassed gases can be seen to have been totally depleted and the pressure drops to a high vacuum again. Then the tube is filled, sealed and the mercury dropped and shaken.

===Electrical wiring===
The finished glass pieces are illuminated by either a neon sign transformer or a switching power supply running at voltages ranging between 3-15 kV and currents between 20 and 120 mA.   These power supplies operate as constant-current sources (a high voltage supply with a very high internal impedance), since the tube has a negative characteristic electrical impedance. Standard tube tables established in the early days of neon are still used that specify the gas fill pressures, in either Ne or Hg/Ar, as a function of tube length in feet, tube diameter and transformer voltage.  

The standard traditional neon transformer, a magnetic shunt transformer, is a special non-linear type designed to keep the voltage across the tube raised to whatever level is necessary to produce the fixed current needed, up to the maximum limit of the neon footage possible.   

Newer, compact high frequency inverter-converter transformers developed in the early '90s are used as well, especially when low Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is needed, such as in locations near high-fidelity sound equipment.  The reason for this is that at 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, the typical frequency of these solid state transformers, the plasma electron-ion recombination time is too short to extinguish and reignite the plasma in the tube at every 1/120th second as in 50/60Hz transformers and so the plasma does not broadcast high frequency switching noise. The plasma simply remains lit at all times, becoming radio noise free. 

The most common current rating is 30 mA for general use, with 60 mA used for high-brightness applications like channel letters or architectural lighting.  120 mA sources are occasionally seen in illuminating applications, but are uncommon since special electrodes are required to withstand the current, and an accidental shock from a 120 mA transformer is much more likely to be fatal than from the lower current supplies. 

===Blocking out and coating===
[[File:Club Prima Donna 1955.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|Club Prima Donna animated neon sign in Reno, Nevada, 1955.]]
The trick of the eye neon plays is produced by blocking out parts of the tube with blockout paint, which is either painted on or dipped.  One complete tube is actually composed of contiguous tube elements joined by glass welding to one another so that the entire voltage passes through, say, several letters end to end from cathode to cathode.  To the untrained eye, it looks like separate tubes, but the electrical splice is the plasma inside the crossover glass itself.  The entire tube lights up, unless the parts that the viewer is not supposed to see are covered with highly opaque special black or gray glass paint.  Without blockout paint the display would appear confusing.  In most mass produced signs today, a glass paint is often dipped to make ordinary tubing look like high quality colored glass tubing.

==Applications==
The light-emitting tubes form colored lines with which a text can be written or a picture drawn, including various decorations, especially in advertising and commercial signage. By programming sequences of switching parts on and off, there are many possibilities for dynamic light patterns that form animated images.

Neon signs are increasingly replaced with LED (light-emitting diode) signs due to the lower cost and longer operating life of LEDs.  This trend seems likely to increase given the steady advance in LED luminosity and decreasing cost of high-intensity LEDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I do not think the guide to creating your own vocab is quite right.

It makes sense to create your own classes and predicates where none exist, but there's no good reason to reinvent existing &amp; established ones such as dct:title or foaf:Person. 

It would help to give a good starting set to work with dcterms (NOT dc-elements), foaf, skos, geo, rdfs, rdf, bibo, in fact maybe point at: http://prefix.cc/popular/all 

preifx.cc deserves a good mention of it's own in fact.

Why a goblet? After all, goblets (fancy containers for consumable liquids) are not really all that important in the real world. However, they represent a very large class of interesting objects: those that are radially symmetric. Also, they are fun to play with.

To model a goblet and actually see the result, we do the following steps:
*create the actual mesh of the object.
*apply a ''material'' to the object.
*create and light a scene to display the goblet
*render the scene.

The following tutorials demonstrate three different approaches to creating the mesh model, and then show two different materials (glass and silver) that may be applied to the goblet. Finally, we add the minimal elements to the scene to permit an &quot;interesting&quot; rendering.

==Three ways to build the mesh==
As a beginner, you may wonder why we describe three different ways to build the mesh. After all, surely the Pros know of a &quot;best&quot; method?! The answer is that there is not really a best method. Blender provides a sophisticated toolkit, and different blender artists will become familiar with different tools. If, after you gain experience, you become comfortable with cube extrusion, then this may become your preferred tool. If you  need more than four vertices per &quot;circle&quot; you may find that cylinder extrusion is better for some particular object. If you are comfortable with &quot;spinning&quot; an object, then spinning may be right for you. All three techniques generate an object that is defined by a set of vertices on a set of circles that are &quot;stacked&quot; on a common axis.

After we build the mesh using one of the three methods, we can apply any number of fancy techniques for texture and rendering. We provide two simple &quot;cookbook&quot; approaches in this section so you can see the result, but materials are treated much more extensively in other sections of the book.

In the next three sections of the book we describe the &quot;cube extrusion&quot; approach, the &quot;cylinder&quot; approach, and the &quot;spin&quot; approach. Following sections describe three textures that can be applied to objects that are created with any of the approaches, and the final tutorial provides a simple way to render the result.

The &quot;cube extrusion&quot; approach is a basic technique that all blender artists will become familiar with, to model most types of objects. Since it is such a basic technique, it may become the most efficient way for you to create objects, and you may choose to use it wherever possible rather than switching to a less familiar technique. You can see from the tutorial that this technique is perfectly acceptable for goblets, and by extension it will work for similar objects.

You may prefer the &quot;cylinder extrusion&quot; technique when you need more than four vertices per circle, because cylinder extrusion is very similar to cube extrusion. Thus your proficiency with cube extrusion will directly carry over to cylinder extrusion.

&quot;Spinning&quot; is conceptually different, even though it creates the same mesh as cylinder extrusion. Spinning is the easiest way to create a radially symmetric model from a two-dimensional description of the cross-section of an object.

==How many circles?==
[[image:subsurf-bad.png|right|400px]]
[[image:subsurf-good.png|right|400px]]
Each of the three methods defines a set of stacked circles, with vertices equidistant around each circle. The &quot;cube extrusion&quot; technique has four vertices on each circle, while the cylinder and spin techniques have a user-specified number of vertices per circle. But how did we pick the number of circles and the spacing between them?

The answer is that we know in advance that we intend to use a technique called &quot;subsurf&quot;. Subsurf interpolates additional vertices between those we explicitly specify, and this &quot;smooths out&quot; the profile of our goblet.

This will cause problems where we need a fairly sharp &quot;bend&quot; in the profile, as between the base and the stem and between the stem and the &quot;bulb&quot; of the goblet. At each point in the profile that has a (fairly) sharp bend, we need for the vertical circles to be close to each other. The two images illustrate this effect. Each image shows an outline of the object, the spun object, and the result after subsurf (level 2) has been applied. The outlines and the spun images are nearly identical, but the subsurfed result is very different, because there are three extra vertices in the second outline: one just above the edge of the base, one at the top of the base, and one below the bulb: these are the three locations where we need relatively sharp changes in contour. When we spin the outline, the first outline generates seven circles and two degenerate circles, while the second outline generates ten circles and two degenerate circles. Those extra three circles make all the difference. The same phenomenon occurs with the other two modelling techniques.

On Linux, the first step is to [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats-lang/download download the stable version] of the current ATS compiler,  ATS/Anairiats. The filename should be along the lines of &quot;ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz&quot;, where &quot;x.x.x&quot; stands for version.
Then you can install either into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/atshome/&lt;/code&gt; or into some directory under your home directory.

=== Installing into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/atshome/&lt;/code&gt; ===

Open a terminal and invoke

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo tar xvzf ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz /
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now add this to the environment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
ATSHOME=/usr/share/atshome
export ATSHOME
ATSHOMERELOC=ATS-x.x.x
export ATSHOMERELOC
PATH=$ATSHOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Installing into home directory ===

If you choose to install in a different directory, say &lt;code&gt;~/FOO&lt;/code&gt;, untar into some temporary directory first:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
tar xvzf ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz /tmp
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then move &lt;code&gt;/tmp/usr/share/atshome&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;~/FOO&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mv /tmp/usr/share/atshome ~/FOO
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And then add the following to &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
ATSHOME=~/FOO/atshome
export ATSHOME
ATSHOMERELOC=ATS-x.x.x
export ATSHOMERELOC
PATH=$ATSHOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

An explanation of the meaning of the two environment variables is in order. Both are assumed to be non-empty.

* &lt;code&gt;ATSHOME&lt;/code&gt; is an absolute path to the ATS installation directory
* &lt;code&gt;ATSHOMERELOC&lt;/code&gt; is a version of the installed ATS compiler, and is used for name mangling in the generated code

== The first program ==

For testing, please write the following in your favorite text editor:

&lt;code&gt;
implement main () = print &quot;hello, world!\n&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

and save it into a file named &lt;code&gt;hello.dats&lt;/code&gt;. Then please issue the following command-line:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;atscc -o hello hello.dats&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If everything goes fine, then &lt;code&gt;./hello&lt;/code&gt; is a newly generated executable, which should print the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; and a newline onto the console when executed.

== File extensions ==

There are two major types of files you'll be interested in:
* files containing module interface, having the extension &lt;code&gt;.sats&lt;/code&gt; (the first letter comes from &quot;statics&quot;)
* files containing implementation of interface, with the extension &lt;code&gt;.dats&lt;/code&gt; (the first letter comes from &quot;dynamics&quot;)

The meaning of &quot;statics&quot; and &quot;dynamics&quot; will be explained later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">About Hagrids broken wand, just putting a thought : If harry's broken wand can be repaired by Dumbuldors elder wand (in book 7 last chapter)then why can't Dombuldore himself could have repaired Hagrids wand for him, as he is the one who let Hagrid stay in Hogwarts as a ground keeper when he was expelled from the school.
Please let me know if this though process appeals to you guys.
:Actually that makes sense, and has now been written up elsewhere... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:11, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Ron's broken wand ==

Just a thought : maybe Ron's wand is not performing as well as Hagrid's because Ron's wand is not his own. 
If I remember well, Ron received his elder brother's wand in book 1... And we learn in book 7, that a wand has to choose its wizard (or be taken by force) to perform correctly. 
Weird though that Ron's brother (was it Bill or Charlie?) agreed to give over his wand.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nerts ==
'''Nertz''' is a fast, real-time, multiplayer card game best described as a combination of the card games [[Card Games/Speed|Speed]] and [[Card Games/Solitaire|Solitaire]].

'''Nertz''' is also known as '''Stits''', '''Nerts''', '''Nerks''', '''Dooker''', '''Canfield''', '''Crunch''', '''Nirts''', '''Nerf''', '''Gluck''', '''&quot;Blitz&quot;''', '''Maxcards''', '''Peanuts''', '''Popeye''', '''Pounce''', '''Snerds''', '''Solitaire Frenzy''', '''Scrub''', '''Stop''', '''Squeal''', '''Squeak''', '''Squid''', '''Squinch''', '''Lapu-Lapu Dirty Dance''', '''Swish''', '''Racing Demons''', '''Race Horse Rummy''', '''Lucky Thirty''', '''Grouch''', '''Hell''', '''Hallelujah''', '''Hoorah''', '''Mertz''', '''Moofles''', '''Flip Flip''', '''Knertz''', '''Nuts''', '''Nutz''', '''Nutsy''', '''Kitz Nitz''', '''Double Dutch Bus''', '''Snatch''',  and '''Nerds'''{{Fact|date=May 2010}}.

A standard playing card deck per team or player is all that is necessary to play this game. Specialized decks of cards are not required. There are, however, retail game sets that include specialized decks available to those interested. Nertz-inspired games like the Nertz, Llc decks at Nertz.com, Ligretto, Dutch Blitz, Wackee Six, and Perpetual Commotion are all in close relation to one another.

===Brief Game Description===
[[File:Nertz llc Game Pic.jpg|thumb|left|alt=4 decks of nertz llc card game.|The official Nertz, llc card game decks.]]Nertz can be played in teams of two, teams of three, individually, or using a combination of both individuals and teams. Each player or team uses their own deck of cards in a solitaire–style competition that requires speed and skill. The object of each hand is to try to be the first team/player to call out “Nertz” by getting rid of their (typically) thirteen-card Nertz pile.&lt;ref&gt;National Nertz Association: [http://www.playnertz.com/files/The_Official_Nertz_Rulebook_2008.pdf The Official Nertz Rulebook PDF], page 1. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A game of Nertz is usually played to a designated score like 100 or 150 points. (However, some players designate a number of rounds to play to instead of a set score. Others just tally the number of hand victories without ever keeping a hand score and in doing so, the hand victory count determines a winner. Scoring is up to the individual preferences of the players.) 

For the players that do keep hand scores, the way to receive points during a hand is to play cards in to the common area. Each card a team plays into the common area is worth one point. At the same time a big factor in receiving a higher score is the amount of cards in a player’s Nertz pile. When a hand ends, each card that a team/player has remaining in their Nertz pile is worth -2 points. Therefore, it is possible for a team/player to receive a negative score. This does happen often. Thus, the more Nertz cards a player can get rid of, the better his score will be. (Depending on the variation of Nertz being played, certain cards can be given an added value when played into the common area or Lake.)

Teams that call “Nertz” (typically) receive a 10-point bonus for that hand. (Depending on the region, the amount of this bonus given may vary or be nonexistent.)

===Set Up===
Every team or player will need a deck of playing cards that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the decks that will be used at the table. This is because the decks will be getting mixed together in the common area or Lake and will need to be easily separated after each hand.

After sufficiently shuffling&lt;ref&gt;Shuffling and dealing procedure in Nertz can impact the fairness of play and many house rules have been made to ensure balance and order during these processes. These house rules vary. (Details on “Round Robin Shuffling”, “Dealing”, and the “Order of Cards” can be found at the Nertz Terminology link.&lt;/ref&gt; the decks of cards that each player/team will be using, each player/team deals a row of four cards&lt;ref&gt;In some variants five cards are dealt in the River.&lt;/ref&gt; facing up to form the Personal Piles or River. A 13-card Nertz pile is dealt facing down alongside, with the thirteenth and final top card turned up to be available for play when the game starts.

The team’s remaining 35-card pile is now used as the Stock Pile or Stream Pile. After all teams have finished setting their hands, play is ready to begin.

===Game play===
Play begins with one player calling &quot;Go.&quot; Once a player has begun there are three areas he/she uses to aid in getting rid of all thirteen Nertz cards. The Lake or common area, the River or personal area, and the Stream or Stock pile are all vital to the '''Nertz pile'''.  

'''The Lake''' (common area) is used by all players to score points by playing on piles in a suited order and increasing numeric sequence. Players with aces available to play put these aces out in the Lake.  Anyone can play on card piles in the Lake or common area.  Aces always begin the center piles.  From there, a 2 of the same suit may be played by any player on top the ace. In Standard Nertz, if an ace of hearts is played, a 2 of hearts can be played thereon, and then a 3 of hearts, and so on.  In the center area, all cards must follow what has been previously played both in suit and in numeric sequence.  

'''The River''' (personal area) is used like the tableau piles in Solitaire in which you may only build down with available Nertz or Stream cards by alternating colors. You may also play the top most cards in your River into the Lake to free a space or just to score points. Again, River cards must be played in decreasing numeric sequence and according to alternating color. For example, if a player has a starting Nertz card and the following four River cards to begin with: A red [[King (playing card)|King]] atop the Nertz Pile, black [[Queen (playing card)|Queen]], a red [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]], a black 5, and a Red 6.  The player can immediately play the red jack on the queen and the black five on the red six.  The player can then move the red King from Nertz Pile and move the next card off the Nertz Pile to fill the spaces vacated by the five and jack.  Now the player can move the Queen and Jack onto the King, creating one additional space to be filled from the Nertz Pile.  The top card on the Nertz Pile should also be turned face up.

Like traditional Solitaire, when players do not have any available plays within the Nertz pile or River they then resort to their 35 card '''Stream''' pile or turn deck to find available cards that might aid them. Each player flips over (typically) a three-card group from their Stream in search of playable cards. That player may only play the topmost of three cards either to the River or the Lake. If the third topmost card cannot be played, the next three cards are flipped, with the topmost again being the only playable card, and so on until the pile is gone through.  At the very end of the deck, the bottommost card can be played regardless of whether it is the third card or not.  Then the deck is turned over and the flipping begins again while properly maintaining its order.

To gain points, everyone must play on the Lake piles.  This usually results in a very fast-paced game, as players naturally try to play on the center piles as much as possible.  Whatever player lays his/her card down first on a sequence is awarded the play. Once a player/team has rid their Nertz pile of all thirteen cards they may then call or shout &quot;'''NERTZ'''&quot;. Once Nertz is called play must immediately stop indicating the hand is over.

===Scoring===
Once Nertz is called and verified, the cards in the center area are returned to their respective teams.  This is why it is important to play with highly distinguishable decks, so the points are awarded accurately and each deck’s playing integrity is maintained.  Each player is awarded a predetermined number of points for each card they have played in the central area (often one point per card).  Each player is then penalized a (possibly different) number of points for each card left in their Nertz pile (often two points per card).  So, using the one/two point system, if a player has fifteen cards played in the Lake or central area, and ten cards left in their Nertz Pile, they are awarded fifteen points, but penalized twenty points, for a total of negative five points.  Typically, a 10 point Nertz bonus is awarded to the player/team that calls &quot;Nertz&quot;.

Players on average play to 50 points, but depending on the desired length of Nertz games, it is not uncommon find players that play 100, 200, or 500 point games. 

Penalties and deductions can occur due to cheating or accidental calls, so it is up the players to determine what actions should be taken if this should occur. Again, use the links below to learn more about how others enforce penalties.

===Terminology===
*'''Stream or Stock Pile:''' the cards the players turn over looking to play in their personal play area or the common play area.  The cards already turned are sometimes referred to as the Waste Pile but remain part of the stream as they will be used repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html Nerts / Pounce / Racing Demon]. Pagat. 24 December 2008. Retrieved 15 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''River or Work Piles:''' the four cards set in row in which each individual team has their own to play on.
*'''Lake or Common Area:'''  the area where aces are the starter cards and anyone can play.  It is only in the common play area that points can be scored.
*'''Nertz Pile or Bone Pile:'''  the pile of 13 cards that players are trying to get rid of to win the hand.
*'''Starter Card:''' any card that starts a pile, particularly in the Lake. Aces typically are considered started cards when played in the Lake.
 
:''Note: More in-depth terminology can be found using the links'' [[Nertz#External links|below]].

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
{{TOC right}}
This template allows you to easily include a panorama image. If the image is too wide, scrollbars will be added.

==Usage==

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wide image|''name''|''image width''|''caption''|''box width''|''alignment''|alt=''alt text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

A &lt;code&gt;''caption''&lt;/code&gt; option is optional, and an image frame will be used if a caption is supplied. If the caption contains an equal sign, use the parameter &lt;code&gt;|3=''caption''&lt;/code&gt; in the place of &lt;code&gt;|''caption''&lt;/code&gt;. If the caption supplied is exactly equal to image syntax such as &lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;, the image's tooltip will no longer display the caption, but instead default to the name of the image.

The &lt;code&gt;''box width''&lt;/code&gt; option is optional, and if given a value in pixels followed by &quot;px&quot;, or a value in percent followed by &quot;%&quot;, will set the width of the box to that amount.

The &lt;code&gt;''alignment''&lt;/code&gt; option is also optional but requires ''box width'' to be defined. If given a value of ''right'' or ''left'', it will align the entire wide image frame respectively.

The &lt;code&gt;''alt text''&lt;/code&gt; describes the image's visual appearance to visually disabled readers

==Example==
===Without caption===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|
|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five to ten story buildings}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|
|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five to ten story buildings}}

====smaller====
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|400px|
|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five to ten story buildings}}

===With caption===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|Helsinki panorama
|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five to ten story buildings}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|Helsinki panorama
|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five to ten story buildings}}

===Right aligned===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Azuchi-Momoyama period (安土桃山時代 Azuchi-Momoyama jidai) came at the end of the Warring States Period in Japan, when the political unification that preceded the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate took place. It spans the years from approximately 1573 to 1603, during which time Oda Nobunaga and his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, imposed order upon the chaos that had pervaded since the collapse of the Ashikaga Shogunate. The name of this period is taken from Nobunaga's castle, Azuchi Castle, in the present-day town of Azuchi, Shiga Prefecture and Hideyoshi's castle, Momoyama Castle (also known as Fushimi Castle), in Kyoto.
Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, this period begins with Nobunaga's entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the 15th, and ultimately final, shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate, and lasts until the coming to power of Tokugawa Ieyasu after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.

==Japan around 1582==
During the period from 1576 to 1579, Nobunaga constructed on the shore of Lake Biwa at Azuchi (in present-day Shiga Prefecture) Azuchi Castle, a magnificent seven-story castle that was intended to serve not simply as an impregnable military fortification but also as a sumptuous residence that would stand as a symbol of unification. This castle gives us the first part of the name of this period.

Having secured his grip on the Kinai region, Nobunaga was now powerful enough to assign his generals the task of subjugating the outlying provinces. Shibata Katsuie was given the task of conquering the Uesugi clan in Etchū, Takigawa Kazumasu confronted the Shinano Province that a son of Shingen Takeda Katsuyori governs, and Hashiba Hideyoshi was given the formidable task of facing the Mōri clan in the Chūgoku region of western Honshū.

In 1576, Oda Nobunaga the new Arquebus, first shown to the Japanese by the European's, and beat the Takeda clan of a traditional samurai at the Battle of Nagashino. The Samurai's traditional combat style declined after this.

In 1582, after a protracted campaign, Hideyoshi requested Nobunaga's help in overcoming tenacious resistance. Nobunaga, making a stop-over in Kyoto on his way west with only a small contingent of guards, was attacked and by one of his own disaffected generals, and committed suicide.

==Hideyoshi completes the unification==

What followed was a scramble by the most powerful of Nobunaga's retainers to avenge their lord's death and thereby establish a dominant position in negotiations over the forthcoming realignment of the Oda clan. The situation became even more urgent when it was learned that Nobunaga's oldest son and heir, Nobutada, had also been killed, leaving the Oda clan with no clear successor.

Quickly negotiating a truce with the Mōri clan before they could learn of Nobunaga's death, Hideyoshi now took his troops on a forced march toward his adversary, whom he defeated at the Battle of Yamazaki, less than two weeks later.

Although a commoner who had risen through the ranks from foot soldier, Hideyoshi was now in position to challenge even the most senior of the Oda clan's hereditary retainers, and proposed that Nobutada's infant son, Sanpōshi (who became Oda Hidenobu), be named heir rather than Nobunaga's adult third son, Nobutaka, whose cause had been championed by Shibata Katsuie. Having gained the support of other senior retainers, including Niwa Nagahide and Ikeda Tsuneoki, Sanpōshi was named heir and Hideyoshi appointed co-guardian.

Continued political intrigue, however, eventually led to open confrontation. After defeating Shibata at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583 and enduring a costly but ultimately advantageous stalemate with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584, Hideyoshi managed to settle the question of succession for once and all, to take complete control of Kyoto, and to become the undisputed ruler of the former Oda domains. Daimyo of Shikoku Chōsokabe clan surrendered to Hideyoshi in July, 1585. Daimyo of Kyushu Shimazu clan also surrendered two years later. He was adopted by the Fujiwara family, given the surname Toyotomi, and granted superlative title Kanpaku in representing civil and military control of all Japan. By the following year, he had secured alliances with three of the nine major daimyo coalitions and carried the war of unification to Shikoku and Kyūshū. In 1590, at the head of an army of 200,000, Hideyoshi defeated the Hōjō clan, his last formidable rival in eastern Honshū. The remaining daimyo soon capitulated, and the military reunification of Japan was complete.

==Japan under Hideyoshi==

===Land survey===
With all of Japan now under Hideyoshi's control, a new structure for national government was configured. The country was unified under a single leader, but the day-to-day governance of the people remained decentralized. The basis of power was distribution of territory as measured by rice production in units of koku. In 1598, a national survey was instituted and assessed the national rice production at 18.5 million koku, 2 million of which was controlled directly by Hideyoshi himself. In contrast, Tokugawa Ieyasu, whom Hideyoshi had transferred to the Kanto region, held 2.5 million koku.

The surveys, carried out by Hideyoshi both before and after he took the title Taiko, have come to be known as the &quot;Taikō surveys&quot; (Taikō kenchi).
===Control measures===
A number of other administrative innovations were instituted to encourage commerce and stabilize society. In order to facilitate transportation, toll booths and other checkpoints along roads were largely eliminated as were unnecessary military strongholds. Measures that effectively froze class distinctions were instituted, including the requirement that different classes live separately in different areas of a town and a prohibition on the carrying or the owning of weapons by farmers. Hideyoshi ordered the collection of weapons in a great &quot;sword hunt&quot; (katanagari).

===Unification===
Hideyoshi sought to secure his position by rearranging the holdings of the daimyo to his advantage. In particular, he reassigned the Tokugawa family to the Kanto region, far from the capital, and surrounded their new territory with more trusted vassals. He also adopted a hostage system in which the wives and heirs of daimyo resided at his castle town in Osaka.

He also attempted to provide for an orderly succession by taking the title Taikō, or &quot;retired Kanpaku,&quot; in 1591 and turned the regency over to his nephew and adopted son Toyotomi Hidetsugu. Only later did he attempt to formalize the balance of power by establishing administrative bodies. These included the Council of Five Elders, who were sworn to keep peace and support the Toyotomi, the five-member Board of House Administrators, who handled routine policy and administrative matters, and the three-member Board of Mediators, who were charged with keeping peace between the first two boards.

===Korean campaigns===
Hideyoshi's last major ambition was to conquer the Ming Dynasty of China. In April 1592, after having been refused safe passage through Korea he sent an army of 200,000 to invade and pass through Korea by force. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598), the Japanese occupied Seoul by May of 1592, and within three months of invading reached Pyongyang together with large numbers of Korean collaborators who at first viewed them as liberators from the corrupt aristocracy. King Seonjo of Joseon fled, and the two princes were captured by Kato Kiyomasa.

The Japanese army was defeated in the many region of the Korean peninsula by the Righteous army and Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin succeeded in attacks on the Japanese supply ships and defeating the Japanese navy at sea, and proceeded to cut off the Japanese supply line. The Japanese, cut off from their supplies and couldn't make any progress on land.

King Seonjo of Joseon dispatched an emissary to the Ming court, asking urgently for military assistance.
The Chinese emperor sent admiral Chen Lin and commander Li Rusong to aid the Koreans. Li Rusong banished the Japanese from the northern part of the Korean peninsula . The Japanese were forced to retreat as far as the southern part of the Korean peninsula by January 1593. Japan and China started peace talks.

During the peace talks period that ensued between 1593 and 1597, Hideyoshi, seeing Japan as an equal of Ming China, demanded a division of Korea, free-trade status, and a Chinese princess as consort for the emperor. The Joseon and Chinese leaders saw no reason to concede to such demands, nor to treat the invaders as equals within the Ming trading system. Japan's requests were thus denied and peace efforts reached an impasse.

A second invasion began in 1597, but it too resulted in failure as Japanese forces met with better organized Korean defenses and increasing Chinese involvement in the conflict. Upon the death of Hideyoshi in 1598, Japanese forces withdrew from Korea. By this time, most of the remaining Japanese commanders were more concerned about internal battles and for the control of the shogunate.

==Sekigahara and the end of the Toyotomi rule==
Hideyoshi had on his deathbed appointed a group of the most powerful lords in Japan — Tokugawa, Maeda, Ukita, Uesugi, Mōri — to govern as the Council of Five Elders until his infant son, Hideyori, came of age. An uneasy peace lasted until the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Thereafter, Ishida Mitsunari accused Ieyasu of disloyalty to the Toyotomi name, precipitating a crisis that led to the Battle of Sekigahara. Generally regarded as the last major conflict of the Azuchi–Momoyama period and sengoku-jidai, Ieyasu's victory at Sekigahara marked the end of the Toyotomi reign. Three years later, Ieyasu received the title Seii Taishogun, and established the Edo bakufu, which lasted until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

==Social and cultural developments during the Momoyama period==
The Momoyama period was a period of interest in the outside world, which also saw the development of large urban centers and the rise of the merchant class. The ornate castle architecture and interiors adorned with painted screens embellished with gold leaf were a reflection of a daimyo's power but also exhibited a new aesthetic sense that marked a clear departure from the somber monotones favored during the Muromachi period. A specific genre that emerged at this time was called the Namban style—exotic depictions of European priests, traders, and other &quot;southern barbarians.&quot;

The art of the tea ceremony also flourished at this time, and both Nobunaga and Hideyoshi lavished time and money on this pastime, collecting tea bowls, caddies, and other implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters such as Sen no Rikyū.

Hideyoshi had occupied Nagasaki in 1587, and thereafter sought to take control of international trade and to regulate the trade associations that had contact with the outside world through this port. Although China rebuffed his efforts to secure trade concessions, Hideyoshi commercial missions successfully called to present-day Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand in Red seal ships. He was also suspicious of Christianity in Japan, which he saw as potentially subversive and some missionaries were crucified by his regime.

=== Usage ===
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tall image|''name''|''image width''|''box height''|alt=''alt text''|''caption''|''alignment''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;''name''&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the image without any preceding &quot;&lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;Image:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

The &lt;code&gt;''image width''&lt;/code&gt; option is optional, but must be given in pixels ''without the &quot;px&quot;''. It will set the width of the image to that amount. Default is 250px.

The &lt;code&gt;''box height''&lt;/code&gt; option is optional, but must be given in pixels ''without the &quot;px&quot;''. It will set the height of the box containing the image to that amount. Default is 500px.

The &lt;code&gt;''alt text''&lt;/code&gt; describes the image to visually-impaired readers and should have little in common with any caption.

The &lt;code&gt;''caption''&lt;/code&gt; option is optional, and an image frame will be used if a caption is supplied. If the caption contains an equal sign, use the parameter &lt;code&gt;|3=''caption''&lt;/code&gt; in the place of &lt;code&gt;|''caption''&lt;/code&gt;. If the caption supplied is exactly equal to image syntax such as &lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;, the image's tooltip will no longer display the caption, but instead default to the name of the image.

The &lt;code&gt;''alignment''&lt;/code&gt; option is also optional but requires ''box width'' to be defined. If given a value of ''right'' or ''left'', it will align the entire wide image frame respectively. Default is right, use ''none'' for in-line.

==Example==
===Without caption===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400|alt=Image of circularly polarized light}}
{{lorem ipsum|3}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400|alt=Image of circularly polarized light}}
{{lorem ipsum|3}}
{{clear}}

===With caption and &quot;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&quot;===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400alt=Image of circularly polarized light|The direction of the helix relative to the central axis represents the direction of the electric field.|none}}
{{lorem ipsum}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400|alt=Image of circularly polarized light|The direction of the helix relative to the central axis represents the direction of the electric field.|none}}
{{lorem ipsum}}

===Left aligned===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400|alt=Image of circularly polarized light|The direction of the helix relative to the central axis represents the direction of the electric field|left}}
{{lorem ipsum|3}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{tall image|Polarisation_(Circular).svg|250|400|alt=Image of circularly polarized light|The direction of the helix relative to the central axis represents the direction of the electric field|left}}
{{lorem ipsum|3}}
{{lorem ipsum|3}}

I was surprised to see the removal of the links to the [[w:Fried pickle]] and [[w:dill pickle]], listed in the edit summary as &quot;not necessary.&quot;  Seems like WP frequently links to Wikibooks, why not the converse? I have reverted with plain wikilinks, sans hatnote. --[[User:Lexein|Lexein]] ([[User talk:Lexein|talk]]) 21:30, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

Thanks)&quot;
# Not merely &quot;my opinion.&quot;  In my edit summary, I paraphrased [[w:WP:Linking]] (linked from [[w:WP:MOS#Links]]), which explicitly states '''Linking through hyperlinks is an important feature of Wikipedia. Internal links bind the project together into an interconnected whole. Interwiki links bind the project to sister projects'''.  See also [[w:WP:UNDERLINK]].  Linking is practiced and encouraged by many thousands of editors, over quite a long history. There are pillars, policies, guidelines, essays, and consensus. Guidelines, essays, and consensus are in favor of wikilinks, and interwiki links.  Note that I never overlink.
# Shouldn't deletions of links be justified by reference to a relevant guideline or policy? 
# I already did &quot;discuss on the discussion page&quot; as shown in the talk page history, two minutes before the re-revert. 
# The [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Fried_Pickle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1995953 first undoing of the deletion] was obviously not &quot;just undoing&quot;, I changed from a hatnote, which might be perceived as intrusive, to an interwikilink.
# The linked Wikipedia article [[w:Fried pickle]] discusses, with sourced references, the history of fried pickles, and is from where this recipe was rescued. The [[w:Dill pickle]] article is long and detailed.  Since dill pickles may be covered elsewhere in Wikibooks Recipes, maybe it should link there instead of to Wikipedia.
# Here, in this recipe article, two wikilinks cannot be considered excessive.  Is there some other reason they were deleted?

: I can understand why Wikipedia would encourage linking as much as it does, each article is a topic overview with many external links being used to not only ensure verifiability, but as a way for people to find places where they can gain a deeper/richer/fuller understanding of a topic. However [[WB:NOTWP|Wikibooks is not Wikipedia]]. Wikipedia policies, guidelines, essays and consensus does not apply here. I imagine QuiteUnusual meant point to a Wikibooks policy supporting your view. Wikibooks takes the opposite stance by encouraging the practice of &quot;[[Template:Dewikify|Dewikifying]]&quot; articles imported from Wikipedia. At Wikibooks, books build knowledge from one page to the next, and part of that is including any relevant details to understanding the topic within the text itself to ensure a deeper/richer/fuller understanding of the topic. At Wikibooks, external linking is discouraged when used as a substitute for missing details. Any relevant details for cooking fried pickles you think can be gleaned from Wikipedia articles should be explained directly for people to learn from. I hope my explanation provides some useful insight as to why the links were deleted and are likely to be deleted again. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:18, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

:: I agree with Darklama that Wikibooks should follow different rules on when linking is appropriate than Wikipedia should (I think this is explained on an official Wikibooks policy document somewhere, but I can't find it at the moment). The purpose of Wikibooks is to have self-contained books that contain all appropriate information. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 16:07, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

: Thanks to both of ya.  The in-depth reply is appreciated, though the link to [[WB:Dewikify]] tells all, and would have completely satisfied me by itself. Since there's a [[Template:Dewikify]] and an [[WB:Dewikify]] article, I do hope WB editors in future can just habitually refer new WB editors to that ''right away'' when deleting wikilinks, rather than what happened here.  Shouldn't [[WB:Dewikify]] be an actual guideline, since it's the working rationale for a Wikibooks-wide process?  Going forward, if I add the Fried Pickle history from the WP article, can I expect sources cited there to uncontroversially come with, per [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines#Content_guidelines]]? Thanks again. --[[User:Lexein|Lexein]] ([[User talk:Lexein|talk]]) 17:21, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

::To clarify my reasons - the links to the policies, etc., were added to your talk page as part of the &quot;welcome&quot; message in May 2010. I assumed - as it was seven months later - that you would have spent some time here and would be familiar with the general style of work here and didn't think it was necessary to treat you as a &quot;new editor&quot;. I noted in the edit summary that it was your opinion and I disagreed because the &quot;policy&quot; in question is informal, hence it was my opinion that custom and practice here was not to WP link extensively. 

::On your question, above, if you think there is value in having a &quot;dill pickle&quot; ingredient page in the Cookbook, I suggest you request it is imported at [[WB:RFI]] and then clean it up to WB norms before moving it into the Cookbook. For the WP fried pickle article, it is unlikely all of that content is relevant so you'd have to use your own judgement as to what to copy over. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:24, 6 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

{{tl|pre}} uses &lt;code&gt;[[w:HTML element#Other containers|&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;]]&lt;/code&gt; tags, but with text that is either [[w:word wrap|wrapped]] or is contained in a horizontal scrollbox. This means the text will not stretch past the right side of the screen.

As it uses real &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags , it will be displayed correctly regardless of how the user's skin renders &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; boxes.

If you want to disable wikitext in it, you should use &amp;lt;nowiki&gt; tags inside the template (see [[#wikitext|below]]).

===Usage===
====Wrapped text====
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:white&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{pre|Text to be displayed. And more and more and more... and a paragraph break.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;And then more and more...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
:produces:
{{pre|Text to be displayed. And more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and a paragraph break.

And then more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.}}

====Scrollbox====
&lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{pre|scroll|Text to be displayed. And more and more and more... and a paragraph break.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;And then more and more...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
:produces:
{{pre|scroll|Text to be displayed. And more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and a paragraph break.

And then more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.}}

===Using Wikitext {{anchor|wikitext}}===
To disable wikitext (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[links]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), &amp;lt;nowiki&gt; tags must be used in the form:

&lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{pre|&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;Your [[text]], which ''might'' include {{tl|templates}}.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Examples]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This will produce this:
{{pre|&lt;nowiki&gt;Your [[text]], which ''might'' include {{tl|templates}}.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Examples]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

as opposed to:
{{pre|Your [[text]], which ''might'' include {{tl|templates}}.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Examples]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}

This template shows up to 100 images in an array. The number of images per row is based upon the width specified and the width of the screen, which allows greater flexibility than the {{tag|gallery}} tag.

=== Parameters ===
==== For each image ====
Specify a line of the following form for each image.
: '''&lt;code&gt;|File:''Filename''|alt''N''=''Alt text''|''Caption''&lt;/code&gt;'''
* '''&lt;code&gt;''Filename''&lt;/code&gt;''' is the image's file name. It can use a '''&lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt;''' instead of an '''&lt;code&gt;Image:&lt;/code&gt;''' prefix.
* '''&lt;code&gt;''N''&lt;/code&gt;''' should be '''&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;''' for the first image, '''&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;''' for the second image, and so forth.
* '''&lt;code&gt;''Alt text''&lt;/code&gt;''' is the alt text for the image, used by visually impaired and other readers who cannot see the image. If omitted, the image's alt text is blank.
* '''&lt;code&gt;''Caption''&lt;/code&gt;''' is the caption.

If no such lines are present, a gallery with a single question-mark image is produced. There is currently a limit of 100 such lines.

==== For the gallery overall ====

These parameters are optional.

; &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;: The gallery's title.
; &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;: (default 180) Maximum width of each image.
; &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;: (default 180) Maximum height of each image.
; &lt;code&gt;lines&lt;/code&gt;: (default 2) The number of text lines needed for the largest caption. Blank lines are appended to smaller captions. A caption that does not fit is cut off.

&quot;... the pharmaceutical industry employs more statisticians than any other business ...&quot;, if true right now in some country or worldwide, could become false at some point in the future. Would be nice to reference or even to date.</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

Since MediaWiki does not provide a way to add visible captions to images integrated seamlessly in a page (i.e, without borders), this template aims to provide that functionality.

=== Usage ===
This template can be either with named parameters, as in
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{plain image with caption|image=Example.svg|caption=Example text|width=250|align=right}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
...or in its shorthand form:
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{plain image with caption|Example.svg|Example text|250|right}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* The only compulsory parameters are &lt;tt&gt;image&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;caption&lt;/tt&gt;. The width defaults to 250px, and the alignment defaults to right
* When using the shorthand version, keep in mind that the order of parameters is important
* Please notice that the width does not include the unit &quot;px&quot;
&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS HERE, THANKS --&gt;

The '''spin''' technique is  a good choice when you want to model an object that is radially symmetric and you know what the cross section of the object looks like. This the virtual equivalent of using a [[w:lathe|lathe]] to create an object in the real world. With the spin technique, we draw an outline of one half of the outline of the object, and then spin the outline about an axis to create the object's mesh.

==Modeling==
[[Image:Red Wine Glas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photo of a real-world goblet]]
Here is a real-world goblet. The picture is not an orthographic image, so we cannot directly copy the outline, but it is close.

===Setup===
We now model the outline. Let's start with the default model.&lt;ref&gt;Default model:select ''file→new.''&lt;/ref&gt; We want to create an initial object consisting of a two-dimensional outline, so select the cube, go to edit mode, and delete all the vertices. This leaves us with an object that has no vertices as a nice place to start.  We want the resulting goblet to sit at the origin with the Z axis as its axis of symmetry so we get a front view.&lt;ref name=front_view&gt;Front view:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since we will be working directly with mesh vertices, the ''manipulator'' is a hindrance, so turn it off.&lt;ref&gt;manipulator off: press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}} to bring up the ''Manipulator'' menu, then select ''Enable/Disable''&lt;/ref&gt;. (With the manipulator on, it is easy to accidentally move a vertex out of the editing plane, but we want a 2D cross-section.) We are now ready to create the two-dimensional outline as a chain of vertices with the first and last vertices on the axis.

===First Vertex===
Now, place the first vertex: this will be the center of the bottom of the goblet, so place it slightly above the origin on the Z axis.&lt;ref&gt;Place a vertex:{{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Why? Well, for two reasons: in the real world, the bottom of a goblet is not actually flat. Instead, the rim is lower than the center of the bottom, so the bottom is concave and the goblet sits on a flat surface without wobbling. The second reason is that we intend to use the &quot;subsurf&quot; technique, and this technique will make a flat surface slightly convex in our virtual world, so we will preemptively start the bottom of the base with a slightly concave surface.

===Finish the outline===
Add the second vertex, which will be on the rim of the goblet's base: move the cursor to the X axis at about -3, and add a vertex.&lt;ref name=add&gt;Add a vertex:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}, or {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}},{{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Add additional vertices to your outline by moving the cursor to the desired location and adding,&lt;ref name=add/&gt; for as many vertices as you need to accurately model the outline. Since you will be using subsurf later, make sure that you place two vertices near each other when you need a sharp curve in your outline. Otherwise, subsurf will convert your sharp curve into a wide smooth curve.

'''Noob Note:''' This is wonderful advice, but it won't work, because Blender interprets the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}} differently when you attempt to place an extruded vertex too near the vertex from which you are extruding. One quick way around this is to create your vertices sufficiently far from each other to avoid the problem, and then come back and move them&lt;ref&gt; Move a vertex: select it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}, move it with the cursor, and then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the correct spots later.

Eventually, you will place the last vertex, which will become the point at the bottom of the inside of the goblet. This point should be on the Z axis. Your outline is done!

===Spin===
Now, to spin it. first, make sure that you are still in edit mode, and that the last vertex is selected. Set the cursor to the selection.&lt;ref&gt;Cursor to selection: ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|SKEY}}, then ''cursor&amp;rarr;selection''&lt;/ref&gt; Now, get a top view:&lt;ref&gt;top view:{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}&lt;/ref&gt; you are now looking at your outline from the top, and it should look like a straight line along the X axis with one end at the cursor on the Z axis. (If this is not the case, select and move points to the X axis and check your work by switching back to the front view, then come back to the top view.) Now select the whole outline&lt;ref&gt;Select all:{{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} once or twice, until all are displayed in yellow&lt;/ref&gt;  and then move to the button menu to perform the spin. Set the rotation to 360 and the count to 12 (or another number of your choice) and click on &quot;spin.&quot; An elaborate circle will appear. Go to the front view&lt;ref name=front_view/&gt; to see your un-smooth goblet.

===Finish up===
Since you are in edit mode and you have the whole mesh selected, this is a good time to remove duplicate vertices. The two vertices on the Z axis (base bottom center and bulb bottom center) were duplicated 12 times, and the entire outline was duplicated once when the circle closed at the end of the spin. Remove the duplicates.&lt;ref&gt; Remove duplicate vertices:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and select ''Remove Doubles''&lt;/ref&gt; If you fail to do this, the subsurf operation will create a cusp at the two centers, and a crease at the duplicated outline.

If you placed the two Z-axis vertices by hand, they may not be exactly on the axis, and therefore may still be duplicated, leaving a tiny &quot;hole&quot; at the axis. Fix this by merging each of the two sets separately:
# select the vertices to merge.
# merge at center.&lt;ref&gt;Merge at center:Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}},''Merge &amp;rarr; At Center'', confirm with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Now start to smooth by using the subsurf in the button window. First add a modifier and select subsurf. Set levels to 2 Then, use ''smooth'' in the texture window. You now have a goblet model.

[[Image:Spin_a_goblet.png|500px]]
{{clear}}
The image shows four objects: the two-dimensional outline, a smoothed version of the two-dimensional outline, the result of spinning the outline, and the result of subsurfing and smoothing. As you follow the procedure above, you will not actually have more than one object at a time as shown here.

==Rendering==
[[Image:Rendered_spun_goblet.png|right]]
As with the other two goblets, It is difficult to fully evaluate the model unless you render it. However, a &quot;pretty&quot; rendering requires at least minimal materials, lighting, and scenery. This section is a cookbook approach to providing these minimal elements and is not really a useful tutorial, so we won't explain the concepts. These topics are treated at length in later tutorials. If you wish to explore these subjects in more depth, go to the appropriate tutorials.
*The Goblet material: plain glass.
*The tablecloth: A (non-existent) table with a white tablecloth, in a featureless room painted yellow.
*The lighting: one bright lamp.

===Material===
*Go to object mode and select the goblet.
*In the Materials button window, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material|add a material]] to the goblet, and name it &quot;glass.&quot;
*In the ''Material'' tab, change the color in ''Diffuse'' section to black (set R, G, and B all to 0.000.) Here, &quot;black&quot; merely means &quot;do not add any color.&quot; It does not mean that the goblet looks black.
*In ''Transparency'' section, pick Raytrace. Set Alpha to 0.1 (i.e., quite transparent), set IOR to 1.5, and set Depth to 6 (or higher on a very fast computer.)

===Tablecloth and room===
*In the main window, put the cursor at the origin and switch to top view. In object mode, add a plane and then scale it to quite large. This is your tablecloth
*Go to object mode and select the tablecloth. 
*In the ''Material'' tab, set the color to white and ensure the Alpha is 1.000 (i.e., opaque.)
*In the ''Shadow'' section, check the Receive Transparent checkbox. (Older versions: in the ''Shaders'' tab, click on Trashado.) This allows the tablecloth to show the ray traced shadow of your goblet instead of a fake shadow.
*To paint the room, in the ''World'' tab check Blend Sky and change Zenith Color to e.g. yellow.

===Lighting===
If you started with the default camera and light the scene will be too dark and the shadow effect from the lamp will not be too pretty.  To fix this:
*Move the lamp higher and farther away.
*Turn up the Energy.
*In the lamp's ''Shadow'' section, pick Ray Shadow.

===Camera===
Now adjust the camera:
*Shift to camera view.
*Dolly and aim the camera.
*Move the camera back some.
*Render.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Motivation ==
For document types which contain multiple tags, such as TEI or DocBook, it is tedious and error-prone to write this conversion code by hand.  We can use XQuery to generate the basic text for an XQuery module. 

This article uses the same example as used in [[../Transformation idioms/]].

== Example ==
Starting with a simple list of the tags in this document, we can generate a module which performs an identity transform on a document containing these tags.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace gen =  &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/gen&quot; at &quot;gen.xqm&quot;;

let $tags := (&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;sites&quot;,&quot;site&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;,&quot;name&quot;,&quot;description&quot;)

let $config :=  
 &lt;config&gt;
   &lt;modulename&gt;coupland&lt;/modulename&gt;
   &lt;namespace&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&lt;/namespace&gt;
 &lt;/config&gt;
return 
  gen:create-module($tags, $config)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/eXist/transformation/coupidxml.xq XML output] and the text 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/eXist/transformation/coupidtext.xq XQuery file] created by adding the line 
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/text&quot;; 
&lt;/source&gt;
to the script.


If we save this script as, say coupid.xqm, we can use it to generate the transformed document:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace coupland = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&quot; at &quot;coupid.xqm&quot;;

let $doc := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/eXist/transformation/Coupland1.xml&quot;)/*
return 
   coupland:convert($doc)
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/eXist/transformation/coupidtrans.xq  Generate] 

We can also check if the identity transformation has retained the full structure of the document:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace coupland = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&quot; at &quot;coupid.xqm&quot;;

let $doc := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/eXist/transformation/Coupland1.xml&quot;)/*
return 
   &lt;compare&gt;{deep-equal($doc,coupland:convert($doc))}&lt;/compare&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/eXist/transformation/coupidcompare.xq  Compare]

== Module design ==
The generated module looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
module namespace coupland = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&quot;;
(: conversion module generated from a set of tags 

:)

declare function coupland:convert($nodes as node()*) as item()* {
  for $node in $nodes
  return 
     typeswitch ($node)
       case element(websites) return coupland:websites($node)
           case element(sites) return coupland:sites($node)
           case element(site) return coupland:site($node)
           case element(uri) return coupland:uri($node)
           case element(name) return coupland:name($node)
           case element(description) return coupland:description($node)
           
       default return 
         coupland:convert-default($node)
  };

declare function coupland:convert-default($node as node()) as item()* {
  $node
  };

declare function coupland:websites($node as element(websites)) as item()* {
  element websites{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
   
declare function coupland:sites($node as element(sites)) as item()* {
  element sites{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
   
declare function coupland:site($node as element(site)) as item()* {
  element site{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
   
declare function coupland:uri($node as element(uri)) as item()* {
  element uri{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
   
declare function coupland:name($node as element(name)) as item()* {
  element name{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
   
declare function coupland:description($node as element(description)) as item()* {
  element description{
     $node/@*,
     coupland:convert($node/node()) 
     }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The function convert($nodes) contains the typeswitch statement to dispatch the node to one of the tag functions.  Each tag function creates an element of that name, copies the attributes and then recursively calls the convert function passing the child nodes.  The default action defined in the function convert-default merely copies the node.

== Generation Function ==

This function generates the code for an XQuery module which performs an identity transformation.

There are two parameters
* tags - a sequence of tags 
* config - an XML node containing definitions of the module name, module prefix and module namespace.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $gen:cr := &quot;&amp;#13;&quot;;

declare function gen:create-module($tags as xs:string*, $config as element(config) ) as element(module) {
let $modulename := $config/modulename/text()
let $prefix := $config/prefix/text()
let $pre:= concat($modulename,&quot;:&quot;,$prefix)
let $namespace := ($config/namespace,&quot;http://mysite/module&quot;)[1]/text()
return
&lt;module&gt;
module namespace {$modulename} = &quot;{$namespace}&quot;;
(: conversion module generated from a set of tags 

:)
&lt;function&gt;
declare function {$pre}convert($nodes as node()*) as item()* {{ {$gen:cr}
  for $node in $nodes
  return 
     typeswitch ($node)
       {for $tag in $tags
        return 
           &lt;s&gt;case element({$tag}) return {$pre}{replace($tag,&quot;:&quot;,&quot;-&quot;)}($node)
           &lt;/s&gt;
       }
       default return 
         {$pre}convert-default($node)
  }};
&lt;/function&gt;

&lt;function&gt;
declare function {$pre}convert-default($node as node()) as item()* {{ {$gen:cr}
  $node
  }};
&lt;/function&gt;

{for $tag in $tags
 return 
   &lt;function&gt;
declare function {$pre}{replace($tag,&quot;:&quot;,&quot;-&quot;)}($node as element({$tag})) as item()* {{ {$gen:cr}
  element {$tag} {{
     $node/@*,
     {$pre}convert($node/node()) 
     }}{$gen:cr}
}};
   &lt;/function&gt;
}

&lt;/module&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Generating the tags ==

All tags in the document or corpus need to be handled by the identity transformation, so it would be better to generate the list of tags from the document or corpus itself. The following function returns a sequence of tags in alphabetically order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function gen:tags($docs as node()*) as xs:string * {
   for $tag in distinct-values ($docs//*/name(.))
   order by $tag
   return $tag
};
&lt;/source&gt;

and we can modify the calling script:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $doc := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/eXist/transformation/Coupland1.xml&quot;)
let $tags := gen:tags($doc)

let $config :=  
 &lt;config&gt;
   &lt;modulename&gt;coupland&lt;/modulename&gt;
   &lt;namespace&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&lt;/namespace&gt;
 &lt;/config&gt;
return 
  gen:create-module($tags, $config)
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/eXist/transformation/coupidtext2.xq Generate]


== User-defined function template ==

The module generator function generates a fixed code pattern for each tag.  We can allow the user to customize this pattern by using  a callback function to generate the code pattern as an alternative to modifying the generator code itself.

The modified function code has the following modifications:

Function signature ;
  declare function gen:create-module($tags as xs:string*, $callback as function, $config as element(config) ) as element(module) {

generating each tag function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;function&gt;
declare function {$pre}{replace($tag,&quot;:&quot;,&quot;-&quot;)}($node as element({$tag})) as item()* {{ {$gen:cr}
  {util:call($callback,$tag,$pre)}{$gen:cr}
}};
 &lt;/function&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To generate a basic transformation to HTML, with HTML elements being copied while non-HTML elements are converted to div elements with an additional class attribute, we define the function to create the code body, create the function reference and call the convert function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace gen =  &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/gen&quot; at &quot;gen.xqm&quot;;
declare namespace fx = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fx&quot;;

declare variable $fx:html-tags := 
  (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;em&quot;,&quot;q&quot;);

declare function fx:tag-code ($tag as xs:string, $pre as xs:string) {

if ($tag = $x:html-tags)
   then 
&lt;code&gt;
  element {$tag} {{
     $node/@*,
     {$pre}convert($node/node()) 
  }}
&lt;/code&gt;
   else
&lt;code&gt;   
  element div {{
     attribute class {{&quot;{$tag}&quot; }},
     $node/(@* except class),
     {$pre}convert($node/node()) 
  }}
&lt;/code&gt;
};

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/text&quot;;

let $doc := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/eXist/transformation/Coupland1.xml&quot;)
let $tags := gen:tags($doc)
let $callback := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/x&quot;,&quot;fx:tag-code&quot;),2)

let $config :=  
 &lt;config&gt;
   &lt;modulename&gt;coupland&lt;/modulename&gt;
   &lt;namespace&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/coupland&lt;/namespace&gt;
 &lt;/config&gt;
return 
   gen:create-module($tags, $callback,  $config) 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Customising the generator ===
Another customization of the generator which may be required is to add an additional $options parameter to all signatures and calls. This provides a mechanism for passing configuration parameter around the functions to control the transformation.

== Transforming with XSLT ==

When the conversion is complex, requiring restructuring, context-dependent transformations and reordering, it is not clear that the XQuery typeswitch approach is better or worse than the XSLT equivalent.  For comparison here is the equivalent XSLT.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create an architecture that allows a single web-page to quickly display many operational parameters of your system.

== Terminology ==
We will use some of the following terms in this design:

'''Key Performance Indicator''' is an item that you would like to monitor.  If you are running a production database server one of the key performance indicator is &quot;free disk space&quot;.

'''Metric''' a number associated with a KPI.  In the disk space example the metric might be &quot;number of megabytes of free disk space&quot;.

'''Indicator''' is a user interface widget that displays the Metric for a KPI.  Indicators have types such as &quot;needle gauge&quot; or &quot;bullet bar&quot; or &quot;dial&quot;.

'''Ranges''' are numbers that associate a metric with acceptable, warning or error ranges.  For example in the free disk space KPI the acceptable range might be over 30% free, the warning might be 30% to 10% and the error would be under 10% free space.

A '''Portlet''' is a region of a of the screen that contains a specific Indicator.  Portlets conform to a standard such as the JSR-168 standard.

A '''Dashboard''' is a composite of many Portlets that have been configured for a task, role or user.

One of our goals is to allow XQuery to generate portlets for use in other portal software packages such as LifeRay but also use XQuery to generate web pages that include portlets from other systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Reviewer''' is a term used for users who can [[WB:REVIEW|review]] page revisions. If/when you can satisfy the [[#Automatic criteria|criteria]] you should receive the reviewer flag automatically; otherwise you can [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|request the reviewer flag]]. If you could satisfy the reviewer criteria given enough time, please provide a reasonable argument for why you should be given the reviewer flag manually instead when requesting the reviewer flag. [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] are reviewers automatically.  Reviewers are also given the ability to [[WB:ROLL|roll back]] changes in combating vandalism.

== Automatic criteria ==
You should ''automatically'' get reviewer tools when/if you meet the following criteria:

*Have a registered account that is ''at least'' 30 days old, with an email set and confirmed in [[Special:Preferences]].
*Have never been blocked, and have never had the reviewer tools removed (you can [[WB:RFP|request the tools]] if otherwise).
*Have ''at least'' 100 edits since registration (excluding deleted edits), in which:
**50 or more edits are to pages other than discussion pages, including edits to the main space, Cookbook, and Wikijunior.
**50 or more [[WB:ES|edit summaries]] are used.
**10 or more unique pages are edited ''at least'' once.
**8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other (which takes ''at least'' 14 days, if you edit every 2 days).
**5 or more edits are in [[WB:RC|recent changes]] at the time automatic reviewer promotion is checked (this works out to be anytime in the past week).

      <comment>shortened bash scripts by replacing &quot;FOO= ...; export FOO&quot; with the equivalent &quot;export FOO=...&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this article we provide instructions on installing the ATS compiler on your system. At the end, a very simple program is provided to help you test your installation.

== Installing ATS ==

NOTE: these instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Linux, and may need to be changed for other distributions.

On Linux, the first step is to [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats-lang/download download the stable version] of the current ATS compiler,  ATS/Anairiats. The filename should be along the lines of &quot;ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz&quot;, where &quot;x.x.x&quot; stands for version.
Then you can install either into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/atshome/&lt;/code&gt; or into some directory under your home directory.

=== Installing into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/atshome/&lt;/code&gt; ===

Open a terminal and invoke

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo tar xvzf ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz /
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now add this to the environment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
export ATSHOME=/usr/share/atshome
export ATSHOMERELOC=ATS-x.x.x
export PATH=$ATSHOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Installing into home directory ===

If you choose to install in a different directory, say &lt;code&gt;~/FOO&lt;/code&gt;, untar into some temporary directory first:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
tar xvzf ats-lang-anairiats-x.x.x.tar.gz /tmp
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then move &lt;code&gt;/tmp/usr/share/atshome&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;~/FOO&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mv /tmp/usr/share/atshome ~/FOO
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And then add the following to &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
export ATSHOME=~/FOO/atshome
export ATSHOMERELOC=ATS-x.x.x
export PATH=$ATSHOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== The first program ==

For testing, please write the following in your favorite text editor:

&lt;code&gt;
implement main () = print &quot;hello, world!\n&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

and save it into a file named &lt;code&gt;hello.dats&lt;/code&gt;. Then please issue the following command-line:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;atscc -o hello hello.dats&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If everything goes fine, then &lt;code&gt;./hello&lt;/code&gt; is a newly generated executable, which should print the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; and a newline onto the console when executed.

== File name extensions ==

There are two major types of files you'll be interested in:
* the extension &lt;code&gt;.sats&lt;/code&gt; (the first letter comes from &quot;statics&quot;) is for files containing module interface, and
* the extension &lt;code&gt;.dats&lt;/code&gt; (the first letter comes from &quot;dynamics&quot;) is for files containing implementation of interface.

The meaning of &quot;statics&quot; and &quot;dynamics&quot; will be explained later.

| Comparator || [[Image:Op-Amp Comparator.svg|200px]] || Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicate which voltage is larger. 
*&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \left\{\begin{matrix} V_{\text{S+}} &amp; V_1 &gt; V_2 \\ V_{\text{S-}} &amp; V_1 &lt; V_2 \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; is the supply voltage and the opamp is powered by &lt;math&gt;+V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.)
|-
| Inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] || An inverting amplifier uses negative feedback to invert and amplify a voltage. The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; resistor allows some of the output signal to be returned to the input.  Since the output is 180° out of phase, this  amount is effectively subtracted from the input, thereby reducing the input into the operational amplifier.  This reduces the overall gain of the amplifier and is dubbed negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p.342-343.&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_{\text{in}}} V_{\text{in}}\!\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = R_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a virtual ground)
* A third resistor, of value &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} \| R_{\text{in}} \triangleq R_{\text{f}} R_{\text{in}} / (R_{\text{f}} + R_{\text{in}}) &lt;/math&gt;, added between the non-inverting input and ground, while not necessary, minimizes errors due to input bias currents.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, ISBN 0-8053-6917-1, Chapter 5. pp 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gain of the amplifier is determined by the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Non-inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] ||

Amplifies a voltage (multiplies by a constant greater than 1)

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Input impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} \approx \infin&lt;/math&gt; 
** The input impedance is ''at least'' the impedance between non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs, which is typically 1 MΩ to 10 TΩ, plus the impedance of the path from the inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) input to ground (i.e., &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;).
** Because negative feedback ensures that the non-inverting and inverting inputs match, the input impedance is actually '''much higher.'''
* Although this circuit has a large input impedance, it suffers from error of input bias current.
** The non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs draw small leakage currents into the operational amplifier.
** These input currents generate voltages that act like unmodeled input offsets. These unmodeled effects can lead to noise on the output (e.g., offsets or drift).
** Assuming that the two leaking currents are '''matched,''' their effect can be mitigated by ensuring the DC impedance looking '''out''' of each input is the same.
*** The voltage produced by each bias current is equal to the product of the bias current with the equivalent DC impedance looking out of each input. Making those impedances equal makes the offset voltage at each input equal, and so the non-zero bias currents will have no impact on the '''difference''' between the two inputs.
*** A resistor of value
***:&lt;math&gt;R_1 \| R_2 \triangleq \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{ R_1 R_2 }{ R_1 + R_2 },\,&lt;/math&gt;
**:which is the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input will ensure the impedances looking '''out''' of each input will be matched.
*** The matched bias currents will then generate matched offset voltages, and their effect will be hidden to the operational amplifier (which acts on the difference between its inputs) so long as the [[common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]] is good.
** Very often, the input currents are ''not'' matched.
*** Most operational amplifiers provide some method of balancing the two input currents (e.g., by way of an external potentiometer).
*** Alternatively, an external offset can be added to the operational amplifier input to nullify the effect.
*** Another solution is to insert a variable resistor between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input. The resistance can be tuned until the offset voltages at each input are matched.
*** Operational amplifiers with MOSFET-based input stages have input currents that are so small that they often can be neglected.

| Differential amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Differential Amplifier.svg|300px]] || The circuit shown is used for finding the difference of two voltages each multiplied by some constant (determined by the resistors). 

''The name &quot;differential amplifier&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;differentiator&quot;, also shown on this page.''

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ \left( R_{\text{f}} + R_1 \right) R_{\text{g}} }{\left( R_{\text{g}} + R_2 \right) R_1} V_2 - \frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} V_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* Differential &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (between the two input pins) = &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt; (Note: this is approximate)

For common-mode rejection, anything done to one input must be done to the other.  The addition of a compensation capacitor in parallel with Rf, for instance, must be balanced by an equivalent capacitor in parallel with Rg.

''The &quot;instrumentation amplifier&quot; is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high input impedance.''

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} = R_{\text{g}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the differential gain is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A (V_{\text{2}} - V_{\text{1}})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \frac{ R_{\text{f}} }{ R_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; the differential gain is A = 1 and the circuit acts as a differential follower:

|Voltage follower || [[Image:Op-Amp Unity-Gain Buffer.svg|200px]] || Used as a buffer amplifier to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high source impedance to a device with a low input impedance).

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself, 1 MΩ to 1 TΩ)

Due to the strong (i.e., unity gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer data sheet for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.

|Inverting integrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px|]] || [[Integral|Integrates]] the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -\int_0^t \frac{ V_{\text{in}} }{RC} \, \operatorname{d}t + V_{\text{initial}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

* Note that this can also be viewed as a low-pass electronic filter. It is a filter with a single pole at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain.
* There are several potential problems with this circuit.
** It is usually assumed that the input &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has zero DC component (i.e., has a zero average value). Otherwise, unless the capacitor is periodically discharged, the output will drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range.
** Even when &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has no offset, the leakage or bias currents into the operational amplifier inputs can add an unexpected offset voltage to &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; that causes the output to drift. Balancing input currents '''and''' replacing the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) short-circuit to ground with a resistor with resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can reduce the severity of this problem.
** Because this circuit provides no DC feedback (i.e., the capacitor appears like an open circuit to signals with &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the offset of the output may not agree with expectations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; may be out of the designer's control with the present circuit). 
: Many of these problems can be made less severe by adding a ''large'' resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the feedback capacitor. At significantly high frequencies, this resistor will have negligible effect. However, at low frequencies where there are drift and offset problems, the resistor provides the necessary feedback to hold the output steady at the correct value. In effect, this resistor reduces the DC gain of the &quot;integrator&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it goes from infinite to some finite value &lt;math&gt;R_F/R&lt;/math&gt;.

|Inverting differentiator || [[Image:Op-Amp Differentiating Amplifier.svg|300px]] || [[Derivative|Differentiates]] the (inverted) signal over time.

* Note that this can also be viewed as a high-pass electronic filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain. The high pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to unstable behavior when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop.  For this reason the system function would be re-formulated to use integrators.

| Schmitt trigger || A bistable multivibrator implemented as a comparator with hysteresis.[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]] || In this configuration, the input voltage is applied through the resistor &lt;math&gt;{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be the source internal resistance) to the non-inverting input and the inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.

[[File:Op-Amp Inverting Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]

Alternatively, the input source and the [[electrical ground|ground]] may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a configuration is used in the [[#Relaxation_oscillator|relaxation oscillator]] shown below.

|Relaxation oscillator || [[File:Op-Amp Relaxation Oscillator.svg|300px]] || By using an [[RC network]] to add slow [[negative feedback]] to the inverting [[#Schmitt_trigger|Schmitt trigger]], a [[relaxation oscillator]] is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to [[oscillate]] in an endless symmetric [[square wave]] (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an [[astable multivibrator]]).
|-
|Inductance gyrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|300px]] || Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

In general, the components &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].

|Precision rectifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Precision Rectifier.svg|250px|]] || The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across the forward biased diode in the circuit of a passive rectifier is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (''super'') [[diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V. 

The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps.

|Logarithmic output || [[Image:Op-Amp Logarithmic Amplifier.svg|300px]] || * The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{T}} \ln \left( \frac{v_{\text{in}}}{I_{\text{S}} \, R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{in}}}{R} = I_{\text{R}} = I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where  &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt; is the current through the diode. As known, [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|the relationship between the current and the voltage]] for a [[diode]] is:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} = I_{\text{S}} \left( e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}} - 1 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

:This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage is the negative of the voltage across the diode (&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;), the relationship is proven. 

Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:

Phase: A particular appearnce or  state in a regulalry recurring cycle  of changes.

{{AltBookCat}}
A phase should be  used as a problem yet to be discoverd.  With a tool measuring the distance BC we can for example discover that a certain peculiarity a difference in single circuits theory causes the diagram to carry out its function. Such is the case with AB the same process may take place  except a difference in diagram causes a difference in phasing. MAGNETIC coils as mentioned in singularity gives an engineer the means to figure how or where the short might be located. Of course on the basis of general phase the assumed starting point of electricity is found within an oscillation, a point of contact this contact appears different depending on the  schematic drawing. In a mathematical notation you can determine using calculus how much power there is in a closed loop. The only problem is to figure a way when the loop is open in what other method can you use to make that solution possible?</text>

   HIV and AIDS are the number 6 killers in the United State today, people are finding out they have it everyday, people around the world die from it.there is no cure for the disease at this point and time,Half of all new HIV infections in the US occur in people 25 years of age and younger.The &quot;Information STD Center&quot; say that people with HIV have what is called HIV infection. Some of these people will develop AIDS as a result of their HIV infection.The only way to know if you are infected is to be tested for HIV infection. You cannot rely on symptoms to know whether or not you are infected with HIV. Many people who are infected with HIV do not have any symptoms at all for many years. Accoding to www.epigee.org/guide/stds.html HIV is a sexually transmitted diseased,Since the first case of AIDS were identified in 1981, more than 25 million people have died as a results of AIDS in 2008 alone. Awareness and fear have increased, you see advertisment for different types of condoms and television, radio, billboards and even the internet encouraging you to use protection to lower your risk of HIV and AIDS.www.ashastd.org/ says  HIV was first identified among gay males, which led to new forms of negitive attitude about the same sex orientation and raised new fears about interaction with gay or bisexual men.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter of the book deals with the Kamakura Period (鎌倉時代 Kamakura jidai, 1185–1333). This period marks the transition of Japan to it's medieval era, which will last, for nearly 700 years until the Meiji Restoration. This period of Japanese history is marked by the governance of the Kamakura Shogunate, officially established in 1192 in Kamakura by the first shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo, who beating the rival Taira clan at sea, ended the Gempei War and established the Kamakura Shogunate.

The Kamakura period ended in 1333 with the destruction of the shogunate and the short reestablishment of imperial rule under Emperor Go-Daigo by Ashikaga Takauji, Nitta Yoshisada, and Kusunoki Masashige.

==The Shogunate and The Hōjō Regency==
The Kamakura period marks the transition to land-based economies and a concentration of advanced military technologies in the hands of a specialized fighting class. Lords required the loyal services of vassals, who were rewarded with fiefs of their own. The fief holders exercised local military rule. This type of rule is known as feudalism.

Once Minamoto Yoritomo had consolidated his power, he established a new government at his family home in Kamakura. He called his government a bakufu (幕府, tent government), but because he was given the ancient high military title Seii Tai-shōgun by the Emperor, the government is often referred to in Western literature as the shogunate. Yoritomo followed the Fujiwara form of house government and had an administrative board Mandokoro (政所), a board of retainers (Monchūjo), and a board of inquiry (Samurai-dokoro (侍所)). After confiscating estates in central and western Japan, he appointed stewards for the estates and constables for the provinces. As shogun, Yoritomo was both the steward and the constable general. The Kamakura shogunate was not a national regime, however, and although it controlled large tracts of land, there was strong resistance to the stewards. The regime continued warfare against the Northern Fujiwara, but never brought either the north or the west under complete military control. However, The 4th leader of the Northern Fujiwara Fujiwara no Yasuhira was defeated by Yoritomo in 1189, and the 100-year long prosperity of the north disappeared. The old court resided in Kyoto, continuing to hold the land over which it had jurisdiction, while newly organized military families were attracted to Kamakura.

Despite a strong beginning, Yoritomo failed to consolidate the leadership of his family on a lasting basis. Intrafamily contention had long existed within the Minamoto, although Yoritomo had eliminated most serious challengers to his authority. When he died suddenly in 1199, his son Minamoto no Yoriie became shogun and nominal head of the Minamoto, but Yoriie was unable to control the other eastern warrior families. By the early thirteenth century, a regency had been established for the shogun by Hōjō Tokimasa—a member of the Hōjō clan, a branch of the Taira that had allied itself with the Minamoto in 1180. The head of Hōjō was installed as the regent for the shogun is called the Shikken in the period, although later positions were created with similar power such as Tokuso and Rensho. Often the Shikken was also the Tokuso and Rensho. Under the Hōjō, the shogun became a powerless figurehead.

With the protector of the Emperor (shogun) a figurehead himself, strains emerged between Kyoto and Kamakura, and in 1221 the Jōkyū War broke out between the Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba and the second regent Hōjō Yoshitoki. The Hōjō forces easily won the war, and the imperial court was brought under the direct control of the shogunate. The shogun's constables gained greater civil powers, and the court was obliged to seek Kamakura's approval for all of its actions. Although deprived of political power, the court retained extensive estates.

Several significant administrative achievements were made during the Hōjō regency. In 1225 the third regent Hōjō Yasutoki established the Council of State, providing opportunities for other military lords to exercise judicial and legislative authority at Kamakura. The Hōjō regent presided over the council, which was a successful form of collective leadership. The adoption of Japan's first military code of law—the Goseibai Shikimoku—in 1232 reflected the profound transition from court to militarized society. While legal practices in Kyoto were still based on 500-year-old Confucian principles, the new code was a highly legalistic document that stressed the duties of stewards and constables, provided means for settling land disputes, and established rules governing inheritances. It was clear and concise, stipulated punishments for violators of its conditions, and remained in effect for the next 635 years.

As might be expected, the literature of the time reflected the unsettled nature of the period. The Hōjōki describes the turmoil of the period in terms of the Buddhist concepts of impermanence and the vanity of human projects. The Heike monogatari narrated the rise and fall of the Taira, replete with tales of wars and samurai deeds. A second literary mainstream was the continuation of anthologies of poetry in the Shin Kokin Wakashū, of which twenty volumes were produced between 1201 and 1205.

==the Flourishing of Buddhism==
In the time of disunity and violence, deepening pessimism increased the appeal of the search for salvation. The Kamakura period was the age of the great popularization of Buddhism in Japan. Two new sects, Jōdo shū and Zen, dominated the period. The Mount Hiei monasteries had become politically powerful but appealed primarily to those capable of systematic study of the sect's teachings, while the Shingon sect and its esoteric ritual continued to enjoy support largely from the noble families in Kyoto. During this time, a number of monks who had left the Tendai sect founded separate Buddhist sects of their own, including:

*Hōnen, founder of Jōdo shū (Japanese Pure Land Buddhism).
*Shinran, disciple of Hōnen and founder of Jōdo Shinshū sect.
*Ippen, founder of the Ji sect, which emphasized devotion to Amida Buddha through an ecstatic dance.
*Dōgen, founder of the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism.
*Eisai, founder of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism.
*Nichiren, founder of the Nichiren Sect, which emphasized devotion to the Lotus Sutra itself.

The older Buddhist sects such as Shingon, Tendai and the early schools of the Nara period continued to thrive through the Kamakura period, and even experienced some measure of a revival. However, with the increasing popularity of the new Kamakura schools, the older schools partially eclipsed as the newer &quot;Kamakura&quot; schools found followers among the new Kamakura government, and its samurai.

==Mongol Invasions==
The repulsions of two Mongol invasions were momentous events in Japanese history. Japanese relations with China had been terminated in the mid-ninth century after the deterioration of late Tang Dynasty China and the turning inward of the Heian court. Some commercial contacts were maintained with the Southern Song Dynasty of China in later centuries, but Japanese pirates made the open seas dangerous. At a time when the shogunate had little interest in foreign affairs and ignored communications from China and the Goryeo kingdom, news arrived in 1268 of a new Mongol regime in Beijing. Its leader, Kublai Khan, demanded that the Japanese pay tribute to the new Yuan Dynasty and threatened reprisals if they failed to do so. Unused to such threats, Kyoto raised the diplomatic counter of Japan's divine origin, rejected the Mongol demands, dismissed the Korean messengers, and started defensive preparations.

After further unsuccessful entreaties, the first Mongol invasion took place in 1274. More than 600 ships carried a combined Mongol, Chinese, and Korean force of 23,000 troops armed with catapults, combustible missiles, and bows and arrows. In fighting, these soldiers grouped in close cavalry formations against samurai, who were accustomed to one-on-one combat. Local Japanese forces at Hakata, on northern Kyūshū, defended against the superior mainland force, which, after one day of fighting was destroyed by the onslaught of a sudden typhoon. Kublai realized that nature, not military incompetence, had been the cause of his forces' failure so, in 1281, he launched a second invasion. Seven weeks of fighting took place in northwestern Kyūshū before another typhoon struck, again destroying the Mongol fleet.

Although Shinto priests attributed the two defeats of the Mongols to a &quot;divine wind&quot; or kamikaze, a sign of heaven's special protection of Japan, the invasion left a deep impression on the shogunate's leaders. Long-standing fears of the Chinese threat to Japan were reinforced. The Japanese victory, however, gave the warriors a sense of fighting superiority that remained with Japan's soldiers until 1945. The victory also convinced the warriors of the value of the shogunate form of government.

The Mongol war had been a drain on the economy, and new taxes had to be levied to maintain defensive preparations for the future. The invasions also caused disaffection among those who expected recompense for their help in defeating the Mongols. There were no lands or other rewards to be given, however, and such disaffection, combined with overextension and the increasing defense costs, led to a decline of the Kamakura bakufu. Additionally, inheritances had divided family properties, and landowners increasingly had to turn to moneylenders for support. Roving bands of ronin further threatened the stability of the shogunate.

==Civil War and the End of The Kamakura Shogunate==
The Hōjō reacted to the ensuing chaos by trying to place more power among the various great family clans. To further weaken the Kyoto court, the bakufu decided to allow two contending imperial lines—known as the Southern Court or junior line and the Northern Court or senior line—to alternate on the throne. The method worked for several successions until a member of the Southern Court ascended to the throne as Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo wanted to overthrow the shogunate to restore imperial rule, and he openly defied Kamakura by naming his own son his heir. In 1331 the shogunate exiled Go-Daigo, but loyalist forces, including Kusunoki Masashige, rebelled. They were aided by Ashikaga Takauji, a constable who turned against Kamakura when dispatched to put down Go-Daigo's rebellion. At the same time, Nitta Yoshisada, another eastern chieftain, rebelled against the shogunate, which quickly disintegrated, and the Hōjō were defeated. This restoration of the emperor is known as the Kenmu restoration and will be explored in the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Nanboku-chō period (南北朝時代 Nanbokuchō jidai) spanned from 1336 to 1392. It was a period that occurred during the Muromachi Period.

During this period, there existed a Northern Imperial Court, established by Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and a Southern Imperial Court, established by Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino.
Ideologically, the two courts fought for fifty years, with the South giving up to the North in 1392. However, in reality the Northern line was under the power of the Ashikaga shoguns and had little real independence.

Since the 19th century the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Other contributing factors were the Southern Court's control of the Japanese imperial regalia, and Kitabatake Chikafusa's work Jinnō Shōtōki, which legitimized the South's imperial court despite their defeat.

The consequences of events in this period continue to be influential in modern Japan's conventional view of the Tennō Seika (Emperor system). Under the influence of State Shinto, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the Southern Court. After World War II, a series of pretenders, starting with Kumazawa Hiromichi, claimed descent from the Southern Court and challenged the legitimacy of the modern imperial line which is descended from the Northern Court.

The destruction of the Kamakura shogunate of 1333 and the failure of the Kemmu Restoration in 1336 opened up a legitimacy crisis for the new shogunate. Furthermore, institutional changes in the estate system (the shōen) that formed the bedrock of the income of nobles and warriors alike decisively altered the status of the various social groups. What emerged out of the exigencies of the Nanboku-chō (Southern and Northern Court) War was the Muromachi regime, which broadened the economic base of the warriors while undercutting the noble proprietors, a trend that had started already with the Kamakura bakufu.

==The fall of the Kamakura bakufu==
The main conflicts that contributed to the outbreak of the civil war were, in ascending order of importance, the growing conflict between the Hōjō family and other warrior groups in the wake of the Mongol invasions of Japan of 1274 and 1281 and the failure of the Kemmu Restoration, which triggered the struggle between the supporters of the imperial loyalists and supporters of the Ashikaga clan.

Disaffection towards the Hōjō-led Kamakura regime appeared among the warriors towards the end of the thirteenth century. This resentment was caused by the growing influence of the Hōjō over other warrior families within the regime. The Mongol invasions were the main cause behind this centralization of power that took place during the regency of Hōjō Tokimune (AD 1268-1284). During the crisis, three things occurred: Hōjō family appointments to the council of state increased; the Hōjō private family council became the most important decision making body; and direct vassals of the Hōjō were increasingly promoted to shugo posts. They essentially narrowed down their constituents by including only Hōjō family members and direct vassals, at the expense of a broader base of support. When a coalition against the Hōjō emerged in 1331, it took only two years to topple the regime.

Wealth in agrarian societies is tied to land, and medieval Japan was no different. In fact, land was the main reason for much of the discontent among the warrior class. Since the rise of the warriors under the Minamoto, it was expected that victory in battle would be rewarded by land grants given to those who served on the victorious side. However, unlike any war that had been fought until then, the Mongol invasions presented a problem since this war, which was seen by most Japanese as a patriotic duty, did not take place against another warrior family, but against a foreign enemy. After the foreign enemy’s defeat there were no lands to hand out to the victors. This was especially a problem for those warriors who had fought valiantly and petitioned the Hōjō regents for land. Even in the beginning of the fourteenth century this discontent put a tremendous pressure on any regime that emerged. They had to immediately satisfy this group in order to succeed.

The Nanboku-chō War was an ideological struggle between loyalists who wanted the Emperor back in power, and those who believed in creating another warrior regime modeled after Kamakura. It was as if the two previous periods in Japanese history, the Heian and the Kamakura, were clashing on the ideological level. Noble warriors like Kitabatake Chikafusa were pragmatic about the need for warriors to participate in the Restoration on the instrumental level, but on the ideological level a severe divergence between Chikafusa and Takauji polarized the leaders for many years to come. Hammered together during war time, the emergence of the Muromachi regime followed on the heels of the Restoration's failure.


==Vassalage ties and the rise of the Muromachi bakufu==
Serious fighting between the two sides raged on for nearly thirty years before supporters of the new warrior regime gained the upper hand. Ashikaga Takauji relied on three main policies to accomplish the task of assembling power:

:1. The half tax (hanzei) policy of dividing estate lands
:2. Vassalage ties to samurai housemen (gokenin);
:3. The use of shugo lords as bakufu governors and vassals in the provinces (covered below in a separate section).

Both the vassalage ties with the samurai and control over shugo lords were established after the regime had solidified in the 1350s. These two hierarchies were the most important connections in determining the shogun's power. The bureaucratic organs are the most difficult to assess, because the early bureaucracy was altered after the Kannō disturbance (see the section below), and much of these eventually concerned just Kyoto and Yamashiro province.

===The estate (shōen) from Kamakura to Muromachi===
The half tax policy was straight forward: it was a drastic policy of recognizing the legality of samurai incursions on estate lands, but at the same time guaranteed the survival of the estate system.

To examine how the estate system changed we must first look at the Kamakura period. The vassalage ties between the samurai stewards (jito) and the Kamakura regime (AD 1185-1333) were intermediary, because they placed the samurai steward (Jitō) in a position where he was answerable at the same time to both Kamakura and Kyoto. By being chosen as a samurai he was placed in a direct vassalage relationship to the shogun as a member of his house in a fictive kinship tie. As a steward, the samurai became a shogunal houseman (gokenin) and trusted vassal, and given the management of an estate that legally belonged to a noble in Kyoto (Varley 1967:22-5). This is where the intermediary nature of Kamakura vassalage ties lies. As a vassal of the warrior regime in Kamakura he was answerable to the shogun in the form of military service and dues, but as a manager of an estate owned by a noble, he had to pay rent to the latter. We will first examine the nature of the samurai steward as Kamakura vassals, and then examine the vassalage ties that emerged under Ashikaga Takauji.

The stability of the Kamakura system of rule rested upon the regime's guarantee of stewardship rights (jito shiki) to the dominant warriors, and of rent and land ownership rights to the noble proprietor. Through the vassalage ties to samurai stewards, the new warrior regime was grafted onto the older estate system, and in the process bridged the conflicting tendencies that were latent between the upstart warriors and the nobles.

The samurai stewards who had direct vassalage ties to the shogun or the Hōjō regents were also known as housemen (gokenin). The tradition of the Kamakura houseman was a prestigious one, and set the precedent for what followed in the Muromachi period. Yoritomo and the Hōjō Regents were only concerned about controlling their own housemen, consciously limiting themselves to hearing the land dispute cases of their own vassals and rewarding stewardship rights to their followers, letting other disputes from other groups be taken care of by the civil administration. This precedent was followed by the Ashikaga shoguns as they endeavored to protect the interests of their house vassals against the incursions of the shugo lords throughout the Muromachi period.

Not only were shugo given more power as lords of the provinces, but the half tax policy (hanzei) that Takauji used to divide estate lands multiplied the number of fiefs owned outright by samurai warriors. However, Takauji could have gone further if he had followed the advice of his trusted generals, the Kō brothers, who wanted to do away with estates altogether. What emerged was a redrawing of the estate system where warrior interests predominated, but noble interests were still preserved. In helping to preserve the estate system, the half tax measure was a policy that still managed to connect the rights of the noble with those of the warrior.

The half tax policy began as an emergency tax designated for military rations (hyororyosho) collected during war time: half the income from particular temple, shrine and estate lands in the provinces of Mino, Ōmi and Owari would be taken to support armies of the Muromachi regime. Increasingly, this was reinterpreted and changed by Takauji as the permanent acquisition of half the land for the purpose of enforcing vassals . This was a radical departure from previous practice. As was indicated above, during the Kamakura period, most of the lands, particularly in the central and western provinces of Honshū, were owned by the nobles, but managed as stewardships (jito shiki) by Kamakura house vassals, uniting both the interests of the nobles and the interests of the warriors together in the estate institution. With the advent of the half tax measure, Takauji was removing one half of the estate lands from noble control and giving it in fief to his warriors.

===Rise of local samurai (kokujin)===
When the Nanboku-chō conflict broke out, vassalage ties became more serious. The loyalty of vassals became a big issue. During the relatively peaceful Kamakura period, military skills were not placed at a premium, but after the outbreak of civil war this criterion became the most important one (Mass 1989:113-4,117). A new intermediary consideration emerged in the vassalage ties of the post 1336 environment: the need for loyalty and a tighter tie between lord and vassal. The tighter ties between the shogun and his vassals emerged as a result of the need for military action against rivals. Vassalage ties were either established by the Ashikaga or there was a risk of losing a potential warrior to another warrior hierarchy controlled, at best, by emerging shugo lords loyal to the Ashikaga, and at worst by rival imperialist generals. So, in a true sense, vassalage ties during the civil war period were used to bridge potential conflict through the recruitment of warriors.

At the same time that vassalage ties tightened between samurai and shogun, the legitimacy of these ties were sorely tested. This apparent paradox is logically explained by the existence of many claims to samurai loyalty that were presented: towards rival imperialist generals, shugo lords, and even towards local samurai alliances.

A few examples will illustrate the emergence of vassalage ties between the shogun Ashikaga Takauji and his new housemen. The Kobayakawa family became loyal vassals when they were entrusted with defending Ashikaga interests in the province of Aki province after Takauji had retreated to Kyūshū in 1336 (Arnesen 1985:108). Another Aki samurai family, the Mori clan, became vassals of Takauji in 1336, and served under Kō Moroyasu until the outbreak of the Kannō Incident. In the 1350s, the Mori sided with the enemies of Takauji, Tadayoshi and his adopted son Tadafuyu, and not until the 1360s were they back again as vassals of the shogun (Arnesen 1985:114-5). Vassalage ties to the Kawashima clan and other warrior families near Kyoto were established by Takauji in the summer of 1336 in the latter's drive to retake the capital. The Kawashima case is of considerable interest because of a document pertaining to the terms of vassalage bearing Takauji's signature: they would exchange military service for stewardship rights (jito shiki) over half of Kawashima Estate, leaving the other half in possession of the noble proprietor in the form of rent.

===The Kannō Incident and the resurgence of the Southern Court in the 1350’s===
===The events===
Takauji was nominally shogun but, having proved not to be up to the task of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi governed in his stead. The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by an extremely serious episode called the Kannō Incident, an event which takes its name from the Kannō era (1350–1351) during which it took place and which had very serious consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made Kō no Moronao his shitsuji, or deputy. Tadayoshi didn't like Moronao and, every other effort to get rid of him having failed, tried to have him assassinated. His plot was discovered, so Tadayoshi in 1349 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, shave his head and become a Buddhist monk under the name Keishin. In 1350 he rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the supporters of the Southern court, whose Emperor Go-Murakami appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year he captured and executed the Kō brothers at Mikage (Settsu province). The following year his fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief. Tadayoshi fled to Kamakura, but Takauji pursued him there with an army. In March 1352, shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi died suddenly, according to the Taiheiki by poisoning.

===Their background===
The extremely divisive Kannō Incident that divided the Muromachi regime put a temporary hold on integration. Since this incident took place as the result of bureaucratic infighting, it will be necessary to first take a look at the bureaucratic organs, then examine where the conflict emerged.

The bureaucratic organs of the early regime were under the separate jurisdiction of the Ashikaga brothers Takauji and Tadayoshi, creating a bifurcated administration. Takauji was the leader of the house vassals, and thus controlled the Board of Retainers (Samurai Dokoro) and the Office of Rewards (Onshō-kata), while Tadayoshi was the bureaucratic leader controlling the Board of Inquiry control over the judicial functions of the regime (Sato 1977:48; Grossberg 1981:21-24).

The Board of Retainers was used as a disciplinary organ towards house vassals: brigandage and other crimes were prosecuted (Grossberg 1981:88,107). The Office of Rewards was used to hear the claims of and to enfeoff deserving vassals. The Office of Rewards was used to enroll new warriors who were potential adversaries of the regime. The major judicial organ, the Board of Coadjutors, decided on all land dispute cases and quarrels involving inheritance (Grossberg 1981:88). All judicial functions are par excellence used to resolve conflicts and disputes legally, within an institutional framework. Bureaucrats (bugyōnin) for the new regime were recruited from the ranks of those who served the Hōjō regime before its fall (Grossberg 1981:90). They were valuable because they knew how to read and write, a task beyond the reach of most warriors.

In the 1350s, the Kannō Incident and its aftermath divided and nearly destroyed the early regime (Sansom 1961:78-95). On the surface the incident looks like a factional struggle pitting Ashikaga Tadayoshi, Takauji's brother, against the Kō brothers, Moronao and Moroyasu backed by Takauji (Wintersteen 1974:215; Arnesen 1979:53-54). The conflict can be pinpointed to differences in opinion regarding the estate system, and behind these differing opinions, the different bureaucracies that were controlled by Takauji and Tadayoshi. On the whole Takauji was the innovator while Tadayoshi played the conservative, wanting to preserve the policies of the past. In his capacity as a military leader of vassal bands, Takauji did two things that conflicted with Tadayoshi: he appointed vassals to shugo posts as a reward for battlefield heroics, and he divided the shōen estates giving half of it to his vassals in fief or as stewardships. Tadayoshi strenuously contested these policies through the drafting of the Kemmu Formulary that opposed the appointment of shugo as a reward for battlefield service. He also opposed any sort of outright division of estate lands in his capacity as the leader of the Board of Coadjutors (Grossberg 1981:23-4). There was a clear division between the policies of Takauji and his brother Tadayoshi.

Conflict broke out as a result of having two heads of state whose policies contradicted each other. The events which followed the incident testify to the extent to which the regime began to lose its support. Deep divisions between members of the Ashikaga family strengthened the opposition. Both of the pillars of the Muromachi regime, Tadayoshi and Takauji, enacted token submissions to the Southern Court to push their own agendas: Tadayoshi in his desire to destroy the Kō brothers, and Takauji in his desire to defeat Tadayoshi. Ironically, even though the Southern Court was the enemy, it was used as the justification by regime members to attack each other.
===Effects===
One of the main effects of the incident was to reinvigorate the war effort of the Southern Court. To a large extent this renewed offensive was made possible by turncoats from the Muromachi regime. The imperialist offensive of 1352 directed against Takauji in Kamakura was made possible by the vast numbers of former adherents of Tadayoshi who became supporters of the imperialist leader Nitta Yoshimune. The imperialist offensive against Kyoto in 1353 was made possible through the defection of the shugo lord Yamana Tokiuji. Tadayoshi's adopted son Ashikaga Tadafuyu was the outstanding example of defection: he became the leader of the western armies of the Southern Court during the imperialist offensives against Kyoto in 1353 and 1354.

===The Rise of the shugo lords===
To understand the vicissitudes of this age we must now turn to the example of the shogun-shugo lord relationship. The competing loyalties that characterized the Nanboku-chō era were played out on many levels. At once we see the defection of local samurai families like the Mori—not uncommon during the terribly divisive Kannō Incident; and at a higher level, shugo lords continued to act in a dangerously independent manner until the latter half of the fourteenth century.

The Ashikaga shogun Takauji appointed branch family members as shugo lords in the different provinces of western and central Japan. The shugo acted as governors, and served the function of mediating between the regime center and periphery. As local governors, and lords in their own right, they represented the authority of the regime in the provinces. They came to hold much greater authority than the samurai houseman by virtue of having a province-wide appointment, not limited to single estates. Here we will look at their ties to the Ashikaga shogun during the early Muromachi period.

The success of shugo appointments lie not in the direction of kinship ties, but with how well they were tied to the regime through other factors. Warrior families since the Kamakura period were characterized by the use of headship rights (soryo) where leadership over branch families was accorded to the leader of the main family. However, headship rights were extremely unstable because branch families often asserted their own independence, particularly as new generations emerged to dilute the ties of kinship (Mass 1989:119).

The exigencies of the day called for the successful use of military skills by those who were appointed to shugo posts. As in vassalage ties between the Ashikaga shoguns and the local samurai, the tie between the shoguns and the shugo lords was intermediary in a similar sense: in the world of competing loyalties, the Ashikaga shoguns by appointing warriors to shugo posts endeavored to tie these men closer to themselves. The successful generals, who were at the same time branch family heads who had cast in their lot with Takauji's rebellion, were the ones often rewarded with the post (Grossberg 1981:23). The cost of not tying them to the regime was to lose their support, and to encourage their independence from the regime.

Ashikaga branch families appointed to shugo posts included the Hosokawa, Yamana, Imagawa, Hatakeyama, Niki, Kira, Shiba, Ishido, and the Isshiki families (Papinot 1972:27). In particular provinces, the Ashikaga failed to displace the original shugo families: the Sasaki, Togashi, Takeda and the Ogasawara in the central provinces, and the Shimazu, Otomo and Shoni in Kyūshū (Arnesen 1979:60). In the central and western provinces roughly half were new appointees. During the Kannō Incident, Ashikaga headship (soryo) ties to the new appointees did not prevent these shugo from outright rebellion towards the regime at all. In fact, the coercive institutions of the regime were woefully lacking in this time period vis-a-vis the shugo lords.

What prevented the shugo lords from simply doing whatever they pleased was the tenuous link of appointment, particularly new appointees who had emerged with Takauji—they had a vested interest in maintaining their links to the regime, insofar as they had not yet built up their power in the provinces. Those provincial families who had accumulated power throughout the Kamakura period, like the Ouchi of Suo and Nagato provinces and the Shimazu of Satsuma province, were lords in their own right, and were, thus, less dependent on the regime and on their shugo titles.

After 1372, shugo lords were given the responsibility to collect taxes (tansen) for the Muromachi regime. These taxes hit every category of landowner from the nobles to the samurai. As middlemen, the shugo profited by inflating the amount of taxes required from each individual landowner (Grossberg 1981:75). By this date, they had become unassailable as governors and hence were given the added responsibility of overseeing a new regime centered tax.

===Shugo usurpation of civil functions and shugo uke===
What comes into focus is the gradual but steady usurpation of the office of civil governor by the shugo lord, and his use of this position to effect feudal ties. The shugo was able to make his provincial power effective, not through his traditional administrative capacity like the earlier governors, but through the intermediary ties of vassalage with the samurai who had taken over the estate lands during the Nanboku-chō War, and with the samurai residing on public lands (kokugaryo). The shugo lords were both governors, having certain legitimate duties given to them by the Muromachi regime, and feudal lords attempting to enfoeff vassals.

The Nanboku-chō War was merciless to the nobles whose lands were taken outright by previous samurai stewards and converted into private holdings (chigyo) illegally. This revolutionary development was the harbinger for the total liquidation of the estate system that took place later. The shugo lords also participated in this wholescale land grab by accumulating former estates under their control by enfoeffing samurai on them (Nagahara 1982:12). Ironically, this lawless situation created by samurai encroachments on land, at the height of the war, caused security problems for all landed interests from petty samurai to the kokujin, and provided further impetus among local samurai to seek intermediary ties to the shugo lords in the form of vassalage. By tying themselves to the shugo, they were able to ally themselves to the one person in the province who could provide some form of local security.

Vassalage ties between the shugo lord and kokujin often took place on the estates in a three way intermediary tie called the shugo contract (shugo-uke): a noble proprietor would give the responsibility of managing his estate to the shugo in exchange for a guaranteed year end (nengu) income delivered to the proprietor residing in the capital. The shugo lord then enfoeffed vassal samurai (hikan) on those estates as managers (Miyagawa 1977:92; Nagahara 1982:14). Supposedly, shugo contracts tied the interests of the shugo lord, the samurai kokujin and the noble together, but were not based on equality of interests. They were truly instruments of shugo encroachment on the estates. There is no doubt as to the intermediary nature of the contract, because it connected the interests of three groups of people, but it was most favorable to the shugo lord who used this instrument to expand his ties of vassalage with the local samurai (kokujin), and at the same time to expand his land base at the expense of the nobles.
Shugo contracts (shugo-uke) emerged in the 1340s and gradually became widespread (Wintersteen 1974:211). By looking at how this contract operated, it is apparent to what extent the estate system (shōen) was taken over by the warriors, and had become a skeleton of its previous life. Shugo lords gave the management of the estate to samurai in exchange for military service, but the noble stripped of all powers on the estate, was reduced to waiting for his portion of year end (nengu) income in Kyoto where he lived. The noble hired tax overseers (nengu daikan) to guarantee his own portion of the income, but had to pay an exorbitant amount to hire him. Noble income already reduced by the kokujin and the shugo lord, was further reduced once the tax overseer took his half. This reduction in noble income was the result of gradual non-payment on the part of both shugo and samurai; as a last measure, the nobles hired moneylenders (doso) and bureaucrats (bugyōnin) as a way to put pressure on the warriors. But even this remedy produced spotty results since the hired hands had to negotiate with the warriors (Nagahara 1982:16).

===Shugo and public lands (kokugaryo)===
A largely missing picture until recently, was the fate of public lands (kokugaryo) during the Muromachi period, and the role of the shugo lords in their encroachment on them. Public lands (kokugaryo) during the Heian period were distinguished from private lands of the estates (shōen), because the latter were immune from state taxation. Before the rise of private estates, the only kind of lands were public lands maintained under the old civil administration. With the rise of private estates called shōen, during the Heian period, public lands by no means disappeared: in details, the public lands differed very little from private estates. Both were owned by absentee proprietors. They differed only in terms of administration: private estates were directly managed by noble officials, whereas, public lands were managed by the civil governors (kokuga or kokushi) on behalf of the former (Arnesen 1979:94).
By the Kamakura period, public lands were owned by different landowners as private holdings (chigyo). These landowners included noble houses, religious establishments and warriors. Whole areas of the Kantō and the northeast were held by warriors not in the capacity as estate managers, but as private holdings (Nagahara 1982:15): Kantō provinces were granted to the Kamakura regime as private lands (chigyokoku). The Ashikaga regime inherited these lands, and decided, fatefully, to place shugo lords over them (Arnesen 1979:94).

One of the main functions of the civil governor's office (kokushi) was the oversight of criminal justice in the provinces, and the maintenance of the private holdings within the public lands (kokugaryo), but his function began to change with the advent of the Kamakura regime (Hall 1966:202-03). With the appointment of shugo constables by Kamakura, all criminal jurisdiction within the provinces passed into his hands. But the civil governor (kokushi) remained as the key officer in the civil administration (ritsuryo), who made sure that rent from private holdings reached the absentee nobles and religious establishments (jisha honjo) in Kyoto and in Yamashiro province. His oversight did not include the private holdings of warriors, most usually concentrated in the Kantō and further north.

With the outbreak of the Nanboku-chō War, the civil administration (ritsuryo) began to break down rapidly, and shugo lords, who had a minor role in provincial governance during the Kamakura period, emerged to usurp the civil governor's functions. This did not happen immediately in every province, but occurred without interruption until the shugo lords had become true governors over public lands (kokugaryo). As they took over the oversight of private holdings within public lands, they established ties to many kinds of landowners: nobles, samurai of various kinds (kokujin, jizamurai), and to religious establishments. They enfoeffed their own followers on these lands, and reconfirmed the lands of existing samurai in exchange for military service, and established shugo contracts with the nobles with predictable results (Nagahara 1982:15). Along with vassalage ties to local samurai (kokujin) on the estates, vassalage ties on public lands became a key resource that augmented the power of the shugo lords.

Furthermore, in 1346, ten years after the emergence of the Muromachi regime, the shogun decentralized authority by giving the shugo the right to judge cases of crop stealing on the estates, and to make temporary assignments of land to deserving vassals taken from the imperialist forces (Arnesen 1979:65). This was significant, insofar as traditional areas of Kamakura jurisdiction were &quot;given up&quot; by the Muromachi regime. Previously, all cases of crop stealing or land assignments were strictly under Kamakura administration. Also, about this time, the imperialist forces were suffering their worst defeats, opening up enemy land for confiscation and reassignment. By giving these new jurisdictions to the shugo lords, it further augmented their position as governors over their assigned provinces.

===Legitimation and limits to power===
In this dual capacity, the shugo lords had to compete with other landed samurai in the provinces for land they administered as governors, but did not personally own. Like the noble proprietors, a single shugo lord owned lands in widely dispersed areas in several provinces. His power was not built upon personal ownership of land like the territorial lords (daimyo) of the sixteenth century, but upon the loyalties of the local samurai through ties of vassalage (Miyagawa 1977:91-93). There was much greater coercive potential exercised by the territorial lords of the sixteenth century, because their ties of vassalage were based on their ownership of the lands around them: as owners they could dispense with the land as they saw fit, getting rid of recalcitrant vassals without much ado. In the fourteenth century, the shugo lords could not claim province wide ownership of territory: first, the concept of personal provincial ownership was as yet undeveloped; second, they never amassed large amounts of personal property, relying rather on using the traditional framework of estate lands and public lands to enfoeff their vassals. This is the central enigma of the fourteenth century: the fragmentation and dissolution of the estate system, and the disappearance of the civil administration coincided with the proliferation of private lands, but the external framework of the estate system (shōen) and the public lands system (kokugaryo), though devoid of content, still remained (Kierstead 1985:311-14). Given the fragmentation, it was the intermediary ties of shugo vassalage, and the shugo role as provincial governor, that helped to integrate the disparate forces to some degree.

It becomes a wonder how the estate system survived at all given the depredations it suffered at the hands of the warriors. There were two reasons why it survived in the attenuated form described above: one, was the existence of the Muromachi regime that consistently upheld the estate system in the face of warrior incursions (Nagahara 1982:16). As described in section two, Ashikaga Takauji tried to make sure that the limits set on the warriors by the half tax measure was not exceeded, but he failed to circumvent arrangements like the shugo contract that really denuded the noble of his estate and its income. The half tax measure itself did not protect the noble from the outright takeover of the estate at the hands of the samurai, even if the latter were required to hand over a portion to fulfill the half tax law. In the end, it was the Muromachi administration that made sure that the samurai paid their portion of income to the nobles.

The other reason behind the survival of the estate system was connected to the legitimacy of the noble class. The rise of the warriors was not popular among the farmers living on the estates. The more gentle hand of the nobles was also the hand the people came to respect. To prevent outright disobedience and rebellion among the populace was one reason why both shugo lords and kokujin came to respect the outward form of the estate structure. To make their rulership legitimate in the eyes of the farmers, the warriors worked within the framework of the estate structure, even though this structure had been totally altered (Nagahara 1982:16-7). A case can be made that the estate system, outside of Yamashiro province, had become eroded to such an extent that the nobles had little if any influence left in the provinces.

==Consolidation of Ashikaga power: 1360-1370==

In 1358 after the death of Takauji, the shogunate passed into the hands of his son Yoshiakira. Under his leadership, and that of the kanrei Hosokawa Yoriyuki's, the regime succeeded in integrating the shugo lords in the 1360s and '70's: shugo branch families of the Ashikaga were employed within the government bureaucracy. I will cover the following points: 1) the emergence of the kanrei council system, and the Board of Retainers as intermediary instruments that tied shugo lords more firmly to the regime; 2) the emergence of a coercive instrument in the form of shogunal hegemony that was used to discipline errant shugo lords, and the final defeat of Southern Court forces; 3) the use of the court ranking system as an intermediary instrument that tied the regime to the imperial court, and in connection to this the hanzei half-tax decree of 1368 and its effect; and 4) the limitations to Muromachi authority in the Kyūshū and Kantō regions.

It was left to the shogun Yoshiakira to heal the wounds of the Kannō Incident by reorganizing the regime. In 1362 he established the most important intermediary institution that connected the shugo lords to the regime: the kanrei council system. This system was made up of two components, the kanrei office and the senior vassal council (jushin kaigi) over which the kanrei presided. The kanrei council system involved the most powerful shugo families as participants in directly governing central and western Japan. Along with the shogun, the kanrei council emerged to form the heart of the Muromachi regime to such an extent that historians have come to characterize this regime as the bakufu-shugo system (Tanuma 1976:12; Harrington 1985:67).

===The kanrei council and the reorganization of institutions===
The kanrei council system was intermediary, because it tied together the military side of the regime with the bureaucratic. The very conflict that emerged with the Kannō Incident had to do with the separation and clash between the military vassal institutions controlled by Takauji and the bureaucratic-judicial institutions controlled by Tadayoshi. With the emergence of the kanrei council system, the shugo lords who represented the military side of the administration were tied firmly to the bureaucracy, as important players in the creation of policy.

The kanrei office itself is a good example of mediation by tying together the interests of the shugo lords with those of the shogun. The job of the kanrei was to act as a spokesman between the Senior Vassal Council (jushin kaigi) and the shogun, mediating between the two (Kawai 1977:70). The kanrei also had the responsibility of looking over the bureaucratic elements of the regime on a daily basis, consulting and transmitting shogunal orders to the council and to the bureaucracy. The kanrei was consistently selected from a hereditary group of three shugo families related to Takauji within four generations (Papinot 1972:27): the Hosokawa, the Hatakeyama and the Shiba. The three families took turns in filling the post. They were the highest ranking shugo families in the regime, and the post of kanrei helped to tie their interests in support of it.

The other component of the kanrei council system was the Senior Vassal Council (jushin kaigi). The kanrei presided over the meetings of the council, relayed the decisions reached by the council to the shogun, and transmitted orders from the shogun to the council. In this system, regime policy was formulated in consultations between the council and the shogun, though final decisions were made by the latter (Kawai 1977:70-71; Sato 1977:48). In the beginning, the council was composed of the heads of the three shugo families from whom the kanrei was regularly selected along with four other heads of powerful shugo families: the Yamana, the Isshiki, the Akamatsu and the Kyogoku (Varley 1967:27-9). The latter two families were unrelated to the Ashikaga family. This trend of including unrelated shugo families into the council continued with the recruitment of the Ouchi, the Sasaki and the Toki families in the next few decades. This trend indicates that powerful shugo families, irrespective of kinship, were tied to the regime through the intermediary nature of the Senior Vassal Council: conflict and potential conflict of interests between shugo lords and the shogun was institutionalized by letting the shugo lords voice their opinions in discussions within the council.
The Board of Retainers (samuraidokoro) was also headed by a Senior Vassal Council member selected in the fourteenth century from among the Imagawa (who became a council member a little later), the Hosokawa, the Hatakeyama, the Shiba, and the Toki. The Board of Retainers had the responsibility over police functions and the execution of criminal justice in the capital of Kyoto (Grossberg 1981:88,107). The office holder automatically became the shugo over Yamashiro province, the wealthiest and most densely populated in Japan, and had the responsibility of protecting the regime headquarters and the city of Kyoto (Varley 1967:57). By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the head of the Board of Retainers was chosen from among four shugo families: the Yamana, the Akamatsu, the Kyogoku, and the Isshiki. The Board of Retainers did what the kanrei council system did: it connected the interests of the shugo lords to that of the regime, and thereby mediated potential conflicts between them. It was intermediary insofar as the sources of potential conflict to the regime, the shugo lords, became participants in an institution of the regime.

Shugo participation in the Senior Vassal Council and in the Board of Retainers were two of the more prominent examples of their participation within the remodeled regime. The importance of this participation cannot be overestimated: it was through the use of these intermediary instruments whereby the Ashikaga shoguns were able to centralize the state under their direction.
As we shall see time and again, kinship in the form of headship ties (soryo), looms large as a recruiting mechanism at all levels of Muromachi society: here too, the shugo lords of the highest standing were mostly branch families of the Ashikaga. However, these kinship ties did little in the way of mediating between the semi-independent shugo lords and the regime. It was rather the effective participation of the shugo lords in governing through the kanrei council system which bound their interests more firmly than before to the regime.

===Ashikaga and the use of shugo coalitions===
In 1362, the two most powerful shugo houses in the country, the Ouchi and the Yamana, submitted themselves to the Ashikaga regime on condition that the shogun would not interfere with the internal affairs of their respective provinces (Grossberg 1981:25). Subsequently, the Yamana, who were related to the Ashikaga, and the Ouchi, who were not related, began to play an increasingly important role in government affairs. However, within a few decades, both shugo houses became powerful enough to incur the wrath of the shogun.

In 1366, the first kanrei office holder's father, Shiba Takatsune who held real power over his thirteen year old son, and who engineered the placement of Shiba family members in key government offices was declared a traitor, because of his growing power and arrogance (he felt demeaned by accepting the kanrei post, so he had his son appointed instead). In the first show of force against an important shugo family, Yoshiakira ordered the Yamana, Sasaki, Yoshimi and the Toki shugo lords to attack the Shiba in the province of Echizen. The Shiba were defeated, and their territory in Echizen was redistributed (Grossberg 1981:92). In 1367, following the ouster of the Shiba family, Hosokawa Yoriyuki was named as the successor to the post of kanrei: after the shogun Yoshiakira's death, Yoriyuki managed during the minority of the young shogun Yoshimitsu to place the regime on a firmer foundation.
The use of shugo lords to attack one of their own colleagues in the 1366, points to the growing authority of the shogun vis-a-vis the shugo lords, and the emergence of an effective instrument of coercion that would grow with age. Up till now, we have seen the virtual non-existence of true disciplinary mechanisms that the shogun could use against his shugo lords. In conjunction with the new intermediary instruments that emerged between the shogun and the shugo lords, the new coercive instrument of pitting one shugo lord against another, through shogun-shugo coalitions, strengthened the shogun's hand.

In 1362, the last Southern Court offensive against Kyoto forced the Ashikaga to withdraw from the capital, but like many previous attempts, the imperialists had to eventually retreat in the face of a large counterattack without having accomplished anything (Sansom 1961:108). The exuberance that existed during the 1350s among the imperialist armies had faded. Resistance after this date became sporadic and completely defensive. Finally, in 1369, a year after the death of Emperor Go-Murakami, the stalwart imperialist general Kusunoki Masanori submitted himself to the regime. His capitulation ended the imperialist threat to the central provinces (Sansom 1961:108).

===Seeking legitimation from the court===
In 1370 Imagawa Sadayo (Ryoshun) was appointed by the kanrei Yoriyuki and the Senior Vassal Council to bring down the last bastion of Southern Court resistance in Kyūshū. After a grueling twelve year campaign, imperialist resistance collapsed with the defeat of the Kikuchi family in 1381; and with the death of Shimazu Ujihisa in 1385, the last Kyūshū provincial domain declared its allegiance to the regime (Sansom 1961:112). With the fall of Kyūshū the whole of western Japan came under the rule and influence of the Ashikaga regime. However, campaigns alone were inadequate to legitimize Ashikaga rule over the nobles.
After 1367, during the minority of the shogun Yoshimitsu, the kanrei Hosokawa Yoriyuki became active in trying to legitimize the regime in the eyes of the nobles. He did this through a series of extremely conservative measures, gaining prestige among the nobles in Kyoto. He used an ancient court ranking system by having the young shogun participate in it (Grossberg 1981:26). He also associated the regime with the court much more closely than had any other past warrior leader. By doing this, he tied the regime closer to the imperial court, thereby erasing the stigma of the ideology that fueled the Nanboku-chō conflict: Ashikaga Takauji was seen as a traitor fighting against the restoration of imperial power.

The court society survived such a long time because of its popularity among the different classes in Japanese society. On the estate level, farmers felt much closer to the nobles than towards the warriors. The waning power of the nobles notwithstanding, their influence went far beyond their actual power, because they possessed a legitimacy of tradition and the charisma of culture that the warriors did not possess. It is no wonder that Yoriyuki had the young shogun participate in court ceremonies: this participation was intermediary, involving the highest military leader in a court ranking system that dated back several centuries, and had as its premise the primacy of the imperial line over everyone, including the warriors, who had to receive titles from the emperor. By participating in this court ranking ritual, the Ashikaga regime was sending a strong message to the entire society: that the legitimacy conferred by the court was still valid and still important (Grossberg 1981:20). This participation bridged the tensions between the warrior regime and the court, and had the unintended effect of disseminating court culture among the warrior class, creating a fusion of taste that has forever marked this period of Japanese culture as one of brilliant innovation.
In a way this participation was an anachronism that seemed removed from the real world where power was directly exercised by warriors. However, the question of legitimacy is not necessarily tied to the direct exercise of power. Legitimacy is tied to ideology, and the ideological basis for aristocratic noble rule had a better basis than the rule of warriors. Force alone cannot make legitimacy, and the cultural milieu that surrounded the court was still much more persuasive, much more elegant than the samurai sword. The warriors themselves were attracted to the culture of the nobles, and enthusiastically emulated the latter's tastes until they were able to produce a synthesis that went beyond what had existed earlier such as the rise of rock gardens influenced by Zen among other art forms that has had a lasting impact to this day. And for these reasons alone, the connection effected between the shogun and the imperial court during the last few decades of the fourteenth century, had the effect of broadening the legitimacy of the shogun's power.

The kanrei Yoriyuki promulgated the last half-tax decree (hanzei) in 1368. This decree was a comprehensive and decisive intermediary instrument that was used to tie noble interests to the regime: it outlawed the halving of lands owned by the imperial family, those lands under the control of major temples, and those that were owned by the imperial regents (the Fujiwara). Exceptions also included noble lands that were given full title by the previous shogun (perhaps Yoshiakira ?), and estates managed by the samurai stewards (jito) (Wintersteen 1974:219-20). This decree was applicable to all estates nationwide, and its real importance was the strong language used to deter further samurai incursions onto the estates, and to defend the interests of the nobles in the face of the samurai incursions that had already taken place. Unlike the earlier half-tax decrees, this one was conservative, and its aim was to protect noble lands from division rather than to justify it.

With the 1368 half-tax decree, the regime had come a long ways from the 1352 decree, but the realities of samurai incursions that had already taken place could not be reversed. Here, what was ideologically stated openly departed from what was actually taking place in the provinces. As we saw above, the incursions of the samurai and the shugo lords on the estates were severe despite the 1368 decree. And with the fifteenth century, this trend of land grabbing became ever more pronounced. I must conclude that the 1368 decree was, on the whole, ineffective in stopping the warriors from taking control over the estates and their income, given the evidence of continued warrior takeovers. In a sense, the 1368 decree was an ideological document that attempted to legitimize the Ashikaga regime in the eyes of the nobles, following from the closer connections that were established between the shogun and the imperial court. Furthermore, the Ashikaga shoguns were not able, even if they had the desire, to stop the continued incursions of warriors on the income of the estates. However ineffective, the 1368 decree recognized noble interests were defended ideologically by a warrior regime, and in the process tied together the interests of both.

Finally, the direct rule of the Muromachi regime that emerged in the 1360s was limited geographically to the western and central provinces in contrast to the previous Kamakura regime based in the Kantō. Outside shugo lords (tozama) unrelated to the Ashikaga like the Takeda, Chiba, Yuki, Satake, Oyama, Utsunomiya, Shoni, Otomo, Aso, and the Shimazu families, all of whom were concentrated in or near the Kantō and Kyūshū regions did not participate in the kanrei council system, and were semi-independent of the regime (Varley 1967:29; Hall 1966:199). They were tacitly recognized and given shugo titles by the Ashikaga, because of their predominant positions in areas that were not easily controlled from Kyoto (Harrington 1985:67).

===Kyūshū===
After the Kyūshū campaign that began in 1370, the Kyūshū deputy (tandai) became the representative of the Muromachi regime on that island. Imagawa Sadayo (Ryoshun) effectively prosecuted the campaign against the Southern Court forces, and continued to press his attack against the forces of Shimazu Ujihisa, garnering support from local Kyūshū kokujin in the process (Harrington 1985:85-6). Deputies like Sadayo were Muromachi representatives in the areas they controlled, even when they arrogated the full powers of vassalage to local samurai . For example in 1377, a contract was signed between Sadayo and a samurai alliance (ikki) consisting of sixty-one local samurai. The contract stipulated that all disputes between alliance members would be taken to the Kyūshū deputy, while disputes between alliance members and the deputy himself would be taken to the Muromachi regime in Kyoto (Harrington 1985:87). The Kyūshū deputy was an intermediary figure who united the interests of the regime and the interests of the local area under his jurisdiction together. It was a precarious position because of the temptation to independence it presented. But for whatever reason, the Muromachi regime did not extend their direct control over the whole nation, and so came to rely on appointees like the Kyūshū deputy to act as their representatives to influence the shugo lords and samurai of the region through coercive and intermediary instruments.

===The Kantō===
In the late fourteenth century, the Kantō region was dominated by powerful warrior families. Of these, the Uesugi were the most powerful. They were able to take advantage of the fighting that erupted between families in the region to advance their own interests. In 1368, the Utsunomiya family revolted against the Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime, because they had lost their shugo posts to the Uesugi. The Uesugi family was able to extend their influence by amassing shugo posts under their jurisdiction, and by enfoeffing vassals in the Kantō region at the expense of other families (Harrington 1985:82-3). One could advance a theory that the Kantō region had become semi-independent from Kyoto, and that the Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime existed because of Uesugi support. The Uesugi family was legally recognized by the Muromachi regime by their appointment to the Kantō kanrei post because of their unassailable position.

The Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime acted in much the same way as the Kyūshū deputy (tandai): it became the regional intermediary office through which regime orders were transmitted to the outlying Kantō region. In practice as seen above, the Kantō was dominated by powerful families like the Uesugi. Increasingly, the Kamakura headquarters became independent from the Muromachi regime, and for all essential purposes took care of regional disputes, regional taxation, and developed ties with shugo lords in the Kantō with minimal reference to the Muromachi government in Kyoto—even though the right to confirm fiefs and the right to ratify shugo appointments technically remained in the hands of Kyoto (Harrington 1985:83-5).

===Centralization of Ashikaga power and the end of the Nanboku-chō War: 1379-1399===
One area of resistance after another fell to the Muromachi regime during the crucial decade of the 1360s: tellingly, powerful shugo lords like the Ouchi and the Yamana submitted themselves as semi-independent lords; Southern Court resistance became more futile as time passed. Militarily the regime was able to call upon the services of the shugo lords to attack one of their own colleagues in 1366, pointing to the increasing subordination of the shugo to shogunal control. Hand in hand with the creation of the kanrei council system and the increasing participation of the powerful shugo families in the bakufu bureaucracy, ties to the imperial court broadened the legitimate base of the regime. These key developments were used not only to increase shogunal control, but to bind the interests of the shugo lords and nobles more closely to the regime.[18] However, geographically, the Muromachi regime was limited in scope, delegating its jurisdiction of the Kantō and Kyūshū areas to regional representatives, holding more or less direct control over the central and western provinces of Honshū.

For fifty years after Yoshimitsu's assumption of authority in 1379, the Muromachi regime entered its most powerful phase as the unrivaled government of the country. The connection between the shogun and the shugo lords tightened as shogunal control increased. The main instruments and their effects that enabled the shogun to exercise control over the shugo lords, and to broaden the base of the legitimacy of the regime involved: 1) a continuation of close ties between the Muromachi regime and the imperial court; 2) the compulsory residential policy aimed at the shugo lords; 3) further development of the shogunal army (gobanshu); 4) the rise of shogunal hegemony using the coalition of several shugo lords; and 5) the use of commercial and agrarian revenue and taxes by the regime. All of these changes exemplify the continuing trend of centripetal forces that augmented the power of the regime.
The Ashikaga and the Imperial Court

Under Yoshimitsu (active 1379-1408) who took the reins of power after the dismissal of Yoriyuki as kanrei, the effects of this particular connection encouraged one of the most brilliant periods in Japanese history, renowned for the maturation of architectural and cultural forms that have since characterized Japanese culture. His close association with the imperial court and its culture, and his patronage of the new arts helped to disseminate this culture to the military aristocracy, particularly through the shugo lords (Grossberg 1981:31-32; Kawai 1977:72). This connection between the shogun and the imperial court brought added prestige to both institutions, and gave the shogun an aura of civil legitimacy and culture that the previous Kamakura regime had lacked.

By participating in court institutions, the shogun also adopted much of the refined pastimes of court culture. Cultural pursuits came as a result of a prior institutional connection. Culture has more in common with ideological justifications: as we saw in the previous section, much of court culture enjoyed a legitimacy denied to the warriors.

===Monopoly of force: compulsory residence===
Moving to the shogun-shugo relationship, in the 1380s the kanrei council system was strengthened by Yoshimitsu when he persuaded the western and central shugo lords to take up residence in Kyoto. He even went to visit Ouchi Yoshihiro in 1389, and persuaded him to live in Kyoto during one of his so-called pilgrimage circuits. These circuits were used to display his power through the provinces in which he traveled (Grossberg 1981:29-30). This compulsory residential policy that Yoshimitsu instituted was the main coercive policy that aided the kanrei council system, and enabled the shogun to tighten his grip around the shugo lords. Permission to leave the capital city was rarely granted to the shugo lord: it was only granted after discussion in the Senior Vassal Council. Even when permission was granted in the case of provincial rebellion or Southern Court guerilla activity, suitable hostages were left behind in Kyoto. If the shugo lord left without permission, it was seen as tantamount to treason (Kawai 1977:68-9; Tanuma 1976:13).

The Kantō and Kyūshū shugo were exempt from this order of compulsory residence in Kyoto. However, the Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime instituted a similar policy in regards to the Kantō shugo lords, and made them establish mansions in Kamakura just as the western and central shugo lords made mansions in Kyoto (Kawai 1977:68). Mansion building in Kyoto became fashionable, and eventually included shugo lords like the Shimazu of Kyūshū, who decided to live in Kyoto even though he was not required to do so.
The shugo lords really had little choice in the matter. They either resided in Kyoto or were branded as traitors of the regime. Along with institutions like the kanrei council system, the compulsory residential policy had incalculable effects both from a national standpoint, and from a provincial standpoint. For starters, the power of the shugo lords was severely restricted by this policy: their freedom of movement was circumvented. Second, as time passed into the second quarter of the fifteenth century, real power in the provinces moved away from the shugo lords and came to rest upon the deputy shugo (shugo-dai), and upon other independent samurai (kokujin) who resided in the provinces. Therefore, from the standpoint of shugo lords the compulsory residential policy proved to be a long term disaster (Kawai 1977:73). The hiring of deputy shugo was necessitated by the compulsory residential policy if the shugo lords were to maintain their power in the provinces. In the short term, hiring branch family members and samurai kokujin as deputy shugo, and using them as their own representatives in the provinces worked well; but in the long term, power passed from the hands of the shugo lords into the hands of those they hired.

===The Shogunal Army===
Yoshimitsu did not hesitate to use military force to reduce the shugo lords to obedience on the pretext that they had become too powerful. He assembled a new shogunal army (gobanshu) made up of five divisions totalling some three thousand warriors dependent on him (Grossberg 1981:106-7). This force was a formidable array, particularly when they were augmented by contributions from other shugo lords. The importance of the shogunal army goes beyond quantity, but strikes more at what this force represented: a separate force connecting the shogun directly with his own vassals made up of kokujin samurai. The shogunal army served as a check on shugo forces. As we saw in section two, the first Ashikaga shogun, Takauji, had created ties with samurai stewards by enfeoffing them on estate lands. Throughout the early Muromachi period, this separate vassal hierarchy under the command of the shogun was an important check on shugo power. We will see how this earlier army differed from the shogunal army of Yoshimitsu.

The shogunal army had two components: the shogunal bodyguard (shin'eigun) consisted of Ashikaga branch family members, shugo relatives and shugo branch family members, other sons and brothers of regime officials, and most importantly, powerful kokujin. Numbering (at most) three hundred and fifty men, this group was a cohesive and loyal body, ready to defend the shogun's person at any cost (Arnesen 1985:102). Surrounding this small band was a number of direct vassals of the shogun tracing its origins back to 1336, when the shogun Takauji enfeoffed many samurai as house vassals who were probably used as a reserve army (Gay 1986:95-6); a larger number of indirect vassals connected to the members of the shogunal bodyguard probably made up the bulk of the shogunal army under Yoshimitsu. This last point is well illustrated by Arnesen, who calculated that the number of direct vassals in the shogunal bodyguard was sixty to seventy percent the number of direct vassals enrolled under the Late Hōjō clan of the sixteenth century (1985:126). And if the Late Hōjō were able to field fifty thousand troops in the Odawara campaign, the shogunal bodyguard of three hundred and fifty could easily have mobilized their own vassals to come up with the three thousand troops that Grossberg claims took part in the Meitoku Rising of 1391 (1981:107). The creation of the shogunal bodyguard, and the central position of this group over other shogunal vassals is what differentiates the shogunal army of Yoshimitsu from the shogunal vassals of Takauji. A tighter organization and esprit de corps emerged with the new shogunal army.

===Use of shugo coalitions to defeat powerful shugo===
However, the shogunal army alone was not adequate to meet and defeat kanrei class shugo lords on the field of battle, but were perfectly suited to the kind of warfare Yoshimitsu practiced: pitting one shugo lord against a family member, and against other shugo lords. The new shogunal hegemony, that emerged under the previous shogun, Yoshiakira, came to dominate the politics of Yoshimitsu. Shogunal prestige informally dictated that no single shugo lord should exceed a certain level of power without incurring the wrath of the shogun. It was in the interest of the shugo lords themselves, that none of their own colleagues should become too powerful and dominant over the rest (Varley 1967:63-64).

In pursuit of this policy in 1389 Yoshimitsu ordered Toki Yasuyuki, the shugo lord of the provinces of Mino, Ise and Owari to give up the latter province to a relative. Yasuyuki refused, and Yoshimitsu ordered the cousin of Yasuyuki, Yorimasu, to attack him. After three years Yasuyuki was defeated, and gave up the province of Mino to Toki Yorimasu in 1391 (Papinot 1972:659). To Yoshimitsu it did not matter whether the province that was given up was Mino or Owari as long as Toki Yasuyuki was shorn of some of his power in the central provinces.

Before the Meitoku Rising (ran) in 1391, the Yamana family possessed eleven provinces in western and central Japan which made them the most powerful shugo family in the country. Yoshimitsu looked for an excuse to attack them; and when Yamana Mitsuyuki (who was shugo over the provinces of Izumo, Tamba, Hoki, and Oki) took possession of some estates belonging to the imperial family in Izumo, Yoshimitsu recalled the ex-kanrei Hosokawa Yoriyuki to plan a campaign against Mitsuyuki (Papinot 1972:744). The Yamana shugo lords Mitsuyuki and Ujikiyo attacked Kyoto, but were severely defeated by the shogunal army in concert with the forces of Ouchi Yoshihiro (Grossberg 1981:30,107; Arnesen 1979:82). The other shugo contingents that made up the shogun's forces numbered no more than three hundred horsemen each (Grossberg 1981:107). After the campaign, the Yamana were assigned only two provinces, Tajima and Hoki, and the leaders of the rebellion were killed, Ujikiyo in battle and Mitsuyuki through assassination in 1395 (Papinot 1972:744).
This pitting of one shugo lord against another reached a head in 1399. Ironically, this time the target was Ouchi Yoshihiro, who had served the regime well in the campaign against the Yamana. Yoshihiro was ordered to attack the Shoni in 1397 which he did, losing his brother in the process. He later learned of the Byzantine duplicity of Yoshimitsu: Shoni was also ordered to attack the Ouchi. Angered by this duplicity, and fearing for his life when the shogun summoned him to Kyoto, he opted to disobey (Grossberg 1981:32). Not surprisingly, he was declared an enemy by the regime. At the battle of Sakai, Yoshimitsu along with the forces of five shugo lords, the Hosokawa, Akamatsu, Kyogoku, Shiba, and the Hatakeyama, overwhelmed Yoshihiro's defensive works by setting fire to the city (Grossberg 1981:33; Sansom 1961:149). The allied force led by Yoshimitsu numbered 30,000 warriors against Ouchi's 5,000: Yoshihiro was simply overwhelmed in battle where he committed suicide (Arnesen 1979:82,86).
As each of these previous examples illustrate, shogunal hegemony became very effective. It was used to divide the shugo lords by making them attack and destroy fellow colleagues. Shogunal hegemony would not have succeeded without the cooperation of the shugo lords in uniting their forces with the shogunal army. However, without finances to support the shogunal army and other expenses of the regime, this coercive policy would have been unthinkable.

===Revenue===
Kyoto in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was a brilliant center for economic activity. With the compulsory residential policy that emerged under the shogun Yoshimitsu, shugo lords with their vassals and servants added to the distinguished population of the city that included nobles, the imperial court and the Muromachi government. This translated into a vast market for a variety of goods and services that spurred the economic growth of the city. This growth was important to both the shogun and shugo lords who lived in the capital: they tapped the wealth of the moneylenders (sakaya-doso) on a consistent basis. The shogun even employed them as tax collectors in the city (Kawai 1977:71; Grossberg 1981:37,78-80). What made the Muromachi regime so different from the previous Kamakura regime was the basis for its income. Much of its revenue came from commercial taxes in addition to its landed base.

The Board of Administration (mandokoro) was used as a clearing house for matters concerning the revenue of the Muromachi regime. It was the chief bureaucratic organ that connected the regime to various commercial groups in the city for purposes of taxation. In 1393, the regime legalized its right to tax the moneylenders directly (Grossberg 1981:78,95-6). Commercial taxes assessed in Kyoto became the foundation for the new urban based Muromachi regime, and decisively changed the nature of the regime from one solely based on landed estates to a regime partly based on commerce.

Traditional agrarian based revenue came from three major sources: from shogunal estates, from shogunal vassals, and from taxes assessed against the shugo lords. The landed base of the Ashikaga shoguns was paltry compared to their successors, the Tokugawa; however, there were approximately two-hundred shogunal estates (goryosho) scattered between Kyoto and the Kantō region, and revenue extracted from these estates were significant (Grossberg 1981:70-3). Moreover, the connection between the shogunal estates and the shogunal army was decisive: some of the men who served in the army were also managers over the shogun's personal estates (Grossberg 1981:112). Furthermore, many local samurai paid land taxes directly to the regime (kyosai) as one of the privileges they enjoyed as house vassals (gokenin), being immunized from shugo tax collectors in the process (Grossberg 1981;109-10). In addition, shugo lords were taxed directly (shugo shussen) according to how many provinces they administered. This was assessed by the regime whenever there were buildings to be built or fixed, and when the shogun needed cash for various projects (Kawai 1977:71; Grossberg 1981:74).
The sources of revenue for the Muromachi regime were varied to a much greater extent than it was under the Kamakura regime due to the emerging market economy in Kyoto and Yamashiro province. It came in novel form as commercial revenue extracted from the moneylenders (sakaya doso): a tax was assessed once the power structure of the Muromachi bureaucracy had effectively taken the city of Kyoto.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far we have seen how the wars of this period had an effect however we must now have a look at the Muromachi Period more generally. The Muromachi period (室町時代 Muromachi jidai) also known as the Ashikaga period is the period of Japanese history running from 1336 to 1573. The period marks the governance of the Ashikaga shogunate, which was officially established in 1338 by the first Muromachi shogun, Ashikaga Takauji, two years after the brief Kemmu restoration (1333–1336) of imperial rule was brought to a close. The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga.
The early years from 1336 to 1392 of the Muromachi period are known as the Nanboku-chō or Northern and Southern Court period. This period is marked by the continued resistance of the supporters of Emperor Go-Daigo, the emperor behind the Kemmu restoration. The years from 1465 to the end of the Muromachi period are also known as the Sengoku period or Warring States period.

==Ashikaga bakufu==
Emperor Go-Daigo's Kemmu restoration(see last chapter) for various reasons disappointed the samurai class. Ashikaga Takauji obtained the samurais' strong support, and deposed Emperor Go-Daigo. In 1338 Takauji was proclaimed shogun and established his government in Kyoto. However, Go-Daigo escaped from his confinement, and revived his political power in Nara. The ensuing period of Ashikaga rule (1336–1573) was called Muromachi from the district of Kyoto in which its headquarters were located by third shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in 1378. What distinguished the Ashikaga bakufu from that of Kamakura was that, whereas Kamakura had existed in equilibrium with the Kyōto court, Ashikaga took over the remnants of the imperial government. Nevertheless, the Ashikaga bakufu was not as strong as that in Kamakura had been, and was greatly preoccupied with civil war. Not until the rule of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (as third shogun, 1368–94, and chancellor, 1394–1408) did a semblance of order emerge.

Yoshimitsu allowed the constables, who had had limited powers during the Kamakura period, to become strong regional rulers, later called daimyō. In time, a balance of power evolved between the shogun and the daimyō; the three most prominent daimyō families rotated as deputies to the shogun at Kyoto. Yoshimitsu was finally successful in reunifying the Northern Court and the Southern Court in 1392, but, despite his promise of greater balance between the imperial lines, the Northern Court maintained control over the throne thereafter. The line of shoguns gradually weakened after Yoshimitsu and increasingly lost power to the daimyō and other regional strongmen. The shogun's influence on imperial succession waned, and the daimyō could back their own candidates. In time, the Ashikaga family had its own succession problems, resulting finally in the Ōnin War (1467–1477), which left Kyoto devastated and effectively ended the national authority of the bakufu. The power vacuum that ensued launched a century of anarchy (see Provincial Wars and Foreign Contacts).

==Economic and cultural developments==
Contact with the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates in coastal areas of China. Japanese pirates of this era and region were referred to as wokou, by the Chinese (Japanese wakō). Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wokou threat, Yoshimitsu accepted a relationship with the Chinese that was to last for half a century. In 1401 he restarted the tribute system, describing himself in a letter to the Chinese Emperor as &quot;Your subject, the King of Japan&quot;. Japanese wood, sulphur, copper ore, swords, and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk, porcelain, books, and coins, in what the Chinese considered tribute but the Japanese saw as profitable trade.
During the time of the Ashikaga bakufu, a new national culture, called Muromachi culture, emerged from the bakufu headquarters in Kyoto to reach all levels of society. Zen Buddhism played a large role in spreading not only religious but also artistic influences, especially those derived from painting of the Chinese Song (960-1279), Yuan, and Ming dynasties. The proximity of the imperial court to the bakufu resulted in a commingling of imperial family members, courtiers, daimyō, samurai, and Zen priests. Art of all kinds—architecture, literature, Noh drama, comedy, poetry, the tea ceremony, landscape gardening, and flower arranging—all flourished during Muromachi times.


===Shintoism===
There also was renewed interest in Shinto, which had quietly coexisted with Buddhism during the centuries of the latter's predominance. In fact, Shinto, which lacked its own scriptures and had few prayers, had, as a result of syncretic practices begun in the Nara period, widely adopted Shingon Buddhist rituals. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries, Shintoism was nearly totally absorbed by Buddhism, becoming known as Ryōbu Shinto (Dual Shinto). The Mongol invasions in the late thirteenth century, however, evoked a national consciousness of the role of the kamikaze in defeating the enemy. Less than fifty years later (1339–43), Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293–1354), the chief commander of the Southern Court forces, wrote the Jinnō Shōtōki. This chronicle emphasized the importance of maintaining the divine descent of the imperial line from Amaterasu to the current emperor, a condition that gave Japan a special national polity (kokutai). Besides reinforcing the concept of the emperor as a deity, the Jinnōshōtōki provided a Shinto view of history, which stressed the divine nature of all Japanese and the country's spiritual supremacy over China and India. As a result, a change gradually occurred in the balance between the dual Buddhist–Shinto religious practice. Between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, Shinto reemerged as the primary belief system, developed its own philosophy and scripture (based on Confucian and Buddhist canons), and became a powerful nationalistic force.

==Provincial wars and foreign contacts==
The Ōnin War (1467–1477) led to serious political fragmentation and obliteration of domains: a great struggle for land and power ensued among bushi chieftains and lasted until the mid-sixteenth century. Peasants rose against their landlords and samurai against their overlords as central control virtually disappeared. The imperial house was left impoverished, and the bakufu was controlled by contending chieftains in Kyoto. The provincial domains that emerged after the Ōnin War were smaller and easier to control. Many new small daimyō arose from among the samurai who had overthrown their great overlords. Border defenses were improved, and well fortified castle towns were built to protect the newly opened domains, for which land surveys were made, roads built, and mines opened. New house laws provided practical means of administration, stressing duties and rules of behavior. Emphasis was put on success in war, estate management, and finance. Threatening alliances were guarded against through strict marriage rules. Aristocratic society was overwhelmingly military in character. The rest of society was controlled in a system of vassalage. The shōen (feudal manors) were obliterated, and court nobles and absentee landlords were dispossessed. The new daimyō directly controlled the land, keeping the peasantry in permanent serfdom in exchange for protection.
===Economic effect of wars between states===
Most wars of the period were short and localized, although they occurred throughout Japan. By 1500 the entire country was engulfed in civil wars. Rather than disrupting the local economies, however, the frequent movement of armies stimulated the growth of transportation and communications, which in turn provided additional revenues from customs and tolls. To avoid such fees, commerce shifted to the central region, which no daimyō had been able to control, and to the Inland Sea. Economic developments and the desire to protect trade achievements brought about the establishment of merchant and artisan guilds.

===Western influence===
By the end of the Muromachi period, the first Europeans had arrived. The Portuguese landed in southern Kyūshū in 1543 and within two years were making regular port calls, initiating the century-long Nanban trade period. The Spanish arrived in 1587, followed by the Dutch in 1609. The Japanese began to attempt studies of European civilization in depth, and new opportunities were presented for the economy, along with serious political challenges. European firearms, fabrics, glassware, clocks, tobacco, and other Western innovations were traded for Japanese gold and silver. Significant wealth was accumulated through trade, and lesser daimyō, especially in Kyūshū, greatly increased their power. Provincial wars became more deadly with the introduction of firearms, such as muskets and cannons, and greater use of infantry.

===Christianity in the Muromachi Period===
Christianity had an impact on Japan, largely through the efforts of the Jesuits, led first by the Navarrese Saint Francis Xavier (1506–1552), who arrived in Kagoshima in southern Kyūshū in 1549. Both daimyō and merchants seeking better trade arrangements as well as peasants were among the converts. By 1560 Kyoto had become another major area of missionary activity in Japan. In 1568 the port of Nagasaki, in northwestern Kyūshū, was established by a Christian daimyō and was turned over to Jesuit administration in 1579. By 1582 there were as many as 150,000 converts (two per cent of the population) and 200 churches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The overthrow of the Kamakura Shogunate was accomplished by two groups acting more or less as allies. On the one side there was Godaigo Tenno who aspired to put an end to the Shogunate and reestablish centralized rule under the Emperor. On the other were disgruntled warriors, led by two branches of the Minamoto clan who aspired to overthrow the Hojo only but retain the Shogunate with themselves in control of it. Naturally enough, the two sides soon fell into conflict. 

The resulting civil war is known as the War of the Northern and Southern Courts, because at one point the two sides came to each recognize one of two rival branches of the imperial clan. Except in its earliest stages this was not a normal war with front lines and organized strategies. It was highly episodic and practically everyone involved changed sides at least once. What actually happened was that Ashikaga Takauji established a new Shogunate commonly called the Muromachi Shogunate after the district of Kyoto where its headquarters was estabished. Anyone who had a quarrel with the Shogunate had the option of declaring himself a supporter of the Southern Court (there was a brief period where the Ashikaga officially supported the Southern Court and their enemies the Northern one, but it was usually the other way round) so that he was not a mere rebel. 

What the war accomplished was to establish a general situation where legality was relatively unimportant and control of the ground by military force was everything. The system of provincial administration used by the Ashikaga relied completely on feudalism. Ashikaga vassals were appointed shugo of provinces and it was up to them to gain actual control of their provinces by forming their own feudal organizations within them. There were significant parts of the country which the Ashikaga made no attempt to rule directly, leaving it up to allies to form their own feudal groupings. However, by the end of the period covered by this chapter (1408, the death of Yoshimitsu the most able and most powerful of the Ashikaga Shoguns) the courts had been reunified and open opposition had been suppressed.

During this time most of the institutional arrangements that derived from ancient Japan disappeared. New forms of social organization appeared in the countryside, shoen disappeared and were replaced by a system rooted in self-governing peasant villages. Kyoto became a real city and new cities began to appear that were founded by and run by commoners. A money economy began to operate and there were early versions of industry and banking. Literacy spread rapidly and literature grew enormously compared to earlier times. This is the point in history when feudal Japan looked most like feudal Europe (as of the 13th century).

==The Kemmu Restoration==
The Kenmu (or Kemmu) restoration (建武の新政 Kenmu no shinsei) (1333–1336) is the name given to both the three year period of Japanese history between the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, and the political events that took place in it. The restoration was an effort made by Emperor Go-Daigo to bring the Imperial House and the nobility it represented back into power, thus restoring a civilian government after almost a century and a half of military rule. The attempted restoration ultimately failed and was replaced by the Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1575). This was to be the last time the Emperor had any power until the Meiji restoration of 1867. The many and serious political errors made by the Imperial House during this three year period were to have important repercussions in the following decades and end with the rise of the Ashikaga shogunate.

===Background===
The Emperor's role had been usurped by the Minamoto and Hōjō families ever since Minamoto no Yoritomo had obtained from the Emperor the title of Shogun in 1192, ruling thereafter from Kamakura. For various reasons, the Kamakura shogunate decided to allow two contending imperial lines—known as the Southern Court, or junior line, and the Northern Court, or senior line—to alternate on the throne. The method worked for several successions until a member of the Southern Court ascended to the throne as Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo wanted to overthrow the shogunate and openly defied Kamakura by naming his own son his heir. In 1331 the shogunate exiled Go-Daigo but loyalist forces, including Kusunoki Masashige, rebelled and came to his support. They were aided among others by Ashikaga Takauji, a samurai who turned against Kamakura when dispatched to put down Go-Daigo's rebellion. At the same time, Nitta Yoshisada, another eastern chieftain, rebelled against the shogunate, attacking its capital (Siege of Kamakura (1333). The shogunate tried to resist opposing his advance, but quickly disintegrated.

===Objectives===
When Emperor Go-Daigo ascended to the throne in 1318, he immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura. Historical documents show that, disregarding evidence to the contrary, he and his advisers believed that a revival of the Imperial House's and of the nobility's fortunes was possible, and that the Kamakura's shogunate was the greatest and most obvious of the obstacles.
Another situation that begged for a solution was the land-ownership problem posed by the manors and their lands (see the article shōen). The great landowners (shugo (governors) and jitō (manor's lord)), with their political independence and their tax exemptions were impoverishing the government and undermining its authority, and Kitabatake Chikafusa, Go-Daigo's future chief adviser, discussed the situation in his works on succession. Chikafusa admitted that nobody had any intention of abolishing those privileges, so the hope of success on this front was from the beginning clearly very dim. What he planned to replace shugo and jitō with is unclear, but he surely had no intention of sharing power with the samurai class. However serious the land ownership problem, Go-Daigo and his advisers made no serious effort to solve it, partly because it was samurai from the manors in the western provinces that had defeated the Bakufu for him. In such a situation, any effort to regulate the manors was bound to cause resentment among key allies.

===End of the Restoration===
In hindsight the Kemmu Restoration was a failure. It failed for a number of reasons, chief among these Emperor Go-Daigo's unrealistic desire to return to what he perceived to have been a golden age. Although there is no evidence he wanted to go back to Heian period policies like Chikafusa, there is clear evidence he believed it possible to restore not only imperial power, but also its culture. He even wrote a treatise called Kenmu Nenchū Gyōji for the purpose of reviving court ceremonies that had fallen out of use. In 1336 Ashikaga Takauji rebelled against the imperial court and proclaimed the beginning of a new warrior regime. After his proclamation, he was forced to retreat to Kyūshū after the imperialist forces of Kitabatake Akiie attacked and defeated him near Kyoto. This betrayal of the Kemmu Restoration by Takauji blackened his name in later periods of Japanese history, and officially started the Nanboku-chō War. Previous historical views tried to look at the failure of the Restoration at the level of ineffectiveness in the area of rewarding lands to the many petitions that flooded in from samurai; however, it is now clear that, at the most important level, the judicial organs that determined land dispute cases, the Restoration was effective. This forces us to conclude that Takauji's rebellion and desire to create a new warrior regime was a prime determinant in the Restoration's failure. His rebellion encouraged a large body of dissatisfied warriors (there were always those whose petitions were not granted) who desired to see the creation of another warrior regime modeled after Kamakura.

The Nanboku-chō War was an ideological struggle between loyalists who wanted the Emperor back in power, and those who believed in creating another warrior regime modeled after Kamakura. It was as if the two previous periods in Japanese history, the Heian and the Kamakura, were clashing on the ideological level. Noble warriors like Kitabatake Chikafusa were pragmatic about the need for warriors to participate in the Restoration on the instrumental level, but on the ideological level a severe divergence between Chikafusa and Takauji polarized the leaders for many years to come. Hammered together during war time, the emergence of the Muromachi regime followed on the heels of the Restoration's failure. In the next chapter we will see the North-South Courts Period (Nanboku-chō Period) which was an ideological battle between the shogunate with the Northern Court against the Southern Court, founded by Go-Daigo.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;''Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.'' 
''Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.''
''-- [[w:en:Margaret Mead|Margaret Mead]]''&lt;/div&gt;

==Who I Am==
I work in Reader Relations for the Wikimedia Foundation.  I have a background in online community management, and am currently a Master's candidate at [[w:en:San Jose State University|San Jose State University]] in [[w:en:Applied anthropology|Applied anthropology]].  My thesis topic revolves around stakeholder relations in Web 2.0, using [[w:en:LiveJournal|LiveJournal]] as my fieldsite.  I am analyzing how communications occur, how they break down, and where the failures in communication occur.  I hope to use this information to be able to assist organizations with interfacing better with their online communities; not seeing them as simple consumers to be sold a product to, but instead as partners and true stakeholders in their operations.

My volunteer account is [[w:en:User:Kethryvis|Kethryvis]], which I use sporadically usually on small edits on interesting subjects that generally have nothing to do with my scholarly interests.  It's what keeps me sane.

I also have an alternate account, [[w:en:User:Kheff|Kheff]] in order to see what the registration process is like for new editors.  This account will make few, if any, edits and will be abandoned once this research is complete.

If you'd like to find me on IRC, I hang out under the nick ChristineM. Very original, I know.

You can email me with any questions or comments to readers[[File:At sign.svg|15px|&amp;#xFE6B;|link=]]wikimedia.org

==What I'm Thinking About==

I'm thinking about how to make the new editor process easier.  I'm fairly new at editing myself, and it's rather daunting.  There's an awful lot to wade through.  There's gotta be an easier way! (one of my mantras)

I'm thinking about the line between WMF staff and Wiki-volunteers.  Where they cross, where they clash, where they come together. Hey wait, that sounds familiar.

I'm thinking about all the on-Wiki and off-Wiki reading I need to do to get up to speed!

==New editors==
Thought I'd note that myself and another administrator here are working on updating our [[Help:Contents|help documentation]] to try to make the process for new editors at Wikibooks easier.  Many of our help pages weren't updated in several years (we don't have the community size of Wikipedia to maintain it) and we have our own little WikiProject [[Wikibooks:WikiProject_Users/Tasks#Help_pages|planning it out]] (so [[Help:Contents]] will be getting more links and better organization). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:57, 10 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Screen is a very powerful program that allows multiplexing several interactive shells. The sessions can be attached and detached, this is especially useful for sessions that are used on a remote sever: One can log on from a different computer, attach the screen session and continue working in the same environment which was last encountered. 

== Most important commands ==
Starting a screen session:
 screen -S sessionname

Attaching an already running screen session:
 screen -r sessionname

list all running screen sessions
 screen -ls


From inside a screen session, all commands are started with Ctrl-a and then another key.
Detach session: Ctrl-a + d
Switch to next window: Ctrl-a n
Switch to previous window: Ctrl-a p

It is possible to call R functions and even modules direcly from Python. One easy way to do this is the rpy2 interface.  In the following code snippet, an R module called [http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/preprocessCore.html preprocessCore] from the bioconductor portal is loaded and the quantile normalization function is applied on a matrix that is created in python and then converted back to python again. 

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
import numpy

preprocessCore = importr('preprocessCore')

matrix = [ [1,2,3,4,5], [1,3,5,7,9], [2,4,6,8,10] ]
v = robjects.FloatVector([ element for col in matrix for element in col ])
m = robjects.r['matrix'](v, ncol = len(matrix), byrow=False)
Rnormalized_matrix = preprocessCore.normalize_quantiles(m)
normalized_matrix = numpy.array( Rnormalized_matrix)

&lt;/source&gt;

It is thus possible to handle R modules and objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

You want a simple ant task that will reindex a collection.

== Method ==
We will us the ant task that will call an XQuery that has the reindex() command in it.  Because there is no ant task that does this we will use the xquery task to execute a remote XQuery that performs this task.

Here is a link to the ant task to run an XQuery
http://exist-db.org/ant-tasks.html#N1041F

=== Call a remote XQuery by file name ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;reindex-collection&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xdb:xquery user=&quot;${user}&quot; password=&quot;${password}&quot;
        uri=&quot;${test-server}$(collection)&quot; query=&quot;reindex.xq&quot;
        outputproperty=&quot;result&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/xdb:xquery&gt;
     &lt;echo message=&quot;Result = ${result}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Supply the Body of an XQuery ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;inline-query&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xdb:xquery uri=&quot;${test-server}/db&quot;  
       user=&quot;${user}&quot; password=&quot;${password}&quot;
       outputproperty=&quot;result&quot;&gt;
       reindex('/db/mycollection')
     &lt;/xdb:xquery&gt;
     &lt;!-- note, this only returns a SINGLE line --&gt;
     &lt;echo message=&quot;Result = ${result}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Background =
In the previous client server example, 4 files were edited to present a really basic example of a CORBA enabled application which presented a RMI interface in a factory type interface. Not terribly interesting, or useful. Ideally, one of these applications would act to serve up networked objects/entities which could answer questions as well as perform tasks. It would also be nice to have it perform these tasks with a database back end. The point of such a service would be to implement an in-memory database, the members of which are capable of individually acting like instantiated objects.

CORBA provides a framework to hang networked objects on called the Portable Object Adapter (POA). This framework, and a rather complicated framework it is, is capable of keeping references to your objects, performing reference counting of your objects, and doing garbage collection on spent objects. For this example, we'll only use the POA to store references to the factory object. Other services the POA offers we'll ignore for the moment, and perform our own object lifetime operations. In later examples, we'll explore the utility of using more of the features of a POA, however, since these features aren't generated by the IDL compiler and require knowledge about the specific ORB you'll be using (in this case TAO), we'll use this simpler example first, and build on it later.

This example was originally used to proof out a performance improvement for some rather inefficient code which was originally written in Java and running under a Tomcat instance. My job was to get more bank for the customer's buck out of their server, and incidentally, solve some of their garbage collection issues they were having in Tomcat. My solution was to factor their existing transient in-memory entities out of Tomcat, and into an in-memory CORBA server. The server you're about to see certainly isn't the most efficient design, however, it is designed to mimic exactly the customer's design. The point of this was to demonstrate the performance improvements available to the JAVA designers in as recognizable a fashion as possible. Following the initial demonstration, and first flush of embarrassment, subsequent improvements were added on to further flush out the available features.

= Design =
This client's issue was with a customer framework that was chewing up too much resources, freezing when GC operations were in effect, and generally not scaling as well as they'd hoped. To proof the improvements they could hope to realize, I went out onto the net, and downloaded one of those free, randomly generated address/credit card databases. I then used this to fill an in-memory DBMS based in Boost's Muti-Index Container, and then used a CORBA factory idiom to feed these objects to clients. When the clients were done with these objects, they called a destroy method on them and the server's POA would clean them up. Simple to understand, but not the speediest design.

== The IDL ==
=== Source File Actor.idl ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;idl&quot;&gt;
// Forward declare
interface Actor;
struct Person{
  unsigned long id;
  string fname;
  string mname;
  string lname;
  unsigned long address;
};

// = TITLE
//   A factory class for Actor interfaces
interface My_Factory
{
  typedef unsigned long uint;
  typedef sequence&lt;uint&gt; People;
  //Get an interface to an actor via its ID
  Actor get_actor (in uint actor_id);
  //Get one or more People by searching on the first name. Returns a sequence of actor_ids.
  People get_sloppy_match_fname(in string fname);
  //Get one or more People by searching on the first and last names, returns a sequence of actor_ids.
  People get_sloppy_match_flname(in string fname, in string lname);
  uint add_actor(in Person person); //Add a person to the in-memory db and the backing store, return person_id
  uint delete_actor(in uint actor_id); //Delete from in-memory and backing store, associated addresses will likely be cascaded on the backend.
};

interface Actor
{
  readonly attribute Person person;
  typedef unsigned long uint;
  typedef sequence&lt;uint&gt; Addresses;
  uint get_identity(); 
  string get_fname();
  string get_mname();
  string get_lname();
  Addresses get_addresses();
  void setPersonId(in uint ps);
  void destroy();
};
&lt;/source&gt;
Now, run your IDL through the compiler to get your machine generated code out:
&lt;pre&gt;tao_idl -GI Actor.idl&lt;/pre&gt;
This generates a bunch of files, the one we'll be editing first, is the ActorI.h file. This is where the interface for the IDL is stored. Since we will be needing a database connection in the factory class to perform some operations, our first edit will be to add a database connection object to the My_Factory_i class. Just put it up near the top, and we'll initialize it when the factory starts up. For this example, I used PostgreSQL as the database. An example of the code edit I made is listed below. That's it for this file.

== The Interface ==
=== Source File ActorI.h ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*! \class My_Factory_i
*   \brief Factory class for creating instances of Actor and Location
*
 *   Code generated by the The ACE ORB (TAO) IDL Compiler v1.8.2
*/
class  My_Factory_i
  : public virtual POA_My_Factory
{
public:
  /*! \var pqxx::connection *c
  *   \brief Postgres Connectin variable
  *
  *   This variable gets used throughout the class for the duration of its life
  *   as the variable responsible for enabling writes back to the database
  */
  pqxx::connection *c;
...  
&lt;/source&gt;

Now on to the ActorI.cpp file. The implementation is jest a matter of filling out the IDL created carcase. This source needs to create a live database connection, connect to the multi-index in-memory database, perform searches, and write certain things back to the database. The most difficult thing to figure out how to do is how to manage the created CORBA objects. The documentation from the open-source support community is pretty thin on the ground, and generally of a type not terribly useful for development. There is however a book for sale by OCI which helps in presenting useful examples which are great for development. This example was inspired by Henning's book on using CORBA in combination with the STL containers. So, here's the interface file. 

=== Source File Actor.cpp ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;ActorI.h&quot;

// Implementation skeleton constructor
My_Factory_i::My_Factory_i (void)
{
  c = new pqxx::connection(&quot;dbname=ecarew user=ecarew&quot;);

&lt;/source&gt;
Let's go over the code. The constructor for the factory creates the postgres connection object. The factory destructor doesn't do anything. The factory get_actor member does the job of instantiating a new Actor_i interface object. Figuring out how to write this code was quite a job for me. Since I didn't have a copy of the [http://www.theaceorb.com/downloads/1.6a/index.html OCI document], I was left using more generic documents such as [http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-CORBA-R-Programming-C/dp/0201379279/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292184242&amp;sr=1-1 Henning's book]. While these books will give you an idea of how something can be architected, specific implementations are definitely on you as the developer. The problem with this code as shown in the getter is that an extra reference count is placed on this object as it is created. I can't find any way to decrement this, so the effect is that when we are done with the object in our client, it gets decremented once, but not enough to get the object garbage collected. To fix this, the created object has a built in destructor function we will be discussing later. That's it for the moment on the factory.

The actor class accesses the in-memory database with the Person object. you can see it created in the constructor for Actor_i.

=== Source file ActorI.h ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
class  Actor_i
  : public virtual POA_Actor
{
public:
  Person_var ps;
  // Constructor 
&lt;/source&gt;

== The Application ==
The in-memory database is defined in the header file person.h, and, as mentioned earlier, is based on Boost's multi-index class. This allows the designer to create a container of objects which can have multiple indexes in them. The file is as follows:

If you look in ActorI.cpp, you'll see in void Actor_i::setPersonId (::Actor::uint ps) how the multi-index object is used to search for data. To get an idea for how this code works, with respect to the Boost container, have a look at their documentation of [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html Boost::Multi-index] the library.

Now, on to the server code. This code is rather simple, and mostly driven by boilerplate code. The IDL compiler doesn't generate any of this, tho it probably could. in this case, the server creates an ORB, attaches to the naming service, and initializes the in-memory database from the postgreSQL database.

Now that we've discussed all the code required to make the server, it's worth noting some of the parts of the application which make it worthwhile as a useful example. note for instance that some of the methods in the factory as well as the entity class, Actor, return complex types. Few, if any of the on-line examples I found discussed how to do this. The main reason many of the other examples don't show this is its a fairly deep topic which requires the developer to first understand how the CORBA spec deals with its own funky brand of memory management. I won't go into all the options here, except to say that most applications I've worked on have either used integral types, in which case, there are no concerns, or a fairly simple usage of the CORBA containers such as ''sequence'', ''string'', and the odd ''struct''. The previously described code uses all of them and shows how to deal with the memory. The key is in name of the automatically generated variable names which come out of the IDL compiler. Those names ending in ''_var'' are CORBA's idea of an STL::auto_ptr. This means that they ''own'' the pointed to object, and like a typical stl container, when they go out of scope, they clean up their own memory, and that contained in the client and server ORBs. Strings merrit special mention as they seem to have their own separate treatment. Notice that in the code, instead of using straight assignment, or new, or some other special operator, CORBA uses the ''string_dup()'' function. Don't think about it, just do it. It's required by the spec. As for the sequence and struct, using the ''_var'' variable is sufficient.

=== The Client ===
Most of the client is boilerplate code, i.e., setup of the CORBA connection. The actual usage of the CORBA object looks just like a function call. As mentioned above, the only thing to watch out for is the usage of the three object types struct, sequence, and string. Have a look at the example client below to get a feel for how it works:

== Deploying the App ==
=== Compilation ===
The TAO web site does a passable job of helping the developer new to ACE+TAO through the task of compiling their new applications. Despite these instructions, there are often some questions on their list serve regarding apps not compiling or linking. The compilation command you are going to need with a 5.8.x or later version of ACE+TAO is likely to require the following local objects:
&lt;pre&gt;ActorC.cpp ActorI.cpp ActorS.cpp objectserver.cpp&lt;/pre&gt;
and the link portion of you application is likely to require the following objects:
&lt;pre&gt;-lpqxx -lTAO_PortableServer -lTAO_CosNaming -lTAO_AnyTypeCode -lACE -lTAO&lt;/pre&gt;
=== Deployment ===
Until recently, ACE+TAO didn't have a deployment plan worth mentioning. I'm not sure which version it was that they acquired a make install target for their platforms, suffice it to say, you want to use their more modern versions, such as 5.8.x and above. If you are on a redhat style linux distro, they even have pre-compiled RPMs. Installing ACE+TAO will place the libraries in your system's common directory, as well as placing the tao binaries in some common bin location like /usr/bin. Once this prerequisite is over with, installing your app is simplicity itself. just copy your binary to a directory from which you can run it. One more thing, remember that you're probably going to want to have a copy of a name server running somewhere on your net, configured to load at boot time.

== Archive format ==
Sequent archives aren't particularly helpful when you need to find things in a specific time period, which is most of the time. I think we should update this template to support archives of the format: &lt;tt&gt;/Archives/Year/Month&lt;/tt&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

:Okay, but we should use the form YYYY/MM then, as in 2011/01 so they go up in a standard numeric order.  This would have to be in addition to the plain number format already present since it's used in several other places.  I somewhat regret not having done it that way for the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives|discussion room archives]] (though I use it for my own talk archives). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:43, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

There is not enough energy in a cell to maintain one (1) membrane pump and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) does not have a “high energy phosphate bond”. This continuing cellular physiology 'mythology' has been shown to be incorrect since 1957. The latest cellular physiology is the “Induction- Association Theory: as outlined in Ling, Gilbert N; Life at the Cell and Below- Cell Level: The Hidden History of a Fundamental Revolution in Biology; 2001; Pacific Press, PO Box 1452-11, Melville, NY, 11747, USA: Any questions or further information please do not hesitate to write drcarlos.viana@gmail.com

{{tl|purge}} produces a link that will clear the cache and rebuild page from the wikitext.

=== Purpose ===
For efficiency in service, [[MediaWiki]] [[w:cache|cache]]s pages. Depending on the exact sequence of actions editors follow, one may view an out-of-date version of a given page. This happens most often on heavily-edited pages and on pages which contain a [[Help:Templates|template]]. 

{{tl|purge}} adds to any page a link that, when clicked, not only reloads the page, but clears the server cache, forcing the page to be completely rendered &quot;from scratch&quot;. This is not a one-time solution; generally, editing a page is itself sufficient to purge cache. Rather, it is a measure taken in anticipation of the frequent need to purge. 

=== Examples ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Code
! Yields
! Result
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{purge}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{purge}}
| Creates a purge link for the page it is used on.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{purge|Purge this page's server cache.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{purge|Purge this page's server cache.}}
| Creates a purge link for the page it is used on, but with the text &quot;Purge this page's server cache.&quot;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{purge|page=Main Page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{purge|page=Main Page}}
| Creates a purge link for [[Main Page]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{purge|Purge this page's server cache.|page=Main Page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{purge|Purge this page's server cache.|page=Main Page}}
| Creates a purge link for [[Main Page]], but with the text &quot;Purge this page's server cache.&quot;

__NOTOC__
When a topic is large, it is often rewritten in summary style.  This template is used to link to the page the has been summarized.

This template is '''not''' to be used as a substitute for inline links or as a &quot;main&quot;. Its usage should be restricted to the purpose described above.

=== Usage ===
 {{tlx|main|Page 1|...|''Page 15''}}

* Up to 15 parameters are permitted: only the first is mandatory.
* The list is dynamically generated so that the word &quot;and&quot; is always placed between the final two entries.
* If more than 15 entries are supplied, a message will be displayed pointing out the problem.
*You can use parameters l1 to l15 to specify alternative labels for the links.
; NB : make sure to start label parameters with a lowercase el (l), not a one (1) or pipe (|)
:adding newline characters will break page links

=== Example ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
! Code!! Result
|- 
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; |{{Tlx|main|Page}}||{{main|Page}}
|- 
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; |{{Tlx|main|Page|Page 2}}||{{main|Page|Page 2}}
|- 
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; |{{Tlx|main|Page|Page 2|Page 3}}||{{main|Page|Page 2|Page 3}}
|- 
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; |{{Tlx|main|Page|Page 2|4=l2=Alternate title for Page 2}}||{{main|Page|Page 2|l2=Alternate title for Page 2}}
|}
''And so on up to 15 parameters.''

=== Link to subsection ===
It possible to direct this template to link a particular section within another page. 

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{main|Michael Tritter#storyline|l1=Storyline}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives
{{main|Michael Tritter#storyline|l1=Storyline}}

== Error? (l2=Alt. VS l1=Alt) ==

I copied the further template onto a module I was creating, (further|Page|Page 2|l2=Alternate title for Page 2), but the alternative title didn't appear. So I continued reading and saw that (further|Michael Tritter#storyline|l1=Storyline) this worked.
The only difference is the l2=Alt. vs l1=Alt. Just hoping to get this cleared up if an error has ocurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that include potentially life-threatening behavioral, psychological, and physiological disturbances. Walsh and Fairburn define an eating disorder as &quot;a persistent disturbance of eating behavior or behavior intended to control weight, which significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning,&quot; and are not secondary to any recognized general medical or other psychiatric disorder (Walsh &amp; Fairburn, 2002). While eating disorders are illnesses that primarily occur in parts of the world where food is plentiful, they have been reported on every continent, including in developing countries (Nobakht &amp; Dezhkam, 2000; Pike &amp; Mizushima, 2005). While more serious eating disorder cases, and those that present within geographic proximity to tertiary care medical centers, may be referred to specialists for management, most cases are initially identified, and frequently managed by pediatricians, internists, and other primary care clinicians. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and other conditions that in the current diagnostic system are categorized together as Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS). These EDNOS conditions include binge eating disorder (BED), night eating syndrome (NES), and sub-threshold syndromes in which some, but not all of the symptoms of the more formally defined eating disorders are present. This chapter will review the clinical manifestations, general epidemiology, and treatment options for the major eating disorders, including AN, BN, and BED.

==Anorexia Nervosa==

===Clinical features and epidemiology===

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric illness characterized by failure to maintain a minimally normal weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and preoccupations about body shape and weight. AN has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 0.5%-1% among women, and is estimated to affect one-tenth as many men (Hoek &amp; van Hoeken, 2003). The onset of AN typically occurs in middle to late adolescence, the disorder being significantly more common in industrialized societies such as the United States and Europe than non-Western countries (Cummins, Simmons, &amp; Zane, 2005; Eddy, Hennessey, &amp; Thompson-Brenner, 2007; Hoek &amp; van Hoeken, 2003; Pike &amp; Mizushima, 2005). While the disorder has gained more public attention in recent decades, some version of AN can actually be traced back to the seventeenth century (Bell, 1987; Pearce, 2004).

The defining psychological feature of AN is the relentless pursuit of thinness, which is often manifested by extreme weight control behaviors such as caloric restriction and excessive exercise. Associated with this severe dietary restraint, nearly 50% of individuals with AN also eventually develop episodic &quot;loss of control&quot; eating—that is, the aversive feeling that one is unable to stop or resist eating (Wilson, Grilo, &amp; Vitousek, 2007). In AN, these loss of control episodes may be subjective, including small amounts more than what the individual intended to eat, or objective binges, including irrefutably large amounts of food consumed with discrete periods of time. Regardless of episode size, loss of control episodes may trigger purging behaviors, including self-induced vomiting and the abuse of laxatives or diuretics. However, these compensatory behaviors also may occur in the absence of loss of control eating. As a result of these extreme weight control behaviors, patients with AN maintain a body weight well below that which is minimally medically acceptable. Despite their low weight, patients often experience their bodies, or certain parts of their bodies, as too fat. This intense dissatisfaction with body shape and weight fuels a vicious cycle of weight loss and abnormal eating behavior that it is extremely difficult for individuals with AN to interrupt.
The current edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) has characterized AN using criteria that include the maintenance of low weight, the presence of cognitive distortions about body shape and weight, and the presence of amenorrhea for post-menarcheal females. There are two sub-types: restricting type, characterized by those who maintain low weight without any binge eating or purging behaviors, and binge-eating/purging type, characterized by the presence of binge eating or purging behaviors (see Table 1). While no specific weight threshold is identified for the AN diagnosis, DSM-IV includes an example of &lt; 85% of recommended weight for height, and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest that body mass index (BMI) &lt; 17.5 kg/m2 may indicate the presence of AN (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). In an attempt to improve diagnostic accuracy and inclusivity, draft criteria for AN proposed for DSM-5 include several changes (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). For example, the proposed criteria for DSM-5 eliminate amenorrhea as a requirement for the AN diagnosis, as evidence suggests that menstruation, while a general indicator of nutritional status, does not provide meaningful clinical distinction among individuals with AN. Furthermore the amenorrhea criterion is not useful for important sub-groups of individuals with the disorder, such as women taking oral contraceptive pills, adolescent patients with primary amenorrhea, and men (Attia &amp; Roberto, 2009).

Individuals with AN, regardless of subtype, often suffer from numerous medical complications consistent with the hypometabolic and malnourished state, including bradycardia (sometimes with prolonged QTc interval), hypotension, hypothermia, and leukopenia (Attia, 2010). Common signs present in patients with AN include hair loss, the development of a downy hair growth on the face, neck and extremities (lanugo), salivary gland enlargement, indigestion, and constipation (Walsh, 2008). Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia, may also present, especially in individuals whose symptomatology includes vomiting or laxative abuse. Even in the presence of significant starvation, it is possible for individuals with AN to display normal laboratory values. Therefore, clinicians should not rely solely on laboratory results to assess acuity of illness. In addition to abnormal laboratory values, individuals with AN commonly display low levels of estrogen and testosterone. These hormonal changes often result in decreased libido, amenorrhea among females, and decreased bone density, eventually leading to potentially irreversible osteopenia and/or osteoporosis. Perhaps the most serious physiological change associated with AN is a prolonged QTc interval, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and/or sudden death. 


'''Table 1.  Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia Nervosa, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994)'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| A)	Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected).

B)	Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.

C)	Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

D)	In postmenarcheal females, amenorrhea, i.e., the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles (A woman is considered to have amenorrhea if her periods occur only following hormone, e.g., estrogen, administration).

|}


Psychological symptoms associated with AN include distractibility, agitation, and sleep disturbance, along with increased depression, anxiety, obsessionality, and compulsivity (Attia, 2010). In addition to these often transient symptoms thought to be associated with the state of nutritional compromise, many individuals with AN also suffer from comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. In a meta-analysis of the outcome of AN in the twentieth century, Steinhausen found that the majority of patients suffered from one or more additional mental illnesses at follow-up, most commonly anxiety and mood disorders, personality disorders, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies (Steinhausen, 2002). However, it is important for clinicians to bear in mind that many symptoms of these comorbid disorders are exacerbated by the underweight condition, and thus may improve or even remit completely with the restoration and maintenance of normal body weight. In fact, studies of starvation in the absence of AN have been useful in identifying the myriad of ways that psychological symptoms develop and worsen in the context of malnutrition (Keys, Brozek, Henschel, Mickelsen, &amp; Taylor, 1950).

Historically, it has been very difficult to track the long-term outcome of AN for reasons including the lengthy course of the disorder and significant relapse rate among those who undergo acute weight restoration. The limited research that has examined longitudinal outcome of AN has revealed high relapse rates and only modest recovery rates. In a trichotomized system classifying outcome of illness into good, fair, and poor, 46.9% of patients reached full recovery from AN, 33.5% improved, and 20.8% displayed a chronic course of the disorder (Steinhausen, 2002). Patients with AN also displayed significant crossover to other eating disorders, most frequently BN and EDNOS (Walsh, 2008). Furthermore, the crude mortality rate amongst patients with AN has been estimated at 5.0% per decade of illness, a rate as high as that seen in any psychiatric illness (Sullivan, 1995). Among a large epidemiological sample of individuals with AN followed in Sweden, the overall mortality rate was 6.2%, with the most common causes of death for the sample being suicide, substance abuse, and eating disorder-related complications (Papadopoulos, Ekbom, Brandt, &amp; Ekselius, 2009). While there are some limitations to the available data regarding longitudinal outcome in AN, there is strong empirically based consensus that AN is a serious mental illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

===Etiology===

Just as it has been difficult to track the long-term outcome of AN, the task of identifying the causal underpinnings of the disorder has proven to be equally challenging. The relatively low incidence and limited ethnic and gendered scope of the disorder, as well as the complicating medical and psychological consequences of semi-starvation, render AN a particularly difficult disorder to study in a controlled setting (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998). Eating disorders have been proven to be more prevalent in women than men. 
For example Striegel-Moore et al. (2009) examined 3,714 women and 1,808 men and found that men were more likely to overeat than women. They found that around 1 in 5 women versus 1 in 10 men check their body size &quot;very often&quot;. While the prevalence of eating disorders in cultures that idealize thinness suggest that social environment may play a causal role the development of the disorder, striking patterns of biological and psychological abnormalities in patients with AN suggest that multiple other factors also contribute (Attia &amp; Walsh, 2009).

Research has provided significant evidence for the role of genetic factors in the etiology of AN (Wade, Tiggemann, Bulik, Fairburn, Wray, &amp; Martin, 2008; Bulik, Sullivan, Carter, McIntosh, &amp; Joyce, 1999). Though specific genes have not been identified, the incidence of AN is greater in families with one affected member, and the disorder has higher rates of concordance in monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Heritable factors may also contribute to the development of AN more distally, through temperamental variables associated with the illness, such as perfectionism, obsessionality, compulsivity, and, particularly in the binge/purge subgroup, emotional lability (Walsh, 2008). 

In addition, numerous physiological disturbances, including abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract and various hormonal and neurotransmitter systems, have been considered as possible risk factors for AN (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998). Researchers have speculated that leptin, a hormone that regulates appetite and metabolism, may play a role in the perpetuation of the illness, as leptin levels are typically low in underweight individuals with AN (Grinspoon, Gulick, Askari, Landt, Lee, Anderson, Ma, Vignati, Bowsher, &amp; Herzog, 1996). Increased serotonergic activity has also been implicated in various behavioral and psychological characteristics of AN, including reduced food intake, perfectionism, and rigidity. Such evidence suggests that premorbid disturbances in this neurotransmitter might be a risk factor in the development of AN (Kaye, 2008). However, the influence of nutritional status on physiological processes requires caution in the interpretation of changes identified in AN, as these disturbances may be secondary to semi-starvation rather than contributing factors to the disorder’s development (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998).
While specific causal factors have not been identified, investigators have made progress regarding some of the factors that may contribute to the perpetuation of the illness or the risk of relapse. Mayer et al. found that among inpatients who had fully restored their BMI to &gt; 20kg/m2, those with a higher percentage of body fat were less likely to relapse in the year following hospitalization (Mayer, Roberto, Glasofer, Etu, Gallagher, Wang, Heymsfield, Pierson, Attia, &amp; Devlin, 2007). Furthermore, Schebendach et al. examined patients’ food records obtained prior to hospital discharge and found that those whose diets had greater variety and higher energy density were more likely to have a good clinical outcome during the year following hospital discharge (Schebendach, Mayer, Devlin, Attia, Contento, Wolf, &amp; Walsh, 2008).

===Treatment of AN===

Despite the fact that AN is an old illness, effective treatments continue to elude clinicians. Studies in this area are few, and none have identified clear empirical support for particular psychotherapeutic or pharmacologic treatments. In part, the challenges to treatment research in AN have resulted from features of the illness itself, including the low prevalence of AN in the general population, and the small percentage of individuals with AN who are treatment-seeking. These characteristics of AN make it difficult to recruit and retain adequate numbers of subjects for clinical studies (Wilson et al. 2007). Additionally, the medical issues present in AN make management difficult and expensive, further complicating efforts to rigorously study psychiatric interventions for this disorder. 

Treatment has evolved using various settings, including outpatient, day treatment, and hospital-based programs. It is generally accepted that treatment for AN needs to emphasize weight restoration. Behavioral management programs, aimed at normalizing weight and eating behavior, reinforce healthy behaviors and overall clinical progress with the use of consistently applied contingencies. While it is always desirable to utilize the least restrictive treatment setting in order to facilitate recovery, structured treatment programs such as inpatient, residential, and partial hospital programs may be necessary when outpatient efforts are unsuccessful or unavailable, or when medical or psychiatric status requires a higher level of care to assure safety. Inpatient treatment is often recommended for individuals who have rapidly lost a substantial amount of weight (usually defined by a weight below 75% ideal body weight for one’s height, or a BMI of 16.5kg/m2). Voluntary treatment is also highly preferable, but involuntary arrangements may, at times, be appropriate, especially when a patient’s weight falls into a medically dangerous range (Attia &amp; Walsh, 2009). 

Treatment for AN should target full restoration of normal weight with associated resolution of physiological changes that may have developed in the context of acute starvation. Healthy weight ranges are usually defined as being at least 90% of weight recommended for given height, but should consider pre-illness weight and weights at which normal physiological functioning such as normal menstrual activity is known to occur (Attia &amp; Walsh, 2009). Treatment plans may include specific behavioral expectations (e.g., eat 100% of food that is prescribed by a treatment program, utilize staff observation and other treatment interventions aimed to help interrupt purging behaviors, achieve recommended weight gain, etc.). Failure to make clinical progress may be met with additional interventions aimed at increasing caloric intake and decreasing behaviors of illness. Examples of these interventions may include prescription of additional food or nutritional supplements, increase of supervision, and decrease of prescribed activity. Such interventions are not intended to be punishment for &quot;bad behavior,&quot; but rather flexible changes to facilitate the ultimate goals of weight gain and recovery.

In behavioral programs, patients are prescribed a diet of an adequate number of calories to achieve weight restoration. Approximately 3500 kcal over maintenance requirements are needed for every pound gained; therefore, sizeable numbers of calories are needed to achieve consistent weight gain. Treatment programs for AN differ in prescription of nutritional plan. Programs that achieve the typical weight gain rates of 2-4 lbs/week generally prescribe 3500-4000 kcal/day to patients at the peak of their weight gain needs. However, calories are typically started at a lower level and increased in a step-wise fashion in order to avoid refeeding syndrome, a syndrome consisting of serious, potentially life-threatening medical symptoms that may occur as refeeding begins and limited nutrient stores are tapped for catabolic processes (Attia &amp; Walsh, 2009). Symptoms of refeeding syndrome may include hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, significant fluid retention (both peripheral and visceral including risk of congestive heart failure (Mehanna, Moledina, &amp; Travis, 2008). Risk factors for the development of refeeding syndrome include seriously low weight (e.g., BMI &lt; 16.5 kg/m2), recent precipitous weight loss, and metabolic disturbance upon presentation, including significant hypokalemia. It is recommended that physical status, including weight, presence of edema, and electrolyte levels be evaluated closely during the first two weeks of acute refeeding.

The Columbia Center for Eating Disorders begins weight restoration treatment with a caloric prescription of 1800 kcal/day. Pending medical stability (generally determined within the first week of hospitalization), the daily diet is increased by 400 kcal every 2 to 3 days until it reaches 3800 kcal, 3000 kcal of which are provided in solid food and the remaining 800 kcal of which are provided in liquid supplement. Because a large part of treating AN emphasizes restoring not only weight, but normal eating behaviors, oral feedings are preferable to nasogastric ones whenever possible. However, this option may be considered for resistant patients, or those who do not enter treatment voluntarily.

Patients in behavioral management programs are also offered a variety of therapeutic interventions from a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, commonly composed of physicians, psychologists, nurses, nutritionists, clinical social workers, and occupational therapists (Attia &amp; Walsh, 2009). Treatment is aimed at confronting disordered eating behaviors and &quot;feared&quot; foods, as well as practicing normal eating. Meal and post-meal supervision, food shopping and cooking groups, and outings to local restaurants may be included in treatment programs to help patients process normal food selection and behaviors around eating with support from staff and peers. Additionally, patients generally participate in regular therapy and discharge planning sessions with psychologists, psychiatric residents, and social workers in individual, group, and family settings.

Such structured and comprehensive behavioral programs are largely effective in helping patients with AN to normalize weight. Yet additional outpatient treatment dedicated to relapse prevention is generally necessary in order to maintain healthy eating and weight. Specific outpatient psychotherapies have been examined in AN, and preliminary evidence supports one of these approaches—a family-based therapy (FBT) for adolescents with AN—as a potentially helpful intervention for outpatient weight restoration and maintenance. FBT, also called, the &quot;Maudsley&quot; method, named for an approach that was developed at London’s Maudsley Hospital, assigns parents the responsibility of refeeding their child, utilizing many of the same treatment principles and reinforcements of structured behavioral programs. For adults, however, results with FBT have been less successful (Lock, 2001; Russell, Szmukler, Dare, &amp; Eisler, 1987). 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has also been studied in outpatients with AN, with more mixed results than that shown for FBT. CBT for AN was first described by Garner, Vitousek, and Pike in 1982 (Garner, Vitousek, &amp; Pike, 1997). The regimen shares many basic therapeutic strategies with Fairburn’s CBT model of BN (1985), but emphasizes the AN-specific issues of enhancing motivation, recognizing the problems associated with semi-starvation, and encouraging weight gain. In a small randomized controlled trial of 33 weight-restored women with AN, Pike et al. found CBT to be more helpful than nutritional counseling at preventing relapse (53% relapse among those receiving nutritional counseling versus 22% relapse among those receiving CBT) (Pike, Walsh, Vitousek, Wilson, &amp; Bauer, 2003). However, a larger study using CBT together with fluoxetine vs. placebo for relapse prevention found that the entire sample had relapse rates of greater than 40% (Walsh et al. 2006). Additional studies have identified clinical improvement in those receiving CBT; however, it is unclear whether CBT fares any better than other specific psychotherapies for individuals with AN (McIntosh, Jordan, Carter, Luty, McKenzie, Bulik, Frampton, &amp; Joyce, 2005; Ball &amp; Mitchell, 2004; Channon, De Silva, Hemsley, &amp; Perkins, 1989).

Because individuals with AN commonly suffer from anxiety, depression, and obsessionality, medications that are generally helpful for these symptoms in other clinical populations have been studied in AN. Overall, results from these studies, most of which have examined antidepressant medications in small samples, have been disappointing (Attia &amp; Schroeder, 2005). Preliminary evidence is more promising regarding the potential utility of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication, in the treatment of AN. Case reports, open treatment trials, and one small randomized controlled trial (Bissada, Tasca, Barber, &amp; Bradwejn, 2008) suggest that olanzapine may help with both weight gain and alleviating psychological symptoms, namely obsessionality, for individuals with AN (McKnight &amp; Park, 2010).

The generally negative findings from studies of antidepressants in acute AN have led some to posit that the poor response to medication may result from the state of malnutrition and its influence on factors that affect medication response, such as neurotransmitter activity. As a result, medication studies in acutely weight-restored individuals have been conducted in order to examine the possible utility of medication at preventing relapse. Unfortunately, these studies have also failed to identify an effective pharmacologic treatment for AN. For example, a large, placebo-controlled medication trial conducted by Walsh et al. did not demonstrate any benefit from fluoxetine in the treatment of weight-restored patients with AN (Walsh et al. 2006).

AN remains a challenging psychiatric condition for which a single clear, empirically-validated standard of care does not exist. There is no question, however, that weight restoration is an essential first step in treating this disorder, and that behavioral methods are often effective in facilitating this process. Medications alone are used less frequently in the management of AN, but are commonly incorporated as part of a multimodal approach to taking care of patients with this complex disorder.

==Bulimia Nervosa==

===Clinical Features and Epidemiology===

In contrast to AN, bulimia nervosa (BN) is a relatively new eating disorder, first described in the 1970s (Russell, 1979) and officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998). BN is defined by the frequent episodic consumption of objectively large amounts of food and the use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to avoid weight gain. DSM-IV specifies that these episodes must occur at least twice weekly for three months in order to meet full diagnostic criteria for BN. A DSM-IV diagnosis of BN also requires overconcern with body shape and weight (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) (see Table 2). BN is more common than AN; an epidemiological review by Hoek and van Hoeken report a 1.0% aggregated prevalence rate for BN (Hoek &amp; van Hoeken, 2003). Additionally, the gender ratio for BN reflects higher percentages of men affected than that seen in AN: 1.5% for females and 0.5% for males (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope Jr, &amp; Kessler, 2007). Other studies have indicated even higher prevalence rates of 5-10% for more broadly defined manifestations of the disorder characterized by occasional binging and purging (Walsh, 2008). New diagnostic criteria being proposed for DSM-5 would lessen the frequency criteria of binge and purge episodes for BN to once weekly for three months, making it more likely that some of these sub-threshold cases currently classified as EDNOS would be considered full syndrome BN according to the proposed diagnostic system (American Psychiatric Association, 2010). Like AN, BN affects predominantly adolescents and young adults in industrialized societies (Fairburn &amp; Harrison, 2003), however, the disorder has been described in a variety of non-Western cultures as well (Nobakht &amp; Dezhkam, 2000; Pike &amp; Mizushima, 2005).

Though there is considerable overlap in the characteristics of AN and BN, these eating disorders are distinct from each other in several important respects. First, the characteristic feature of BN is that attempts to restrict food intake are interrupted by episodes of binge eating, during which individuals consume an unambiguously large amounts of food within discrete periods of time, and experience a sense of loss of control (Fairburn &amp; Harrison, 2003). Binges are usually followed by purging, the most common methods being self-induced vomiting and the abuse of laxatives and diuretics. The frequency and intensity of these binge/purge episodes tend to escalate over time, enough so that many patients develop the ability to induce vomiting without mechanically triggering the gag reflex (Walsh, 2008). A small subset of patients with BN do not purge, but rather compensate for binge episodes with fasting and exercise. The combination of binge eating with extreme weight-control behavior generally places individuals with BN at a normal body weight, distinguishing them from those with AN, who are, by definition, underweight (Fairburn &amp; Harrison, 2003). Because patients with BN typically present with a healthy body weight, the disorder has historically been associated with a significantly lower crude mortality rate (0.32%) than that described in AN (Steinhausen &amp; Weber, 2009). However, results from a recent study by Crow et al. have called this into question, describing mortality rates for BN as high as 3.9% (Crow et al. 2009).

'''Table 2.  Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994)'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| A)	Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:

1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.

2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

B) Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

C) The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months.

D) Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.

E) The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa.

|-
| Specify type:
Purging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.

Nonpurging type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has used other inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.

|}

While there may be fewer medical risks of BN as compared with AN, BN also is associated with several potentially serious physiological complications. The most common medical problems in BN are dehydration and hypokalemia due to vomiting or the consistent over-ingestion of laxatives or diuretics. Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may be present, especially in individuals who replenish their fluid requirements with large amounts of plain water. Metabolic alkalosis may occur in individuals who purge by vomiting with the consequent loss of gastric acid. Conversely, acidosis may be present in those who abuse laxatives (Walsh, 2008). Individuals with BN may also develop a callus or scar on the dorsal side of the hand, commonly named &quot;Russell’s sign,&quot; due to the repeated impact of the teeth rubbing on the hand that may result from manual stimulation of the gag reflex (Halmi, 1987; Russell, 1979). In addition, the recurrent exposure to acid from vomitus may contribute to the gradual weakening of tooth enamel and eventual dental erosion causing a &quot;moth-eaten&quot; appearance of teeth. More serious consequences of bulimic symptoms such as esophageal tearing or gastric rupture have also been described (Walsh, 2008). 

As in AN, individuals with BN tend to present with psychiatric comorbidities (Steinhausen &amp; Weber, 2009). In his meta-analysis of 79 studies of BN, Steinhausen identified mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and impulsive behavioral disturbances, including substance use disorders and self-injurious behaviors, as pathologies frequently seen among patients with this disorder. In addition, Steinhausen found that patients with BN often cross over to develop other eating disorders (up to 32% of individuals studied). The most common crossover was to EDNOS, followed by AN, and finally BED, though it is suspected that crossover to this diagnosis is underreported, as BED was not yet officially recognized as a disorder at the beginning of the time period studied. Perhaps even more striking is the fact that one-third of patients who present for treatment for BN have past histories of AN (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998). The prognosis for individuals with BN is better than that seen in AN, although outcome studies suggest that significant numbers continue to struggle with symptoms of illness years after initial presentation (Steinhausen &amp; Weber, 2009).

===Etiology===

Researchers have identified a range of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that might predict risk for the development of BN. First, there is good evidence that genetics may predispose certain individuals to BN. In fact, one study showed heritability to account for as much as 60% of variance in liability to the disorder (Bulik, Sullivan, &amp; Kendler, 1998). Neurochemical abnormalities have also been described in BN, including those that, on a theoretical basis, offer support for several hypotheses regarding possible mechanisms responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of BN symptoms. Both the serotonergic system, involved in control of hunger and satiety, and dopaminergic system, central to the function of driven behaviors and reward, have been implicated in BN (Kaye, 2008). Additionally, research has shown the release of cholecystokinin, a gut hormone responsible for signaling post-meal satiety, to be blunted in BN (Devlin, Walsh, Guss, Kissileff, Liddle, &amp; Petkova, 1997). A stomach relaxation reflex following the ingesting of a small liquid meal also appears to be lessened in BN, as compared with the normal gastric response seen in control subjects (Walsh, Zimmerli, Devlin, Guss, &amp; Kissileff, 2003).

Certain psychological characteristics have also been associated with BN. Specifically, depression, anxiety disorders, low self-esteem, and premorbid AN have been described in BN and have been examined as possible predisposing factors (Fairburn, Welch, Doll, Davies, &amp; O'Connor, 1997). Discordant or weight-critical family environment, history of obesity, physical or sexual abuse, and the general cultural pressure to be thin are also thought to contribute to the risk for developing BN (Walsh &amp; Devlin, 1998).

===Treatment of BN===

In contrast to the status of treatment research for AN, there is a solid evidence base for the treatment of BN. Many randomized controlled trials have been conducted successfully in BN, identifying both pharmacological and psychological interventions that are effective at reducing or eliminating the core symptoms of BN. Systematic reviews of available treatment studies consistently conclude that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as well as antidepressant medications are both effective for short-term management of BN (Shapiro, Berkman, Brownley, Sedway, Lohr, &amp; Bulik, 2007).	

====Psychological treatments for BN====

CBT—specifically, a form of CBT that focuses on identifying, examining, and modifying a cycle of interrelated thoughts and behaviors that maintain the eating disorder—has been found consistently to be helpful for BN (Fairburn, 1985). For example, patients with BN may describe cognitions that support a connection between self-evaluation and body shape and weight. These thoughts and beliefs may lead individuals with BN to excessive dietary restriction and inappropriate weight control behaviors in order to affect self-evaluation. This process of restricting, in turn, predisposes individuals to binge eating and purging, which has the ultimate consequence of worsening self view and reinforcing the eating disordered behaviors. CBT sessions for BN focus on identifying inconsistencies in the patient’s established cognitions and related behaviors in order to help identify alternative thoughts and healthier behaviors. This treatment typically involves 20 sessions that take place over the course of 4-5 months, and has been utilized in both individual and group settings. CBT appears to be associated with lasting cessation of binge eating and purging in 30-50% of BN cases, with many others achieving substantial improvements not only in binge/purge symptoms, but also in self-esteem, social functioning, and general psychological well-being (Wilson et al. 2007).

Another outpatient psychotherapy shown to be helpful in BN is interpersonal therapy (IPT), a short-term, structured treatment originally developed for depression (Klerman, Weissman, Rounsaville, &amp; Chevron, 1984) and adapted by Fairburn for BN (Fairburn, 1993). This intervention does not focus directly on eating disorder symptoms, but rather emphasizes current interpersonal problems that are thought to be maintaining the eating disorder. Though CBT, based on the empirical and clinical evidence, is generally the preferred treatment for BN, the NICE (2004) guidelines have recommended that IPT be considered as an alternative to CBT (Wilson et al. 2007).

While evidence-based psychotherapies, like CBT and IPT, are consistently effective in clinical trials, these specialized treatments have not been successfully disseminated to community practitioners. A shortage of therapists trained to deliver these treatments impedes access to evidence based interventions for many individuals with BN. There has therefore been interest in whether self-help versions of CBT may be more accessible and cost effective options for BN treatment (Wilson et al. 2007). In fact, there is some evidence that Guided Self Help (GSH) options that provide support and information to the user of a self-help manual may be useful for a subset of individuals with BN, and may be an alternative for those who do not have access to specialist treatment options (Grilo, 2000).

====Pharmacotherapy for BN====
	
Several medications are helpful in the treatment of BN. The high rates of comorbidity with depression seen in BN led to initial attempts to treat this eating disorder with antidepressant medications. Randomized controlled trials using antidepressant medications, initially examining monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), began soon after the first published descriptions of BN. These trials consistently found benefit associated with antidepressant compared with placebo at reducing binge eating and purging behaviors in BN samples (Broft, Berner, &amp; Walsh, 2009). The more favorable side effect profile of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) led to more trials using these medications once they became available. In fact, following a large multi-site trial that demonstrated medication efficacy in 387 individuals with BN, fluoxetine became the only medication approved for use in BN by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Walsh, 2008). It is of note that the dose of fluoxetine recommended for BN (60 mg) is higher than that typically used in treating depression, and also that antidepressant medications are effective at treating BN irrespective of depression symptoms (Walsh, Gladis, Roose, Stewart, Stetner, &amp; Glassman, 1988).

Other classes of medication have also been studied for possible utility in treating BN. Specifically, topiramate, a medicine used to treat seizures that has been found to suppress appetite and cause weight loss, has been examined in BN and associated with benefit in several studies (Hedges, Reimherr, Hoopes, Rosenthal, Kamin, Karim, &amp; Capece, 2003; Hoopes, Reimherr, Hedges, Rosenthal, Kamin, Karim, Capece, &amp; Karvois, 2003; Nickel, Tritt, Muehlbacher, Gil, Mitterlehner, Kaplan, Lahmann, Leiberich, Krawczyk, &amp; Kettler, 2005). However, cognitive side effects and paresthesias associated with topiramate lessen its acceptability to BN patients compared with SSRIs. Odansetron, a medication used primarily for the treatment of nausea in medical and surgical settings, has been tried in one small trial of BN with some benefit (Faris, Kim, Meller, Goodale, Oakman, Hofbauer, Marshall, Daughters, Banerjee-Stevens, &amp; Eckert, 2000).

Although medications (most commonly SSRIs) are useful for short-term management of BN—especially those who have not responded to CBT as a sole intervention—there are few data to support continued efficacy over the long-term (Nakash-Eisikovits, Dierberger, &amp; Westen, 2002). Several studies do support the enhanced  effect of combining medication with CBT for treatment of BN, and some authors suggest that multi-modal treatment is the approach most likely to be associated with long-term remission and symptom reduction rates (Wilson et al. 2007).

For patients with BN who do not respond to evidence based outpatient approaches, many of whom present with psychological co-morbidities or multi-impulsive behaviors, more intensive forms of treatment, such as hospital-based and day treatment may be necessary (Walsh, 2008). Inpatient hospitalization programs for BN typically aim to break the cycle of binge eating and purging, and are followed whenever possible by additional treatments that support the continuation of structured eating, strategies to prevent or reduce likelihood of post-meal purging, and weight maintenance. As with AN, inpatient programs for BN generally include several treatment approaches offered by a multi-disciplinary team of clinicians.

==Binge Eating Disorder==

===Clinical Features and Epidemiology===

Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by repeated, persistent episodes of binge eating in the absence of the inappropriate compensatory behaviors seen in BN. According to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, BED is defined by the consumption of unusually large quantities of food in discrete periods of time together with the experience of loss of control over eating. DSM-IV also specifies that binge eating in BED is associated with emotional distress, and must occur at least twice a week for six months to meet full diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Currently a provisional diagnosis under the larger heading of EDNOS in the DSM-IV, BED is being proposed as a distinct eating disorder in the upcoming DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2010).

In contrast to both AN and BN, BED is seen most frequently in middle-aged individuals, and is evenly distributed across gender and racial demographics, though there is some evidence to suggest that women may be more likely to present for treatment (Tanofsky, Wilfley, Spurrell, Welch, &amp; Brownell, 1997; Wilson et al. 2007). BED is also distinct from the other eating disorders in that binge eating occurs in the context of general overeating as opposed to a setting of dietary restraint (Fairburn &amp; Harrison, 2003). Because of the nature of its symptoms, BED has a strong association with obesity. Although present in approximately 3% of adults, the disorder has a higher prevalence among obese individuals (Grilo, 2002). In fact, BED is present in as many as 5-10% of patients seeking weight control treatment (Fairburn &amp; Harrison, 2003). Because of its links to obesity, BED is associated with increased mortality and risk for numerous medical disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, respiratory illness, cardiac problems, and osteoarthritis (Wonderlich, Gordon, Mitchell, Crosby, &amp; Engel, 2009).

It is important to remember that individuals with obesity do not necessarily suffer from BED. Research has identified a distinct set of psychological characteristics that distinguish patients with BED from obese individuals who are not affected by the disorder. Compared to obese individuals without BED, those with BED report increased rates of depression, anxiety, and dissatisfaction with shape and weight similar to that seen in BN (Walsh, 2008; Yanovski, 1993). Individuals with BED also report a lower health-related quality of life, less life satisfaction, and more functional impairment than obese individuals without eating disorders (Wonderlich et al. 2009). Moreover, eating behavior studies have found that, when instructed to binge eat in a laboratory setting, individuals with BED eat more than their obese counterparts without the disorder (Yanovski, Leet, Yanovski, Flood, Gold, Kissileff, &amp; Walsh, 1992; Goldfein, Walsh, Devlin, Lachaussée, &amp; Kissileff, 1993; Sysko, Devlin, Walsh, Zimmerli, &amp; Kissileff, 2007). Such evidence confirms the meaningful diagnostic and clinical distinction between binge eaters and non-binge eaters within the obese population.
In preparation for the upcoming publication of DSM-5, there has been extensive debate about whether the current data available about BED support its identification as an eating disorder separate from the EDNOS category. In their review of BED, Wonderlich et al. argue that the consistent clustering of disturbed eating symptoms in affected individuals, together with the psychological distress, functional impairment, and significant rates of psychiatric comorbidity associated with BED, support its meeting the definition of illness (Wonderlich et al. 2009). In contrast to AN and BN, BED appears to have a shorter and more variable course. BED is associated with both high rates of treatment response and the possibility of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, but also possible symptom recurrence. Patients with BED are less likely to cross over to another active eating disorder than are individuals with AN or BN. Together, this evidence paints a portrait of BED as a variable, yet sometimes chronic disorder that often fluctuates over time.

===Etiology===

While researchers speculate that biological, psychological, and environmental factors contribute to the development of BED, as they do other eating disorders, the specifics of these risk factors for BED are still relatively poorly understood. Research does indicate that presence of obesity increases an individual’s likelihood of developing BED (Fairburn, Doll, Welch, Hay, Davies, &amp; O'Connor, 1998). Additionally, there is preliminary data to suggest that BED runs in families, with heritability ranging between 0.39 and 0.57 (Hudson, Lalonde, Berry, Pindyck, Bulik, Crow, McElroy, Laird, Tsuang, &amp; Walsh, 2006; Javaras, Laird, Reichborn-Kjennerud, Bulik, Pope, &amp; Hudson, 2008). These substantial familial associations implicate a potential additive effect of genes on the development of BED. However, research has yielded mixed evidence regarding the preexistence of chemical or neurological abnormalities in individuals with this disorder. Though some early studies have yet to find any distinct neurochemical or hormonal anomalies among binge eaters, others tentatively associate BED with decreased levels of the hunger-stimulating hormone, ghrelin (Geliebter, Gluck, &amp; Hashim, 2005). An individual’s development of BED may also be influenced by numerous non-specific risk factors for psychiatric disorders, such as parental depression and adverse childhood experiences (Fairburn et al. 1998). 

===Treatment of BED===

Treatment of BED usually aims to help patients normalize eating behavior, with any weight loss achieved being secondary to the behavioral improvement. While excess weight clearly represents a significant medical problem for some individuals with BED, it is uncertain whether these individuals receive the same level of benefit (i.e., lasting weight loss) from behavioral weight loss treatment programs as non-binge eaters. Hence treatments that aim to improve binge eating behavior are typically recommended when BED is also present in the overweight or obese state (Wilson et al. 2007).

Specialized psychotherapies have been shown to be helpful in addressing the psychological symptoms of BED. Both CBT and IPT are reliably effective in eliminating binge eating and reducing eating disorder psychopathology both in the short and long term. Although these specialized psychotherapies do not typically yield clinically significant weight loss, they do often prevent further weight gain by reducing or eliminating binge eating behavior (Wilson, Wilfley, Agras, &amp; Bryson, 2010).

Specifically, there is strong empirical support for the use of a form of CBT in BED. Adapted from Fairburn’s CBT for BN, this specialized treatment emphasizes recognizing and modifying unhealthy eating patterns (Fairburn, Marcus, &amp; Wilson, 1993). CBT for BED is associated with a high treatment completion rate (approximately 80%), as well as remission from binge eating in 50% of patients, and general improvements in depression and other psychosocial impairments. IPT has been shown to be about equally as effective as CBT for treating BED in both the short and long term (Wilson et al. 2007). Finally, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a specialized treatment that focuses on emotional regulation and gaining greater awareness of chaotic eating habits that characterize BED. While it does not boast as strong of empirical support as CBT and IPT, DBT seems to be a well-suited and durable alternative treatment for BED (Telch, Agras, &amp; Linehan, 2001).

However, the high cost of these specialized treatments, along with the limited availability of therapists who are adequately trained to perform them, has prompted researchers to investigate more accessible, cost-effective treatment options for BED. Wilson et al. found a mode of guided self help based on CBT (CBTgsh) to be equally as effective as IPT in eliminating binge eating in both the short and long term (Wilson et al. 2010). It is of note, however, that, neither CBTgsh nor IPT produced as much weight loss as did a separate behavioral weight loss treatment.

In addition to psychotherapies, researchers have examined the efficacy of various medications in the treatment of BED (Bodell &amp; Devlin, 2009). Consistent with evidence from combined treatment studies of BN, Devlin et al. found CBT to be more effective than fluoxetine as adjunct treatments to group behavioral weight loss treatment. While the addition of fluoxetine to CBT provided little if any improvement in binge reduction, the medication did decrease psychopathologies often associated with BED, such as anxiety, depression, and dietary restriction (Devlin, Goldfein, Petkova, Jiang, Raizman, Wolk, Mayer, Carino, Bellace, Kamenetz, Dobrow, &amp; Walsh, 2005). Leombruni et al., on the other hand, found sertraline to effect a significant improvement in both binge behavior and binge frequency, as well as clinically significant weight loss for up to 24 weeks in women with BED (Leombruni, Piero, Brustolin, Mondelli, Levi, Campisi, Marozio, Abbate-Daga, &amp; Fassino, 2006). Still other evidence from pharmacotherapy studies of BED suggests high and rapid rates of relapse, as well as simple noncompliance with extended open-label treatments (Wilson et al. 2007).

The numerous characteristics of BED that distinguish it from AN and BN render it a subject of unique interest within the field. Because formal research on BED is in relatively preliminary stages, there is still much to learn about its etiology, symptomotology, and treatment. Future efforts would be well-directed towards studying the longitudinal course of the disorder, untangling the complex issues of its management, and further exploring biological and psychological factors that put individuals at risk for developing BED.

==Conclusion==

Eating disorders, including AN, BN, and BED are serious conditions in which significant disturbances in eating behavior are accompanied by distressing cognitions about body shape and weight. They are all illnesses with physical, as well as psychological manifestations. Once their symptoms are established, eating disorders may contribute to significant functional impairment, and are often very difficult to interrupt. Evidence-based treatments, including pharmacotherapy and CBT, are helpful in the treatment of BN and BED, but additional research is needed to establish empirically-supported treatments for AN, the eating disorder with the highest rates of morbidity and mortality.

The '''spin''' technique is  a good choice when you want to model an object that is radially symmetric and you know what the cross section of the object looks like. This the the virtual equivalent of using a [[w:lathe|lathe]] to create an object in the real world. With the spin technique, we draw an outline of one half of the outline of the object, and then spin the outline about an axis to create the object's mesh.

==Modeling==
[[Image:Red Wine Glas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photo of a real-world goblet]]
Here is a real-world goblet. The picture is not an orthographic image, so we cannot directly copy the outline, but it is close.

===Setup===
We now model the outline. Let's start with the default model.&lt;ref&gt;Default model:select ''file→new.''&lt;/ref&gt; We want to create an initial object consisting of a two-dimensional outline, so select the cube, go to edit mode, and delete all the vertices. This leaves us with an object that has no vertices as a nice place to start.  We want the resulting goblet to sit at the origin with the Z axis as its axis of symmetry so we get a front view.&lt;ref name=front_view&gt;Front view:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since we will be working directly with mesh vertices, the ''manipulator'' is a hindrance, so turn it off.&lt;ref&gt;manipulator off: press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}} to bring up the ''Manipulator'' menu, then select ''Enable/Disable''&lt;/ref&gt;. (With the manipulator on, it is easy to accidentally move a vertex out of the editing plane, but we want a 2D cross-section.) We are now ready to create the two-dimensional outline as a chain of vertices with the first and last vertices on the axis.

===First Vertex===
Now, place the first vertex: this will be the center of the bottom of the goblet, so place it slightly above the origin on the Z axis.&lt;ref&gt;Place a vertex:{{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Why? Well, for two reasons: in the real world, the bottom of a goblet is not actually flat. Instead. the rim is lower than the center of the bottom, so the bottom is concave and the goblet sits on a flat surface without wobbling. The second reason is that we intend to use the &quot;subsurf&quot; technique, and this technique will make a flat surface slightly convex in our virtual world, so we will preemptively start the bottom of the base with a slightly concave surface.

===Finish the outline===
Add the second vertex, which will be on the rim of the goblet's base: move the cursor to the X axis at about -3, and add a vertex.&lt;ref name=add&gt;Add a vertex:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}, or {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}},{{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Add additional vertices to your outline by moving the cursor to the desired location and adding,&lt;ref name=add/&gt; for as many vertices as you need to accurately model the outline. Since you will be using subsurf later, make sure that you place two vertices near each other when you need a sharp curve in your outline. Otherwise, subsurf will convert your sharp curve into a wide smooth curve. This is wonderful advice, but it won't work, because Blender interprets the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}} differently when you attempt to place an extruded vertex too near the vertex from which you are extruding. One quick way around this is to create your vertices sufficiently far from each other to avoid the problem, and then come back and move them&lt;ref&gt; Move a vertex: select it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}, move it with the cursor, and then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the correct spots later.

Eventually, you will place the last vertex, which will become the point at the bottom of the inside of the goblet. This point should be be on the Z axis. Your outline is done!

===Spin===
Now, to spin it. first, make sure that you are still in edit mode, and that the last vertex is selected. Set the cursor to the selection.&lt;ref&gt;Cursor to selection: ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|SKEY}}, then ''cursor&amp;rarr;selection''&lt;/ref&gt; Now, get a top view:&lt;ref&gt;top view:{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}&lt;/ref&gt; you are now looking at your outline from the top, and it should look like a straight line along the X axis with one end at the cursor on the Z axis. (If this is not the case, select and move points to the X axis and check your work by switching back to the front view, then come back to the top view.) Now select the whole outline&lt;ref&gt;Select all:{{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} once or twice, until all are displayed in yellow&lt;/ref&gt;  and then move to the button menu to perform the spin. Set the rotation to 360 and the count to 12 (or another number of your choice) and click on &quot;spin.&quot; An elaborate circle will appear. Go to the front view&lt;ref name=front_view/&gt; to see your un-smooth goblet.

===Finish up===
Since you are in edit mode and you have the whole mesh selected, this is a good time to remove duplicate vertices. The two vertices on the Z axis (base bottom center and bulb bottom center) were duplicated 12 times, and the entire outline was duplicated once when the circle closed at the end of the spin. Remove the duplicates.&lt;ref&gt; Remove duplicate vertices:press {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and select ''Remove Doubles''&lt;/ref&gt; If you fail to to this, the subsurf operation will create a cusp at the two centers, and a crease at the duplicated outline.

If you placed the two Z-axis vertices by hand, they may not be exactly on the axis, and therefore may still be duplicated, leaving a tiny &quot;hole&quot; at the axis. Fix this by merging each of the two sets separately:
# select the vertices to merge.
# merge at center.&lt;ref&gt;Merge at center:Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}},''Merge &amp;rarr; At Center'', confirm with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Now start to smooth by using the subsurf in the button window. First add a modifier and select subsurf. Set levels to 2 Then, use ''smooth'' in the texture window. You now have a goblet model.

[[Image:Spin_a_goblet.png|500px]]
{{clear}}
The image shows four objects: the two-dimensional outline, a smoothed version of the two-dimensional outline, the result of spinning the outline, and the result of subsurfing and smoothing. As you follow the procedure above, you will not actually have more than one object at a time as shown here.

==Rendering==
[[Image:Rendered_spun_goblet.png|right]]
As with the other two goblets, It is difficult to fully evaluate the model unless you render it. However, a &quot;pretty&quot; rendering requires at least minimal materials, lighting, and scenery. This section is a cookbook approach to providing these minimal elements and is not really a useful tutorial, so we won't explain the concepts. These topics are treated at length in later tutorials. If you wish to explore these subjects in more depth, go to the appropriate tutorials.
*The Goblet material: plain glass.
*The tablecloth: A (non-existent) table with a white tablecloth, in a featureless room painted yellow.
*The lighting: one bright lamp.

===Material===
*Go to object mode and select the goblet.
*In the Materials button window, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material|add a material]] to the goblet, and name it &quot;glass.&quot;
*In the ''Material'' tab, set the color to black (set R, G, and B all to 0.000) Here, &quot;Black&quot; merely means &quot;do not add any color.&quot; It does not mean that the goblet looks black.
*Set the Alpha to 0.1 (i.e., quite transparent.)
*In the &quot;''Mirror Transp&quot; tab, click the ''Ray Trace'' button, set the IOR to 1.5, and set ''Depth'' to 6 (or higher on a very fast computer.)

===Tablecloth===
*In the main window, put the cursor at the origin and switch to top view. In object mode, add a plane and then scale it to quite large. This is your tablecloth
*Go to object mode and select the tablecloth. 
*In the ''Material'' tab, set the color to white and set the Alpha to 1.000 (i.e., opaque.)
*In the ''Shaders'' tab, click on ''Trashado.'' This allows the tablecloth to show the ray traced shadow of your goblet instead of a fake shadow.

===Camera and lighting===
Render the scene. If you started with the default camera and light the scene will be too dark and the shadow effect from the lamp will not be too pretty.  To fix this:
*move the lamp higher and farther away.
*turn up the intensity.
Now adjust the camera:
*shift to camera view
*dolly and aim the camera
*move the camera back some
*render

      <text xml:space="preserve">The syntax for the &quot;Repeat&quot; command is as follows:  Repeat condition.  The program executes the command between Repeat and End until the codition is true.  The condition is tested when End is encountered, therefore, the commands are always executed at least once. The Repeat command is similar to the While command except that the While command executes while condition is true and tests when While is encountered. Following are examples showing the differences in output of similar Repeat and While commands:

'''Repeat Program'''
&lt;pre&gt;
:0→x
:Repeat X=1
:Disp X
:X+1→X
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;
The output of this program is the single character 0.

'''While Program'''
&lt;pre&gt;
:0→x
:While X≤1
:Disp X
:X+1→X
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;
The output of this program is the characters 0 and 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sounds and Alphabet==
Like other Turkic languages of Central Asia (e.g., Kazakh) Kyrgyz uses the Cyryllic (Russian) alphabet. The sounds represented are typically similar to those in Russian, with a few exceptions.

Аа -- Like the vowel in English “hall.”&lt;br /&gt;
Бб -- Like English “b” in “boy.” Between vowels, often like English “w.”&lt;br /&gt;
Вв -- Like “v”in “void”&lt;br /&gt;
Гг -- At the beginning of words,like “g” in “grin.” Between vowels, like a cross between “g” and the “h” in hat, or a sort of gurgle like the French “r”.&lt;br /&gt;
Дд -- Like “d” in “delta” - that is, made with the tongue off of the upper front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;
Ее -- At the beginning of a word, like the “ye” in “yet.” In the middle or at the end of a word, like the vowel in “let.”&lt;br /&gt;
Ёё -- A “yo” sound, with a much purer “o” than that typically found in English. &lt;br /&gt;
Жж -- Like the “j” in “judge.” (In loan words from Russian, like the “ge” in “rouge.”)&lt;br /&gt;
Зз -- Like the “z” in “zebra.”&lt;br /&gt;
Ии -- Like the “ee” in “bee.”&lt;br /&gt;
Йй -- Like the “y” in “buoy.”&lt;br /&gt;
Кк -- Like the “c” in “cat.”&lt;br /&gt;
Лл -- Like the “l” in “like.”&lt;br /&gt;
Мм -- Like the “m” in “make.”&lt;br /&gt;
Нн -- Like the “n” in “new.”&lt;br /&gt;
Ӊӊ -- Like the “ng” in “sang.”&lt;br /&gt;
Оо -- Like the “o” in “bottle.”&lt;br /&gt;
Өө-- Like the vowel in English “turn,” or, like the German “ö”&lt;br /&gt;
Пп -- Like the vowel in “speech” -- that is, an unaspirated “p.”&lt;br /&gt;
Рр -- Rolled r, but usually pronounced with just a single flap of the tongue (as in Spanish “pero”)&lt;br /&gt;
Сс -- Like the “s” in “slip.”&lt;br /&gt;
Тт -- Like the “t” in “stick” ---- That is, an unaspirated “t.”&lt;br /&gt;
Уу -- Like the vowel in “flu”&lt;br /&gt;
Үү --  Like the German “ü” -- If you round your lips to say the “u” sound mentioned above, but instead attempt to make the vowel in “mean,” the resulting sound will be at least a very close approximation.&lt;br /&gt;
Фф -- Like the “f” in “flew.”&lt;br /&gt;
Хх -- A harsh sound made in the back of the throat, like the German “doch.”&lt;br /&gt;
Цц -- Like the “ts” in “cats.”&lt;br /&gt;
Чч -- Like the “ch” in “punch.”&lt;br /&gt;
Шш -- Like “sh” in “sheet.”&lt;br /&gt;
Щщ -- A sort of “sh-ch,” like the “shch” in “fish chunks” if it is said quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
Ъъ -- A short pause. &lt;br /&gt;
Ыы -- Like the first vowel in “around”&lt;br /&gt;
Ьь -- A palatization of the preceding consonant.&lt;br /&gt;
Ээ  -- Like the “e” in “let.”&lt;br /&gt;
Юю -- Like the English word “you.”&lt;br /&gt;
Яя -- Like the “ya” in “yawn.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	The letters “ц'',''щ'',''ъ,''and “ь'' are used only in loan-words taken from Russian. In spite of the differences in some sounds, Russian words are generally pronounced as they sound in Russian (thus, in a Russian word, “Ы'' sounds more like the “i” in “ill.”)&lt;br /&gt;
	The letters ӊ,ө,and ү are not found in the Russian alphabet.&lt;br /&gt;
==Voiced and Voiceless Consonants==
Consonants are generally divided into two categories, the so-called “voiced” and “voiceless.” When making voiced consonants or vowels, you use your vocal cords, whereas voiceless consonants are made without the vibration of the vocal cords. An easy way to test whether a consonant is voiced or not is to say the consonant while plugging your ears. If you hear a buzzing or rumbling inside your head, then the consonant is voiced. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Voiceless consonants in Kyrgyz are х,ч,т,п,к,ш, and с. Kyrgyz takes many loan words from Russian and other languages, and these words can include the other voiceless consonants ц,щ,and ф. All of the other consonants are voiced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Voiceless consonants often have correspondences to voiced consonants. For example, the only difference between т and д is that in the latter consonant, the vocal cords are used Otherwise, it’s the same sound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	The voiced/voiceless consonant pairs  -- that is, the letters that are apt to change from one to another -- are т/д, п/б, and к/г1. This is important because sometimes, suffixes can be changed on the basis of the last letter in the word, or they can at times change the last letter from a voiceless to a voiced consonant. Generally, if a suffix begins with consonant, it will change to match the type of consonant at the end of the word to which it is being added. So if a suffix begins with a д (which is a voiced consonant), and it is being added to a word that ends in a п (which is a voiceless consonant), then the voiced д will become a voiceless т.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Also, if a word ends in a voiceless consonant, and a suffix that begins with a vowel is added to it, then the last consonant of the word is changed to a voiced consonant. So in the case of the word китеп (book), if you wish to add the first person possessive suffix (in this case, “-им ”) so as to say “my book,” it will come out “китебим.” &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	If this explanation is confusing, it may be better to leave it behind. If you hear the language spoken a little bit, you'll catch on.
&lt;br /&gt;
==Suffixes and Vowel Harmony==
	Kyrgyz is an agglutinative language, which means that most grammatical meanings are communicated with suffixes. These can pile up at the end of a word or root. This can get a bit confusing at first. However, Kyrgyz is a wonderfully regular language, and once its logic is understood, it presents few of sorts of difficulties that tyrannize learners of Russian or German. &lt;br /&gt;
Suffixes can look a little different from word to word, because the vowels in them will change depending the last vowel in the word itself. These changes work according to rules called &quot;vowel harmony.&quot;
===Vowel Harmony===
	The family of Turkic languages (to which Kyrgyz belongs) experiences a phenomenon known as “vowel harmony.” That means that the vowels in a suffix are determined according to the last vowel in the word to which they are being added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kyrgyz vowels are linked together in pairs, of which one is a “left” vowel and one is a “right” vowel. If a suffix needs a left vowel, then it takes the left vowel that corresponds to the last vowel in the stem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the pairs:

{{TODO|Diagram to be placed here}}

'''How it works:''' “from America” is rendered “Америкадан,&quot; whereas “from Boston” is &quot;Бостондон.&quot; In the first example, the idea of “from” is expressed with the suffix “-дан”, while in the second it becomes “-дон.”  The form for this suffix (the “ablative“) is “-д←н,” meaning that the vowel between the д and the н is going to be the “left vowel” of the last vowel of the word to which the suffix is being added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last vowel in “Бостон” is “о,” and since the ablative suffix requires a left vowel, it takes the left vowel of the pair “о-у”: Hence, &quot;Бостондон.&quot; By the same logic, “from Helsinki” is “Хелсинкиден” -- The last vowel is ‘и', and so here the ablative suffix uses the left vowel of the pair “е-и.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	EXCEPTION: As indicated by the diagram above,'''although the right vowel for “о”is“у”, the left vowel for “y” is “a.”''' So, the ablative for окуучу (“student”) is окуучудан, not окуучудон.* This rule, like everything else to do with vowel harmony, is actually much more easily used and mastered than it may seem at first. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of different methods of production.

== Job (Unit) Production ==
[[Image:SewingInDetroit,Michigan.jpg|thumb|Custom made clothes are an example of job production.]] 
This type of production makes a single, unique, product from start to finish. The product is mostly based on the requirements of the customer. Job production tends to be labour intensive, and often highly skilled labour is required. Examples include building ships, bridges and buildings, handmade crafts like furniture and made-to-measure clothes.

=== Advantages ===
* Unique, high-quality products are made.
* Workers are often more motivated and take pride in their work.
=== Disadvantages ===
* Very labour intensive, so selling prices are usually higher.
* Production can take a long time and can be expensive, for instance if special materials or tools are required.
* Economies of scale are not possible, often resulting in a more expensive product.

== Batch Production ==
[[Image:Kee Wah Bakery Wellington Street (Inside).jpg|thumb|A [[w:Bakery|bakery]] is an example of a business that normally produces in batches.]]
In this type of production, products are made in batches. For example, a shoe factory could make different batches of shoes based on the size and colour of them. This method is suited to products that are identical to each other, but are only produced in limited quantities, or for a limited amount of time. Employees focus on one aspect of production, so are labour is not usually highly-skilled. Batch production can also allow for the use of automation.
=== Advantages ===
* Since larger numbers are made, unit costs are lower.
* Offers the customer some variety and choice.
* Materials can be bought in bulk, so they are cheaper.
=== Disadvantages ===
* Workers are often less motivated because the work becomes repetitive.
* Goods have to be stored until they are sold, which is expensive.

== Mass (Flow) Production ==
[[File:Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.jpg|thumb|An example of a production line, producing [[w:Doughnuts|doughnuts]]]]
In mass production, large numbers of identical products are made. Production is often continuous, and is suited to high demand, mass market products. Examples include cars, chocolate bars, and electronic goods.
=== Advantages ===
*  labour costs are usually lower.
* Materials can be purchased in large quantities, so they are often cheaper.
* Large number of goods are produced.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Machinery is very expensive to buy, so production lines are very expensive to set up.
* Workers are not very motivated, since their work is very repetitive.
* Not very flexible, as a production line is difficult to adapt.
* If one part of the line breaks, the whole production process will have to stop until it is repaired.

== How do firms choose their method of production? ==
Firms choose their method of production based on a number of different factors, such as:
* The amounts they are likely to sell.
* The product they are making.
* The costs of production.
* The variety of goods expected by customers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why do firms promote? ==
* To introduce a new product onto the market.
* To increase sales of an existing product.
* To improve the business's image.
* To compete with other firms.

== Types of Promotion ==
There are two main types of promotion:
* '''Persuasive promotion''' attempts to persuade the consumer that he or she needs the product.
* '''Informative promotion''' attempts to give information about the product, usually in an impressive sounding way. This is often used by the Government, for example to inform people of new laws.

== Advertising Media ==
The way in which an advert is communicated is known as the '''medium'''. The medium a firm chooses will depend on its advertising budget, it's target audience, and the size of it's market.
=== Broadcast Media ===
Broadcast media can attract the consumer's attention more than other types of media, and have a larger target audience. 
* '''Television''' adverts can make use of colour, sound and motion (in other words, they are 'high impact'). They can reach millions of people, and can also be targeted quite well towards people who watch particular programmes. However, it is a very expensive way of advertising and the adverts are often missed or ignored.
* '''Radio''' adverts are cheaper to produce and broadcast, and can still be targeted towards listeners of particular stations. However, there is a smaller audience and often do not attract attention. They are sound only, so may not be as effective.
* '''Cinema''' adverts have a high impact and can be targeted towards particular films. They are unique because they are shown to an attentive audience. However, since it is usually only seen once, it is easily forgotten by the consumer.

=== Printed Media ===
Printed media can be kept for future reference, and can often give more information. However, they have less impact because it cannot use sound and movement, and may not be in colour.
* '''National newspapers''' can be seen by a large audience over a whole nation, but are often expensive to advertise in.
* '''Local newspapers''' get the message across to a large number of people in a given area, and are usually cheaper to advertise in than national newspapers.
* '''Magazines''' are useful because they can target either a broad or a very specific group of people (e.g. a fishing magazine will be read by people interesting in fishing).
* '''Leaflets and junk mail''' are very cheap and easy to produce and distribute, and can be good for targeting a specific group of people. However, they are just as easy to ignore.

=== Other Media ===
* '''Posters and billboards''' will be seen often by people in a certain geographical area. They have a high visual impact and stay in place for a long time. However, they cannot contain detailed information and have to communicate their message quickly because they are often only seen for a few seconds. And they are vulnerable to wind, rain and graffiti.
* '''The Internet''' is a fairly cheap advertising media and can give good amounts of information. They can have a good visual impact, can be interactive and link directly to buying the product. However, not everyone has Internet access and since there are lots of adverts they are often simply ignored.

== Sales Promotion ==
Sales promotion may be referred to as 'Below the line' promotion because it does not use the media, or 'Point of sale' promotion because it is used at the point of sale. Some common sales promotion methods include:
* '''Price reductions / Discounts''' involve reducing the price of a product (for example using coupons), to encourage customers to buy it.
* '''Gifts''' can be free objects that are given to a customer when they purchase the product, or buy-one-get-one-free (BOGOF) offers.
* '''Point-of-sale displays''' make the product stand out from others through the use of a special display where it is being sold. These are often seen in supermarkets.
* '''Credit''' may be given on some products, which allows the customer to buy the product now and then pay for it later.
* '''After-sales service''' is given on some products in order to reassure the customer that if anything goes wrong, help will be given.

== Public Relations ==
Public Relations (PR) is often free publicity. This can either be good or bad, but the outcome is the same: it helps a business get their name well known. Large companies may have a PR department, which makes sure that any new stories about the company show it in a good light. Some news events about the company may have been made up by the company themselves. These are called '''PR stunts'''. For example, in Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka starts a competition for consumers to find five golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars. Another way companies get publicity is to pay television and film companies to use the company's product in their films and TV shows. This is called '''product placement'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Word Order==
Kyrgyz is a “Subject-Object-Verb” language. This means that the person or thing doing the action comes first in the sentence, and the verb is at the end. Compare this with English, which is a Subject-Verb-Object language:

Мен   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;       дүкөнгө        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      барам : “I go to the store.”&lt;br /&gt;
I    &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;     to the store   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;    go&lt;br /&gt;

Possessives (like English “my,” “your,” etc.) and adjectives precede the noun that they modify. 

кызыл китеп : “a red book”&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; red  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;book

Other than keeping adjectives in front of their respective nouns and the finite verb at the end of the sentence, word order is much more elastic than it is in English, since much grammar that in English is carried by word order is communicated in Kyrgyz by suffixes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Articles==
Kyrgyz has no separate definite article that would correspond to the English “the”. For example, the word “китеп” can by itself mean either “a book” or “the book.”

That said, the word бир (“one”) is often used in situations where the English indefinite article “a/an” would be appropriate.

мен   бир мугалим менен сүйлөштүм   -- “I spoke with a teacher.” &lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;   teacher   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;    spoke

This can have a somewhat stronger indefinite sense: “бир мугалим” is like saying “some random teacher.” &lt;br /&gt;

I noticed your comments at [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Languages‎]]. While I cannot help you by improving language books myself (not my knowledge area), I might be able to help you make the most of the feedback systems we have available. You can also leave feedback on discussion pages for pages where you would like to see improvements made. You should also be able to see a &quot;What do you think of this page?&quot; form at the bottom of each page. You can use this form to provide feedback for the people working on the books. You can also add &quot;{{tl|expand}}&quot;, &quot;{{tl|confusing}}&quot;, or &quot;{{tl|attention}}&quot; to top of pages in a book to encourage anyone that comes across the page that can help improve it to do so for example. You can also help to improve pages too, when you know something.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''geometry'' of an object is defined by the location of its faces, as described by the location of its vertices. The description can be further refined by ''subsurfing'' and ''smoothing''. The geometry tells us where the object's faces are in space, but it does not describe what the object looks like. This overview describes the concept of  the defining the visual appearance of the object using a '''material'''.

We describe the look of each face by assigning a ''material'' to it. The material describes how light interacts with each point on the face. There are are many ways in which light interacts with a surface in the real world, and Blender permits us to describe many of them for our material. We start by defining ''base material'': a single set of interactions that will apply to all the points on the face. We then use ''Textures'' to modify these interactions for individual points.

Finally there must be a way to describe how a non-uniform material, which is described in two dimensions, is to be applied to our object three-dimensional object: that is, which points on the two-dimensional plane of the material map onto which parts of the object.

==Base material==
[[Image:Surface normal.png|right|thumb|300px|surface normals]]
The base material settings describe how light reacts to a point on the surface given the [[w:surface normal|surface normal]] at that point. The &quot;surface normal&quot; is the direction that is straight out from the tiny area surrounding the point. For a completely flat smooth surface, the surface normals for all points on the surface point in the same direction. For a rough surface, the normals vary a lot.
{{clear}}

==Material textures==
When applied to a material, a  ''texture'' is a description of how to vary one or more parameters of each location on the surface. (Blender uses textures for world, light and brush also, but those uses are different and will be covered in a different chapter.)

A texture consists of a ''texture map'', an ''effect,'' and a ''point mapping''.  The texture map is either an arbitrary image, or one of a number of procedural maps. The texture map provides a value at each point of the texture. The effect tells Blender what to do with that value. You can create a texture with any map combined with any effect, but some combinations make more sense than others. The point mapping tells blender how to determine which point of the texture map are to be applied to each point of the object.

==Texture Map==
===A Map is not a Picture===
[[image:Infrared dog.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Thermal map]]
To describe the points, we use a 2-dimensional array of numbers called a &quot;map.&quot; Each texture has a map. The map may be &quot;procedural&quot; or it may be an &quot;image.&quot; It is imperative to understand that an &quot;image map&quot; is NOT a picture of what the observer will see when looking at the surface. Rather, it is a collection of numbers, each of which tells the renderer something about how light is affected at a point on the surface. Here is a real-world example of the difference between an image map and a picture. This temperature map, or [[w:Thermogram|thermogram]], conveys information about the temperature at each point. It is not a picture of something the observer will actually see.

As it happens, there are several well-defined formats for conveying 2-dimensional map information for use by computer programs. These formats were developed to store images such as drawings and photographs, so we call them image formats and we manipulate them and view them as images. This is unfortunate, because when use them as textures, we can easily fall into the trap of thinking of them as images rather than maps.

There are dozens of separate parameters needed to describe the interactions of light at a surface point, but our commonly-accepted map formats (&quot;image formats&quot;) only provide one (or three, or four) numbers per point. We get around this problem by using multiple textures on one material, with each texture providing numbers for different parameters. For the curious, an image file for a greyscale image has one value per point: intensity. A file with a photograph has three values per point red intensity, Green intensity, and Blue intensity. An computer-generated image file intended for compositing can have an additional number per point called &quot;Alpha&quot; to describe how transparent the point is.

As with the thermogram above, the human visual system can recognize and interpret patterns in two-dimensional maps that are presented as pictures. Furthermore, The visible patterns in the map are recognizably related to the visible patterns produced when the map is used in a texture. Take advantage of this, but do not be fooled by it.

===An Exception: The Colormap===
In one important case, a texture map really is an image ... almost.

When the texture is being used as a colormap, then the four numbers per point in the map (Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha) are used to specify Red, green, blue, and alpha of the point on the surface. In this one case, the map really is an image. Unfortunately, this is frequently the very first use of texturing a Noob is exposed to, and it is therefore hard to understand that it is a special case.

Furthermore, not all real-world photographs are useful as colormaps, because a typical photograph is not a simple one-to-one description of the colors of the points on a surface. One obvious difference is the shadows in a photograph. To be generally useful as a colormap, a photograph should be an orthogonal shot of a surface with uniform illumination. Of course, a blender artist can make good use of a photograph that does not meet these conditions, but simply ignoring this distinction is likely to yield unexpected results.

===Procedural maps===
It is often possible to describe a recipe for determining the number at each point in a map. In this case, there is no need to provide an image at all: we just provide the recipe, or ''procedure''. For example, the procedure for a particular type of gradient map is: &quot;use the number 0 on the left and the number 1 on the right and interpolate between them.&quot; Blender 2.49 is delivered with eleven procedural texture types. These are in a list that also includes &quot;none,&quot; image,&quot; and &quot;plugin.&quot; As you can guess, &quot;image&quot; lets you select an image, not a procedure, and &quot;none&quot; specifies that there is no map (Noob: what?) while &quot;plugin.&quot; allows you to specify an external script as your procedure. Each procedural map is generated by an algorithm, and many of the algorithms have parameters. When you select a procedure with parameters, a panel is added to the buttons window to let you set the parameters. The panel's contents vary depending on the type of the procedural texture.

==Effects==
Outside of Blender, image files are used to describe images to be viewed by humans. When an image file is used for its intended purpose, (e.g., to print a photograph) there is a defined meaning for the numbers in the file: when the file has three numbers per point, the numbers specify the Red, Green, and Blue intensities, respectively, and this tells the printer exactly how much ink of each color to use at each point. When we use an image file for a different purpose, there is no accepted interpretation for the numbers. Therefore, we must provide information to Blender to tell it how to use each number. For texture maps, the way this is done varies in detail depending on which parameters are being affected by that particular texture, but the overall idea is the same: you must tell Blender how to interpret the map. Each ''effect'' controls the how map numbers are mapped to blender parameters.

Blender provides thirteen different effects. Any texture may implement any combination of these effects. The effects are selected in the ''map to'' tab. (As a Noob, I understand how to use a texture with exactly one effect. I do not understand what happens when no effects are selected, and I do not understand what happens when multpile effects are selected.) The effects are: Cor,Nor,Csp,Cmir,ref,Spec,Amb,Hard,RayMir,Alpha,Enit,TransLu, and Disp.
these can be divided into categories:
*Color effects: Col, Csp, and Cmir affect the Diffuse, Specular, and mirror colors of the material, respectively. Each of these effects uses three values per point from the image: R, G, and B.
*Scalar parameters: Ref, Spec, Amb, Hard, RayMir, Alpha, Emit, and TransLu affect specific &quot;scalar&quot; values of the point. A scalar value is represented by a single number , not three different numbers. For these effects, we must describe how to reduce the R, G, and B values from a point in the map to a single number.
*Normal or bump: a ''Nor'' effect (which is either a &quot;normal map&quot; or a &quot;bump map&quot;) does not affect a scalar value of the base material. Instead, it tells Blender how to recompute the surface normal at the point. A &quot;normal map&quot; uses the three map values atthe point (R, G, B) as offset of the normal in three dimensions (X, Y, Z.) A Bump map uses a single number per point to specify an offset to be applied to the point for purposed of computing the normal.
*Displacement: Disp is conceptually very different from the other types. It provides a scalar that tells Blender to actually move the point.

Color and scalar effects are relatively easy to understand: after an effect is applied, the affected point will react exactly as if you had made the same change to the untextured material, but only for that point. You can in theory subdivide the mesh into enough faces to provide one face per texture point, and then replace the texture with a separate untextured material per point, to achieve the same effect. This is of course completely impractical, but aids in understanding the way textures color and scalar textures work.

The Displacement effect is also easy to understand: The effect tells Blender to actually offset the points and create new vertices. Again, it is clear that the same result can theoretically be achieved by actually subdividing the original mesh and adding the vertices. This is also impractical, but aids in understanding how a displacement mesh works.

Normal maps (and bump maps) are very different. They describe how to &quot;tilt&quot; each point on a face. It is not conceptually possible to achieve the same effect by replacing the mesh with a higher-resolution mesh, and in fact you cannot construct a real-world object that affects light in the same way as a bump-mapped or normal-mapped texture on an mesh. These maps are a very valuable way to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of rendering a model by making certain tradeoffs. The Noob should consider these to be advanced techniques to be used only when optimization becomes necessary.

===Applying the Effect===

We now know how to derive a value, and what parameter is to be affected, but we still need to know how the value is to affect the parameter. Blender allows us to specify one of fourteen different texture blending modes to apply the value to the parameter. The modes are called &quot;color, value, saturation, hue, lighten, darken, divide, difference,overlay, screen, multiply, subtract, add, and mix. Nine of these are described in [http://www.yafaray.org/documentation/userguide/textureinput#blending this Yafaray tutorial]. and summarized below.

Remember that in general, order is important. When a material has one texture, the values of all parameters are set by the material, and then the texture is applied. When there is a &quot;stack&quot; of textures, the topmost is applied, and then the next one, and then the next, until finally the texture at the bottom is applied. This means that the last texture in the stack generally has the most obvious effect.

A mode is either &quot;commutative&quot; or not. If it is commutative, then the two textures may be applied in either order to achieve an identical result. If the mode is not commutative, then order is important.

material parameters are all numeric values that are scaled to be between 0, and 1: think of them as ratios, or values on a slider from &quot;black&quot; to &quot;white.&quot; When a mathematical operation causes a value to be below 0 or above 1, the parameter is adjusted: below 0 becomes 0, and above 1 becomes 1.

|-

===Stencils===
It is sometimes useful to apply two different maps to the same parameter in a controlled fashion. You could do this by using an external program to create a new map from the two original map, and then apply the new map to the parameter. However, there is a simpler way to do this within Blender: the ''stencil''. You can tell blender to use a map to apply an effect to another map, instead of applying it to a parameter. The resulting map is then applied to a parameter.

==Point Mapping==
A map is flat, but an object is not. A classic example of this problem is that you cannot glue a paper rectangular map of the world onto a basketball to make a globe. To use a flat material on a 3D object, we must specify the relationship of the points on the object to the points on the material. There is no feasible way for a user to specify the mapping for each point individually, and there is no reason to do so. Instead, we tell blender to use one of its simple internal point-mapping algorithms, or we supply a UV map.

===UV mapping===
A UV map is a description of which points of the material are to be used for each point of the object. 
Instead, we create a 2D layout of the object's mesh. Each face of the mesh is represented in this layout. The layout explicitly identifies the mapping for each vertex, and the points on a face are interpolated based on the vertices for that face. Blender has tools that simplify the process of making a UV map from a mesh.

The easiest way to think about the UV map is to think in terms of cutting seams in the mesh, laying it as flat as possible, and then stretching it until it is flat.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The price is what a firm charges for a product or service.

== What influences the price? ==
The price is influenced by two types of factors, these are:
* '''Internal factors''', such as the cost of production.
* '''External factors''', such as what other firms are charging for similar products or services.

== Pricing strategies ==
There are a number of strategies that firms will use to decide how much they should charge. Some of these are:
=== Cost-plus (full-cost) pricing ===
In this type of pricing strategy, a firm adds a given percentage (know as the '''mark up''') to what it costs them to make a product, and sells it for this price. The formula for getting the sale price is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;(\frac{Production~Price}{100})(100 + Mark~up)&lt;/math&gt;
For example, if a firm was making pens at a cost $2 per pen, and they wanted to make 25% profit on them, the sale price would be worked out like this:
:&lt;math&gt;(\frac{2}{100})(100 + 25) = $2.50&lt;/math&gt;
This is the simplest pricing strategy and is commonly used by small firms or sole traders.
==== Advantages ====
* Very easy and fast to calculate.
* Ensures that all your costs are covered.
==== Disadvantages ====
* Does not take into account what the customer is willing to pay for the product, which could result in reduced profit.
* Does not look at what competitors are charging - if competitors are charging lower prices, sales may be lost.

=== Penetration pricing ===
With penetration pricing a firm charges a very low price for a product in order to attract lots of customers. While this low price is used, firms will usually make little or no profit. This is called '''loss leading'''. Once the product has gained customer loyalty the producer will start charging higher prices to increase their profit. This pricing strategy is often done when introducing a new product in a market, often when existing products have brand loyalty, in order to grab a large market share quickly. Magazines are a good example.
==== Advantages ====
* Will attract customers to the product and make them want to try it.
* Good for increasing market share quickly.
==== Disadvantages ====
* Does not help pay back research and development costs.
* Revenue is lost while the product is selling at a lower price.
* Not good for products with short product life cycles (e.g. fashion clothing).

=== Skimming/Premium pricing ===
[[File:Hyundai dvd player.jpg|thumb|When [[w:DVD player|DVD player]]s were first released, they were sold using premium pricing. Manufacturers have now lowered their prices to make them accessible to the mass market.]]
Skimming is the opposite of penetration pricing. Firms charge a high price to begin with for an exclusive product. This helps to make the product desirable to consumers with large incomes. When the product has become established the firm will lower the price to help it become a mass market product. This pricing strategy is often done with products based on new technology that are only just appearing the market.
==== Advantages ====
* High prices can give a product a good image, and give customers the impression that it is very high quality.
* Will give firms high profits while the price is high, helping to pay back research and development costs.
==== Disadvantages ====
* Competitors may bring out a lower-priced product, taking away your market.
* Some sales may be lost because customers are not willing to pay the higher price.
* Can put some potential customers off because of the high price.

=== Competition pricing ===
With competition pricing a firm will base what they charge on what other firms are charging. This is used when there is lots of choice but not much product differentiation, like petrol.
==== Advantages ====
* Avoids price competition which can damage the company

==== Disadvantages ====
* Businesses have to attract the customers in other ways, since the price will not grab the customer's interest.
* May only just cover production costs, resulting in low profits.

=== Promotional pricing === rude boy 2k14
Promotional pricing means temporarily reducing the price of an established product in order to increase interest in customers. This is usually done because:
* The sales of the product are falling and the firm wants to renew customer's interest in it.
* The product has gone out of fashion, and the firm wants to clear their stock (e.g. sales on last season's clothes).

==== Advantages ====
* Earns revenue on out of fashion goods that would probably not sell otherwise.
* Can renew customer's interest in products with falling sales.
==== Disadvantages ====
* Revenue is lower on each product, so profits will be lower (or non-existent).
* When attempting to renew interest, can be risky if sales don't rise

== Wikibooks policies and guidelines template ==

I noticed that in the style conventions the items listed aren't policies or guidelines. Not extremely important to users that known the status and distinctions but can be confusing to unaware Wikibookians.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:09, 4 December 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, and some of the items in the template are still proposals but for the initial contents I tried to limit it to more of the de facto guidelines.  The style conventions could very well be guidelines and others could be either approved or rejected were we to kick it into gear and decide after (how many years?) what the state of things are.  One of my ulterior goals with the template is to try to foster greater efforts in getting things sorted. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:13, 4 December 2010 (UTC)

== Links to moved pages. ==

I have no problem with deleting redirects for moved pages. However I think links for moved pages should be updated rather than striken from discussions to preserve the context of discussions as best we can, so people can continue to follow links to pages that contributors thought was relevant to the discussion. Whenever I fix links I try to use a format such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[new page|old link text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as a way to make the change as subtle as possible. I created {{tl|bad link}} on the advice given to me for the cases where pages are deleted and there are no good ways to preserve context. Seeing others make use of the template gives me hope that other people see the merit in what I do. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:55, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

:I do follow the same thought.  But the instances where ''Wikibooks:Revision review'' were striken were already next to ''Help:Revision review'' in places comparing the two's previously different scopes in the same sentence.  Since they would have both gone to the same page it didn't make sense to have the link twice to the same destination in the same sentence.  In situations where it was just ''Wikibooks:Revision review'' I did indeed correct the link. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:57, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

Hi Adrignola

I noticed your name in the history of the above template. It used to provide dropdown panels so that you could see an exercise before looking at the solution. The functionality is somehow gone and I do not know why. I had used it quite a bit on the [[Dutch]] language course to insert practice material without interrupting to main story. All that is gone now. Any ideas?

[[User:Jcwf|Jcwf]] ([[User talk:Jcwf|talk]]) 23:53, 17 December 2010 (UTC)

:Some back-end code on the site was changed and while some templates were updated to maintain their functionality, it looks like that one was missed.  I don't know how many others there are since the code doesn't involve calling a template.    I actually did not make any edits to that template.  I simply [[WB:REVIEW|reviewed]] an edit made by another.  I have, however, updated that template to work with the new code.&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:02, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

== Category redirects ==

I only just noticed you'd undone my eradication of the CAT:RFU redirect.

Hard redirects from categories should never, ever be used because they &quot;don't work&quot; &amp;mdash; not in the sense that you won't be redirected automatically if you go there, but in the much worse sense that you ''will'' be redirected automatically if you go there, while pages added to the &quot;redirecting&quot; category will belong to that rather than the target of the redirection.  Over on Wikinews, I once came across a category redirect that had one article belonging to it, that had been languishing there for ''years'' because, of course, the redirect always whisked users away to the target so they'd never notice that there was an article lost in the redirect (and therefore not properly categorized in the target).  If I were remotely Bugzilla-savvy I might file a request to make the redirect magic word '''not work''' in category space, to prevent this accident waiting to happen (or vote for such a request, if there already is one).

To test-and-demonstrate the principle, as I write this, [[WB:Sandbox]] is in [[:Category:RFU]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:26, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

: Category redirects of this type are intended to be used as shortcuts, not for categorizing. The Wikibooks community supported the creation of the CAT shortcut. Like files I think there is work to make category redirects work by having pages show up in the target category, and so the move functionality can be enabled for categories. I much rather see you work on or vote for that functionality than disabling category redirects. Category redirects are only a problem right now when people try to use a redirected category to categorize pages, instead of just a navigational aid. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:29, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

:: The reason I wouldn't try to lobby to fix what happens when a page is categorized into a redirect is that I believe that lobbying would be a complete waste of time, that is, that the devs didn't set that up because it would be expensive and there's absolutely no way they would change it.

:: As I recall, the community, including me, voted for the CAT namespace short'''hand''' (if that's what you mean), but that shorthand has nothing to do with the begging-for-an-accident practice of putting redirects in category pages.  It's exactly because category redirects are not meant to be populated that they should not be created in the first place:  once the category exists, it's ''appallingly'' easy to accidentally put something in it (it produces a blue link, and when you click on that blue link it takes you to the right place) and appallingly easy to not notice the problem, later.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:25, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

::: Yes I mean the CAT namespace shorthand (or namespace alias as they are called in the software). The aliases work by utilizing the existing namespaces. A page named Wikibooks:RFC has to exist in order for WB:RFC to work too. WB:&lt;what&gt; just expands to Wikibooks:&lt;what&gt;. The same is true for the CAT shorthand. Category:RFC must exist in order for CAT:RFC to work. So in a way the shorthand is connected with the potential for redirects to be an accident waiting to happen, because Category:RFC must exist and point somewhere for CAT:RFC to work. Without Category:RFC has a redirect, people would have to use CAT:Requests_for_deletion which defeats the purpose of having shortcuts to longer names. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:18, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

::::An interesting conversation being had here.  The comments Pi zero makes I can understand, but that category is populated by a template and should not have anything categorized manually.  I've also seen the way things are done elsewhere, where they don't use a redirect for the same reasons Pi zero states, but then they place a template tag on the page noting the category that should be used instead.  But in that situation you ''still'' have a category that appears as a blue link to a user and we don't have the luxury of bots handling any recategorization in those cases if they have that set up.  The real reason I undid the shortcut removal on the category was because the shortcut template was fixed by a person to allow it to work without categorizing the category it was placed on.  I can only say that I thought everyone was well aware that CAT would be used like WB was before we made it an official alias.  Otherwise, as Darklama points out, it defeats the purpose of the alias.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:30, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

::::: I've noticed the sporadic practice of soft redirects from categories.  As one might guess from the above, I consider that somewhat less bad than a hard redirect, but I'd rather have no page there at all, so it'd show as a red link and HotCat would shy away from it.  Even better, on top of that, would be if the page also has a deletion log entry that says what other category to use instead.

::::: It's true of course that the category involved here ''should'' not have anything categorized manually.  But keep in mind, my objection is about preventing and detecting things that happen even though they shouldn't.

::::: When we voted in the namespace shorthands, I remember thinking the CAT shorthand wasn't very useful since redirects don't work in category space... but I invested both my thinking and my lobbying to nix the idea of multiple shorthands per namespace (on which, you'll recall, I succeeded).  Thinking it through now, for purposes of shortcuts we'd be better off if we hadn't introduced shorthand CAT &amp;mdash; because if only CAT were ''not'' shorthand for category space, we could have hard redirects from '''mainspace''' pages starting with CAT: (such as CAT:RFU), and those shortcuts could never have stuff accidentally categorized in them because they themselves wouldn't even be categories.

::::: Other than a hard redirect from a category (which I abhor), or a soft redirect from a category (which I dislike), I see two other approaches we could take.
:::::* We ''could'', at least in theory, de-shorthand the CAT prefix, so that as I mentioned above we could have hard redirects like CAT:RFU in mainspace.  Unfortunately, anywhere someone has used CAT: as a shorthand for an actual category, it would break &amp;mdash; which is (somewhat ironically) the very difficulty I described when campaigning against multiple shorthands per namespace.
:::::* Alternatively, we could just put these redirects in a different namespace.  Project space seems a natural choice.  Unfortunately, in this case the obvious name is already taken ({{Plain link|{{fullurl:WB:RFU|redirect=no}}|WB:RFU}}; though possibly the moral should be that this redirect should use a different name than that one).  But if we really mean the redirect to not be a functioning category, there's a certain logic to not putting it in category space.
:::::--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:07, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

::::::We could look and see whether any pages link to the redirected category.  There are not too many of them and removing the alias would be very low-impact.  But we'd have to have another consensus discussion for the developers to consider any requests and I see less and less community participation in such discussions.  However, that's the only outcome I can envision that properly addresses the concerns. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:13, 19 December 2010 (UTC)
== Odd template change? ==

I note that in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 3|chapter pages for the Muggles' Guide]] there has been a change to the page layout. Yesterday the next chapter / prev chapter links were in the top right corner, today they are in the top left. Apparently the addition of the &quot;From Wikibooks, open books for an open world&quot; tagline text in the upper left has bunged up the template. I don't know enough about the way WB templates work to correct this; could I humbly request that you take a gander at it when you get the chance? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:35, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

:::::Well, if you read the documentation created for the reviewing system at [[WB:REVIEW]], the last thumbnail shows [[:File:Diff reviewing toolbar.png]], which is only seen when you click a &quot;review&quot; or &quot;pending changes&quot; link on recent changes or the page itself, respectively. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:19, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

::::::Exactly... and now, when looking at a diff, I no longer see that. The link I posted above is exactly the sort of diff described at the thumbnail, and one where I saw that &quot;review this revision&quot; yesterday, and the review toolbar is no longer present.

::::::::Okay... allow me to rephrase. The revision toolbar shows up if a revision is unchecked. It does not show up if a revision has been automatically checked. The reason I'm seeing this is because I'm chasing after PNW Raven, who leaves her edits auto-checked rather than approving them; generally, I'll do a diff to see her changes and confirm a lack of typos, then re-review to approve and keep the pages we're actually happy with at the Good quality level. Used to be I could look at what she had done, and then review on the same page. Now I have to check what she's done, pop into the Read page, scroll down to the bottom and re-review there. One extra annoying step... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:50, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::::::}}Well, while I'm in the same boat as Darklama, I can't say that the process you use is one I've ever engaged in.  I do notice that categories no longer appear at the bottom of a page when I'm looking at the pending changes diff now.  That recent update they did also removed the ability to prioritize higher-rated revisions for pages that show the reviewed version by default.  Looks like the problems you're having are another result.  I don't know that I can do anything to resolve this, but I definitely share your frustrations with changes being made without consultation to a system extensively used by Wikibooks and German Wikipedia in order to placate those at English Wikipedia who felt it just wasn't good enough for them. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:01, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

I guess I should probably have mentioned there are review preferences that may be related to this. I have seen diffs after reviewing a revision and a diff link for pages with revisions that have not yet been reviewed, when I have had those options enabled. However like I said I've never seen a review form on a normal diff page itself before. The form being available from a normal diff could be ambiguous as to which revision is to be reviewed, not to  mention it could mean review both or what the affect should be on any intermediate revisions not shown. I must say I'm a bit skeptical that it ever was the case because of that problem and since I've never seen it for myself, which is why I asked you before if you were sure you were looking in the correct place for the review form. I guess I should also mention that I think they recently tried to integrate &quot;pending changes'&quot; diff more with mediawiki's default diff, so the distinction between mediawiki's diff and &quot;pending changes'&quot; diff that I had pictured in my mind may be irrelevant now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:20, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

:Plenty of clarity deficiency to go around, I guess... I will say that I never had any problem guessing which revision I was reviewing, it was always the more recent of the two in view, same as the text following is always the more recent of the two. Perhaps my use is a little specialized, that of an actual editor rather than author/editor. But it's because of that use that I was aware of the existence of the revision review on a normal diff page; I knew it was there because I used it heavily, and now it's gone. But if it's a mediawiki decision, there's little we as a minor project can do about it... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:07, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

:: Right. As pointed out seems to still be there when a revision has not been previously checked at all. I guess Wikipedians felt that people who have their edits auto checked should be trusted to know what they are doing or that a revision needing to be rechecked is a rare case. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:47, 24 December 2010 (UTC)
== Incubation ==

I was first interested in incubation because of an idea that has evolved into [http://www.nycwiki.org NYCwiki].  That project actually has a good home now.  But I have seen many interesting proposals on meta and foundation-l that have not been able to find any home, and where I think a solution with Wikibooks could be beneficial to all.--[[User:Pharos|Pharos]] ([[User talk:Pharos|talk]]) 18:15, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

You have been watching and reviewing my contribution in &quot;Technical Analysis&quot;. I need your feedback on how do I improve quality my contributions. ([[User:Yndesai|Yndesai]] ([[User talk:Yndesai|talk]]) 13:22, 29 December 2010 (UTC))

:My reviewing has simply been anti-vandalism patrol, really, but I'll note what appears to me to be the best area for improvement.  You will want to consider splitting the single [[Technical Analysis]] page up into subpages.  [[Using Wikibooks/How To Structure A Wikibook]] can provide detailed information on this.  At that point it truly becomes a ''book'', rather than a ''page''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to the Case System==
Like many other languages, Kyrgyz has a case system. This means that the form of the noun is altered in various ways to carry grammatical meaning. (In English, the vestiges of such a system may be seen in the permutations of the word “who”: we have “who,” “whose,” and “whom,” each of which has a separate grammatical function.) In Kyrgyz, these alterations (called “cases“) are formed by means of various suffixes.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
Nouns in Kyrgyz are considered to have six cases, the Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Locative, and Ablative.  Each case performs a different role. For example, a noun in the nominative case acts as a subject, a noun in the genitive is a possessor, and, as we have seen, a noun in the ablative can translate the English “from.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have already studied any of the “inflected” languages, such as Latin or Russian, don’t let prior bitter experience daunt you: The system of Kyrgyz is generally very straightforward and regular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are only three persistent difficulties:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Case suffixes, like almost all Kyrgyz suffixes require the application of vowel harmony rules. Whether a given suffix takes a left or right vowel will have to be memorized and learned by practice.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Case markers can be changed slightly by suffixes that precede them, most especially the possessive suffixes. Again, the rules regarding this are very regular, and require only practice.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Consonants that begin certain suffixes (including case suffixes) sometimes change, depending on the last letter in the stem. For example, if the noun ends in an “unvoiced” consonant (the consonants ч,т,п,к,ш,с, and in loan words ц,щ,х, and ф ), then the suffix will also begin with a unvoiced consonant. If the stem ends in another consonant or in a vowel, then the suffix will begin with a voiced consonant. (While making a voiced consonant or vowel, a person’s vocal cords vibrate; in the making of an unvoiced consonant they are still. An easy way to tell the difference is to make the consonant while blocking your ears -- If there is a buzzing or rumbling sound, then the consonant is voiced, if there is not then the consonant is unvoiced.) This difficulty is chiefly one of orthography -- In actual speech, these things usually tend to take care of themselves. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a table of the case suffixes, in the forms that they take when appended to noun stems of various types:
&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;table   style=&quot;text-align:center;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:5px;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=5px align=left width=100% &gt;

        &lt;caption&gt; Noun Declension &lt;/caption&gt;

      &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:whitesmoke;&quot;&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;Case&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Voiced Consonants&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Unvoiced Consonants&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Vowels&lt;/th&gt;
   
  
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
  
        &lt;td align=left&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; None&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; None&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; None&lt;/td&gt;
  
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:whitesmoke;&quot;&gt;
  
        &lt;td align=left&gt;Genitive&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td&gt; --д→н&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --т→н&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --н→н&lt;/td&gt;
 
  
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
  
        &lt;td align=left&gt;Dative&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td&gt; --г←&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --к←&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --г←&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:whitesmoke;&quot;&gt;
  
        &lt;td align=left&gt;Accusative&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td&gt; --д→&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --т→&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --н→&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;&gt;

        &lt;td align=left&gt;Locative&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt;--д←&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt;--т←&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt;--д←&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  
      &lt;tr style=&quot;background:whitesmoke;&quot;&gt;
  
        &lt;td align=left&gt;Ablative&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td&gt; --д←н&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --т←н&lt;/td&gt;
  
        &lt;td&gt; --д←н&lt;/td&gt;

  
      &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned before, the arrows indicate whether a suffix takes a right or a left vowel. So, if a word ends with “ы,” and you want to put it in the ablative, then the left vowel of the vowel pair “а-ы” is required. Since the word ends in a vowel, the suffix used is “--дан.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are some examples:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;table   style=&quot;text-align:center;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:5px;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=5px align=left width=100% &gt;

        &lt;caption&gt; Noun Declension &lt;/caption&gt;

      &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:whitesmoke;&quot;&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;Case&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Voiced Consonants&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Unvoiced Consonants&lt;/th&gt;
   
        &lt;th width=25% &gt;After Vowels&lt;/th&gt;
   
  
      &lt;/tr&gt;

These endings change a bit when they follow some possessive suffixes.  That will all be dealt with later, when possessive suffixes are presented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Meaning of Cases==
The various cases carry different grammatical meanings, depending to some degree on the contexts in which they are used. However, many of these uses are actually quite intuitive to English speakers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Nominative===
As in the inflected languages (e.g. Russian), the nominative is the subject case and the dictionary form of the word. &lt;br /&gt;
Жылкы секарат. 	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The horse jumps.”&lt;br /&gt;
horse  &amp;nbsp;     jumps&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Нан   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;жакшы.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	“The bread is good.”&lt;br /&gt;
bread  good&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, if the object of a transitive verb (that is, a verb that requires a direct object) is not definite or specific -- that is, if it is just a general member of a category, and in English would not take the word “the” before it -- then it also is in the nominative case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен алма жедим.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  “I ate an apple”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp; apple   ate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, this is in the case of a direct object that is indefinite. It might be useful to compare the accusative case and the section on definite and indefinite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, so-called “predicate nominatives” are in the nominative case. This means that, in English, a simple “to be” construction would be used, such as “John is a doctor.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Адам жумушчуу.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The man is a worker.”&lt;br /&gt;
man worker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to properly use these sorts of sentences in situations other than the third person, it is necessary to use personal endings, which are dealt with in the section on short sentences.&lt;br /&gt;

===Genitive Case===
The genitive case is usually used to indicate possession, along with the possessive suffixes. &lt;br /&gt;
Алманын &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;териси	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The apple‘s skin.”&lt;br /&gt;
apple(gen)   skin (possessed)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Менин &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;гүлүм &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“My flower”&lt;br /&gt;
(1st pers.gen.)  flower&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this sense, the genitive may also be used to translate the English “to have.” More on this and on the necessary suffixes is in the possessive suffixes section.&lt;br /&gt;
The genitive is also used with postpositions of location.
&lt;br /&gt;
Стулдун &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;астында 			  “Under the chair”&lt;br /&gt;
chair(gen)   under&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These also are more thoroughly dealt with in their own section.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Dative case===
The dative indicates indirect object and motion toward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен дүкөнгө &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;барам .	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I go to the store.”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store(dat)&amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;  go&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is often used in the sense of “for” or “to.”&lt;br /&gt;
Нaзгүл бир алма жылкыга  берди.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Nazgul gave an apple to the horse.”&lt;br /&gt;
Nazgul one  apple  horse(dat) gave&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The dative is also used with the verb жаз-- (write), for the surface on which the writing is being done.&lt;br /&gt;
Ал  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     кагазга   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  жазат.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	“(S)he writes on paper.”&lt;br /&gt;
(s)he   paper(dat)   writes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Accusative Case===
The accusative indicates the direct object of a verb, that is, the thing that the verb directs its action upon. (In English, the direct object of a verb never has a preposition in front of it.) However, the accusative is only used for a direct object  if the object is definite. This means that you should put the object of a verb into the accusative if it is a direct object AND:&lt;br /&gt;
1) It is preceded by words that mean “this” or “that.” (e.g., бул, ошол, ал, тигил)&lt;br /&gt;
OR&lt;br /&gt;
2) It has a possessive suffix.&lt;br /&gt;
OR&lt;br /&gt;
3) You can imagine the word “the” placed before it in English.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен  бул   алманы    жейм.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	“I eat this apple.”&lt;br /&gt;
I        this   apple(acc)   eat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен        алмаӊды          жейм.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I eat your apple.”&lt;br /&gt;
I	apple(“your,“acc)  eat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен   алманы     жейм.	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I eat the apple.”&lt;br /&gt;
I        apple(acc)   eat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BUT:&lt;br /&gt;
Мен   алма     жейм.		&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I eat an apple.”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  apple     eat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only exception to this rule comes with the construction жакшы көр-- , which means “like, love,” and its opposite жаман көр-- (dislike, loathe). These forms always take accusative objects, regardless of whether those objects are definite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен   алманы   жакшы көрөм.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I like apples.”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; apple(acc)  good     see&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Locative Case===
The locative indicates location.&lt;br /&gt;
Мен шаарда  жашайм. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I live in a city.”&lt;br /&gt;
I  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; city(loc)    live&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like the genitive, it can be used in certain constructions to translate the verb “to have.” This is covered in the section on possession.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Ablative Case===
The ablative case can be used to indicate motion from someplace:&lt;br /&gt;
Мен Америкадан  келдим.	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I came from America.”&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     America(abl)  came&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can also work in a partitive sense, that is, it indicates a piece of something from a larger whole. In this it is like the Russian genitive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
Наандан &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;же.	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	“Eat some bread.” &lt;br /&gt;
bread(abl)  eat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ablative indicates the material by which a thing is made:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Колбаса &amp;nbsp;   эттен       жасалат.			“Sausage is made from meat.”&lt;br /&gt;
sausage   meat(abl)    is made&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is also used as the object of verbs or fearing and of questioning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен Чолпондон   сурайм.	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	“I‘ll ask Cholpon.”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Cholpon(abl)  ask&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Мен Чолпондон   корком.	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I fear Cholpon.”&lt;br /&gt;
I &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cholpon(abl)  fear&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Plural==
The plural is formed by adding the suffixes л←р, д←р, or т←р. The first suffix is used for stems ending in a vowel or in the consonant й:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
окуучу -------- окуучулар		үй - үйлөр&lt;br /&gt;
student ------ students	         house	 houses&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
д←р is used for stems that end in voiced consonant:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
көз ----- көздөр &lt;br /&gt;
eye ----- eyes &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The suffix т←р is used for noun stems that end in voiceless consonants.&lt;br /&gt;
таш ----- таштар&lt;br /&gt;
stone ---- stones&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Case endings are then simply appended to the plural suffix:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
таштар -- “stones”	таштарга -- stones(dat) -- “to the stones.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Pronouns==
===Personal and Demonstrative Pronouns===
The Kyrgyz personal pronouns are мен (“I”), сен (“you,”single, informal), сиз (“you,”single, formal), биз (“we”), силер (“you,”plural informal), and сиздер (“you,”plural formal).  The formal second-person pronouns are generally used for elders and social superiors (such as a school director or father). It is probably best to simply use the formal pronouns if there is any doubt (particularly in southern Kyrgyzstan, where the influence of Uzbek makes them the pronoun of choice.) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to these are the demonstrative pronouns, (like the English “this one, that one”), which also work as third person personal pronouns. These are бул (“this one, this”), ошол (“that, that one (just mentioned)”), ал (“that, that one”),and тигил (“that one over there”). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	None of the pronouns make any changes with regard to the gender of the person indicated. Thus, ал (the demonstrative by far the most commonly used as a personal pronoun) can mean “he,” “she,” or “it.” &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Each of the demonstratives can also be used as an adjective. So, while бул by itself means “this one,” бул наан means “this bread.” The big difference is that these words do not change cases when they are used as adjectives, but when used as pronouns they take the full range. &lt;br /&gt;

      &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to тигил, there is another demonstrative pronoun adjective, “тетигил,” which means “that one way over there.” It is declined (put through its system of cases) just like тигил.&lt;br /&gt;

===The Reflexive Pronoun===
Reflexive pronouns are pronouns that refer back to the subject of a sentence, like the English word “myself”. The Kyrgyz equivalent (in first, second and third person) is өз (“self”). It is usually used for emphasis, as the reflexive sense of the verb (e.g., the English “I wash myself.”) is carried in Kyrgyz by a special verbal form (see “verb suffixes”).

Often, өз is used with possessive suffixes (compare English myself, yourself, etc.). Since it takes some sort of possessive suffix when put in any case other than the nominative (and typically, even then), its declination is presented below, in the section dealing with possessive suffixes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installation ==
These days, the pre-compiled RPMs for redhat type servers (Fedora, RedHat, CentOS, etc.) are a pretty handy way to get your name server installed and running as a boot time service. That's certainly what I use on my laptop for testing, and at work on our servers. I don't know if someone has done something similar for the Microsoft platform, but I don't really consider this to be a popular choice for critical service platform due to their regular downtime requirements in an enterprise setting. 

The very nice NameServer implementation provided for RedHat, and I assume other server vendors of the UNIX variety, has a config directory in /etc . The values in the config directory are easy to understand and edit, and there are mercifully few options to set. For instance, my opt file in /etc/tao, is the stock config file which came with the distro and is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;
# Specify desired endpoint arguments
ENDPOINT=&quot;-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://:2809&quot;

# Location of persistance data file, comment out to disable persistance.
PERSISTFILE=&quot;-f /var/cache/tao/tao-cosnaming.dat&quot;

# Enable multicast discovery, comment out to disable.
#MULTICAST=&quot;-m 1&quot;

# Enable debug logging, comment out to disable.
#DEBUGLEVEL=&quot;-ORBDebugLevel 10&quot;

# Configure log file
LOGFILE=&quot;-ORBLogFile /var/log/tao/tao-cosnaming.log&quot;

# Concatenate all options
OPTIONS=&quot;$ENDPOINT $PERSISTFILE $MULTICAST $DEBUGLEVEL $LOGFILE&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the endpoint corbaloc string doesn't have an address. This means it listens to all interfaces. If you wish to define a more restrictive listener, place your address after the double slashes, but before the colon. i.e.
&lt;pre&gt;-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://localhost:2809&lt;/pre&gt;

The list of changes has what is phrased as an exhaustive set of phase changes, but it omits ionization and deionization. I don't know what is best for this book: to correct the set by mentioning [[w:phase transition|each of the eight phase transitions]], or to word the sentence so it's explicitly not an exclusive set?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tail-recursion is of crucial importance for programming in ATS.

Suppose that a function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; calls a function &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; may be the same one. If the return value of the call to &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is also the return value of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, then this call to &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is often referred to as a tail-call. If &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; are the same, then this is a (recursive) self tail-call. For instance, there are two recursive calls in the body of the function &lt;code&gt;f91&lt;/code&gt; defined as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
fun f91 (n: int): int = if n &gt;= 101 then n - 10 else f91 (f91 (n+11))
&lt;/code&gt;

The outer recursive call is a self tail-call while the inner one is not.

If each recursive call in the body of a function is a tail-call, then this function is a tail-recursive function. For instance, the following function &lt;code&gt;sum2&lt;/code&gt; is tail-recursive:

&lt;code&gt;
fun sum2 (n: int, res: int): int = if n &gt; 0 then sum2 (n-1, n+res) else res
&lt;/code&gt;

In ATS, the single most important optimization is probably the one that turns a self tail-call into a (local) jump. This optimization effectively turns every tail-recursive function into the equivalent of a loop. Although ATS provides direct syntactic support for constructing for-loops and while-loops, the preferred approach to loop construction in ATS is through the use of tail-recursive functions.

A certain very few talk pages are magnets for misplaced questions. Newcomers end up there because they've clicked a link about &quot;Discussion&quot; that looked promising to them. They get a page that has discussion on it already.  Perfect place to ask about the weather in London, right?  They don't understand that the talk pages in question are about very specific things.  The newcomer's experience really will be better if they ask in the right place to begin with.  This template is an attempt to point them in the right direction.

This template is very much ''not'' intended to be used on most talk pages.  Indeed, it is unlikely that it will ever be appropriate to place this template on a book's talk page.  Rather, this template is intended for those very few talk pages which, by the nature of their subject matter, tend to attract novices looking for help, and asking in the wrong place.

It can be argued that this template is in danger of [[WB:BITE|biting newcomers]].  However, be aware that when newcomers ask their questions on the wrong page, those questions are almost always ignored, or deleted without response.  The theory is that it is better to grab their attention and direct them to the right place.

The name {{tl|metatalk}} comes from &quot;meta&quot;, in the &quot;about&quot; sense.  &quot;Meta-talk&quot; is talk ''about'' talk.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;


This template is used on top-level subject pages to list books within that subject's respective category.  Use {{tl|subject page}} for regular subjects.
===Usage===
Parameters, of which only the first is required:
*&lt;tt&gt;description&lt;/tt&gt;: specifies the description of the subject area the page will cover
*&lt;tt&gt;featuredbooks&lt;/tt&gt;: alternative to an automatically generated list, specifies a list of featured books in the sub-subjects of this top-level subject as an HTML unordered list (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Book]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Book2]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
*&lt;tt&gt;namespace&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies which namespace should be searched through for books; defaults to the main namespace
*&lt;tt&gt;theme&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the {{tl|Robox}} theme for the description box; defaults to 15
*&lt;tt&gt;theme2&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the {{tl|Robox}} theme for the book box; defaults to 3
*&lt;tt&gt;icon&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the logo displayed in the description box without the &lt;tt&gt;File:&lt;/tt&gt; included; defaults to the Wikibooks logo
*&lt;tt&gt;iconwidth&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the width of the logo displayed in the description box with &lt;tt&gt;px&lt;/tt&gt; included; defaults to 45px

===Copy-paste===

===Internals===
This template itself contains only interface logic: default values for parameters, and code to allow certain parameters to be extracted for use with {{nowrap|[[Template:Allbooks category|allbooks categories]]}}.  Internal code to implement the page layout is in template {{nowrap|{{tl|Root subject/core}}}}.

Parameter extraction uses the same arrangement as with {{tl|subject page}}.  The string provided for extraction is fixed (there being no actual parent parameters by which to vary it) as {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;/Books by subject/&lt;/tt&gt;}} &amp;mdash; thus presenting each root subject as a child of single parent {{nowrap|[[Subject:Books by subject]]}}.  ({{nowrap|[[Subject:Books by subject]]}} also uses this same &quot;parameter extraction&quot; scheme, presenting itself as having no parents, i.e., &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;.)

===Usage===
This template is used on subject pages to list books within that subject's respective category.  For top-level subjects, use {{nowrap|{{tl|root subject}}}} instead.

===Parameters===
*&lt;tt&gt;parent&lt;/tt&gt;: specifies a parent subject, of which this subject is a member
*&lt;tt&gt;parent2&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies a second parent subject for the subject page
*&lt;tt&gt;description&lt;/tt&gt;: specifies the description of the subject area the page will cover
*&lt;tt&gt;namespace&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies which namespace should be searched through for books; defaults to the main namespace
*&lt;tt&gt;show all staged&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies whether to list books at each completion level that are in descendant subjects as well as those in this subject; specifying &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt; lists only those in this subject; specifying &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt; lists first books in this subject, then books in descendants; any other non-blank value lists books in this subject and descendants as a single undifferentiated list; default is &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;show all featured&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies whether to list featured books in descendant subjects as well as in this subject; specifying &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt; lists only those in this subject; specifying &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt; lists first books in this subject, then books in descendants; any other non-blank value lists books in this subject and descendants as a single undifferentiated list; default is &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;maxcount&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies a requested maximum length of the book lists; default is the maximum supported directly by the extension (as of this writing, 200); request a larger number if it may be required for this subject; see {{tl|DPL}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;theme&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the {{tl|Robox}} theme for the description box; defaults to 15
*&lt;tt&gt;theme2&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the {{tl|Robox}} theme for the book box; defaults to 3
*&lt;tt&gt;icon&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the logo displayed in the description box without the &lt;tt&gt;File:&lt;/tt&gt; included; defaults to the Wikibooks logo
*&lt;tt&gt;iconwidth&lt;/tt&gt;: optional, specifies the width of the logo displayed in the description box with &lt;tt&gt;px&lt;/tt&gt; included; defaults to 45px

===Copy-paste===

===Internals===
This template itself contains only interface logic: default values for parameters, and code to allow certain parameters to be extracted for use with {{nowrap|[[Template:Allbooks category|allbooks categories]]}}.  Internal code to implement the page layout is in template {{nowrap|{{tl|Subject page/core}}}}.

Parameter extraction is accomplished by transcluding the subject page from outside the &lt;tt&gt;Subject:&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt; namespaces.  When this template detects that the transcluding page is not in either of those namespaces, it doesn't call the page layout sub-template {{nowrap|{{tl|Subject page/core}}}}; instead, it returns a string of the form {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;/''parent''/''parent2''&lt;/tt&gt;}}, where &lt;tt&gt;''parent''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''parent2''&lt;/tt&gt; are the parameter values specified to this template.  Before attempting to extract parameters from the transcluded result, the caller verifies correct format of the result by passing it to template {{tl|parsable}} &amp;mdash; and if the format doesn't verify, the caller reports the problem to {{nowrap|[[:Category:Attention needed (allbooks)]]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why do firms conduct market research? ==
Some reasons that firms conduct market research are:
* Finding out if customers like their existing products.
* Finding out if customers would be prepared to buy a new product.
If businesses do not conduct market research, they risk producing a product that customers are not interested in. Their marketing will not be effective, and the business will be unsuccessful.

== Methods of market research ==
There are two methods of market research:
* '''Primary (Field) Research''' involves collecting information directly.
* '''Secondary (Desk) Research''' involves looking at information that has already been collected and published.

== Types of data ==
You can find out two types of information through market research.
* '''Quantitative''' information is anything that you can measure or reduce to a number. For example, asking &quot;How many chocolate bars do you buy each week?&quot; will give a numerical answer, so this is quantitative data.
* '''Qualitative''' information is anything about people's opinions. For example, asking &quot;What do you think of this chocolate bar?&quot; will give an answer in words, so this is qualitative data.
Quantitative data is easy to analyse and compare, whereas qualitative data is more difficult, because it is hard to compare people's opinions. However, good market research will use both types of information.

== Primary research ==
Primary research involves things like questionnaires, surveys, product testing, and using consumer groups.
=== Writing a questionnaire ===
With questionnaires in particular, it is important to communicate to your respondent exactly what you want them to do. This ensures the information you get is reliable and easy to compare.
#Decide what information you want to find out.
#Decide what questions you can ask to find out each piece of information that you want to know.
#Use both '''open''' and '''closed''' questions. Closed questions only allow specific answers, e.g.&quot;How many bottles of orange juice do you drink each week?&quot;. Open questions allow a more detailed answer to be given, e.g. &quot;How do you feel about organic juice drinks?&quot;.
#Write the questions in an unambiguous way.
#Allow the respondent to give their answer. Make sure that they are given an option that reflects their opinion.
#Avoid misleading questions. For instance, don't ask &quot;How much do you prefer drinking organic juice to ordinary juice?&quot;. Instead, ask which they prefer.
#Test the questionnaire first (called a '''pilot'''). This gives you the chance to rewrite the questions.

=== Sample choice ===
Instead of asking the whole population questions, a business will question a smaller group, known as the sample, that will be representative of the whole population. 
==== Random sampling ====
With random sampling, the total population is known, and names of people are selected from a list (such as the electoral register) at random. This effectively means that everyone in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This gives a true sample of the population, but is more expensive and time-consuming to conduct.
==== Quota sampling ====
With quota sampling, the interviewers will select people who meet certain criteria. They may, for example, choose to interview 100 men and 100 women. This is easier and cheaper than random sampling, but it is not truly random. For example, if the interviewers were asking passers-by in the street, the people there would not necessarily be representative of the whole population - some people would not be there at the time of day that the interviews were being conducted.
==== Target sampling ====
With target sampling, the interviewers only want to sample a particular group of the population. This might be because its products are only bought by a particular market segment.

=== Advantages ===
* It is up to date.
* Can be kept private by the company.
* It is relevant and specific to what the company needs to find out.
* Gives the company an advantage over competitors, since they have more insight into the market.
=== Disadvantages ===
* Expensive and time consuming to collect.
* Needs a large sample to be accurate, which takes time.
* The data often has to be analyzed by experts to reach meaningful conclusions.

== Secondary research ==
Secondary research involves things like market research reports, government publications, and newspaper and magazine articles.

=== Advantages ===
* Usually free  or significantly cheaper, to obtain than primary research.
* Can be easily found and usually instantly available.
* Useful for looking at the whole market, and analysing past trends.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Not always relevant to what the company wants to find out.
* Not specifically about the company's products.
* May be out of date.
* Other companies have access to it as well, so it does not give the company an advantage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Solving simultaneous equations ==
=== By elimination ===
One way of solving a simultaneous equation is by canceling out either the x or y values so that you are left with a linear equation.
==== First example ====
:&lt;math&gt;20x + 15y = 135&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;20x - 8y = 20&lt;/math&gt;
In this example, we could subtract the second equation from the first to get this:
:&lt;math&gt;23y = 115&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = 5&lt;/math&gt;
Once we know this, we can go back to one of the original equations, and replace y with 5, then solve it, like this:
:&lt;math&gt;20x + 15(5) = 135&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;20x = 135 - 75&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{60}{20} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
So, the final solution is:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = 5&lt;/math&gt;
==== Second example ====
:&lt;math&gt;4x + 2y = 12&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = 4&lt;/math&gt;
We can see that in this example the equations will not cancel each other out. To make them cancel each other out, we multiply the second equation by two and get:
:&lt;math&gt;2x + 2y = 8&lt;/math&gt;
We can now subtract this from the original equation in order to get a linear equation that we can solve:
:&lt;math&gt;2x = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt;
Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it in the first equation in order to solve it:
:&lt;math&gt;4(2) + 2y = 12&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2y = 12 - 8&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{4}{2} = 2&lt;/math&gt;
So, the final solution is:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = 2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adding/subtracting matrices ==
When adding or subtracting matrices you should add/subtract numbers in the same position, like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 5 \\
4 &amp; 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
7 &amp; 2 \\
5 &amp; 3 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
8 &amp; 7 \\
9 &amp; 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
7 &amp; 5 \\
4 &amp; -2 \\
\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 2 \\
-3 &amp; 5 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
8 &amp; 3 \\
7 &amp; -7 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Matrices can only be added/subtracted if they are of the same size.

== Multiplying matrices ==
When multiplying matrices by a number, you should multiply all the numbers inside them by that number, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;2\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 \\
4 &amp; 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 6 \\
8 &amp; 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;On an interactive ROOT session: Fill an array of 100&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 64Bit floating point numbers of the [[ROOT/Handling Data/ROOT Data Types|machine independent ROOT type]] &lt;code&gt;Double_t&lt;/code&gt; with random numbers. Compute the mean of the array and print it to the console. Note the computation time.

'''Hint:''' You can get random real numbers by creating a pointer to an instance of the &lt;code&gt;TRandom&lt;/code&gt; class. (The constructor takes one arbitrary integer as initialization.) Then you can call the method &lt;code&gt;TRandom::Rndm()&lt;/code&gt; to get a simple pseudo random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));  // create a pointer to a new instance of TRanom in the heap
cout &lt;&lt; R-&gt;Rndm() &lt;&lt; endl;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Solution ==
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|Int_t nums &amp;#61; 100000000;  // random numbers to generate}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|1|TRandom *R &amp;#61; new TRandom(time(0));}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|2|Double_t *seed &amp;#61; new Double_t[nums];}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|3|for (Int_t i &amp;#61; 0; i &lt; nums; i++) &amp;#123;}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLineStalled|seed[i] &amp;#61; R-&gt;Rndm(); &amp;#125;}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|4|// some 10-20 seconds later...}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|5|Double_t mean &amp;#61; 0.0;}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|6|for (Int_t i &amp;#61; 0; i &lt; nums; i++) &amp;#123;  // make use of pressing &quot;uparrow&quot; to recall the input of line 3}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLineStalled|mean +&amp;#61; seed[i]; &amp;#125;}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|7|// some 5-15 seconds later...}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|8|mean /&amp;#61; nums;}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|9|cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean &amp;#61; &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;}}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.499963}}

* Datestamp: 00:52, 22 November 2010 (UTC)
* Reason: SUL, here's the [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGauss&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=11022591&amp;oldid=11022540 diff]. I am quite sure that '''I''' actually created [[User:Gauss]] here, given the striking relation between the only two edits of this account with edits on dewiki which were definitely mine: compare [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Transwiki:Fibonacci_number&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=683296 1a] with [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fibonacci-Zahlen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1673785 1b] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Dealing_with_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=638702 2a] with [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalismus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1946437 2b].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;{{esoteric}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

This template includes an FAQ sub-page on a talk page.

=== Usage ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{FAQ}}


&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ|see also=[[Help:FAQ]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{FAQ|collapsed=yes}}


&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ|collapsed=no}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{FAQ|collapsed=no}}


&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ|quickedit=no}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{FAQ|quickedit=no}}

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ|small=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{FAQ|small=yes}}


&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (on a talk page)
{{FAQ|demospace=talk}}


&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FAQ|small=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (on a talk page)
{{FAQ|small=yes|demospace=talk}}

=== Section headings ===
Section headings should not normally be used within the FAQ template since they will show in the table of contents of the page where the FAQ template is transcluded.  A way around this is to use markup like the following: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;Heading name&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, on a line by itself.  On the /FAQ content page itself, when not transcluded, it will have navigable headings as if it were a line reading &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading name==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  When transcluded into the FAQ template (or elsewhere), it will have bold pseudo-headings, as if it were a line reading &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;;Heading name&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
# Consider the problem solved in the [[Template:ROOT/Exercises/Trying Interactive ROOT|previous exercise]]. Now write a script that does the same thing and execute it as interpreted macro. Does it run faster?
# Modify the script in a way that the user can pass the amount of random numbers to be created as a parameter.
# Overload the macro such that the amount of numbers can still be passed but if no parameter is given, 100&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 numbers will be generated.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Solution ==

=== Part 1 ===
Create the following file and name it &lt;code&gt;random_mean.cc&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void random_mean()
{
  Int_t nums = 100000000;  // random numbers to generate
  TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));
  Double_t *seed = new Double_t[nums];
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    seed[i] = R-&gt;Rndm();
  }
  Double_t mean = 0.0;
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    mean += seed[i];
  }
  mean /= nums;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean = &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now open a ROOT session in this directory and say
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|.x random_mean.cc}}

Between a half and one minute later you shall get:
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.499952}}

The script isn't any faster than the code entered directly to the ROOT command line because in either case it is run as interpreted code by CINT.

=== Part 2 ===
This takes only a minor change of the script file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void random_mean(Int_t nums)
{
  TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));
  Double_t *seed = new Double_t[nums];
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    seed[i] = R-&gt;Rndm();
  }
  Double_t mean = 0.0;
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    mean += seed[i];
  }
  mean /= nums;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean = &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now you can compute the mean of&amp;mdash;for example&amp;mdash;20 numbers:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|1|.x random_mean.cc(20)}}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.539992}}

Note that calling without a parameter will fail:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|2|.x random_mean.cc}}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Error: Function random_mean() is not defined in current scope  :0:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42; Interpreter error recovered &amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;}}

=== Part 3 ===
To allow calling with and without parameter, we overload the function with one that takes no parameter and does nothing than calling the other one with the default parameter of 100 millions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void random_mean(Int_t nums)
{
  TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));
  Double_t *seed = new Double_t[nums];
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    seed[i] = R-&gt;Rndm();
  }
  Double_t mean = 0.0;
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    mean += seed[i];
  }
  mean /= nums;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean = &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void random_mean()
{
  random_mean(100000000); // on default, take 1E8 numbers
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now both calls work:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|3|.x random_mean.cc}}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.499998}}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|4|.x random_mean.cc(3000)}}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.499366}}

Actually, this shouldn't be very exciting. It's just the C++ language. But it's a nice thing to see that it works just as expected inside the ROOT framework.

**Case
***Picture of motherboard being inserted into a case
** CPU
***&lt;s&gt;Picture of a CPU Socket&lt;/s&gt;
** Hard Disk
***Mention the importance of cache amount, 7200RPM is now standard for desktop hard disks, 8MB 7200 RPM would be faster than 2MB 7200 RPM, and Seagate, Maxtor, Western Digital all are now offering drives with 16MB cache. 8MB should be the minimum these days.

=== Organizing the book ===
Hi Folks! Your book is progressing greatly, and even going for book of the month. Before being placed into that position, I suggest you though, to give your book a little bit of a &quot;Wikibook appearance&quot; (Currently it looks like a 1-page Wikipedia entry...).
If you want to invest some time in adding subpages to your book, to structure it better, and make it better readable online (people can more quickly go to the section they are interested in), I`d suggest creating subpages: Have a look at a very basic example like [[Hamster Care]]: Ideally on the main page, there is a short introduction and a table of contents which then leads to the pages of the book:
 [[How To Build A Computer]]
 [[How To Build A Computer/Decisions, Decisions, Decisions]]
 [[How To Build A Computer/Choosing the parts]]
 [[How To Build A Computer/Building the computer]]
and so on. Using subpages by &quot;/&quot; will give you an automatic link back to the main page. Don`t split it up completely, four or five sections is probably fine for the moment. (one can always add more later, but avoid having &quot;red links&quot; from the start..)
Have a look at a recent conversion first and read [[User talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization of the Golden Bough]] to see about pitfalls (why it is better to use names than chapter numbers, and why a flat hierarchy is best, i.e. don`t use sub-sub-pages, but have all pages be a direct sub-page of [[How To Build A Computer]]. For an ongoing discussion how to best organize Wikibooks have a look also at [[Wikibooks:Hierachy naming scheme]] . If you need help or have questions, I`d gladly help. Also, if you don`t mind, I might help you with the basic conversion. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:19, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:I had been thinking the same thing myself for a little bit. There were a couple organizational issues that needed to be taken care of before this conversion, but I believe that was taken care of. I reorganized it into sub-modules and split the &quot;Building&quot; section. I think definitively separating the software and hardware construction makes reading easier. We now need to start thinking about the transitions and improving the introduction/conclusion. --[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 05:01, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

OK... I've just made a new table of contents template (actually, a rip-off of the Lucid Dreaming one :)), which appears at the top and bottom of every page.

=== Overclocking AND UNDERCLOCKING? ===
I noticed that there was nothing about Underclocking in the Overclocking section - not everybody wants to overclock, as some of you should know. I think it would be appropiate to add some stuff about underclocking (which, if I'm correct, is basically overclocking with a few different steps in - nevertheless, someone might get confused, etc.) 

Also, if we do decide to put more information about underclocking a CPU in the same section as Overclocking, should we change the title of that section to &quot;Overclocking/Underclocking&quot;? --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 03:00, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

=== About the merge ===
* Ok, but why the book main page threatens with merge suggestion message? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
**The [[Computer Hardware]] book may have a bit more to offer than the [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]] for computer harware but How To Assemble A Desktop PC is better overall.  The merger is to move Computer Hardware into this book and not the other way round. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

** It makes no sense to merge this article with computer hardware. The two subjects are completely different. Building a desktop computer deals with only internal hardware, not external hardware. It would cause confusion to put a subject completely about internal hardware and assembly into an article that deals with both internal and external hardware.

** I don't think that they should put computer hardware into this because it is not really about learning all about hardware, it is about learning how to build a computer and it might get you off track and thinking about something else. &lt;u&gt;Studyfreak101&lt;/u&gt;

===PDF===

:::Seriously, discuss this at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|wikibooks staff lounge]] first. Having two copies of a document causes big trouble. They don't stay in sync for long. Maybe there is, or could be, a stylesheet (wiki skin) that would make a printed version of the wiki look nicer. The ability to produce nice printed books is a general demand for wikibooks projects, not something specific to this book. The problem is either solved already or needs to be solved urgently, and OpenOffice is definitly not the answer. Preparing books for printing needs to be mostly or fully automated.

::::::Users should not have to change the skin. Besides, it still doesn't make it print like a book. It also doesn't print the whole thing out at the same time, instead one module at a time.

This should replace the basic need for the PDF version. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

Now why this makes the whole DIV disappear on print version is another story  hehe.. (it is a trick.. a workaround for the Monobook.css: class=top is actually responsible that the topmost line disappears when printed (the one with user info and login/logout). Since it is a class, I can use it in other DIVs as well, and all it does, is to hide the element when printed.

=== Don't know where else to put this ===
I have a suggestion for the hardware data provided by your book. The overall gist of this book is great (having read the first 2 chapters). I wish I had something like this when I was first building a computer. It would have been a great help. 

However, there are many places where the descriptions given by harware manufacturers arn't given in this book. For example: CAS latencies, HDD technologies (NCQ, cache size, RPM), CPU specifics (clock speed, cache size, socket type), monitor frequency ranges, etc. Most importantly, describe what effects these technologies can have on the computer as a whole. This information would be best placed in an appendix/appendices, so it doesn't clutter up the rest of the book. 

The overall goal should be to describe the different specs that each component can have, so a buyer knows what they are looking at when they look at system specs. Also, I would avoid making specific references to &quot;better choices&quot; (like the specific AMD vs Intel remark on the CPU page). Instead, inform the user of the differences, and have them make a decision on their own.

Just my 2 cents, hope it helps.

Ok, I am an old fart, so for me &quot;computer&quot; is not equal to &quot;PC compatible computer&quot;.

I initially came to this book because I wanted to learn how to build a computer ''the old fashioned way''.  I was going to suggest that the name of this book be changed, but someone already did that.  I would agree, then, that this should have a different name.  Allow me to suggest the name &quot;How to Build a PC&quot; (or Desktop PC), since it is generally understood that a PC is based on the Intel (or compatible) CPU and will run Windows, which is probably what most people are looking for.

:I prefer &quot;assemble&quot;, but I agree. Also, desktop Mac assembly is similar (you need a case, mobo, CPU, power supply, etc.) if you can find the parts. So &quot;How to Build/Assemble a Desktop PC&quot; sounds good to me. (This guide would obviously not cover laptops or PocketPCs.)

Once the reader is assured by the title that they are reading about PCs, then any reference to a `computer' within the book would understandably imply `PC'.

:OK.

I think using the word `assembly' would be misleading, as this is often used to mean ''assembly language''.  -- [[User:JeffreyMeunier|Jeff Meunier]]

: I also would be interested in building a computer &quot;the old fashioned way&quot; (with a few new-fangled improvements). Yes, people have filled out the &quot;desktop PC&quot; sections of the book first -- that doesn't make it ''wrong'' to talk about assembling Macs or laptops or wire-wrapped/soldered systems. If you say &quot;this book is not for hand wire-wrapped/soldered system&quot;, then I feel you have an obligation to point out which book *is* the appropriate one to talk about those things.

=== Book of the month (April) ===
*I nominated this book to be the April book of the month. I'm not sure how &quot;likely&quot; it is this'll get it... but its worth a shot! If you've put some work into this Book throw your weight for it!--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 07:15, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:This book is currently tied for first place in the voting. [[Wikibooks:Book_of_the_month/April_2005_voting#How_To_Build_A_Computer|Vote]] now if you think this book is worthy of recognition.--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 05:13, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:As of today (21-march), We're 2 clear, and in the lead.  If you have added to this book,[[Wikibooks:Book_of_the_month/April_2005_voting#How_To_Build_A_Computer|Get yourself counted!!!]] --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:00, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
*Reub has been of the oppinion that we could make this book look much better after another month or so. I don't feel terribly one way or the other about this, but since Reub started the book and seems to have aspects he wants to put a bit more time into... I've decided to retract my vote as well in support.--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 01:39, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:I've added some things to the todo list. Everyone, please look at it, and see if you can do any of those. Once it's down to only a few items, then I think we should put this up for article of the month again. Also, feel free to add stuff to the todo list, whitch you think should be there. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 02:51, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

=== Guidelines ===

* Please, No brand/location-specific products in the purchasing section. This is not a buyer's guide, and this is also trying to be relevant to non-US Citizens.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 03:05, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

* MOVED.  SEE BELOW FOR THIS POST

--[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 08:19, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:I think there are some places where brands should be mentioned. However, I agree that the buying parts section is getting a bit long and out of hand. So many useless peripherals sections. And the guide should never state that someone should simply buy a certain brand. Reasons should be given for choices, and maybe even alternatives. However, I didn't notice a problem with this guide mentioning non-us parts. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 04:55, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::I do completely agree on the brand issue.  There are many places where mentioning specific brands can be useful, and I kept them in, such as Intel/AMD and ATi/nVidia - these references are necessary as they do actually explain how to build a computer in the later sections; but in other sections (such as Hard Drives, CD Drives, and other petty peripherals), a writer's brand choice can often only be a matter of opinion, and as such shouldn't be in this book.  As for the Non-US problem, I've edited out a considerable amount that refers to brands that cannot be used outside of the US, which is annoying.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 22:07, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:BTW, I found [[Buyers_Guide_For_Building_a_Computer|this]], which has a lot of text that you deleted. I find it quite amusing. I was wondering if we should request that it be deleted? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 02:23, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Yes... This does seem quite impressive -- this guy won't give up!  I especially love his description of CPU's and his comparison between Windows and Lux... As for deletion: I think it would be much more fun to see how he reacts if we actually put some useful information into the article, and clean it up to a respectible standard.

*Simply stating a person should buy a case with a motherboard and power supply with fan already installed would be a good choice.--
:: Although it's nice to tell people to purchase a precompiled case/fan/PSU, it does cut off options.  I can't remember whether we have actually listed this as an option (I think we have), but if not, put it up there -- this is intended to provide a general insight, but still quite specific; not to provide a cut-corners option
* Notice, most stuff is made over seas. I think most of this would be foreign to Americans.
:: That notice was put there to remove references to brands that are sold exclusively in the US - although there are many brands who are globally recognisable, many aren't - we don't want to alienate foreign readers (like myself)
* Maybe we could integrate a lot of Wiki into the a+ certi book. With people reading that whole book they sure would be able to compile a computer from scratch.
:: I don't see the A+ book to be completely relevant -- this has a slightly different focus, I think, in that it doesn't have an end educational point - so you can borrow stuff from here, by all means, but we don't need to get rid of this module for one with a slightly broader focus.
* Also people have to undrestand the complex logic of buying parts and having a power supply to them. If you don't have enough power, you can't have all your parts powered up.
:: That could definitely be added - but doesn't your previous suggestion remove the idea of a PSU from the buyer's mind?

=== Edits ===

* In the Software =&gt; Linux section, I have removed XMMS from the list; as we are already suggesting KDE and amaroK is already on the list, amaroK seems to be a better suggestion in this context. --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 20:50, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== Software Installation Section ===

The section about installing software has grown way out of hand to a point where it doesn't actually help with building a computer - there are way too many redundant lines, such as those on BSD and Window managers, and are going to be removed, and if they reappear, will be removed again.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 22:24, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:I think preparing your new computer is definitly a part of building a computer. However, do get rid of any mentions of obscure OSes like SkyOS. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 02:16, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Maybe this part should link to the freeware wikibook as it has an extensive list of free software [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 01:04, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't really see it as necessary to place a link there - we have here just a short list of software that is ''necessary'' to get a computer up-and-running to a reasonable standard - there's no reason to link to a huge list of software that is only going to confuse.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 08:22, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== Split ===

* Why not split this article into 3 sections, prebuild, building, and postbuilding. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 02:06, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

** If that is to be the case, we need a slightly longer introduction that goes into a bit more depth.  But the article needs to be at a higher standard (specifically the building section) before we do this.--[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 08:43, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== What parts do ===

There should be more of a description on what parts do, a down to detail theme.

: How exactly is this necessary?  Although it can be good to have a certain amount of understanding of a computer, I don't think it quite links into the expertise that is required for an article like this - this is only supposed to go into detail regarding the actual building of a computer.--[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 08:25, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I agree that *somewhere* there should be a description of what the various parts do.
But the wikibooks listed at [[Computer Science/Certifications]]
already have much of that information -- wouldn't it be better to link to the appropriate page in those wikibooks (or to a Wikipedia article) for more details,
rather than duplicate those details here?

:Inconsistency is OK for the article - just write your own edits in your &quot;native tongue&quot;, and don't edit &quot;typos&quot; that result due to the dialect.  As such, there won't be any fighting about which dialect is right.  Your thoughts?  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 05:49, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::I found [[w:Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English|this]] on Wikipedia. So I guess we use British English because seems to be predominant. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 03:04, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I get inside a fair number of computers of all strata in the course of my work, and my camera is an Olympus E-10.  If y'all would like some original photography, I'd be happy to oblige.

Excellent. Please take lots of photos. We need a picture of a floppy disk drive cable (with the strange little twist in the middle), and a picture that shows what to look for on the floppy drive and the motherboard when trying to plug in the cable right-side-up. Also a few &quot;whole system&quot; photos to show that it's normal to have a messy tangle of wires and cables when you are done. (Or am I doing it wrong?)

Well, there, I've been through the book once and I hope left it better than I found it, anyway it's longer. Anybody looking to contribute could do worse than adding more wiki-links, and the hardware section could use some more pictures I think, the overclocking section could be up-dated and more detailed and a troubleshooting section for when things go wrong would be a nice addition.Oh, and maybe some clever person could figure out a consistant placement of the TOC on each page - I couldn't figure it out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise ==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Use [[Template:ROOT/Exercises/Interpreted ROOT Macros|the script you've written before]] and modify it so it can be run as compiled macro via ACLiC.

* Make sure that both, calling with and without parameter, will still work.
* Can your script still be interpreted by CINT after you've changed it?
* How is the performance of the compiled macro for 100&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 numbers? What is faster for 5 numbers?&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
* Does the script run faster a second time after compiling? How can you enforce recompilation?

== Solution ==

All we have to do is adding three lines of code at the beginning that tell the compiler to include the &lt;code&gt;iostream&lt;/code&gt; class (which we need for the console printout) and the &lt;code&gt;TRandom&lt;/code&gt; class which is a ROOT class. We also set the namespace to &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;. That's it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
# include &lt;iostream&gt;
# include &quot;TRandom.h&quot;

using namespace std;

void random_mean(Int_t nums)
{
  TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));
  Double_t *seed = new Double_t[nums];
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    seed[i] = R-&gt;Rndm();
  }
  Double_t mean = 0.0;
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    mean += seed[i];
  }
  mean /= nums;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean = &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void random_mean()
{
  random_mean(100000000); // on default, take 1E8 numbers
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's run it as compiled macro for 5 numbers. The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; after the filename tells ROOT to run it as compiled macro via ACLiC.
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|.x random_mean.cc+(5)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;TUnixSystem::ACLiC&gt;: creating shared library /home/tux/Desktop/test/./random_mean_cc.so  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.264084  }}

It should take about a second until the result appears. In contrast interpreting the macro with CINT&amp;mdah;this ''is'' still possible&amp;mdash will only take less than a second:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|1|.x random_mean.cc(5)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.648964  }}

This is because for such a little job as generating five random numbers and computing their mean, the execution time is so ridiculous low that virtually all the time is needed for compilation. However, if we run the compiled macro again, ACLiC is smart enough to realize that it didn't change and will reuse the binaries. Now execution is only a matter of milliseconds:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|2|.x random_mean.cc+(5)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;ACLiC&gt;: random_mean_cc has been modified and will be reloaded  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.418168  }}

You can force ACLiC to compile again even if not necessary by appending &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;:
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|3|.x random_mean.cc++(5)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;ACLiC&gt;: unmodified script has already been compiled and loaded  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;ACLiC&gt;: it will be regenerated and reloaded!  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;TUnixSystem::ACLiC&gt;: creating shared library /home/tux/Desktop/test/./random_mean_cc.so  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.446351  }}

Now see if calling without parameter will still work and how performance of the compiled macro is for a hundred million numbers. (Remember that it took up to a minute to interpret the script. Try it!) To make a fair competition, recompile the code.
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|4|.x random_mean.cc++  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;TUnixSystem::ACLiC&gt;: creating shared library /home/tux/Desktop/test/./random_mean_cc.so  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.500002  }}

This shouldn't have taken longer than two or three seconds. In some sense, the decision of running a macro as interpreted or as compiled code is like deciding whether you should take the train to visit your friend or you should walk. If your friend lives next door, walking will probably be faster than waiting for the next train to come. But if he happens to live in the next town, the train will be hundred or thousand times faster and the few minutes waiting for it don't account for much.

===Usage===
:{{tlx|archive nav|N}} where N is archive number. Archive subpages must be named as &quot;Archive 1&quot;, &quot;Archive 2&quot;, &quot;Archive 3&quot;, etc. for this to work.
:{{tlx|archive nav|N|base&amp;#61;base}} where N is archive number AND base is the base path of the archives.

&lt;includeonly&gt;{{esoteric}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

This template allows you to navigate through sequentially-numbered archive pages.

===Example display===
{| style=&quot;width: 32em; background: transparent; margin: 0 auto 0.5em; text-align: center&quot;
| [[Talk:Main Page|« 1]] || [[Talk:Main Page|← Archive 5]] || '''Archive 6''' || [[Talk:Main Page|Archive 7 →]] || [[Talk:Main Page|9 »]]
|}

=== Usage ===
It does not require any parameters; just place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{atn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; near the top of each archive for a particular page. It will create a navigation bar to facilitate movement among them, back to the page itself and to the current talk page. It will also work out which archive has the highest number (i.e. the most recent) and allow you to skip directly to that one.

In order for this template to work, the archives must be named &quot;Archive 1&quot;, &quot;Archive 2&quot; and so on (capital &quot;A&quot;, with a space before the number). If they are not, move them to the appropriate names first; see [[Help:Pages#Moving]] for information.

However, if you wish to use the old version, which was a box, simply add &lt;code&gt;|old&lt;/code&gt; to the template, such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{atn|old}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The old version is now also customizable, here are the parameters for customization:

&lt;pre&gt;
|border=
|border-shape=
|border-size=
|border-color=
|border-color2=
|background=
|background2=
|text-color=
|text-color2=
&lt;/pre&gt;

Simply tack any of these onto {{tl|atn}} and they will come into affect, such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{atn|old|text-color2=E32636}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Descriptions of each field can be found below, as well as how to use them.

*'''border''': If you want a border, simply use ''yes'' for this field, otherwise, leave it blank, or put ''no''.
**'''border-shape''': The shape of the border.  If this field is left blank, it is left at ''solid'', otherwise you can put things here like ''thin''.
**'''border-size''': The precise thickness of one of the inner borders, mainly the line separating the link back to the main talk page from the links to the different archive pages.  Make sure you put ''px'' after the number you want, so say, if you wanted the border to be 10px, you would put |border-size=10px .
**'''border-color''': Pretty self-explanatory, the color of the first border around the entire box.  Note that it can either be the color name, such as ''red'', or one of the colors listed at [[w:List of colors|List of colors]] with the color hex triplet, such as ''E32636''.  Also note that when you input the hex triplet color code, do not include the [[#]] sign, as it is already present in the template.
**'''border-color2''': Roughly the same as above, except now it is the color of the line that separates the main talk page link from the archive links.
*'''background''': The background for the text that links to the main talk page.  As with the other params above that use colors, the same applies.
**'''background2''': The same as applies above, except now it is for the background for the text linking to the archives.
*'''text-color''': The color for the text linking to the main talk page.  Same things as above apply.
**'''text-color2''': Same as above, but for the text that links to the archives.  Same rules above apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Once again, consider [[Template:ROOT/Exercises/Compiled ROOT Macros|the code you should have previously written]] to compute the mean of an array of random numbers. Now, last but not least, make it a stand-alone application and run it independently of any ROOT session. Make sure that passing parameters will still work. Check the performance of your application. Take also care that your modifications don't disturb interpretation or on-the-fly compilation by CINT or ACLiC.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Solution ==
What we have to do is to add an &lt;code&gt;int main()&lt;/code&gt; function. But this will bother CINT. So we hide it by putting a preprocessor command around it that will ignore it if the variable &lt;code&gt;__CINT__&lt;/code&gt; is defined.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
# ifndef __CINT__  // the following code will be invisible for the interpreter

int main()
{
  random_mean();
}

# endif
&lt;/source&gt;

This works. But it doesn't allow us to pass command line arguments yet. So to make it complete, we add a check if any parameters are given and if so, we convert the second (the first is&amp;mdash;as always&amp;mdash;the name of the application) to an integer and call &lt;code&gt;random_mean&lt;/code&gt; with it. The conversation may be done with the &lt;code&gt;strtof&lt;/code&gt; method that can be found in the &lt;code&gt;cstdlib&lt;/code&gt;.

The final code should look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// compile with:  g++ -o random_mean random_mean.cc `root-config --cflags --glibs`

# include &lt;cstdlib&gt;  // needed to convert string argument to integer
# include &lt;iostream&gt;
# include &quot;TRandom.h&quot;

using namespace std;

void random_mean(Int_t nums)
{
  TRandom *R = new TRandom(time(0));
  Double_t *seed = new Double_t[nums];
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    seed[i] = R-&gt;Rndm();
  }
  Double_t mean = 0.0;
  for (Int_t i = 0; i &lt; nums; i++)
  {
    mean += seed[i];
  }
  mean /= nums;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mean = &quot; &lt;&lt; mean &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void random_mean()
{
  random_mean(100000000); // on default, take 1E8 numbers
}

# ifndef __CINT__  // the following code will be invisible for the interpreter

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (argc == 1)  // no parameter given
  {
    random_mean();
  }
  else
  {
    Int_t parameter = (Int_t) strtof(argv[1], NULL);  // convert the second parameter to an integer
    random_mean(parameter);
  }
}

# endif
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can compile the code using an external compiler

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;g++ -o random_mean random_mean.cc `root-config --cflags --glibs`&lt;/source&gt;

and also execute it without starting ROOT. With or without a parameter. Check out how fast it is!

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./random_mean 34
mean = 0.500596
./random_mean
mean = 0.500062
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that is is ''still'' possible to interpret or compile your macro on-the-fly.
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|.x random_mean.cc(10)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|mean &amp;#61; 0.568087  }}
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|1|.x random_mean.cc+(10)  }}
{{ROOT/RootOutput|Info in &lt;ACLiC&gt;: script has already been loaded in interpreted mode&lt;br /&gt;Info in &lt;ACLiC&gt;: unloading /home/tux/Desktop/test/./random_mean.cc and compiling it&lt;br /&gt;mean &amp;#61; 0.535071  }}

So after a long journey, we have finally made the ultimate ROOT source file. I also recommend this strategy when developing something new. First try it interactively. If you know what to do, start writing your macro and test it on the interpreter. If it is more or less finished, make sure the code is clean and test it on larger amounts of data as compiled code. And finally make it a stand.alone application (if needed). It is wonderful that ROOT supports all these possibilities.

One more thing to note: This was a ''basic'' example. To build a stand-alone application with a ROOT GUI a slightly more difficult setup is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ROOT/Template Documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;This is a template designed for the book [[ROOT]]. It should be used to embed exercises into other pages.

== Usage ==
=== Syntax ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/Exercise|#1}}&lt;/source&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Parameter || Default Value || Mandatory || Description
|-
| #1 || various || yes || Name of the exercise to embed.
|}

=== Further Explanation ===
* If necessary: Create a new page for the exercise and name it &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/Exercises/A new ROOT Exercise&lt;/code&gt;. Put &lt;code&gt;&amp;#60;onlyinclude&amp;#62;&amp;#60;/onlyinclude&amp;#62;&lt;/code&gt; tags around the ''question''.
* Go to the page you want to embed the exercise and add &lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;ROOT/Exercise&amp;#124;A new ROOT Exercise&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/Exercises/&lt;/code&gt; in the exercise's name is omitted!
* Also embed the exercise on the page [[ROOT/Exercises]].

== Example ==
In this example, we embed the exercise ''[[Template:ROOT/Exercises/Trying Interactive ROOT|Trying Interactive ROOT]]'' which is located at the page named &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/Exercises/Trying Interactive ROOT&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Code ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/Exercise|Trying Interactive ROOT}}&lt;/source&gt;

=== Result ===
{{ROOT/Exercise|Trying Interactive ROOT}}

==Logging in==
{{shortcut|WB:LOGIN}}
It is not necessary to '''[[w:log in|log in]]''' before viewing or editing pages. It does provide additional features, and is generally recommended. If you do not wish to have your [[w:IP address|IP address]] known then you should log in.

It is quick and simple to create a personal user account.

Creating a [[w:user account|user account]] means:
Click on the words &quot;log in&quot; at the top right of the page
(That takes you to the [[Special:UserLogin]] page).
When the &quot;Join Wikibooks&quot; button appears, click on it.
After you supply a username (your real name or a nickname) and a [[w:password|password]], click the &quot;Create your account&quot; button.
The system will reject a username that is already in use. A user account is created only once. You are then &quot;logged in&quot;. The next time you log in, you supply your username again and demonstrate with the password that you are the same person. (Do not share your password with other people; this can allow them to misuse your account, which could lead to it being blocked.)

Edits you make are recorded under your username. If you are not logged in your edits are labeled in [[WB:PH|page history]] with your IP address.

User accounts created will be accessible from all [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] projects). [[#Preferences|Preferences]] are currently set independently on each wiki.

=== Why log in? ===
You don't have to log in to read Wikibooks. You don't even have to log in to edit most of Wikibooks (there are [[Wikibooks:Protected page|some exceptions]]).

However, it's still a good idea to log in, for these reasons:

* Other users will be able to recognize you by your username when you make changes to pages. As a &quot;name&quot; an IP address is somewhat clumsy. Also, if you use computers at different locations (home, office, internet cafe, etc.) you have a different IP address in each case; even in the same location, depending on the Internet connection, the IP address may be different each time. Therefore a username is better to maintain an identity.
*You will have your own ''[[Wikibooks:User pages|user page]]'' where you can write a bit about yourself, and a ''user talk page'' which you can use to communicate with other users.
*You will also be able to make user subpages, as an add-on to your user page.
* You will be able to mark an edit as [[WB:MINOR|minor]], which avoids inconvenience for other users.
* You will be able to keep track of changes to pages you are interested in using a ''[[WB:WATCH|watchlist]]''.
* If you choose to give an email address, other users will be able to contact you by email.  This feature is anonymous—the user who emails you will not know your email address.  You don't have to give your email address if you don't want to.
* You will be able to [[WB:MOVE|rename pages]].
* You will be able to set your own ''[[#Preferences|preferences]]'', to change things such as:
** The number of pages displayed in ''[[WB:RC|Recent changes]]''
** The fonts, colors and layout of the site.

==== Creating an account ====
To create an account, select [[Special:UserLogin|Log in]] (top right of page) then click [[Special:UserLogin/signup|create an account]]. You will need to provide a username and password, as well as answer a visual &quot;[[Special:Captcha|captcha]]&quot; test. You may be unable to create an account if it contains certain symbols (particularly the '@' symbol, as well as certain non-Latin characters) or words, or if it is too similar to that of an existing user. If your IP address has account creation blocked, you can request to be unblocked.

=== How to log in ===
First, make sure that your [[w:Web browser|browser]] accepts [[w:HTTP cookie|cookies]]. Some browsers can accept or reject cookies from individual sites; users of these should configure the browser to accept cookies from each wiki you plan to edit, such as ''wikibooks.org''.

Click on the ''[[Special:Userlogin|Log in]]'' link at the top right of the page. You will then be prompted to enter your username and password.  If you have not logged in before, you will need to use the link provided to create an account.

You may give your email address if you like. Other users will be able to send email to the address, but they won't be able to find out what the address is.

If you click the box ''Remember me'', you will not have to give your password again when you access this wiki from the same computer. Please note that the cookies containing username and password automatically expire 30 days after login (unless you log out manually).

==== Login issues and problems ====
If you find yourself unable to log in, you may have one of the problems addressed in the following paragraphs. If none of them seem to apply, ask for help at the [[WB:HELP|help desk]].

;The login link is obscured: If you cannot click on the login link, for instance because it is obscured by other text, use this [[Special:UserLogin|direct link]] to the login page. It may be helpful to add the page to your browser's bookmarks/favorites.  (This problem may occur on certain browsers when using a large minimum font size.)

;My username and password are refused: Both usernames and passwords are [[w:case-sensitive|case-sensitive]] on Wikibooks. Did you remember to type in the right capitalization? For example, if you registered under MyUserName, you will not be able to log in as Myusername (notice the subtle difference in spelling). The same goes for your password. The only exception is the first character of the username, which is capital by default.

;I get logged out just after logging in: There are a few possible causes of this problem:
* If you appear to have logged in, but as soon as you try to look at a page after 'Log in successful', you appear logged out again, it is very likely to be a [[w:HTTP cookie|cookie]] problem. See [http://www.google.com/cookies.html this brief tutorial] on how to enable cookies for your browser.
* Make sure your computer's date and time are set correctly; if they are not, cookies may expire before they are supposed to. Note that some [[w:firewall|firewall]] and [[w:Ad filtering|ad-blocking]] software may interfere with the cookie that Wikibooks uses to keep a person logged in.
* Some ISPs use [[w:transparent proxy|transparent proxies]] which cause problems logging in. Try using the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/Main_Page secure server] (much slower) to bypass the proxy. This happens most often with some satellite ISPs (particularly [[w:HughesNet|HughesNet]]/[[w:DirecWay|DirecWay]]/[[w:DirecPC|DirecPC]]).
* Occasionally, a user may find him/herself &quot;automatically&quot; logged out between beginning an edit and saving it, or when switching between multiple wiki pages open in multiple windows or tabs. This can be a result of your browser's cookie, cache, or firewall settings, but sometimes, especially during heavy server load, the system can &quot;glitch&quot; and your login information will be lost, resulting in a logout.

;Other causes: If you are absolutely sure that the login information you have entered is correct, then someone else may have compromised your account. In this case, your account may not be recoverable unless you can prove that the account is yours.

;I get a message that my IP address has been autoblocked: Follow the instructions listed on screen on how to request an unblock.

====What if I forget the password?====
If you previously entered an e-mail address when signing up for the account or in your Preferences, you can enter your username on the login screen and click 'E-mail new password', which will send a temporary password to your e-mail address that will allow you to retrieve your account. You can change it after you login. 

If you did not enter an e-mail address—or if the stored address is no longer accessible—you will have to create a new account. After doing this you should [[WB:MOVE|&quot;move&quot;]] your previous User and User talk pages to your new name as soon as possible (e.g. by making a request on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|administrative assistance]] page). This will officially link your old and new identities and reassure other editors that your new account isn't a &quot;[[WB:SOCK|sockpuppet]]&quot;.

=== Your user page and user talk page ===
As a logged in user, you will be able to create your own ''[[Special:Mypage|user page]]'' and ''[[Special:Mytalk|user talk page]]''.  When you are logged in, you will see your username displayed at the top right of the page.  Click on this to get to your user page, which you can edit in the same way as any other wiki page.

Most users write a little bit about themselves and their interests on their user page.

You also have a ''User talk page''. You can access this by clicking on the ''My talk'' link next to your username at the top right of the page. Other people may write messages in your user talk page by editing it, and you can respond. See [[Help:Pages#Discussing]] for more.

=== Logging out ===
You can log out any time by clicking on the ''Log out'' link at the top right of the page. To prevent the browser from remembering your username and suggesting it to the next user of the computer, remember to delete the Wikibooks cookies in your browser's privacy settings. Especially if you are using a public computer, you may want to delete all of the browser's recent history (Ctrl+Shift+Del in [[w:Firefox|Firefox]]).

=== Keeping your account secure ===
Users, especially [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]], should keep their accounts secure. If someone accesses your account and causes malicious damage, your reputation could be in trouble! Below are some tips on keeping your account secure:

#Never give your Wikibooks password to anyone, not even users claiming to be sysop and staff!
#Only enter your password on a Wikimedia site. Beware of fake sites. It should be end with wikibooks.org or wikimedia.org.
#Keep your computer up-to-date with the latest anti-virus  and [[w:anti-spyware software|anti-spyware software]].
#Your password should be easy to remember, but hard to guess.
#If you decide to log on using a public computer, remember to log out when done.
#Consider [[Template:User committed identity|committing]] to your identity by adding a cryptographic hash to your user page to prove that you are really the person behind your username.

==Preferences==
{{shortcut|WB:PREFS}}

'''Preferences''' are settings made by a [[#Logging in|logged-in]] user that control that user's account and various aspects of the user's viewing and editing environment.

To access the preferences screen (having logged on), click &quot;My preferences&quot; at the top of the screen, or navigate to [[Special:Preferences]].

=== User profile ===
The '''User profile''' tab contains information and basic settings relating to your user account.

; Username: The name of your user account. You cannot change this name yourself; see [[#Changing username|Changing username]] below.
; User ID: Your internal account ID number on the wiki. A small number indicates that you were one of the first to create an account on that wiki.
; Member of groups: The names of the user groups you belong to. These provide you with certain &quot;rights&quot; (powers to carry out certain actions).
; Number of edits: The total number of edits you have made on the wiki.
; Global account status: This section provides a summary of the status of your global account. The phrase &quot;All in order!&quot; appears when your global account is fully connected and working properly. See [[m:Help:Unified login|Help:Unified login]] for more information.
; Gender: This option allows you to select a gender (male or female), or unspecified. This option is designed for languages where, unlike English, the grammar of user interface text can change depending on your gender. As such, this option is not meaningful for English users at present. The gender you select is public, but not readily viewable. 
; Password: Click the &quot;change password&quot; link to go to a simple page where you can change your wiki password.
; Remember my login on this computer: This option is equivalent to the &quot;Remember my login&quot; or &quot;Remember me&quot; option on the login page. You can use this option to create (if selected) or delete (if de-selected) a [[w:HTTP cookie|cookie]] that will remember your login details, so you do not need to log in every time you visit the wiki. The cookie expires automatically after 30 days, for security reasons. See [[#Logging in|logging in]] above.

==== Internationalisation ====
; Language: Allows you to specify the language in which the site interface will be displayed to you. There are some limitations:
:* If the wiki's sidebar contains hard-coded custom labels, these are in effect for all interface languages, and will not change according to this setting.
:* Note that using a left-to-right as interface language in right-to-left wikis, such as Arabic, shows all checkboxes and form elements reversed.
:* The interface language does not affect [[WB:NS|namespace]] names; they are determined by the site's main language. However, in links and in page names entered in the address bar of the browser, English namespace names, being the generic namespace names, are automatically converted to the local names.

==== Signature ====
; Preview of existing signature: This shows how your current signature will appear whenever you sign with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; on a wiki page.
; New signature: Text that defines your signature, when you enter &lt;nowiki&gt;~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;~ or &lt;nowiki&gt;~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;~~.
: If the following checkbox is not checked, then the content of the box is applied as a label for a link to your user page, so your signature will be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;User:''username''|''nickname'']] (talk). If you leave text field empty, your username will be used instead.
; Treat signature as wikitext (without an automatic link): This option tells the wiki to interpret your signature as wiki-code, instead of just a nickname. See the information below.

If &quot;Treat signature as wikitext&quot; is checked, then:
*Nothing is added to the text that you specify.  What you specify is what is used before the automatic time stamp. 
*Wiki markup and [[HTML|HTML markup]] (as far as allowed in general in wikitext) can be used: the wiki-code is processed, and the HTML is passed on, allowing the browser to interpret it. However, [[Help:Templates|templates]] are not expanded, and images are not allowed. The maximum length is 255 characters.

You may find the following message displayed in your user preferences:
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:larger;&quot;&gt;Invalid raw signature; check HTML tags.&lt;/span&gt;
This means you are using invalid HTML markup on your signature. Some possible causes with their corresponding solutions:

; Unclosed tags: If you are opening a tag without the corresponding closing tag (for instance: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;Example]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), you should close the tag (for instance: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). It's also a good idea to put the tags outside the link if possible (for instance: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;[[User:Example|Example]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
; Mismatched or incorrectly nested tags :If the tags are mismatched (for instance: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;s&gt;&lt;u&gt;hi&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), fix them (for instance: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;u&gt;hi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
; Unquoted attributes: It's also recommended to use quotes on all attributes (for instance, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=white&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
; Unclosed entities: If you have a [[w:HTML entity|HTML entity]] which is lacking the final &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;, you need to add it; if you have a bare &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, it must be replaced by &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; (a bare &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is always a mistake in either HTML or wikicode).
; Unescaped special characters: If you are using one of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and want it shown as text, it must be escaped as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.

====E-mail options====
Wikimedia wikis provide e-mail functionality, whereby forgotten passwords can be returned, and users can contact other users by e-mail without anyone having to reveal their address. Entering your e-mail address is entirely optional.

; E-mail: Your e-mail address. This is completely optional. Whenever you enter a new address, you will be required to confirm the change by responding to a message that is sent to that e-mail address.
; E-mail confirmation: The status of your e-mail address: not specified, need to confirm (in which case you need the click the link in the confirmation e-mail message you were sent), or authenticated.
; Enable e-mail from other users: This allows other registered users to send you an e-mail using &quot;E-mail this user&quot; link on the sidebar of your [[Wikibooks:User pages|user page]]. Emails are sent using a web interface, and your e-mail address is not revealed to a sender (that is, unless you decide to reply by email).
; Send me copies of emails I send to other users: This option is helpful for keeping track of messages you have sent using &quot;E-mail this user&quot;.
; E-mail me when a page on my [[WB:WATCHLIST|watchlist]] is changed: This is disabled on Wikibooks for performance reasons.
; E-mail me when my user talk page is changed: Send an email when someone edits your [[Special:MyTalk|user talk]] page, but only for edits not marked as [[WB:MINOR|minor]].
; E-mail me also for minor edits of pages: Notify you via email for every edit to your user talk page, whether marked as minor or not.
; Reveal my e-mail address in notification e-mails

=== Appearance ===
==== Skin ====
A '''skin''' is a style of page display.  The default is the Vector skin.

; Chick: This lacks a sidebar and instead places navigation links below the page's main content.
; Classic: Has a sidebar that contains actions for a page and has those actions above the page content as well.
; Cologne Blue: Cologne Blue has a fixed font size unless one specifies in the browser &quot;ignore font sizes specified in the webpage&quot;; even then the line height is fixed; therefore this skin is not suitable for a large font.
; Modern: A blue-oriented theme with a sidebar.  Has a fancier appearance than Monobook below.
; Monobook: The &quot;classic&quot; look that was seen on most wikis from 2005 to 2010. The width of the panel on the left is dependent on the font size. Therefore, with a large font or a small screen size, the width of the main part of the page is smaller than with other skins.
; MySkin: Not normally useful on Wikimedia wikis.  Has no formatting applied other than what you specify as part of your [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|custom CSS]].  See [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for information on this advanced subject.
; Nostalgia: Reminiscent of the skin used in the early days of Wikipedia.
; Simple: A &quot;lite&quot; version of Monobook for slower connections.
; Vector: A new skin, based on Monobook, that has been rolled out to Wikimedia wikis. As well as a new look, it adds a few new features to the wiki interface, particularly in the editing process.

Links at the edges of the page are in different positions. Some links are not present in every skin. In Nostalgia some links are in a drop-down menu instead of directly visible.

Use the &quot;Preview&quot; links to try out the skin.

==== Files ====
; Image size limit: One can specify a limit on the size of images on [[Help:Files#File pages|image description]] pages. With a slow connection it is not practical to have to load a large image just to read image info. Also, it may be practical if a large image at first is made to fit on the screen. The large limit, 10000x10000, means that one gets the full image.
; Thumbnail size: The width of thumbnails shown in pages on the wiki. This will be used unless a specific image provides its own thumbnail size.

====Math====
Wikimedia wikis provide the functionality to include mathematical ([[Help:Formulas|TeX]]) formulas in wiki pages. These options let you control how those formulas are displayed.

; Always render PNG: Always display formulas as an image.
; HTML if very simple or else PNG: If the formula is very simple, like &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;, display it as normal text ([[w:HTML|HTML]]). For more complex code, display the formula as an image.
; HTML if possible or else PNG: This option tries really hard to use normal webpage text ([[w:HTML|HTML]]), but if it's too complicated, then an image is displayed.
; Leave it as TeX: Don't convert the formula, just show the mathematical TeX code. This is primarily for text-based browsers like [[w:Lynx web browser|Lynx]].
; Recommended for modern browsers: If you use a web browser that was released recently, use this option.
; MathML if possible (experimental): This option attempts to use MathML code, which offers a good-looking display of mathematical data. But only some browsers can display it.

==== Advanced options ====
; [[WB:LINK|Link]] underlining: Here, you can choose whether links will be underlined. the &quot;Browser default&quot; option means the site will honor your browser's setting.
: Having underlining on means you can differentiate between two links side-by-side, like [[p]] [[q]] and [[p q]]. However, underlining means underscores (_) may get lost in the underline.
; Threshold for stub link formatting (bytes): A wikilink to an existing page will be formatted differently if the page is in the main [[WB:NS|namespace]], it is not a [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]], '''''and''''' the number of [[w:byte|bytes]] of the wikitext is less than the &quot;threshold for stub display&quot; set here.
; Format links to non-existent pages [[The weather in Londinium, 50 AD|like this]] (alternative like this[[Main Page|?]]): A link to a page that doesn't exist will normally be colored red. You can turn this option off to have the link displayed as a question mark after the linked text. Note that with the trailing question mark link, one cannot distinguish between a single word being linked, or a phrase of more than one word.
; Show [[WB:TOC|table of contents]] (for pages with more than 3 headings): You can switch off the table of contents on all pages that you visit.
; Disable page caching: This turns off page caching. Use this option only if you know what you are doing - it puts unnecessary strain on the Wikimedia servers.
; Show hidden [[Help:Categories|categories]]: Shows categories which are normally hidden at the bottom of the page.

[[File:Enable &quot;jump-to&quot; links pref demo.gif|200px|thumb|&quot;Jump to&quot; links comparison.]]

; Enable &quot;jump to&quot; accessibility links: Provides two links &quot;Jump to: navigation, search&quot; at the top of each page. These links are normally hidden, except under the Myskin, Chick, or Classic [[#Skin|skins]]; they are displayed in browsers lacking [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] support (or with CSS disabled), or read out by screen readers for low vision users. The navigation panel, at the left of the page in the Vector and Monobook skins, is at the bottom of the page in these &quot;flat-format&quot; browsers. 
; Justify paragraphs: If set, article paragraphs will be formatted to avoid jagged line endings. If unset, the paragraphs will be formatted as-is.
; Auto-number headings: This adds hierarchical outline-style numbering to headers in pages.
; Enable collapsing of items in the navigation menu in Vector skin: This option allows you to shrink or expand sections of the navigational links in the sidebar under the Vector skin, such as the toolbox and community links.

===Date and time===
On this tab, you can control the appearance of some dates and times, and you can select your time zone.

; Date format: This setting affects the appearance of timestamps on all special pages, including page histories (as listed below). They appear just like shown here, except in [[WB:RC|Recent Changes]] and your [[WB:WATCH|watchlist]], where date and time are shown in different places. Note that the last option, although rather arcane, provides the only way to see seconds.
; Time offset: &quot;Offset&quot; is the number of hours to be added or subtracted from [[w:UTC|UTC]] to find your [[w:time zone|time zone]]. It may become temporarily incorrect from time to time if you observe [[w:daylight saving time|Daylight Saving Time]]—don't forget to update it to match ''your'' local time, because the wiki doesn't know where you are or precisely when you observe DST. Try [http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/ this link] if you are not sure what your time zone is.

These two options are used to display your local date and time on all special pages, i.e. the pages that are generated automatically and cannot be directly edited:
*[[WB:RC|Recent Changes]], [[Help:Tracking changes#Related changes|Related Changes]], [[WB:WATCH|Watchlist]]
*[[Special:Log]], [[Special:NewPages]], [[Special:ListFiles]]
*[[WB:PH|Page history]], image history, [[WB:DIFF|Diff]], [[WB:CONTRIBS|User contributions]]
*&quot;This page was last modified&quot; at the bottom of pages

On the other hand, UTC is always shown in the timestamps on all [[WB:TALK|talk pages]] (and also used in referring to non-localized events, including things that happen on the wiki). Keep this in mind when copying an excerpt from any special page to a talk page. Convert manually to UTC or temporarily set the preferences to a zero offset before producing the revision history, etc. to be copied. Many experienced users prefer to keep offset as 0 all the time.

===Editing===
The options on the '''Editing''' tab can fine-tune the process of editing.

; Size of editing window: Here you can set up your preferred dimensions for the textbox used for editing page text. &quot;Rows&quot; refers to lines of text (height), and &quot;Columns&quot; means the number of characters that will fit across the box (width). The exact size will vary depending on your browser's font size, screen resolution, and other factors. The default is 80 cols x 25 rows.
: Note that, by default, the &quot;columns&quot; setting is ignored, and the edit box will scale to fill the whole available width. This behavior can be disabled by turning off the &quot; Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen&quot; check box lower down on the page.

==== Advanced options ====
; Edit area font style: You can change the font family of text in the edit area. The browser will determine exactly which font to use, depending on which fonts are available on your computer. &quot;Browser default&quot; will normally provide a &lt;code&gt;monospaced&lt;/code&gt; font.
; Show preview before edit box: If you select this option, the [[WB:PREVIEW|edit preview]] will be displayed above the edit box when you click the &quot;Show preview&quot; button while editing a page.
; Show preview on first edit: When pressing the edit button or otherwise following a link to an edit page, a preview will appear, just like after pressing &quot;Show preview&quot;. 
; Enable [[WB:SECTION|section editing]] via [&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;] links: An edit link will appear beside each sub-heading on a page to allow editing of that subsection only.
; Enable section editing by right-clicking on section titles (requires [[JavaScript]]): In compatible browsers, if this option is checked, a right-click on the section title will bring up the edit box for that section only, just as if you had clicked the small [&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;] link beside the heading.
; Edit pages on double click (requires JavaScript): In compatible browsers, if this option is checked, a double click anywhere on the page will bring up the edit box for the entire contents of the page, just like what happens when you click on the &quot;edit&quot; tab at the top of the page.
; Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen: See [[#Editing|Size of editing window]] above.
; Show [[Help:Editing#Edit_toolbar|edit toolbar]]: In compatible browsers, a toolbar with editing buttons can be displayed. The exact contents of this toolbar will vary, depending on the wiki.
; Mark all edits [[WB:MINOR|minor]] by default: This option automatically selects the &quot;This is a minor edit&quot; checkbox when you edit pages.
; Use external editor by default: This feature allows you to edit pages in an external program, rather than using the wiki editing form in your web browser. It requires a special set-up on your computer. See [[mw:Manual:External editors]] on the MediaWiki web site for information and setup instructions.
; Use external diff by default: This is an advanced feature that requires a special set-up on your computer. See [[mw:Manual:External editors]] for information and instructions.
; Prompt me when entering a blank [[WB:ES|edit summary]]: If selected, the editor will display a warning message when no edit summary is provided. This can help you remember to provide edit summaries, as they help other editors greatly.
; Use live preview (requires JavaScript): This is an experimental feature that speeds up the retrieval of edit previews. When you click the &quot;Show preview&quot; button, the browser will retrieve a preview from the wiki server and display it above the edit box, without needing to reload the page. This is only an experimental feature for the time being.
; Show the pending changes diff when editing pages: If there are edits that have not been [[WB:REVIEW|reviewed]] to a page you are editing, a [[WB:DIFF|diff]] showing the pending changes that have been made will be shown.  This is only useful for [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]].
; Warn me when I leave an edit page with unsaved changes (Vector skin only): If you use the Vector skin, this option will give you the chance to go back and save your work if you accidentally close or leave an editing page.

====Beta features====
; Enable enhanced editing toolbar: On the Vector skin, allows the use of the improved toolbar over the Monobook skin.  This is enabled by default and you can its appearance at [[Help:Editing]].
; Enable dialogs for inserting [[WB:LINK|links]], [[Help:Tables|tables]], and more: On the Vector skin, allows pop-up dialog boxes to appear for adding more complex elements to a page when editing.

====Labs features====
The [[usability:Wikipedia_Usability_Initiative|Usability Initiative]] is currently testing some new features that are primarily designed for the new Vector skin and its refreshed user interface. These options are not documented here, as they may change from time to time.

===Recent changes===
On the '''Recent changes''' tab, you can choose what appears on your [[WB:RC|Recent Changes]] page (linked in the sidebar, and available at [[Special:RecentChanges]]). Some of these options also affect [[Help:Tracking changes#Related changes|Related Changes]], at [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]].

==== Display options ====
; Days to show in recent changes: The number of days' worth of changes to show in the Recent Changes list. The default is 5 days; the maximum is 7 days.
; Number of edits to show by default: You may select the number of changes which will be shown by default on the Recent Changes page, all page &quot;[[WB:PH|history]]&quot; tabs, and on some log pages at [[Special:Log]]. Links are provided for other options on those pages.

====Advanced options====
; Use [[Help:Tracking changes#Enhanced Recent Changes|enhanced recent changes]] (requires JavaScript): Group recent changes per day by page, display the titles of the changed pages in order from new to old latest change, or in the case of hiding minor edits, latest major change. This feature applies also to Related Changes, and, in the case that &quot;Expand [[WB:WATCH|watchlist]] to show all applicable changes&quot; has been selected, to the watchlist. It requires a browser with JavaScript enabled.
;Hide [[WB:MINOR|minor edits]] in recent changes
;Hide [[WB:REVIEW|reviewed edits]] in recent changes: Use these options to filter out unwanted changes from the recent changes and related changes pages.
;Hide reviewed pages from new page list: This option affects [[Special:NewPages]]. When it is set, all reviewed pages are hidden by default. You can easily show or hide reviewed pages (highlighted in yellow) from the New Pages page.

=== Watchlist ===
The options on the '''Watchlist''' tab control what appears on your [[WB:WATCH|watchlist]] (accessible by visiting the page [[Special:Watchlist]], or clicking &quot;my watchlist&quot; in the top-right of the page).

==== Display options ====
; Days to show in watchlist: The number of days' worth of changes to show in your watchlist. Maximum 7 days.
; Maximum number of changes to show in expanded watchlist: This controls how many recent changes to show for each watched article when &quot;Expand watchlist&quot; is switched on under &quot;Advanced options&quot;. Maximum 1000 changes.

==== Advanced options ====
; Expand watchlist to show all changes, not just the most recent: This option will expand the watchlist to include all changes made to a page within the time-frame of your watchlist, up to a maximum number (as set in &quot;Display options&quot;). Normally, only the most recent modification is shown.
; Hide [[WB:MINOR|minor edits]] from the watchlist
; Hide [[Wikibooks:Bots|bot]] edits from the watchlist
; Hide my edits from the watchlist
; Hide edits by [[Wikibooks:Anonymous users|anonymous users]] from the watchlist
; Hide edits by [[Wikibooks:Registered users|logged in users]] from the watchlist
; Hide [[WB:REVIEW|reviewed]] edits from the watchlist: Use these options to filter out unwanted revisions from the watchlist.
; Watchlist token: If you want an [[w:RSS feed|RSS feed]] to be generated from your watchlist, you can input a secret token here. Anyone who knows this token can use it to access your watchlist. You don't actually need to store this value; when you subscribe to the RSS feed, the browser will store it for you. A randomly-generated token is provided under the field if you need inspiration.
; Hide [[WB:REVIEW|reviewed]] edits from the watchlist: Use this option to filter out reviewed edits (edits made by [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]]). This is particularly useful when monitoring vandalism, as reviewed edits can only be made by trusted users.
; Add pages I edit to my watchlist
; Add pages I move to my watchlist
; Add pages I delete to my watchlist
; Add pages I create to my watchlist
; Add pages I review to my watchlist: Automatically select the [[w:check box|check box]] to &quot;Watch this page&quot; when performing any of these actions. You can de-select the check box on a page if you do not wish to watch that particular page. The option for deleting is only available to administrators.  The final option is only available to users that have the ability to review pages, such as administrators and reviewers.

=== Search options ===
The options on the '''Search options''' tab let you control how searches are conducted, and how search results appear. The default values of these options may differ on some wikis.

====Display options====
; Hits per page: You may choose the number of results returned on each page of [[WB:SEARCH|search]] results. The default is 20.
; Lines per hit: This is how many lines of text you will see in the &quot;preview&quot; area underneath a search result. The default is 5.
; Context per line: the number of characters of context per occurrence; however, the context is anyway restricted to the paragraph it occurs in. To get the whole line, put a large number like 5000. The default is 50.
; Disable AJAX suggestions: The small search box in the top-right of the page or in the left sidebar, will provide a pop-up menu of search suggestions whenever something is entered into the box. The process of retrieving these suggestions can slow down the system on older machines, and it may waste Internet bandwidth. If you don't need this service, you can turn it off.
; Enable enhanced search suggestions (Vector skin only): If this option is turned off, the Search box reverts to its traditional look, with separate &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Search&quot; buttons, and search suggestions are not presented.

==== Advanced options ====
; Search in all [[WB:NS|namespaces]]
; Otherwise search in these namespaces: Shows a list of all namespaces, allowing you to select which ones are searched by default if you choose not to search in all namespaces with the above option.

=== Misc ===
This tab contains other options that don't belong anywhere else.

==== Diffs ====
; Do not show page content below [[WB:DIFF|diffs]]: Normally, when viewing a diff, the page content as of the second revision is presented. You can turn off this display using this option, to allow for faster loading of diff pages.
; Omit diff after performing a [[WB:ROLL|rollback]]: When rolling back edits (available to [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]]), a diff will be shown. This option will prevent the display of that diff page.

=== Edit review ===
This tab covers the interface for and behavior of the [[WB:REVIEW|page review]] system, alternately called ''pending changes'' or ''flagged revisions''.

; Use detailed boxes to show review status of pages: Shows a bar across the window underneath the page title that details whether a page is unreviewed, reviewed, or has pending changes awaiting review.
[[File:Unreviewed version detailed.png|center|frame|Viewing page with no reviewed edits, using the detailed edit review interface.]]
; Use small icons and minimal text to show review status of pages: Indicates the review status of a page with a brief description and icon in the upper-right of the page.
[[File:Unreviewed version minimal.png|center|frame|Viewing page with no reviewed edits, using the minimal edit review interface.]]
; Always show the latest reviewed revision (if there is one) of a page by default: This allows users who want to only view vandalism-free versions of pages to give priority to reviewed versions and see them when browsing.  This won't apply if there are no reviewed versions.
[[File:Reviewed version with pending detailed.png|center|frame|Showing the latest reviewed version of a page rather than the latest pending revision (accessible via the &quot;latest draft&quot; tab).]]
; Show the pending changes diff when viewing the latest pending revision: This shows a diff that can be collapsed and expanded above a page's content if the version of the page you are looking at differs from the latest reviewed revision, showing you what has changed.  This is useful for [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]].

==Changing username==
{{shortcut|WB:CHU}}

Registered users at Wikibooks are able to seek '''username changes'''. Renames are carried out by [[Wikibooks:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. Requests for usernames which are offensive, promotional, disruptive, misleading, or confusing are not accepted.

* A rename moves your contributions and userspace pages to a new name, while preserving your account preferences.
* If you have many thousands of edits or the site is very busy, it might be upwards of several weeks before the software reattributes all your contributions. 

'''Please be aware of the following renaming limitations and restrictions:'''
* Accounts cannot be merged or deleted. They can only be renamed. 
* Consequently, it is not possible to re-assign edits made through an [[w:IP address|IP address]].
* Our bureaucrats are able to perform renames only on the English Wikibooks. [[:m:Index of pages where renaming can be requested|Renames on other projects]] are done locally, or (if  no local bureaucrats exist) through a request on [[m:Steward requests/Username changes|Meta-wiki]]. 
* Your username cannot contain underscores and cannot start with a lowercase letter. 
* Existing signatures are not affected by a rename, and must be edited manually if desired.
* Renames appear in the [[Special:Log/renameuser|user rename log]] and requests are moved to the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Wikibooks:Requests_for_renaming/|archives]]. This is done in the interest of transparency, and there are no exceptions.

'''There are several alternatives to a rename. Please consider them.'''
* Your username cannot begin with a lowercase letter. Try placing {{tl|lowercase title}} on your userpage.
* You can change your signature. This will change your &quot;public appearance&quot; on talk pages and elsewhere.
* If you want to retire from Wikibooks, place {{tl|retired}} or a similar declaration on your userpage. A request for a rename to something like ''RetiredUser123'' will be declined. Respected users wishing to vanish completely, perhaps by way of a rename to a random character string, are an exception to this rule.
* Users who have made very few edits are encouraged to register a new account and discard the old one.

'''Other things to consider:'''
* Using your real name as a username may put you at risk of harassment.
* Once you have been renamed, your old account will no longer exist and could be recreated by a third party. To guard against impersonation, you may wish to recreate the old account yourself and make redirects.

'''It's important to choose the right venue for your request. Otherwise, it may be delayed or declined.'''

Once you are sure, proceed to [[Wikibooks:Requests for renaming]] and click the &quot;request a rename&quot; link.  Follow the instructions to complete your request.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ROOT/Template Documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;This is a template designed for the book [[ROOT]]. It should be used to create new templates that can be used to format ROOT input / output during an ''interactive'' session. The text given as argument is displayed in a light gray box in a typewriter font.

Please do ''not'' use this template to format interactive ROOT in-/output directly. Use the appropriate of the following derived templates instead:
* [[Template:ROOT/RootInputLine]]
* [[Template:ROOT/RootInputLineStalled]]
* [[Template:ROOT/RootOutput]]

== Usage ==
=== Syntax ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/RootIO|content}}&lt;/source&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Parameter || Default Value || Mandatory || Description
|-
| content || &amp;nbsp; || no || Text to be displayed inside the box.
|}

== Example ==
In this example, we display the text &quot;I didn't know ''that''!&quot; in a RootIO box.

=== Code ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/RootIO|content = I didn't know ''that''!}}&lt;/source&gt;

=== Result ===
{{ROOT/RootIO|content = I didn't know ''that''!}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ROOT/Template Documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;This is a template designed for the book [[ROOT]]. It should be used to format '''input''' during an ''interactive'' ROOT session.

== Usage ==
=== Syntax ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/RootInputLine|#1|#2}}&lt;/source&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Parameter || Default Value || Mandatory || Description
|-
| #1        || 0             || no        || Line number.
|-
| #2        || &amp;nbsp;        || no        || Input line to be displayed.
|}

=== Comments ===
* Do not add a blank line before this template or you'll get ugly space.
* To format multiple lines of code, use a new template for each line.
* Well, this is annoying: You can't use the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; sign, curly braces or a pipe inside the parameter. Encode them as HTML, eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#61;&lt;/code&gt; for the equality sign. Please see [http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm] for a list of HTML replacements.

==== Convention on Line Numbers ====
Always start with line number 0. When using this template multiple times on a page, use continuous line numbers except there is a good reason to do different. (E.g. to emphasize a restart of ROOT.)

== Examples ==
=== Example 1 ===
In this example, we display a blank input line that gets the default line number 0.

==== Code ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/RootInputLine}}&lt;/source&gt;

==== Result ====
{{ROOT/RootInputLine}}

=== Example 2 ===
In this example, we display an input line that acts as a &quot;hello world&quot; program.

==== Code ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}}&lt;/source&gt;

==== Result ====
{{ROOT/RootInputLine|0|cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}}

      <comment>/* More bound clitics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Morphological Typology ===
toki pona is an isolation language. The morphological processes are limited to possible clitics. No content words inflect. 

&quot;A bound morpheme is a morpheme that must be attached to some other morpheme to be integrated naturally into a discourse.&quot; 1997 Payne

==== Bound Morphemes ====
The following words cannot stand alone.
pi - a variety of meanings, including &quot;of&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, or a logical grouping operator.
e - accusative clitic
li - verb phrase marker
lon, sama, kepeken, tan, tawa, poka -- These are the prepositions. 

&quot;A clitic is bound morpheme that functions at a phrasal or clausal level, but which binds phonologically to some other word, known as the host.&quot; 1997 Payne

==== More bound clitics ====
The particles '''pi''', '''e''' and the prepositions are clitics that consistently have the same host. The pi always precedes a noun and no other word can go between the pi and the noun without changing the sense of the phrase.  This is also true for prepositions.  The pi and propositions apply to the entire following phrase.

How bound is pi? One test is to examine how pi reacts to conjunctions.  

 mi lukin e soweli pi ma Sonka
I saw the Chinese animals.

? mi lukin e soweli pi telo en ma.
? mi lukin e soweli pi ma en telo.
I saw the animal of the land and sea.

The specs to date do not make it clear if conjuncted modifiers or pi-complements are legal.

How bound is '''e'''? en doesn't move e from it's head noun, but anu does.
mi lukin e soweli anu waso.
mi lukin e waso anu soweli.

==== Less bound clitics- Grammatical Particles ====
Auxiliary or serial verbs may go between '''li''' and the head verb.  '''li''' marks the beginning of a verb phrases that continues until the '''e''' or first preposition.

Depending on how you parse the phrases with compound prepositions (lon + geographic word), lon can be split from it's head noun.

soweli li lape anpa supa.
The dog sleeps under the bed.

==== Periphrasal Patterns ====
Because toki pona is strongly isolating, the equivalent of derivational operations do not involve binding morphemes. This doesn't mean that these processes don't exist, but instead they are clausal or discourse level operations.

There isn't any bound infixation, but at the phrasal level, plural markers can be inserted in the middle of the phrase.

tomo pi telo nasa
tomo mute pi telo nasa
bar/bars

jan pona
jan pona mute
? jan mute pona
friend/friends

Stems or base words are never modified. Reduplication has no special meaning. 

=== Head/Dependent Marking ===
It isn't clear if the head or the dependents are being marked.

lipu jan
The man's book.

lipu mute jan
The man's book.

lipu mute pi jan mute
The people's book.

:I intentionally left out the Second World War because it is left out of most specifications, or is one of the optional Depth Studies (none of which are in the book at the moment), because it is such a large topic on its own. If you want to add it, feel free, but I won't be contributing to it since it isn't in my specification and I don't have much information about it (well, there's plenty of information on the Internet and in books, of course, but I wouldn't know which parts are relevant to GCSE). - [[w:User:EdoDodo|&lt;font color=&quot;#21421E&quot; face=&quot;Harrington&quot;&gt;EdoDodo&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[w:User talk:EdoDodo|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#33dd44&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:09, 14 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>added what we mean when we say &quot;practical&quot; to the first paragraph</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is aimed at teaching practical programming skills using ATS: we concentrate on actually writing programs, all other aspects of programming, such as formulating problem descriptions, thinking about them, and using various problem solving techniques are not covered in this book. ATS shares some aspects with other programming languages, namely Standard ML and OCaml, but is unusual in the way it uses its type system to support safe (in terms of type safety) and efficient (in terms of execution time and memory footprint) programming in a variety of paradigms.

ATS supports imperative, functional and concurrent programming paradigms. Imperative programming is what most programmers are familiar with. Functional programming can be contrasted with imperative programming as it enables programmers to concentrate on the problem at hand without worrying too much about (uninteresting) implementation details of some kind, such as explicit memory management. Some functional programs can be seen as executable specifications, which makes them suitable for teaching and reasoning about.

It is widely known that programming is prone to errors (by &quot;error&quot; we mean &quot;unwanted program behavior&quot;). One way to mitigate the problem is extensive testing, but sometimes, you'll want to use other methods, such as stating pre-, post-conditions and other invariants formally, with help of a type system.

Type systems have arisen as a tool to eliminate certain classes of program errors (for example, making sure that memory for an object is allocated and initialized correctly).

Typical type-safe programming languages (such as Pascal and Java) will not try to treat a variable of type integer as if it was a variable of type bool; errors like this are ruled out at compile-time (early, before testing). Other errors, such as out-of-bounds array access, cannot be checked at compile-time, hence such checks are moved on to the next phase, of executing the program. The program remains safe (in a sense), because even if it goes wrong, it will not continue to do so.

Also, it's usually the case that public APIs place certain restrictions on their use for proper functioning. For example, what would [printf] do if the NULL was passed for the format string? In a typical statically typed programming language it is not possible to enforce a compile-time constraint on [printf]: it accepts only non-NULL format strings. In addition, there are rules that must be followed in constructing format strings.

This is where ATS fits in: it allows you, the programmer, to formally specify constraints using its type system. Such constraints are then checked by the compiler without human intervention. For example, in ATS you have an option (a trade-off) to prove that your program will never access an array out of its bounds making run-time bounds-checking redundant and increasing our confidence. In this particular case, you won't need to address this issue with tests.

We heartily recommend our readers to not take into account their experience with common statically typed programming languages (especially C/C++) because this experience, for the most part, is not applicable to programming with ATS (as you don't use types in these languages to express constraints); and to keep their mind open for new ideas and concepts, which might seem confusing at first, but we hope will make sense after some practice.

Chapter one contains an introduction to a purely functional subset of ATS, starting from elementary arithmetic, continuing to functions and data structures. In this chapter, readers will acquaint themselves with programming without assignment and loops. Chapter two covers basic imperative programming (mutable variables and data structures, explicit control flow operators) and relates it to the language introduced in chapter one. Chapter three goes to a detour about types, and then introduces some advanced types, such as singleton types, dependent and linear types. Chapter four introduces users to program verification with types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bertolt Brecht was a fully committed Marxist who believed that everyone should be equal and that “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” This belief was put into practice by the start of epic theatre, a theatre which had a moral for the audience and this was portrayed by all the emotions and suchlike being removed to show the very basics of the play. Brecht also portrayed his beliefs and tried to show us which belief we should lean towards through the play “The Good Person Of Szechwan” as he portrays Shen Teh as the Marxist side by giving rice to the hungry and giving shelter to the homeless, and he portrays the communist side through Shui Ta with the way that he is giving less than he should, yet both of these characters are essentially the same person this shows that there are two sides to every person.
Brecht was also severely influenced by the war that was going on at the time. Due to his fear of persecution, Brecht fled from Germany and went to Denmark and then a few years later he moved to Sweden. During the war, Brecht became a main writer for the Exilliteratur, in which he expressed his opposition the National Socialist and Fascist movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
Born on the 4th September 1896, under the Christian name of Antoine Marie Joseph Artaud, he became known for his contribution the art of surrealism. He suffered from meningitis at a young age, and later on he suffered from neuralgia, and severe depression, he was sent for prolonged periods of time to the sanatorium. He was conscripted to the French army, but was allegedly discharged due to his habit of sleepwalking
==What he believed in and what techniques he used==
Artaud believed that the audience should be involved in the story and believed that the audience should feel heightened emotions; this became known as the theatre of cruelty. The theatrical techniques used in the theatre of cruelty are mainly used to attract the audience’s attention and to express the characters themselves in such a way that the audience cannot fathom out what the play is actually about. The plays themselves usually have no storyline, but instead have many different themes going on at the same time; this causes confusion and discomfort for the audience.

== Documentation ==
A [[:Category:PrettyTextBox_Templates|PrettyTextBox]] that can be shown or hidden, designed to act as a &quot;box&quot; in the style of separate information boxes as seen in textbooks (often labelled Box 1.1, etc.). This requires a title, which can be seen even when the contents of the box are hidden. Much of this functionality is copied from [[Template:Hidden]]. By default, the box is shown, unless the &quot;hidden&quot; parameter is set.

For extensive box contents which are relatively independent of the main text, consider using [[Template:TranscludeBox]], which allows you to place the contents in a subpage of your book, and [[:Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Advanced_Techniques#Templates|transclude]] it into the main page.

=== Parameters ===
This template displays the first parameter (the heading) with a [Show] link on the right.  If the heading box or [Show] link is clicked by the user, the second parameter (the content) is also displayed.  The following parameters are also available:

;header
: The heading for the box (e.g. Box 1.1). This can also be taken from the 1st unnamed parameter.
;content
: The content of the box. This can also be taken from the 2nd unnamed parameter.

==== Conventional css parameters ====
;fw1
:the font-weight for the heading
;fw2
:the font-weight for the body
;bg
:the background-color for the enclosing box
;bg1
:the background-color for the heading 
;bg2
:the background-color for the body
;ta1
:the text-align for the heading
;ta2
:the text-align for the body
;float
:should the box be floated? (left, right, or none)
;width
: the width of the box, e.g. 33%
;style
: HTML/CSS affectionados only: any other css style arguments for the whole box

==== Special parameters ====
;hidden
: set this to any string (e.g. hidden=true) to have the box hidden by default
;headType
: allows you to set the box header to (say) &quot;h4&quot;, which means it will be included in the table of contents. This is provided as an explicit parameter because if you just surround the title with header tags, e.g.
: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Box 1.1&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
: Then the title will be displaced downwards by the show/hide button. See examples below.
;preHead
: allows you to specify stuff to place ''before'' the header. This is used, e.g. in [[Template:TranscludeBox]].
;dropClass
:(default = collapsible) The class of the dropbox which determines the drop-down behaviour. Setting this to something other than collapsible will remove the drop-down behaviour of the box.
;boxClass
:(default = PrettyTextBox) The class of the dropbox which determines the style.

=== Examples ===
The simplest example&lt;pre&gt;{{DropBox|Box 1.1|{{Lorem}}}}&lt;/pre&gt; renders as:
{{DropBox|Box 1.1|{{Lorem}}}}

To hide by default, specify a value for &quot;hidden&quot;&lt;pre&gt;{{DropBox|Box 1.2|{{Lorem}}|hidden=hidden}}&lt;/pre&gt; renders as:
{{DropBox|Box 1.2|{{Lorem}}|hidden=hidden}}

{{DropBox|Box 1.3|{{Lorem}}|
headType=h4|
float=left|
bg=#999999|
width=33%}}
A more realistic example, setting the title to h4 which will place it in the TOC. This is produced by
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;DropBox{{!}}Box 1.3{{!}}&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Lorem&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{!}}
 headType{{=}}h4{{!}}
 float{{=}}left{{!}}
 bg{{=}}#999999{{!}}
 width{{=}}33%&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
renders as seen on the left

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

{{DropBox|Box 1.4|{{Lorem}}|
headType=h4|
float=right|
width=33%|
ta1=right|
bg=#BBBBFF|
bg1=#BBBBFF|
bg2=white|
hidden=hidden}}
Another similar layout, styled differently, and hidden by default. This is produced by
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;DropBox{{!}}Box 1.4{{!}}&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Lorem&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{!}}
 headType{{=}}h4{{!}}
 float{{=}}right{{!}}
 ta1{{=}}right{{!}}
 bg{{=}}#BBBBFF{{!}}
 bg1{{=}}#BBBBFF{{!}}
 bg2{{=}}white{{!}}
 hidden{{=}}hidden&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
renders as seen on the right

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Business Size ==
There are a number of indicators used to determine whether a business is large or small. Some of these are:
* '''Number of employees:''' How many people are employed by the business?
* '''Turnover:''' What is the sales revenue of the business?
* '''Value of its assets:''' How much are all the possessions of the company worth?
* '''Physical size of the business:''' How many shops or warehouses does it own? How much land does it occupy?

== Economies of Scale ==
Large businesses have some advantages over smaller businesses. These are known as economies of scale, and can be divided into two categories:
* '''Internal economies of scale:''' Are related only to the business itself.
* '''External economies of scale:''' Benefit the whole industry or community.
=== Internal Economies ===
==== Production and Technical Economies ====
These economies relate to the firm's production process. Some examples of these are:
* Mass production means lower unit costs.
* Able to transport materials in bulk, saving on transport costs.
* Can use computers and technology that may be too expensive for a small firm.
==== Purchasing and Marketing Economies ====
These economies relate to the firm's purchasing and marketing. Some examples of these are:
* Bulk buying means raw materials are cheaper.
* Advertising costs can be spread.
==== Financial Economies ====
These economies relate to the firm's finance. Some examples of these are:
* Easier to raise capital - better lending terms and lower interest rates.
* Risk is spread over multiple products.
=== External Economies ===
External economies are those that benefit the whole industry or community. Some of these are:
* Better road and rail networks improve the area the business is in.
* Skilled labour in the area increases.
* Other businesses, such as suppliers, are attracted to the area.
* This provides a mutual advantages to businesses in the area.

      <comment>/* Why was appeasement a failure? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout the 1930s, Britain and France let Hitler do what he wanted, hoping that he would stop making demands and war would not happen. This policy was known as '''appeasement'''.

== Why did Britain and France follow a policy of appeasement? ==
{{rquote|right|
I am completely convinced that the course I am taking is right and therefore cannot be influenced by the attacks of my critics.|
[[w:Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] in a letter to his sister (1938)}}
Britain and France has a number of reasons for following this policy, some of them were:
* The Depression was happening, so their economic problems had a higher priority.
* They were glad that Hitler was standing up to Communism.
* They did not want to repeat the horrors of the First World War.
* Britain believed that the British Empire would not support them in a war. The USA would also not have supported them in a war.
* They were not ready for war, and hoped to buy time to develop their armies.
* At this point, many people saw that the Treaty of Versailles had been too harsh on Germany, and were sympathetic to them.

== Why was appeasement a failure? ==
With hindsight, we can see that appeasement was bad for a number of reasons:
* It encouraged Hitler to be more aggressive and take bigger gambles - e.g. Poland.
* It allowed Germany to grow too strong.
* It put too much trust in Hitler's promises.
* It scared the USSR who then signed the Nazi-Soviet pact because of it.

==Usage, Limitations, and Options==

===Usage===
Template name: '''DROPIMAGE'''.   Place text for a heading in parameter one position.  Place definitions for images, galleries, text, or an '''HTML''' table in parameter two position.   The content hides initially in the collapsed state, and drops when the link button is clicked.   The link toggles to collapse and expand the drop control.

The ''initial'' width of the control is not necessarily the ''dropped'' width, since the control expands to display the contents.   The '''width''' option sets the '''initial width'''.   the drop contents can contain links.   The template can be nested.

Three simple examples of its use, with results, are shown:

'''Image example code:'''
&lt;pre&gt;{{dropimage|width=200px|align=left|Image|[[image:Primula_aka.jpg|thumb|300px|center]]'''Primula'''   :
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primula ''Main article.'']}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{dropimage|width=200px|align=left|Image|[[image:Primula_aka.jpg|thumb|300px|center]]'''Primula'''   :   ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primula  Main article.'']}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
'''Gallery example code:'''
&lt;pre&gt;{{dropimage|width=200px|align=center|Gallery|&lt;gallery Caption=&quot;Gallery Markup Code Example&quot;&gt;

&lt;br clear=all&gt;
'''Text box example code:'''
&lt;pre&gt;{{dropimage|width=200px|align=right|Text|&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;Drop-down Images

For all the space saving qualities of the gallery,
it can be useful to save even more. If space is at
a premium, and there are just too many images to show,
then an image or even a  gallery o images can be tucked
away in a drop-down box. The display will appear
when the bar is clicked with the mouse; clicking it
again closes the gallery and restores the page to a
more tidy state.&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;}}&lt;/pre&gt;

'''HTML Table Example Code:'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!-- This is the code for an HTML table within a drop-control--&gt;  
{{dropimage

| chta=center
| 1=HTML Table Example

&lt;!-- This is the code for an HTML table within a drop-control--&gt;

 &lt;th&gt;Column Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Row Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Row Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Limitations===
The '''width''' option sets the ''ititial'' width of the control.   It expands on opening, and has been observed to involve some overlap of adjacent structures.   This can be avoided by care in basic layout.   The '''width''' option should be set to avoid an overtight fitting of the '''heading text''', bearing in mind the width of the ''show/hide'' text.

No attempt has been made to limit the width of the 'open content' state.   It will be limited to the width of the widest block or image structure, and unformatted text will then wrap in that width.   In the event that long lines of code in '''pre''' tags are to be used, the width might extend to an unreasonable extent; In this event consider the use of the '''poem''' tags instead of the '''pre''' tags so that long lines will be wrapped.   Alternatively, when control of the ''open-width'' for text wrapping is essential, as well as having the ''initial width'' set to a smaller value, make an HTML one-celled table around the right hand side of the content parameter, and set its width; this will set a convenient  ''open-width'' for wrapping text, though as mentioned above, block elements like '''pre''' will still need some other form of control.

'''These few bulleted points relate to using tables as contents:'''
*The content ''cannot'' reliably be a Wikitext table, since the pipe symbols confuse the code; use an HTML table instead.
*The HTML attribute ''cellspacing'' can cause problems.  Use the CSS styles for any spacing.
*Use the HTML heading tags instead of wikitext headings. Headings within content will not be listed in the table of contents since most drops default to the closed state.
*Use a numbered parameter for the content.   

Bear in mind that the use of  '''&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;'''  tags will be needed for verbatim text layout, and if the block of text itself has these same tags within it, that the literals should be used to replace the  ones within the text.   (ie: use these instead;   '''&amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt;''' and '''&amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;''').   This avoids the corrupted functioning which would otherwise result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why did the League of Nations fail? ==
There were a number of factors that led to the league failing, such as:
* They had no troops, so its decisions were often not respected by countries as they knew there would be no consequences.
* Decisions were slow, making it less effective.
* Economic sanctions did not work, especially because countries such as the USA, USSR and Germany were missing.
* The leading members often put their interests before those of the League, making it less effective.
* The treaties it had to uphold were seen as unfair in many countries.

In rexx, filename association is used, rather than numeric filehandles to refer to open files or devices. The rexx interpreter make the appropriate mappings to filehandles behind the scenes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humanitarian work was one of the areas that the League was most successful in.

== Social problems ==
Many agencies and commissions worked to reduce social problems. Some of their successes include:
* Freed more than 200 000 slaves.
* Brought death rate in the construction of the Tanganyika railway in Africa from 50% to 4%.
* Organized raids against slave owners/traders.
* Blacklisted four large companies involved in illegal drug trading.
== Health ==
The Health Committee, later renamed to the World Health Organization (WHO), did lots of work to improve health around the world.
== Transport ==
The League made an international highway code that was adopted by many member countries.
== Refugees ==
The Refugees Committee worked to bring refugees back to their homes. Over 400 000 war prisoners were taken back to their homes by the Refugees Committee.
== Working conditions ==
The International Labour Organization campaigned for better working conditions around the world. Some of its successes include:
* Banned poisonous white lead from paint.
* Limited the hours small children could work.
* Resolution for maximum 48-hour week and 8-hour day passed, but lots of member countries didn't adopt it.

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/81.109.210.18|81.109.210.18]]) and restored revision 2669799 by Xania</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Aims of the League ==
The League had four main aims that were defined in its charter:
* To encourage nations to disarm.
* To discourage aggression from any nation.
* To improve the living and working conditions of people in all parts of the world.
* To encourage countries to co-operate, especially in business and trade.

== Membership of the League ==
The League was supposed to be a representative world body but in reality many countries weren't part of it. Germany, for example, wasn't invited until several years after the League had been founded.

=== The USA ===
The USA, the most powerful country at the time, was never a part of the League. Some of the reasons for this were:
* They were worried about having to stop trade because of trade sanctions.
* The American public disliked the Treaty of Versailles.
* They did not want to get involved in another horrible war like the First World War.
* Americans did not want to have to defend Britain and France's empires.
However, the USA observed what was going on in the League. There was also always an American judge in the International Court of Justice.

== The structure ==
The League was made up of a number of parts.
=== The Secretariat ===
This dealt with the administrative work of the League. It kept records of meetings, prepared reports, translated speeches, etc.
=== The Council ===
This was a small group, made up of about a dozen countries (the exact figure varied throughout the League's history). There were two types of members:
* '''Permanent''' members stayed permanently. Initially these were Britain, France, Italy and Japan. These countries could vote on any decision they chose.
* '''Temporary''' members were elected by the Assembly on three-year terms.
The Council was the part of the League intended to sort out disputes between countries. If sorting out matters by discussion did not work, the Council had these powers:
* '''Moral condemnation:''' They could condemn the aggressor and tell it to stop what it was doing.
* '''Economic sanctions:''' They could make members of the League stop trading with the aggressor.
* '''Military force:''' They could use the armed forces of member countries, however the League had no armed forces of its own.

=== The Assembly ===
This was the League's parliament. Every country that was part of the League was represented in it. It could recommend action to the Council and vote on:
* Adding members to the League.
* Appointing the temporary members of the Council.
* The budget of the League.
* Putting forward ideas to the Council.
The Assembly had a number of problems. Firstly, it had very little power, and could not do much because it only met once a year. Another problem was that decisions had to be unanimous - everyone had to agree. This made it very difficult to reach a decision. Also the assembly allowed each member state to have one vote.

=== The Permanent Court of International Justice ===
This part of the League, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was made up of judges from various countries. The Court ruled on border disputes and gave legal advice to the Assembly and Council. However, it had no way of ensuring that countries followed its rulings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Treaty of Versailles dealt with the defeated Germany.
== War guilt ==
Germany had to agree that is was solely responsible for starting the war, and had to announce this publicly.
== Reparations ==
It was agreed that Germany would have to pay reparations to pay back for the damage they had done to the Allies.
* The exact amount of reparations, £6600 million, was agreed in 1921.
* This was reduced by the Young Plan in 1929. If it was no they would not have finished paying until 1984.
== Territories ==
The part of the treaty that dealt with territories was a complex one. The main points that were agreed were:
* They lost large parts of land in Europe.
* Their overseas colonies became mandates controlled by League of Nations. This meant that they were effectively controlled by Britain and France.
* They could not unite with their former ally, Austria.
== Armed forces ==
The following things were agreed:
* The German army would be limited 100 000 men.
* Conscription would be banned - all soldiers would have to be volunteers.
* The army would have no tanks, submarines or aircraft
* Their navy would be limited to 6 battleships.
* No armed forces would be stationed in the Rhineland
== League of Nations ==
The League of Nations would be set up amongst the allied countries to help maintain world peace. Germany, which was not considered a peaceful country at the time, would not be invited to join the League.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Firstly, list your BarCamp at [http://barcamp.org/ barcamp.org]
* If you use Twitter and Facebook, promote it on there.
* Set up a Twitter account for your event (see, for example, [http://twitter.com/barcamplondon @barcamplondon])
* Be sure to promote BarCamp to a wide variety of people: if there are geek communities in your city, approach those. Ask them if they can promote it to their community, and to ask any companies involved in that community if they are interested in sponsoring.
** Language or technology communities might include something like a Python user group or a hardware hacker group.
* Ask other BarCamp organisers if they could promote the event: many will retweet your announcement, blog about it and so on.
* Try and reach out to under-represented communities: some cities have a group for &quot;girl geeks&quot;, women in technology etc. Some BarCamps have given a handful of tickets to such communities to hand out at events, although some find this practice slightly controversial.

== Register interest ==
If you are planning an event but are not ready to start giving out tickets, make a form to just register interest: that way you can get people to just add their e-mail address, and they will get a message when there is a venue and date with instructions on how and when to register for tickets.

== After you've given out tickets ==
Once people have registered, you need to work out how to keep them engaged. Sending people reminder e-mails is one good way. For BarCampLondon8, the organisers sent out numerous reminder e-mails, and all attendees had to confirm their attendance a week before the event by clicking a link in an e-mail. Using this kind of approach, the organisers reduced the number of people not turning up quite dramatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Catalytic antibodies are antibodies that can enhance a couple of chemical and metabolic reactions in the body by binding a chemical group, resembling the transition state of a given reaction. Catalytic antibodies are produced when an antibody is immunized with a hapten molecule. The hapten molecule is usually designed to resemble the transition state of metabolic reaction.

Antibodies act like soldiers to the body, fighting unwanted materials. They are secreted, for instance, when the body is infected with a bacterium or virus. The animal produces antibodies with binding sites that are exactly complementary to some molecular feature of the invader. The antibodies can thus recognize and bind only to the invader, identifying it as foreign and leading to its destruction by the rest of the immune system. Antibodies are also elicited in large quantity when an animal is injected with molecules, a process known as immunization. A small molecule used for immunization is called a hapten. Ordinarily, only large molecules effectively elicit antibodies via immunization, so small-molecule haptens must be attached to a large protein molecule, called a carrier protein, prior to the actual immunization. Antibodies that are produced after immunization with the hapten-carrier protein conjugate are complementary to, and thus specifically bind, the hapten. 

Ordinarily, antibody molecules simply bind; they do not catalyze reactions. However, catalytic antibodies are produced when animals are immunized with hapten molecules that are specially designed to elicit antibodies that have binding pockets capable of catalyzing chemical reactions. For example, in the simplest cases, binding forces within the antibody binding pocket are enlisted to stabilize transition states and intermediates, thereby lowering a reaction's energy barrier and increasing its rate. This can occur when the antibodies have a binding site that is complementary to a transition state or intermediate structure in terms of both three-dimensional geometry and charge distribution. This complementarity leads to catalysis by encouraging the substrate to adopt a transition-state-like geometry and charge distribution. Not only is the energy barrier lowered for the desired reaction, but other geometries and charge distributions that would lead to unwanted products can be prevented, increasing reaction selectivity.

Making antibodies with binding pockets complementary to transition states is complicated by the fact that true transition states and most reaction intermediates are unstable. Thus, true transition states or intermediates cannot be isolated or used as haptens for immunization. Instead, so-called transition-state analog molecules are used. Transition-state analog molecules are stable molecules that simply resemble a transition state (or intermediate) for a reaction of interest in terms of geometry and charge distribution. To the extent that the transition-state analog molecule resembles a true reaction transition state or intermediate, the elicited antibodies will also be complementary to that transition state or intermediate and thus lead to the catalytic acceleration of that reaction.

Catalytic antibodies bind very tightly to the transition-state analog haptens that were used to produce them during the immunization process. The transition-state analog haptens only bind and do not react with catalytic antibodies. It is the substrates, for example, the analogous ester molecules, that react. For this reason, transition-state analog haptens can interfere with the catalytic reaction by binding in the antibody binding pocket, thereby preventing any substrate molecules from binding and reacting. This inhibition by the transition-state analog hapten is always observed with catalytic antibodies, and is used as a first level of proof that catalytic antibodies are responsible for any observed catalytic reaction.

The important feature of catalysis by antibodies is that, unlike enzymes, desired reaction selectivity can be programmed into the antibody by using an appropriately designed hapten. Catalytic antibodies almost always demonstrate a high degree of substrate selectivity. In addition, catalytic antibodies have been produced that have regioselectivity sufficient to produce a single product for a reaction in which other products are normally observed in the absence of the antibody.

Finally, catalytic antibodies have been produced by immunization with a single-handed version (only left- or only right-handed) of a hapten, and only substrates with the same handedness can act as substrates for the resulting catalytic antibodies. The net result is that a high degree of stereoselectivity is observed in the antibody-catalyzed reaction.

Abyzymes are artificial catalytic antibodies and come from the words “antibody” and “enzyme” They are monoclonal antibodies that have catalytic properties, or carry out catalysis. The figure bellow shows the active of site of the abyzyme chorismate mutase and side-chain interactions with the transition state analog.

__TOC__

== Coordinate Transformations ==

A ''transformation'' is any kind of operation that changes coordinate values in some way. For example, if you pick up an object and move it to a different place in the room without changing its orientation, then the coordinates of each point on the object relative to the room are adjusted by an amount that depends on the distance and direction between the old and new positions; this is called a ''translation'' transformation.
&lt;center&gt;
{|
 |[[File:LEMAtOrigin.png|framed|Object at original location]]
 |[[File:LEMTranslated.png|framed|Object translated to new position]]
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;
{{-}}

If you simply turn the object around without moving it from its original location, then that’s called a ''rotation''.
[[File:LEMRotated45.png|framed|center|Object rotated 45°]]
{{-}}

If the object were to get bigger or smaller, then that would be called a ''scaling'' transformation. In the real world, only a few objects can be scaled in this way—for example, a balloon can be inflated or deflated to a larger or smaller size, but a bowling ball cannot be re-sized. Regardless of what can and can't be re-sized in the real world, any object can be scaled (re-sized) in the world of computer graphics. Scaling may be ''uniform'' (applying equally in all dimensions) or ''non-uniform''. 

&lt;center&gt;
{|
 |[[File:LEMScaled50.png|framed|Object uniformly scaled to 50% of original size]]
 |[[File:LEMSquashed50.png|framed|Object scaled vertically to 50% of original size]]
 |}

&lt;/center&gt;
{{-}}

== Linear Transformations ==

The main kinds of coordinate transformations we’re concerned with here are called ''linear transformations''. Lines that were straight before the transformation remain straight after; they do not turn into curves. For example, the following diagram illustrates three linear transformations applied to the square in the center: a scaling, a ''shear'' or ''skew'' transform, and a rotation, plus one transformation that isn’t linear, because it introduces curves where there were none before.

[[File:LinearTransformations.svg|400px]]

== Multiple Transformations ==

It is possible to ''concatenate'' or ''compose'' a series of transformations. The resulting transformation can do a whole bunch of things in one operation—translation, rotation, scaling etc. However, the order of composition of the component transformations becomes important—in general, transformations are not ''commutative''. For example, compare the result of moving our model a certain distance along the Y axis followed by rotating it about the X axis (If this doesn't make sense, consider that the axes are fixed, they aren't moving with the object.  More on that later [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Coordinate Spaces in Blender#Global_and_local_coordinates|Global and local coordinates]]):

[[File:LEMTranslatedRotated45.png|framed|center|Translation followed by rotation]]

versus the result of doing the rotation first:

[[File:LEMRotated45Translated.png|framed|center|Rotation followed by translation]]

In some instances, three of the forms of transformation may be applied on a single object concurrently. Such a feature exists in Blender and is normally implemented in creating animations. Therefore, you can decide to pick up the object (first transformation - translation), twist it (second transformation - rotation), and, in a 3D modeling environment, increase the size of the object (third transformation - scaling).

== Inverse Transformations ==

There is quite commonly a need to find the ''inverse'' of a transformation—that is, the opposite transformation that undoes its effect. For example, a rotation of +45° about the X axis is undone by a rotation of -45° around the same axis.

Inverses have many uses, one of which is to simplify the construction of certain kinds of transformations.

For example, it is easy to construct a rotation transformation about the X, Y or Z-axis of the coordinate system. But what about a rotation of Θ° around an arbitrary axis? This can be made out of the following parts:
* a translation that makes the rotation axis pass through the origin.
* rotations about the Y and/or Z axes, as appropriate, so the rotation axis lies along the X axis.
* a rotation of Θ° about the X axis.
* the inverse of the rotations that aligned the rotation axis with the X axis.
* the inverse of the translation that made the rotation axis pass through the origin.

Most of the transformations we deal with in 3D modelling have an inverse, but not all—see the next section for some that don’t.

== Projections ==

Most of our display and output devices are not three-dimensional. Thus, three-dimensional images need to be ''projected'' onto a two-dimensional surface (like a display screen or a printed page) before we can see them.

There are two main ways to perform such projections. One is ''orthographic'' projection, where parallel lines are drawn from all points of the three-dimensional object until they intersect a plane representing the display surface:

[[File:OrthographicProjection.svg|600x280px]]

[[../Orthographic Views|More on orthographic projections]]

The other way is ''perspective'' projection, where the lines drawn are not parallel, but intersect at a point representing the location of the eye of the viewer:

[[File:PerspectiveProjection.svg|600x282px]]

Projections are also linear transformations. But since they take a three-dimensional space and flatten it onto a two-dimensional surface, some information is lost. Which means these are ''non-invertible'' transformations; they cannot be undone, at least in a unique way—the depth information is gone.

[[../Perspective Views|More on perspective projections]]

The mathematics of perspective were first worked out in the 11th century by [[w:Alhazen|Alhazen]], and used to great effect by the Italian Renaissance painters four hundred years later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ROOT/Template Documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;This is a template designed for the book [[ROOT]]. It should be used to mark template documentation sites.

== Usage ==
=== Syntax ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;{{ROOT/Template Documentation}}&lt;/source&gt;

=== How to document a template for the book ROOT ===
Say we want a template &lt;code&gt;MyTemplate&lt;/code&gt;.

# First we create the template on the page &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/MyTemplate&lt;/code&gt;
# Next we create an other template on the page &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/Template Documentation/MyTemplate&lt;/code&gt;. On this page we put the documentation and embed this box&lt;ref&gt;From a technical point of view, the documentation is of course a template again. But it would become an awkward loop to document it again. Since a documentation template ''never'' takes any parameters and has an obvious purpose, it should be absolutely clear how to use it even without documentation.&lt;/ref&gt;.
# '''Important:''' Put &lt;code&gt;&amp;#60;noinclude&amp;#62;&amp;#60;/noinclude&amp;#62;&lt;/code&gt; tags around the &amp;#123;&amp;#123;ROOT/Template Documentation&amp;#125;&amp;#125; so it won't appear on pages where the documentation is just embedded.
# Now we embed the documentation on the template's site via: &lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;ROOT/Template Documentation&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/code&gt;.
# '''Important:''' The syntax &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/MyTemplate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Template:ROOT/Template Documentation/MyTemplate&lt;/code&gt; must be strictly followed or the thing won't work.

== Example ==
Since this template analyzes the page information, an example can't be given. Check out the source of the [[Template:ROOT/Template Documentation/Template Documentation|template's own documentation site]] for an example if really needed.

== Notes ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs ==
[[Image:Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.svg|thumb|right|300px|Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom.]]
Maslow studied employee motivation and, 1954, published his research. He created a hierarchy of people's needed. These were:
# Physiological needs - food, water, shelter, warmth, clothing
# Safety needs - being safe and secure from harm, job security
# Social needs - enjoying the company of others, teamwork, social contact
# Self-esteem - feeling valued by others, being praised and encouraged
# Self-actualisation - achieving something, reaching targets
Some people are prepared to work for just money, but others like going to work because of the friends they have made there, or the fact that they are respected by others and recognized for their good work.
=== Conclusions ===
Maslow drew some conclusions from his research. He determined that:
* If a lower need is not met, then the higher ones are ignored. For example, if employees are worried that they will be fired, and have no job security, they will be concerned about friendship and respect.
* If a need is not met staff may become very frustrated. For example, if someone works very hard for a promotion and does not achieve the recognition they want, they may become demotivated and put in less effort.
* When a need is met it will no longer motivate the person, but the next need in the hierarchy will become important to that person.

== Herzberg's Hygiene Factors ==
Herzberg believed that all the needs of workers can be categorised into two groups:
# Hygiene factors - The things the business has to provide in order to keep workers content. These include clean, safe working conditions, and adequate rest breaks.
# Motivating factors - The things that will encourage workers to do their best. These include praise from managers, more responsibility, and promotions for good workers.

If the hygiene factors are poor, then the motivating factors won't work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 1970s, tension between the two superpowers relaxed. This period was known as ''détente''.

== Why did the Cold War thaw in 1970s? ==
* At the Helsinki conference in 1975 all countries recognized the borders set out at the end of the Second World War (including Germany/Berlin).
* The Vietnam War ended.
* Nuclear testing damaged the environment and cost a fortune. Anti-nuclear movements supported détente.
* The leaders held regular summit meetings.
* American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts shook hands in space.
* Both had extremely advanced weapons, and were spending large sums of money to develop them. They realised that this money could be better spent elsewhere.
* SALT ('''S'''trategic '''A'''rms '''L'''imitation '''T'''reaty) 1 was signed, and progress was being made towards a SALT 2.

== Why did the Cold War freeze again in the 80s? ==
* The USA boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics. In retaliation, the USSR and eastern Europe boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
* SALT 2, a USA-USSR agreement to limit nuclear weapons, collapsed because relations between the two countries had detriorated too far.
* There was a revolution in Iran. The new leader was anti-American and anti-Communist, both superpowers were worried.
* Jimmy Carter criticised the USSR's suppression of dissidents in the USSR and eastern Europe.
* New nuclear weapons were being developed by both the USA and USSR.
* There were civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Angola where the USA and USSR funded opposing sides.
* Ronald Reagan was elected president. He funded the Strategic Defense Initiative ('Star Wars') and took a tougher line on the USSR. He called the USSR the 'Evil Empire' and was more very anti-Communist.
* The USSR was fighting for the pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan. The USA was supporting opponents of the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Induction Training ==
Induction training is used to introduce a new employee to the company and the way it works. It can last anything from half a day to several weeks, but it is important that every company does it because:
* Most people who quit their job do it within the first weeks, because they have difficulty adapting. This reflects poorly on the image of the company and means that they have to go through the whole process of recruitment again, which is expensive and time-wasting. Induction training helps reduce this.
* Induction training is necessary so that employees know what they are expected to do.
* Given appropriate induction training, employees will become productive more quickly and adapt better to the company.

== Training Type ==
Training can be divided into two main types. These are on-the-job training and off-the-job training. Most companies will use a mixture of the two methods of training.
=== On-the-job Training ===
In this type of training, the employee learns skills from another employee (typically somebody with more experience at the job).
==== Advantages ====
* '''To the employer:'''
** Less expensive than sending them to a course.
** Knows where the employee is and what he is doing at all times.
** Training is exactly what is needed for the job.
** Skills may not be transferable to other companies, reducing the chances the employee will leave.
** The employee will continue working during the training.
* '''To the employee:'''
** Does not have to travel for training.
** Learns relevant skills which will help him in his job.

==== Disadvantages ====
* '''To the employer:'''
** Mistakes made by the trainee can be damaging to the company.
** The trainer will be less productive whilst he is doing the training.
* '''To the employee:'''
** Does not gain any official qualification.
** Skills learnt are often only relevant to the company, and will not help in a different job.
** Normally only a short training.
** Often, they are not trained by an expert teacher, so the quality of the training may be poor.

=== Off-the-job Training ===
In this type of training, the employee is sent to a training center to be taught skills related to his job.
==== Advantages ====
* '''To the employer:'''
** Any mistakes made will not affect the company.
** If courses are held outside of work hours, the employee is still working normally.
* '''To the employee:'''
** Gains an official qualification, which will help when applying for a promotion or a new job.
** Often a fun or interesting experience because it changes the normal routine of work and lets them meet new people.

==== Disadvantages ====
* '''To the employer:'''
** Courses are often expensive.
** The employee will be missing work time to go to the courses.
** Once the employee has gained the qualification, he may use it to find another job.
** Cannot check on the employee easily when he is away from work.
* '''To the employee:'''
** May have to travel to get to the training centre.
** Some courses may be outside of work hours.
** Some of the skills learnt may not be directly transferable to his job.

GHCi assists in several ways toward more efficient work. Here, we will discuss some of the best practices for using GHCi.

==User interface==

===Tab completion===

As in many other terminal programs, you can enter some starting text in GHCi and then hit the Tab key to be presented with a list of all possibilities that start with what you've written so far. When there is only one possibility, using Tab will auto-complete the string. For example fol&lt;tt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will append letter d (since nothing exists with &quot;fol&quot; other than items that start with &quot;fold&quot;). A second &lt;tt&gt;Tab&lt;/tt&gt; will list the four functions included in Prelude: foldl, foldl1, foldr, and foldr1. More options may show if you have already imported additional modules.

Tab completion works also when you are loading a file with your program into GHCi. For example, after typing :l fi&lt;tt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, you will be presented with all files that start with &quot;fi&quot; that are present in the current directory (the one you were in when you launched GHCi).

The same also applies when you are importing modules, after typing :m +Da&lt;tt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, you will be presented with all modules that start with &quot;Da&quot; present in installed packages.

===&quot;: commands&quot;===

On GHCi command line, commands for the interpreter start with the character &quot;:&quot; (colon).
* &lt;code&gt;:help&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;/code&gt; -- prints a list of all available commands.
* &lt;code&gt;:load&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:l&lt;/code&gt; -- loads a given file into GHCi (you must include the filename with the command).
* &lt;code&gt;:reload&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:r&lt;/code&gt; -- reloads whatever file had been loaded most recently (useful after changes to the file).
* &lt;code&gt;:type&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:t&lt;/code&gt; -- prints the type of a given expression included with the command
* &lt;code&gt;:module&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:m&lt;/code&gt; -- loads a given module (include the module name with the command). You can also ''un''load a module by adding a &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; symbol before the module name.
* &lt;code&gt;:browse&lt;/code&gt; -- gives the type signatures for all functions available from a given module.

Here again, you can use &lt;tt&gt;Tab&lt;/tt&gt; to see the list of commands, type :&lt;tt&gt;Tab&lt;/tt&gt; to see all possible commands.

===Timing Functions in GHCi===

GHCi provides a basic way to measure how much time a function takes to run, which can be useful for to find out which version of a function runs fastest (such as when there are multiple ways to define something to get the same effective result).
# Type &lt;code&gt;:set +s&lt;/code&gt; into the ghci command line.
# run the function(s) you are testing. The time the function took to run will be displayed after GHCi outputs the results of the function.

===Multi-line Input===
If you are trying to define a function that takes up multiple lines, or if you want to type a do block into ghci (without writing a file that you then import), there is an easy way to do this:
# Begin a new line with &lt;code&gt;:{&lt;/code&gt;
# Type in your code. Press enter when you need a new line.
# Type &lt;code&gt;:}&lt;/code&gt; to end the multi-line input.

For example:

    *Main&gt; :{
    *Main| let askname = do
    *Main|               putStrLn &quot;What is your name?&quot;
    *Main|               name &lt;- getLine
    *Main|               putStrLn $ &quot;Hello &quot; ++ name
    *Main| :}
    *Main&gt;


The same can be accomplished by using &lt;code&gt;:set +m&lt;/code&gt; command (allow multi-line commands). In this case, an empty line will end the block.

In addition, line breaks in ghci commands can be separated by &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;, like this:

    *Main&gt; let askname1 = do ; putStrLn &quot;what is your name?&quot; ; name &lt;- getLine ; putStrLn $ &quot;Hello &quot; ++ name

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sales Revenue ==
The sales revenue is how much a business makes by selling goods or providing a service. Sales revenue for a single product can be calculated like this:
:&lt;math&gt;sales~revenue = amount~sold * selling~price&lt;/math&gt;

== Costs ==
=== Fixed costs ===
Fixed costs, also known as indirect costs or overheads, are costs that do not change depending on how much the firm sells. Some examples of fixed costs are:
* Rent
* Salaries
* Load repayments

=== Variable costs ===
Variable costs, also known as direct costs, change directly depending on how much a firm produces. Some examples of variable costs are:
* Raw materials
* Electricity

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Synopsis ==

This class implements a propositional rule learner, Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER), which was proposed by William W. Cohen as an optimized version of IREP. It is based in association rules with reduced error pruning (REP), a very common and effective technique found in decision tree algorithms.
In REP for rules algorithms, the training data is split into a growing set and a pruning set. First, an initial rule set is formed that over ts the growing set, using some heuristic method. This overlarge rule set is then repeatedly simplified by applying one of a set of pruning operators typical pruning operators would be to delete any single condition or any single rule. At each stage of simplification, the pruning operator chosen is the one that yields the greatest reduction of error on the pruning set. Simplification ends when applying any pruning operator would increase error on the pruning set. 

The algorithm is briefly described as follows: 
Initialize RS = {}, and for each class from the less prevalent one to the more frequent one, DO: 

=== 1. Building stage: ===

Repeat 1.1 and 1.2 until the description length (DL) of the rule set and examples is 64 bits greater than the smallest DL met so far, or there are no positive examples, or the error rate &gt;= 50%. 

==== 1.1. Grow phase: ====

Grow one rule by greedily adding antecedents (or conditions) to the rule until the rule is perfect (i.e. 100% accurate). The procedure tries every possible value of each attribute and selects the condition with highest information gain: p(log(p/t)-log(P/T)).

==== 1.2. Prune phase: ====

Incrementally prune each rule and allow the pruning of any final sequences of the antecedents;The pruning metric is (p-n)/(p+n) – but it's actually 2p/(p+n) -1, so in this implementation we simply use p/(p+n) (actually (p+1)/(p+n+2), thus if p+n is 0, it's 0.5).

=== 2. Optimization stage: ===

after generating the initial rule set {Ri}, generate and prune two variants of each rule Ri from randomized data using procedure 1.1 and 1.2. But one variant is generated from an empty rule while the other is generated by greedily adding antecedents to the original rule. Moreover, the pruning metric used here is (TP+TN)/(P+N).Then the smallest possible DL for each variant and the original rule is computed. The variant with the minimal DL is selected as the final representative of Ri in the rule set. After all the rules in {Ri} have been examined and if there are still residual positives, more rules are generated based on the residual positives using Building Stage again. 
3. Delete the rules from the rule set that would increase the DL of the whole rule set if it were in it. and add resultant rule set to RS. 
ENDDO
Note that there seem to be 2 bugs in the original ripper program that would affect the rule set size and accuracy slightly. This implementation avoids these bugs and thus is a little bit different from Cohen's original implementation. Even after fixing the bugs, since the order of classes with the same frequency is not defined in ripper, there still seems to be some trivial difference between this implementation and the original ripper, especially for audiology data in UCI repository, where there are lots of classes of few instances.

== Installation ==

The caret package can be installed by using the following command on R's command-line:

 install.packages(&quot;caret&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)

The above command shall recursivelly download and install all packages that caret depend to along with fpc itself.

== Example ==

The example in this section will illustrate the carets's JRip usage on the IRIS database:

 &gt;library(caret)
 &gt;library(RWeka)
 &gt;data(iris)
 &gt;TrainData &lt;- iris[,1:4]
 &gt;TrainClasses &lt;- iris[,5]
 &gt;jripFit &lt;- train(TrainData, TrainClasses,method = &quot;JRip&quot;)

== Study Case ==

=== Dataset ===

The Iris dataset contains 150 instances, corresponding to three equally-frequent species of iris plant (Iris setosa, Iris versicolour, and Iris virginica). An Iris versicolor is shown below, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.

[[Image:Iris_versicolor_3.jpg|thumb|center|180px|Iris versicolor]]

Each instance contains four attributes:sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm. The next picture shows each attribute plotted against the others, with the different classes in color.

[[Image:Anderson%27s_Iris_data_set.png|thumb|center|180px|Plotting the Iris attributes]]

=== Execution and Results ===

First of all, we need to specify which base we are going to use:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; data(iris)
&gt; summary(iris)
  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
 Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
 Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  
 Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  
 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  
 Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
       Species  
 setosa    :50  
 versicolor:50  
 virginica :50  

&lt;/pre&gt;

After that, we are ready to create a Naïve Bayes model to the dataset using the first 4 columns to predict the fifth.  

 &gt;data(iris)
 &gt;varIndex &lt;- 1:numSamples
 &gt;
 &gt;TrainData &lt;- iris[,1:4]
 &gt;TrainClasses &lt;- iris[,5]
 &gt;jripFit &lt;- train(TrainData, TrainClasses,method = &quot;JRip&quot;,preProcess = c(&quot;center&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;),tuneLength = 10,trControl = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;))

=== Output === 
 
 Loading required package: class
 
 Attaching package: 'class'

   10      0.94      0.91   0.0584       0.0876            
 
 Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
 The final value used for the model was NumOpt = 2.

The caret package runned the training tunning the NumOpt JRip parameter from 1 to 10 and chouse the best performance wich is NumOpt=2 with a 95.3% accuracy. If some other algorithm was chosen, other algorithm parameter would be tunned.

If we plot the results we have a plot of the parameter choosing accuracy:

 &gt;plot(jripFit)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Yalta Conference ==
[[File:Yalta Conference cropped.jpg|thumb|Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta.]]
The Yalta Conference, in February 1945, was fairly successful. Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin agreed on a number of things:
* They would join the United Nations Organization.
* Stalin would join the war against Japan.
* Germany, and Berlin, would be divided into four zones (American, British, French, and Soviet).
* They would hunt down war criminals.
* Eastern Europe would be seen as 'a Soviet sphere of influence.'
* All countries liberated from Germany would be allowed to hold free elections.
* The Big Three had to compromise about Poland. Stalin wanted to take Polish territory and allow Poland to take German territory. The other two let him have his way with Poland, but he had to agree to not interfere in Greece, where a civil war between monarchists and Communist was brewing.

== The Postdam Conference ==
The Yalta Conference was followed by Potsdam, in August 1945.
=== Break-down of the Alliance ===
{{rquote|right|
The Communist parties have been raised to power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. This is certainly not the liberated Europe we fought to build. Nor is it one which allows permanent peace.|
[[w:Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill]] in a speech}}
By the Potsdam conference the war-time alliance between the USA and the USSR had broken down. There were a number of reasons for this:
* Stalin's armies occupied eastern Europe.
* America had a new president, Truman, who was more anti-Communist than Roosevelt.
* America had successfully tested an atomic bomb.

=== Disagreements ===
Very little was agreed at Potsdam. The following things were discussed:
* They disagreed over what to do about Germany. 
* They disagreed over Soviet policy in eastern Europe. Truman was unhappy of Russian intentions.
* Stalin wanted to cripple Germany, Truman did not want to repeat the mistakes of Versailles.
* They disagreed over reparations. Once again Stalin wanted to cripple Germany, and Truman wanted to avoid another war.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Cuban Revolution ==
=== How did the USA react to Batista's government being overthrown? ===
* Initially, there was a frosty relationship but with no direct confrontation.
* In 1960, the USA banned buying of Cuban sugar (July) and then banned all trade with Cuba (October).
* In January 1961 the USA broke off diplomatic relations.
* After the takeover, Castro took over American businesses, but let them keep the naval base.
* In April 1961 the USA supported an invasion of Cuba by exiles ([[#The Bay of Pigs|the Bay of Pigs]]). It failed.

== The Bay of Pigs ==
=== Why was the Bay of Pigs invasion a failure? ===
* The CIA underestimated Castro's popularity - the Cubans did not rise to support the invasion.
* The invasion convinced Castro that the USA was an enemy and made him look to the USSR for support and protection.
* Kennedy claimed that there was no direct American government involvement, but Castro and Khruschev knew the CIA had planned it and trained/armed the exiles.
* The failed invasion made Castro even more popular.
* Because of the failed invasion, Khruschev was able to put missiles on Cuba claiming that they were for defensive purposes.
* A force of 1400 exiles landed in Cuba and were killed/captured by 20 000 Cuban troops.

== The Cuban Missile Crisis ==
=== Why did the Soviet Union put missiles on Cuba? ===
There are a number of theories as to why the Soviet Union decided to put missiles on Cuba. Some of these are:
* To get the upper hand in the arms race.
* They genuinely wanted to defend Cuba.
* To bargain with the USA (e.g. make them remove their missiles in Turkey).
* To test the USA.
* They wanted to trap the USA.
=== Why was the USA concerned about Soviet missiles on Cuba? ===
{{rquote|right|
The estimate was that within a few minutes of [the missiles] being fired 80 million Americans would be dead.|
[[w:Robert Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]]|''[[w:Thirteen Days (book)|Thirteen Days]]''}}
There are a number of reasons for which the USA was concerned about Soviet missiles on Cuba. Some of these are:
* There was the potential for a nuclear war that would have destroyed the USA.
* Cuba was becoming a powerful country in their 'sphere of influence'
* The USSR could use the missiles to bargain with the USA and make them remove their nuclear missiles from Turkey.
* They were worried that the USSR was trying to draw them into a nuclear war.
* It was a test that would show how strong the USA really was.
* It was a threat to USA supremacy in the arms race.

=== The USA's Actions ===
Kennedy had a number of choices as to what course of action to take. The main ones were:
* Doing nothing would make the USA seem weak and ineffective, and would not solve the problem. However, there would be no risk of war.
* A blockade would prevent more nuclear weapons arriving but did not solve the root of the problem, and would make the USA seem weak if it failed.
* An invasion of Cuba would get rid of Castro but risked starting a war with the Soviet Union.
* Diplomatic pressure would not risk the outbreak of war, but would make the USA seem weak if it failed.
* A surgical air attack would result in a Soviet response (Berlin?) and could not guarantee the destruction of all the missiles.
=== The Outcome ===

We behaved with dignity and forced the United States to demobilise and to recognise Cuba.|

{{rquote|right|
President Kennedy will be remembered as the President who helped bring the thaw in the Cold War.|
Kennedy's obituary in [[w:The Guardian|The Guardian]] (1963)}}
There has been much debate about who came out victorious of the Cuban Missile Crisis. You should draw your own conclusions, but keep the following points in mind:
* After the failure with the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy was able to claim a success.
* Khruschev's reputation was damaged, and he was overthrown by his opponents in 1964.
* The Cuban Missile Crisis made some steps towards better relations:
** A 'hot line' was set up to allow better communication between the leaders.
** In 1963 a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed.
* Cuba remained Communist and highly armed, and was a useful base for Soviet operations in South America.
* Khrushchev claimed that he had ensured the safety of his ally, and made peace.
* Khrushchev got the USA to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, but this was kept secret so it couldn't be used for propaganda purposes.

=== Was the Cuban Missile Crisis really a threat to world peace? ===
Historians argue whether the Cuban Missile Crisis was really a threat to world peace. Some points to think about are:
* Both leaders were ready to negotiate. After the crisis, they even set up a direct telephone line to discuss future crises
* If Khruschev was to be believed, the missiles were only for defensive purposes.
* Advisers on both sides were suggesting a war.
* Castro wanted Khrushchev to open fire first, but Khruschev wanted to negotiate with the USA.
* Neither leader wanted to start a war.
