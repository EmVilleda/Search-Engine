* I plan to merge Decision Control into Conditional Statements and move Loops after Sequences.  I already moved Sequences to after Decision Control because they seem more advanced than Boolean logic, but now the higher level of iteration is bugging me.  I understand why Decision Control exists; it's neat and logical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Independent thinking and learning ===

Independent learning outside of school can be promoted through the creation of extensive written works and team work.
To create a parent education course, such as the one you are about to write, could consequently be seen as a useful learning context.
The topic is of general interest and there are extensive opportunities for literature research and research projects.
Independent thought can be encouraged by a need for {{/@|Self-concept and metacognition|metacognition}}, through research and through extensive opportunity for discussions which can be further stimulated through questions and contradictions, or other need for clarification.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* How can you bring the motivation for independent learning into the family?
* What other topics than parent education could one work on in a similar manner?
* What other aspects of independent thought and learning could one choose to promote?
* What other methods of promotion for independent thought and learning can you devise?
}}

A parent education course may also have the objective to train competencies in a family.
An important competence, which promotes independent thought and learning, is [[w:autodidacticism|autodidacticism]].
In order not to exaggerate one should also apply {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultural competence}}; not everybody shares enthusiasm for [[w:lifelong learning|lifelong learning]] and not everybody wants to improve his autodidactic skills.
The right way can be to prefer interest-driven learning and to improve autodidactic skills only as a side effect; whoever learns according to his interests is unlikely to complain about the improvement of his learning skills.
Autodidactic learning presupposes a willingness to accept that there are things which one does not understand, but which one may consider essential once they are understood.
Many people fail to recognize this fact again and again.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* How do you explain to a learner that he only after understanding a topic can truly understand its benefits?
* Why is it hard to understand that the benefits of the unknown may also be unknown?
* Is this a [[w:cognitive bias|cognitive bias]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Happiness research ==

At the Willy-Hellpach school in Heidelberg there is a new subject [http://www.schulfachglueck.de/ Happiness] since September 2007.
The head teacher Ernst Fritz-Schubert means to promote life skills, enjoyment of life, personality development, personal satisfaction, self-confidence, self-responsibility and social responsibility with this subject.
What he deems necessary for this purpose are self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, spirituality, humor and optimism.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
The head teacher of the Willy Hellpach school sees happiness as a basic need.
* Where would you put happiness in the {{/@|Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs}}?
* What do you think about the ingredients of happiness (self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, spirituality, humor and optimism)?
* What do you know yourself (or believe to know) about the psychology of happiness?
}}

An important observation is that happiness occurs in many situations in response to a change, so you can react in these situations only to that event or a shorter or longer phase with happiness and well-being. After the event or after a certain time a habituation effect can occur, which means you get used to the state that initially made you happy and you perceive the pleasant event or the comfortable state as normal.

A good example are computer games or listening to music; both of which can be used to enhance the mood, to feel in a good mood for a limited time, but both can also be exaggerated, so that the effect decreases and a habituation occurs.
In case of homework one could distinguish for instance if the homework is unpleasant enough, so that an artificial improvement of one's mood appears necessary, or whether the intellectual challenge may be motivation enough. To turn off music before the homework can be seen as [[w:Deferred gratification|delayed gratification]] as well as a necessity in order to achieve the necessary concentration. (If the homework is always unpleasant that could be a topic for the {{/@|Class council and family council|class council}}.)

Longer-lasting happiness results however, for instance, from the fulfillment of some of the basic needs in the {{/@|Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs}}, especially on the steps three (social needs), four (esteem) and five (self-actualization).

At level four of the hierarchy of needs respect, self-esteem, recognition and wealth can be found as examples.
In a capitalist society all these terms can easily be associated with &quot;wealth&quot;, which makes capitalism an end in itself instead of a {{/@|Capitalism as a means to an end|means to an end}}. An interesting question could thus be: How much money does one need to be happy? The [[wikinews:de:ZDF-Studie_zum_Glück_der_Kinder_in_Deutschland|ZDF-study about happiness of children in Germany]] reports that children in families with a household income of less than 1.500 Euro described themselves as less happy.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* What can you do to help families who possibly do not earn enough?
* What forms of cooperation with other families do exist?
* Is the income the actual cause or merely an indicator? What are possible causes?
* What can you do about these causes?
}}

An example for a measure could be a [[w:de:Schülerfirma|pupil company]] that works as an educational coaching agency and employment agency for unemployed parents; the same pupil company could for instance offer and organize parent education courses and {{/@|parent service}} and organize additional leisure and educational offers for pupils.

=== Class council and family council ===

The [[w:class council|class council]] of a class and the {{/@|Family council|family council}} of a family are both democratic committees that serve the purpose to facilitate learning processes for social and democratic behavior.
Many families can benefit from assistance for family councils through their schools.

}}

==== Philosophycracy ====

Philosophycracy is a made up word, but the meaning is generic and can be deduced from the components &quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;krátos&quot;. The term philosophy comes from the Ancient Greek word φιλοσοφία (philosophía) and means love of wisdom. The root word κράτος (krátos) is also of Ancient Greek origin and means strength or power, such as in the word democracy. The philosophycracy would consequently be the &quot;rule of the love of wisdom&quot;.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
Can one design a council so that all votes have to be based on the philosophical positions of the voters?
}}

The voters would have to determine their philosophical positions in advance and commit to vote in accordance with their philosophy or possibly to abstain from voting.
In general it may be almost impossible to anticipate all possible exceptions and conflicts of interest, however, exceptions should be rare enough so that one could at least establish the general positions.
Whether a council recognizes an exception or a conflict of interest and allows a deviation from the philosophycracy rule can be left to the council to decide.

A benefit of the prior determination of philosophical positions is that every member of the council gets to know every other council member.
To discuss the philosophical positions of other council members could thus be regarded as valuable social behavior.

=== Parent service ===

{{Rquote|right|There is much evidence that the furtherance of children in programs outside of the family benefits if likewise the parents can be won over to give the educational processes of their children more attention and support.|[http://www.familienhandbuch.de/familienpolitik/wissenschaftliche-beitrage/die-bildungspolitische-bedeutung-der-familie-folgerungen-aus-der-pisa-studie The meaning of the family for educational policy,&lt;br&gt;conclusions from the PISA study]|Scientific Advisory Council of the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth}}

In the U.S. some private schools require that all parents must collaborate in school.
Both, services for parents as well as services by parents can be referred to as &quot;parent service&quot;.
These services may include assistance with school events but also in education.
Often merely the family is required to serve a certain number of hours, for instance four hours per month; the family members can then discuss in a family council who accepts this duty in each case, which should also be seen as a positive motivation for discussions.
A further psychological effect is that children and teenagers will appreciate the cooperation of their parents if a duty could just as easily be assigned to them.
An occasional compulsory school attendance for parents can, however, be used for parent education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Intercultural competence ===

[[w:Intercultural competence|Intercultural competence]] is actually the competent handling of cultures of other countries, but you can also apply intercultural competence to the personal cultures and characteristics of people and groups of people as {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultural competence}}.
This is obviously the case when you personally meet people from other cultures.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* What cultural differences do you know?
* What is required for intercultural competence when dealing with people from other countries?
* How can you learn or train intercultural competence?
}}

Intercultural competence means knowledge about other cultures, but also {{/@|Self-concept and metacognition|metacognition}}, because you have to think about your own actions and the actions and expectations of others; it means [[w:people skills|people skills]], because you have to be able to apply the knowledge and the results of your considerations in social activities.
The required knowledge, the ability for the required metacognition and the aspects of social competence that are necessary form together an {{/@|Active mental vocabulary|active mental vocabulary}} of intercultural competence, or more simply put: You cannot just read up on intercultural knowledge but you have to train intercultural competence like a skill.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* Is there a cognitive bias, which produces the impression that one is proficient, although one only knows the theory?
* What cognitive biases result in the impression that other cultures are less important, less complex, and already sufficiently known?
}}

Für die Bewertung von interkultureller Kompetenz werden insbesondere die Eigenschaften Ambiguitätstoleranz, Kontaktfähigkeit, Verhaltensflexibilität, Emotionskompetenz, Leistungsmotivation, Empathie und Polyzentrismus bewertet.

For the assessment of intercultural competence the attitudes and abilities [[w:ambiguity tolerance|ambiguity tolerance]], [[w:interpersonal skills|interpersonal skills]], behavioral flexibility, [[w:emotional competence|emotional competence]], [[w:Need for achievement|achievement motivation]], [[w:empathy|empathy]] and [[w:polycentrism|polycentrism]] are of particular importance.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* Which of these properties can be trained?
* How can you measure these properties?
* Can you measure or train the abilities of parents?
* Which of these options could be used as part of a parent education course, if they are usable at all?
}}

Don't worry if you cannot devise or implement the perfect measurement methods as pupils in middle school or at the beginning of high school.
The attempt is important and the considerations about the possibilities should be useful to reveal new perspectives for the parent education course.
You shouldn't be discouraged by the view &quot;we can't do this yet&quot;, but you should, of course, not assume that your measurement methodes will produce very precise results; that is possibly not relevant: Fantasy and creativity are what is demanded from the authors here.

Sri Lanka.

==What is the history of this language?==
It is believed that about the 5th century BC, settlers from north-eastern India reached the island of Sri Lanka.  This group of settlers is referred to as prince Vijaya and his entourage in the chronicle Mahavamsa.  These new settlers merged with the native Hela tribes known as Yakka, Naga who spoke Elu language, and a new nation called Sinhala came to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Model of culture ===

Cross-cultural researchers have devised various [[w:Cultural_dimensions|models of culture]] that describe cultural dimensions as important features of cultures, which vary between different cultures.
Models of culture are, for instance, important for {{/@|intercultural competence}}.
A cultural dimension that deserves the name describes an important aspect of a whole culture that is part of the culture and shapes the culture, especially in comparison to other cultures.
For the parent education course, however, the term culture shall be extended to include smaller groups up to {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultures}}.
The term cultural dimension is thus made more flexible and may allow interesting new interpretations.

The model of culture offered here does not correspond exactly to any of the scientific models of culture, but that is not important.
The point is that you can offer your own cultural dimensions to suit your own needs.
A [[w:youth culture|youth culture]] can have a different demand for cultural dimensions than the cultures of adults. 
Your family cultures can also have unknown dimensions and your school culture may not even exist yet.
If your school does not have a school culture the {{/@|class council can family council|class council}} could possibly decide a class culture.
A class culture can also provide a lowest common denominator for a class and allow smaller groups to build a more specific {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idioculture}} on top.

Less fundamental but also interesting are the [[w:Intercultural_competence#Typical_examples_of_cultural_differences|typical examples of cultural differences]] in the Wikipedia article about intercultural competence.

{{/Table 1}}
{{/Table 2}}
{{/Table 3}} &lt;!-- please do not fill table 3, pupils should be able to do some research here themselves --&gt; 


{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
What is missing in this table? Find your own cultural dimensions and insert them into the table.
* Is &quot;talkative or taciturn&quot; a cultural dimension?
* Is there a relationship between cultural dimensions and [[w:Trait theory|personality traits]]? 
}}

==== Test your youth culture ====

{{Rquote|right|The adolescents do neither conform with the so-called &quot;traditional&quot; values such as loyalty, sense of duty, etc.; nor have they fully set &quot;modern&quot; values in their place, which are supposedly more capable to support an individual self-actualization than the value orientation of older generations. The adolescents rather mix their own &quot;values cocktail&quot; from different values, which seem best suited for their individual plans for life.|[http://www.familienhandbuch.de/jugendforschung/jugend-heute/jugend-ohne-perspektive-alte-werte-und-neuer-generationenkonflikt Jugend ohne Perspektive? - &quot;Alte&quot; Werte und &quot;neuer&quot; Generationenkonflikt]|Mathias Albert}}

What is your youth culture? You can test your youth culture by extending the model of culture table with your own cultural dimensions, which apply to your own youth culture or youth cultures. You can then use the table as a questionnaire and use it to interview teenagers from your social environment.
A statistical analysis shows how your common youth culture looks like.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* How do you collect ideas for cultural dimensions best?
* How should the table be completed? Which information is needed on the respective cultural dimensions?
* How should the questionnaire be amended to allow the survey to be conducted without extensive explanations?
* Why could the youth culture be important for a parent education course?
}}

If the parent education course is meant to guide parents to better understand teenagers it can be important to explain the youth culture to those parents who do no yet have this understanding, particularly the aspects that are preferably criticized by parents.
A democratic education also means to respect the culture of others and to find compromises where possible.
Parents will possibly view some aspects of youth culture as a kind of [[w:counterculture|counter-culture]].

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Crystal_Clear_app_error.png|
This survey can be used as an exercise to rehearse techniques for surveys and evaluations.
The more important polls relate to families, education and mentoring.
As pupils you are, however, allowed to disagree with this view.
}}

==== Capitalism as a means to an end ====

{{Rquote|right|Especially from an economic perspective the insight has developed that growing material wealth in the developed countries above a certain level does not lead to increasing well-being.|Wissenschaftliche Bestandsaufnahme der Forschung zu &quot;Wohlbefinden von Eltern und Kindern&quot;|German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth}}

An error in the assessment of moral priorities, which in capitalism arises almost like an anti-pattern, is to assign the capitalist system a high priority and also to consider close personal relations and mutual support as an important priority, but to assign the common good only a lower priority.
A moral error that results from this perspective is that one would implicitly have to endorse a lower level of education of the general public in order to serve the purpose to attain and to preserve a capitalist advantage for one's chosen social environment. Trivially this is not a particularly moral position.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Japan road sign 206-L.svg|
* Where is the error in the assessment of moral priorities?
* Is the public interest more important than friends and acquaintances?
* Is the public interest more important than capitalism?
* If the error the evaluation as unchanging priorities?
}}

{{/@|Mentoring}} consequently constitutes insofar a higher moral level (or at least a refinement of moral evaluation) as the basis is a conscious decision that, while one doesn't have to promote a mentally disabled person to earn a medical degree, arbitrary third parties should have a right to a certain level of support.

Another important argumentation in relation to capitalism is that capitalism is a means to achieve an end.
If that means becomes and end by itself, as it can happen in a capitalist society, then the question of the actual purpose remains unanswered.
This open question is also evident in the behavior of capitalist organizations: The organizations respond to the orders of their customers, but do not always have own interests and goals beyond that. In that sense the efficient capitalist company is primarily controlled by external interests. 

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* Is it a purpose of capitalism to serve the common good?
* What is [[w:Corporate Social Responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility]]?
* What do parents know about Corporate Social Responsibility?
* Why is that important?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What to juggle with ==
To learn how to juggle, you will need three objects of suitable size, weight and hardness. Beanbags or hackey-sacks are optimal, but tennis balls or racquet balls and the like can fill the role in nicely. You may also wish to use mandarin oranges, rolled-up socks, newspaper balls or other similar objects instead.

== Where to juggle ==
The place where you juggle should be bright enough to allow you to see the balls clearly. Depending on the balls used, it may also be necessary to juggle in front on a bright wall (as is often the case with hackey-sacks). The place should be well ventilated and not too hot, but a direct breeze is ill-advised as it may make it harder to throw the balls accurately. It should also be tall enough to allow you to juggle freely without hitting the ceiling.

== Position ==
Stand up in a comfortable position in the middle of your juggling area and begin with step one!

      <comment>From [[Juggling]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The three ball cascade is the basic juggling style. If you have not done any juggling before this is what you should start with. You should NOT try doing a shower(where all the balls move in a circle with all the balls moving in the same direction. aka clockwise or counter-clockwise) until much further along in your juggling practice.

== Step one ==
Use one ball for this step. Take a ball in one hand. Now throw it to the other hand. The throwing hand should move in a semi-circle before releasing the ball in order to make the ball fly almost vertically. This is called a &quot;scoop&quot; and will help a lot in further steps.

You should aim to throw the ball in such a way that it falls directly into the other hand. Having to move the catching hand too much is not a good sign. The ball should travel in an arc, its top around the height of your eyes.

Do not look at the ball as it falls. You have to learn to control yourself and catch the ball without looking at it. If you do not learn to do so now, further steps will become very hard. Throw the ball softly and try and keep the flow of the throwing smooth.

Do not underestimate this step, as it is possibly the most important. Not knowing how to throw the balls nicely will result in trouble in the following steps.

== Step two ==
You will need two balls for this step. Take one ball in each hand and throw it directly upwards. Catch each ball with the hand that threw it. Alternate which ball you throw such that when the left ball is at the top of the arc, you throw the right ball and when the right is at the top, you throw the left one.

This process will help you achieve good rhythm for later. Apply the principles from step one - throwing the ball so you don't need to move the catching hand much, looking upwards instead of at the balls etc.

Try and make this step as automatic as possible. Listen to a few songs while performing it and throwing the balls to the rhythm. Try and listen to songs with different rhythm. Fast, slow, whichever you like.

== Step three ==
This is the step that makes what you are doing actually look like juggling. Take a ball in each hand. Now throw one ball to the other hand as in step one. When the ball is at the top of the arc (as in step two), throw the other ball to the first hand. The second ball should travel underneath the first one.

This step may seem a bit daunting, but it is just a combination of steps one and two. When practicing this step, you should train both hands equally. First, throw the left ball first and the right ball second. Then, throw the right ball first and the left ball second. After a while, you should be able to do this in a nice, circling movement.

Never be afraid of going back to previous steps just to recapture the rhythm or throw more accurately.

== Step four ==
When performing this step, you are actually already juggling. Take two balls in one hand and one ball in the other. Always begin with the hand with two balls. Repeat what you have been doing in step three, but when the second ball is at the top of the arc, throw the third ball to the opposite hand.

When you have done this step, you have made the first juggling circle. Actual juggling is just a series of these steps. Try and repeat these three passes until you feel you have perfected them. Throw the balls accurately, remember the rhythm when throwing and always try and catch the balls. It isn't a problem if they fall on the ground, but you need to be able to do at least three circles (with pauses after each circle) without them falling down before proceeding to step five.

Remember to practice this step with both hands equally. Left-right-left, then right-left-right. Music might help you with rhythm.

This step is the forerunner to juggling. As such, you might feel tempted to pass it quickly, but you should resist the urge and repeat it until you are comfortable with it.

== Step five ==
This is it, the last step of the way! This is the breakthrough step and the time needed to get the grip of it varies greatly from person to person. If you have thoroughly practiced the previous steps, however, it shouldn't be a problem.

Repeat step four, but instead of catching the third ball as it falls down, throw the first ball again and proceed right into the next circle. When you first do it, you might get caught off balance and you will drop all the balls. Don't worry, it's natural at this point! Repeat step four again. When you are comfortable, try and do two circles without pausing.

As you learn this step, you will realize the movements are becoming more and more natural. Feel the flow of the balls as they soar through the air. Enjoy yourself! You now know how to juggle!

== Troubleshooting ==
=== I cannot do more than 3 (or 4 or 5 etc.) throws ===
This is probably a mental problem. If this is happening to you, you need to make a point of throwing your balls whether or not you think you can catch them. Even if you drop them, throwing the balls will help you get past this mental block.

=== I throw my balls forward ===
(and in turn have to walk forward to keep up)

This is a common problem and can probably be fixed by juggling while facing a wall just close enough that you can extend your arms.

=== My balls collide in mid-air ===
To fix this problem you will have to work on your throws. Go back to step one and make sure you throw the ball correctly. Make sure that you are &quot;scooping&quot; your throws so that the ball flies almost completely vertically.

=== I still can't juggle. ===
Try this:  http://www.alightfingers.com/tuition/  This is a more gradual and supportive version of the above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After you have practiced the three ball cascade enough that you can do it comfortably, you are ready to learn your first juggling trick.

== Over the Top ==
The first trick that most people learn is &quot;over the top&quot;. This trick is just what it sounds like, instead of the normal cascade throw in which the ball travels under the previous one, you throw a ball over the top of the other one.

To begin with, practice the over the top throw with only one ball. Simply take the ball in your hand and &quot;scoop&quot; in a half circle towards the outside instead of the inside. When doing this you will probably want to move your hand further to the outside in order to make the throw more horizontal. When doing this you should throw the ball all the way from one side to the other whereas in the cascade you throw them from the middle to the outside.

Once you are comfortable with this try working it into a three ball cascade. Do not worry about it falling. Just throw it over the top of the other balls and resume your cascade.

== Jugglers' Tennis ==
Before you learn this trick you need to know &quot;over the top&quot;.

When doing &quot;juggler's tennis&quot; it may help if you have one different colored ball but it is definitely not necessary. The jugglers' tennis is when you do an &quot;over the top&quot; over third throw such that the same ball goes over the top every time you throw it. If you have a ball that is a different color than the other two that should be the one that goes over the top. This will help you to remember which ball you are supposed to throw over the top and lets you concentrate more on the technique.

== Half Shower ==
Before learning this trick you need to know &quot;over the top&quot;. &quot;jugglers' tennis&quot; will help but is not required.

In the &quot;half shower&quot; you throw ever other ball over the top such that the same hand always makes this throw. If you thoroughly practiced &quot;over the top&quot; and &quot;jugglers' tennis&quot; this should be fairly easy.

== Reverse Cascade ==
Before learning this trick you need to know all previous &quot;over the top&quot; tricks.

This trick is basically a cascade where you throw every ball over the top of the others. It is not, however, that simple. You see if you throw every ball with the over the top throw, you will have to continually throw them higher and higher until you cannot keep up. Instead, you must make your throws go from the outside to the middle. This will be hard at first but with practice will gradually become easier.

As soon as you have the new throw down you will want to work it into the cascade. You may have been starting with a normal cascade and working your way into the trick before, but with the reverse cascade you will have to go straight into it. You may not get it at first but keep at it. You will get it eventually and it is really fun once you do.

:{{Del}} Let's see... &quot;A possible definition of a miracle is that a miracle is something that negates a holon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_%28philosophy%29)&quot;. Even if we assumed it makes sense to use a Wikipedia reference like this, [[w:Holon (philosophy)]] has no mention of miracles. Then we have &quot;Many ideas behind the theories presented here are taken from A Course In Miracles&quot;, which clearly suggests both original research and annotations on a parent book. Conclusion: non-salvageable OR.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 

:{{Del}} I agree with the arguments above.  Removing the OR would remove all the text from the book, there is nothing to be saved. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:09, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

::{{Comment}} I just noticed the comment by the author on its discussion page, in which he states: &quot;This is a metaphorical book. Please do not take it too literally, that would not be appropriate. This book is an exercise, a poem.&quot;  I would say that means it is not a textbook.

: {{Del}} &quot;this site will test your belief in God and about God also your motives and thoughts.&quot; ''Test my belief in God?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will show two ways of making a program that can draw a Mandelbrot set where the iterations are towards ∞: a program where all is done from the ground, but which does nothing more than drawing a single picture, and a program where you can do all you desire (zoom, alter colouring and render as file), but where these facilities are handed over to another program, namely ''Ultra Fractal''.

==A single picture==

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictcomp1.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Mandelbrot set for &lt;math&gt;z^2 + 0.009/z + c&lt;/math&gt;]]Let us make a program that is as simple as possible: it draws a single picture, and does nothing more (when it has done its work it closes). It was originally written in assembly language, but here we write it in pseudo-code. It consists of two parts: the drawing procedure and the colour scale.

We draw a section of the Mandelbrot set for the family &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^2 + \frac{p}{z} + c \,&lt;/math&gt;, for p = 0.009. We let the size of the window be 800x600 pixels, and we imagine that the section has its lower left corner in the point with coordinates (ax, ay) and that is has width h. We have &lt;math&gt;f'(z) = 2z - \frac{p}{z^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;, so that the finite critical point we need, is solution to the equation &lt;math&gt;z^3 = p/2&lt;/math&gt;. We choose the real solution cri = &lt;math&gt;(p/2)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''The drawing procedure'''

:p = 0.009
:cri = &lt;math&gt;(p/2)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
:r = 1.0E200 (square of the bail-out radius)
:u = log(log(r))
:v = 1/log(2) (2 is the degree of the rational function)
:ax = -0.7028233689263 (x-coordinate of lower left corner)
:ay = 0.1142331238418  (y-coordinate of lower left corner)
:h = 0.0092906805859 (width of the section)
:g = h / 800
:m = 850 (maximum iteration number)
:thick = h * 0.0005 (thickness of the boundary)
:dens = 24.9 (density of the colours)
:disp = 432.0 (displacement of the colour scale)

for i = 0 to 799 do
:begin
::cx = ax + i * g (x-coordinate of pixel (i, j))
::for j = 0 to 599 do
:::begin
::::cy = ay + j * g (y-coordinate of pixel (i, j))
::::x = cri
::::y = 0
::::xd = 0
::::yd = 0
::::f = 0
::::n = 0
::::while (n &lt; m) and (f &lt; r) do
:::::begin
::::::n = n + 1
::::::x1 = x * x - y * y
::::::y1 = 2 * x * y
::::::f = x * x + y * y
::::::x2 = 2 * x - p * x1 / (f * f)
::::::y2 = 2 * y + p * y1 / (f * f)
::::::temp = xd
::::::xd = x2 * xd - y2 * yd + 1
::::::yd = x2 * yd + y2 * temp
::::::fd = xd * xd + yd * yd
::::::x = x1 + p * x / f + cx
::::::y = y1 - p * y / f + cy
::::::f = x * x + y * y
:::::end
::::if (n = m) or (log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; thick * sqrt(fd)) then
:::::setpixel(i, 599 - j, 0)
::::else
:::::begin
::::::s = n - v * (log(log(f)) - u)
::::::n = round(dens * s + disp) mod 720
::::::col = paletteRGB(col1[n], col2[n], col3[n])
::::::setpixel(i, 599 - j, col)
:::::end
:::end
:end

'''Explanation'''

We have set &lt;math&gt;c = cx + icy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z' = xd + iyd&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x1 + iy1 = (x + iy)^2&lt;/math&gt;, and we have used that &lt;math&gt;1/z = z^-/|z|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The successive calculation of the derivative ''z''' is &lt;math&gt;xd + iyd = (x2 + iy2) * (xd + iyd) + 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x2 + iy2 = 2 * (x + iy) - p * (x1 - iy1) / (f * f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;. The next point in the iteration is &lt;math&gt;x + iy = (x1 + iy1) + p * (x - iy) / f + (cx + icy)&lt;/math&gt;. The distance function is

:''log(&amp;#8730;f)*&amp;#8730;f/&amp;#8730;fd &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(= log(f)*&amp;#8730;f/(2*&amp;#8730;fd))''

for the last ''z''-value, here &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;fd = xd^2 + yd^2&lt;/math&gt;. The number in the interval [0, 1[ to be subtracted from the iteration number (in order to get the real iteration number), is &lt;math&gt;log(log(|z|)/log(r))/log(2) = v * (log(log(f)) - u)&lt;/math&gt;, for the last ''z'', here &lt;math&gt;v = 1/log(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u = log(log(r))&lt;/math&gt;.

paletteRGB(r, g, b) is the integer indexing the colour with RGB-values (r, g, b), 0 gives black. col, col2 and col3 are the arrays from 0 to 719 of integers from 0 to 255 constructed in the next section.

'''The colour scale'''

A colour is immediately (in the computer) given by its composition of the three primary colours red, green and blue, and their shares are measured in whole numbers between 0 and 255. This triple of numbers is the set of RGB values of the colour. The colours correspond accordingly to the entire points in a cube with side length 256, and we construct our cyclic colour scala by going regularly along an ellipse in this cube. An ellipse in the space is determined by:

::a centre with coordinates ''(a, b, c)''
::a major axe ''rmaj'' and a minor axe ''rmin''
::two angles angle ''g'' and ''h'' determining the direction of the plane of the ellipse
::an angle ''q'' determining the direction of the ellipse in this plane

:u = cos(g * pi / 180) * cos(h * pi / 180) {(u,v,w) is a unit vector orthogonal to the plane}
:v = cos(g * pi / 180) * sin(h * pi / 180)
:w = sin(g * pi / 180)
:x = -a {(x,y,z) is a vector ''in'' the plane}
:y = -b
:z = a * u / w + b * v / w
:e = sqrt(sqr(x) + sqr(y) + sqr(z))
:x1 = x / e {the unit vector corresponding to (x,y,z)}
:y1 = y / e
:z1 = z / e
:x2 = v * z1 - w * y1 {the unit vector in the plane orthogonal to (x1,y1,z1)}
:y2 = w * x1 - u * z1
:z2 = u * y1 - v * x1
:e = cos(q * pi / 180)
:f = sin(q * pi / 180)
:x1 = e * x1 + f * x2 {the unit vector in the plane in the direction of the angle q}
:y1 = e * y1 + f * y2
:z1 = e * z1 + f * z2
:x2 = v * z1 - w * y1 {the unit vector in the plane orthogonal to this direction}
:y2 = w * x1 - u * z1
:z2 = u * y1 - v * x1
:for i = 0 to 719 do
::begin
:::e = rmaj * cos(i * pi / 360)
:::f = rmin * sin(i * pi / 360)
:::col1[i] = round(a + e * x1 + f * x2) {the three coordinates of the point on the ellipse}
:::col2[i] = round(b + e * y1 + f * y2)
:::col3[i] = round(c + e * z1 + f * z2)
::end

In the picture we have: (a, b, c) = (176, 176, 176), rmaj = rmin = 88, g = 146, h = -32, q = 0.

==Ultra Fractal==

Ultra Fractal is a program for drawing fractals where the user to a great extent can write his own formula programs and where the main program performs all that is common for all the fractal procedures, that is, the procedure of going from pixel to pixel, zooming, colouring, production of a large picture as a file. Your effort is reduced to a minimum, and apart from pictures that cannot be drawn regularly from pixel to pixel - attractors and landscapes, for instance - you can do all you desire: non-complex functions, quaternions, ... You can operate directly with complex numbers.

First you should download a free trial-version of the program and learn how it works. Then you should see the article [http://www.juliasets.dk/UFP.htm Make attractive pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets with Ultra Fractal], and download the (free) programs from this site to be run with Ultra Fractal.

For the drawing two programs have to be combined: a formula program and a colouring program. In the formula program is a section called ''loop'', and when this loop has done its work, the number of iterations and the last value of the complex number ''z'' are transferred to the colouring program, which calculates the colour from these two numbers. However, Ultra fractal is designed to &quot;all&quot; types of fractals, and unfortunately the Julia and Mandelbrot sets do not quite fit into this form: for iterations towards cycles, the iteration has to be continued in order to find the order and the attraction of the cycle, and it is not the last value of ''z'' in the sequence we do use for the colour. Therefore we replace this loop by a fictive loop (which only runs one time) and perform all the operations in the section ''init''. This implies that we cannot use the default colouring program of Ultra Fractal, we must write a new colouring program.

Another thing you must be aware of, is that in Ultra Fractal the norm |z| of the complex number z is the '''square''' of its length: |z| = &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictcomp2.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Mandelbrot set for &lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + 0.26*z^4 + c&lt;/math&gt;]]We will show a program that draws the Mandelbrot set for the family &lt;math&gt;f(z) + c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial whose first two terms are zero, so that it begins with &lt;math&gt;z^2&lt;/math&gt; or a larger power of ''z'', because we then can take 0 as the finite critical point.

The two programs can be copied and inserted in an empty formula and colouring document, respectively. We have inserted the polynomial &lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + p*z^4 + c&lt;/math&gt; of degree 4, where p is a real parameter. The picture shows a section of the Mandelbrot set for p = 0.26.

'''The formula program'''

:Mandelbrot {
:global:
::float p = 0.26  ;parameter
::float deg = 4  ;degree of the polynomial
::float v = 1 / log(deg)
::float g = 10 * log(10)
::float r = exp(g)  ;square of the radius of the bail-out circle
::u = log(g)

::float h = 1 / (1500 * #magn * @width)  ;a very small real number

::complex z = 0  ;critical point

::complex z1 = 0
::float w = 0
::int n = 0

:::n = n + 1
:::z1 = z^2/2 + p*z^4
:::zd = ((z+h)^2/2 + p*(z+h)^4 - z1) * zd / h + 1
:::z = z1 + #pixel

:::w = -1
::else
:::w = n - v * (log(log(|z|)) - u)
::endif
: ;begin fictive loop
::z = 0
::n = 0
:loop:
::n = n + 1
::z = z + #pixel
::if n == 1
:::z = w

: ;end fictive loop

::maxiter = 100

:::caption = &quot;boundary&quot;
:::default = 1.0
::endparam
::param width
:::caption = &quot;width&quot;
:::default = 640
::endparam
:}

'''Explanation'''

We have set the square of the radius r of the bail-out circle to &lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, and set the thickness of the boundary to &quot;thick/(1000 * #magn)&quot;, so that it becomes thinner when we zoom in.

We have calculated the derivative &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(f(z+h) - f(z))/h&lt;/math&gt; for a small number h, namely &quot;h = 1/(1500*#magn*width)&quot;, where &quot;width&quot; is the width of the picture. The default value is the width of the window in pixels (here set to 640), but if you draw a large picture, you should enter the width of this.

The successive calculation of the derivative &lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1} = f'(z_k)z'_k + 1&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;zd = (f(z+h) - f(z)) * zd / h + 1&quot;. The next iteration &lt;math&gt;z_{k+1} = f(z_k) + c&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;z = f(z) + #pixel&quot;. The square of the distance estimation &lt;math&gt;log|z_k| * |z_k| / |z'_k|&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;sqr(log(|z|)) * |z| / |zd|&quot;. The number to be subtracted from the iteration number &lt;math&gt;log(log(|z_k|)/log(r))/log(deg)&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;v * (log(log(|z|)) - u)&quot;, where &quot;v = 1/log(deg)&quot; and &quot;u = log(log(r))&quot;.

The final complex number ''z'' (to be transferred to the colouring program), which here actually is real, is set to -1, when the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set or to the boundary, otherwise it is set to the real iteration number. It is transferred to the colouring program, which we have called ''Gradient'', as #z, and is here set equal to the real number s. When s is negative the colour is set to &quot;#solid&quot;, otherwise we multiply s by a number &quot;dens&quot; determining the density, and add to this number a number &quot;disp&quot; determining the displacement of the scale, and as we want this displacement to be a per cent, we divide the result by 100: &quot;u = (dens * s + disp) / 100&quot;. In Ultra Fractal the colours of the cyclic colour scales are indexed by the real numbers in the interval [0, 1[, and we let this number, &quot;#index&quot;, be the non-integral part of the number u: &quot;#index = u - trunc(u)&quot;.

'''The colouring program'''

:Gradient {
:final:
::float s = real(#z)
::float u = 0
::if s &lt; 0
::: #solid = true
::else
:::u = (@dens * s + @disp) / 100
::: #index = u - trunc(u)
::endif
:default:
::title = &quot;Gradient&quot;
::param disp
:::caption = &quot;displace&quot;
:::default = 0
::endparam
::param dens
:::caption = &quot;density&quot;
:::default = 1.0

Thanks for your work on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Flower Arrangement|Flower Arrangement]] honor.  Though I am pretty well versed in wild flower identification, flower arranging is a pretty foreign concept to me!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a simple XQuery program that will extract all the OWL classes from an OWL file that is coded using RDF.

== Method ==
We will start by just selecting all the classes in the file that have an name.  In this example the names are stored in the rdf:ID attribute of the class like the following:

   &lt;owl:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Wine&quot;&gt;

For our example we will use the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/wine.rdf wine ontology] Used in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/ W3C OWL Guide]:

Our XQuery will specifically get all the RDF tags with the &quot;owl:Class&quot; element in the file.

Here is a simple XQuery that returns all the Classes in the wine ontology.  To you this script you can load it into a collection such as
/db/apps/owl/views/classes.xq and the RDF data files can be loaded into /db/apps/owl/data

/db/apps/owl/views/classes.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

declare namespace xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare namespace rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;;
declare namespace rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
declare namespace owl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $title := 'List of OWL Classes'

let $data-collection := '/db/apps/owl/data'
let $file := request:get-parameter('file', 'wine.rdf')
let $file-path := concat($data-collection, '/', $file)

(: we only want classes that have an ID.  Other classes are not named classes. :)
let $classes := doc($file-path)//owl:Class[@rdf:ID]

(: sort the list :)
let $ordered-classes :=
   for $class in $classes
   order by $class/@rdf:ID
   return $class

return
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;{$title}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;file&gt;File Path: {$file-path}&lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Number of Classes = {count($classes)}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
      {for $class in $ordered-classes
         let $class-name := string($class/@rdf:ID)
         return
           &lt;li&gt;{$class-name}&lt;/li&gt;
      }
      &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Results ==

The results will be an HTML file with a ordered list:

&lt;pre&gt;
File Path: /db/org/syntactica/apps/owl/data/wine.rdf

Number of Classes = 74

   1. AlsatianWine
   2. AmericanWine
   3. Anjou
   4. Beaujolais
   5. Bordeaux
   6. Burgundy
   7. CabernetFranc
   8. CabernetSauvignon
   9. CaliforniaWine
  10. Chardonnay
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Other Tools ==
There are several other tools for working with OWL files that are very useful.  One is to list all of the properties in an OWL file or list all the properties of a class.  These reports can then be used to load the class or property into an XForms application for editing/versioning/workflow and approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Joypads are the SNES' means of input from the user. There can be up to four connected to the system, and there's support for special controllers, too ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES_Mouse mouse], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Scope Super Scope], etc).

'' '''NOTE''': This tutorial is a work-in-progress. I'm still relatively new to the SNES, so please feel free to correct any errors in this document.''

=Joypad Registers=

To start off, we'll list the registers that we're going to use:

{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|''Size''||''Address''||''Description''
|-
|Byte|| $4200|| Counter Enable
|-
|Byte|| $4212|| Status Register
|-
|Word|| $4218|| Joypad #1 Status
|-
|Word|| $421a|| Joypad #2 Status
|-
|Word|| $421c|| Joypad #3 Status
|-
|Word|| $421e|| Joypad #4 Status
|-
|Byte|| $4016|| Joypad #1 Old-Style Status
|-
|Byte|| $4017|| Joypad #2 Old-Style Status
|-
|}

Now, let's look at them in a bit more depth:

'''$4200 - Counter Enable'''
''n-vh---j''

This register is most likely a bit familiar to you. If you've done any prior SNES coding, you'll recognize that you've probably used this register to enable a VSync interrupt. For joypad input, we must make sure bit 0 (&quot;j&quot;) is set. This tells the SNES that we will be polling the other joypad registers.

'''$4212 - SNES Status Register'''
''vh-----j''

This register is used to see if certain data is ready to be polled from the SNES. In this case, we only care about bit 0 (&quot;j&quot;). If we poll $4212 and bit 0 is set, then we know that the other SNES joypad registers will contain relevant data. It's usually not so bad if this step is left out, though. In the algorithm I'll be showing later, this check is skipped, but this explanation still exists for completeness.

'''$4218/9 through $421e/f - Joypad Status Registers'''
''hi:bystudlr lo:axlriiii''

These are 16-bit registers that return the button and/or type states for each joypad connected to the SNES. $4218 and $4219 contain joypad 1's data, and joypad 2, 3, and 4 follow. The bits are laid out like this:

{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|'''Bit(s)'''||'''Description'''
|-
|''$4219/b/d/f''||''(hi)''
|-
|b||B Button
|-
|y||Y Button
|-
|s||Select Button
|-
|t||Start Button
|-
|u||Up D-Pad Button
|-
|d||Down D-Pad Button
|-
|l||Left D-Pad Button
|-
|r||Right D-Pad Button
|-

|''$4218/a/c/e''||''(lo)''
|-
|a||A Button
|-
|x||X Button
|-
|l||L Button
|-

Most of these are quite self-explanatory. If a corresponding button's bit is set, then that button is pressed. The only semi-confusing part of this is the mysterious &quot;iiii&quot; bits - these determine which kind of controller is connected to the port. Basically, if they read 0000, then it's a standard SNES controller. Otherwise, it's a custom controller type or corrupted data.

'''$4016 and $4017 - Joypad 1 and 2 Old-Style Status'''

For these, you'll notice I left out the specific bits of each register. Basically, these work just like reading states from NES. Because of this, I think it's redundant to include that information here, except that bit 0 of $4200 must be clear to do use them this way. These registers can still be useful, though. If you write 0 to $4016, then these two registers can be used to check if joypads 1 and 2 are connected. After writing the 0 (and you only need to write to $4016, not both), reading from the registers will return 0 if not connected, and something else if connected.

== Welcome to MakerFairePedia 2010! ==

:''The online [[w:Maker Faire|Maker Faire]] encyclopedia that theoretically anyone can edit.''

You may have received a [[/Handouts|handout card paper form]] to help write a mini-encyclopedia about the exhibits at this year's Maker Faire.  Check the list of exhibits already in MakerFairePedia below. You may review an article for an exhibit you want to write about and see if it's as complete as you want it to be.

When you are ready to create a new article, replace &quot;ExhibitName&quot; with the name of the exhibit you are writing about in the box below. For example, if you are writing an article about a Fire Machine, use something like &quot;MakerFairePedia/Fire Machine&quot; in the box below; then click the button.

You may have received a card paper handout [[:File:MakerFairePedia.pdf|(pdf)]] for taking notes like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #f9f9f9; line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;
:MakerFairePedia Form: fill in and return to the Wikimedia booth and/or &lt;tt&gt;[[MakerFairePedia|httр://3.ly/makerfairepedia]]&lt;/tt&gt;



:Exhibit name ___________________________ Your name (optional) ____________________________

:Description: (write a description of the exhibit as objectively, without bias or opinion, as possible)






:Maker(s): (write the names and contact information of the Maker(s) here)




:Impressions: (What did you like best about the exhibit?)




:External links: (any URLs about the exhibit)



&lt;/div&gt;


Check the list of exhibits already in [[MakerFairePedia]] and use the card to take notes about a new exhibit.  Or, review an article for an exhibit you want to write about and see if it's as complete as you want it to be.  Then use the card to take notes so you can use the button on [[MakerFairePedia]] to create or edit an existing exhibit's article.

{{tl|Music}} renders Western music notation of various types into Wikibooks and improves cross-browser support for music symbols.

==Accidentals==
The template correctly renders Unicode sharps ({{music|sharp}}), flats ({{music|flat}}), and natural signs ({{music|natural}}) in Internet Explorer which would otherwise display empty squares unless a full Unicode font is chosen in its Preferences. The choice of fonts also improves the rendering in other browsers on [[Microsoft Windows]] such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]. See the tables below to compare the results in your current browser. The template makes use of SVG to display double flat ({{music|doubleflat}}), double sharp ({{music|doublesharp}}), and microtonal signs since the corresponding Unicode characters are not widely supported.

Some browsers support &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2669;&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#x2669;) and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x266a;&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#x266a;) for quarter and eighth notes, but since the display is often ugly and does not match any of the other (non-supported) notes and rests, this template does not use these characters.

;Sample text
In place of the single whole note ({{music|semibreve}}), Chopin writes {{music|eighthrest}} {{music|halfnote}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|eighth}}, completely changing the profile of the music.

==Clefs==

Note that there is no graphical distinction between treble clef and G-clef; alto clef, tenor clef and C-clef; bass clef and F-clef. The names preserve a difference in meaning and make the caption text (for screen readers) different.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beside the obvious weight lifting aspect, some regard a proper diet to be as, if not more important. A traditional bodybuilder's diet will always include a high amount of ''Protein'' (current research suggests 25-30% of calorie intake [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15107010&amp;dopt=Abstract]), Carbohydrates, usually complex (rather than simple sugars) to provide them with energy to complete their workout, and go about their daily lives. Lastly, fats. The misconception about fats is that &quot;all fats&quot; make you gain body fat, whilst this is not true. There are three types of fatty acids: saturated, trans, and unsaturated. They each contain 9 calories per gram, whilst Carbohydrates and Protein have 4 calories per gram.

* Saturated fats: They are definable because they are solids at room temperature, like the fat on bacon.
* Unsaturated fats: These are &quot;useful&quot; fats that can be broken down into subcategories monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, and include the popular Omega 3 &amp; 6 fats. They are usually found in liquid form, particularly in fish. They are essential to every diet.
* Trans-fats: These are so named due to how they look structurally. From a chemistry perspective, there is a cis formation and a trans formation for a fatty acid chain. This trans formation is produced when hydrogen is added to an unsaturated fat (an oil) which causes it to solidify. These fats are solid at room temperature and are generally found in fried foods, some margarines, processed red meats, and processed foods of all types. They are listed on food labels as 'partially hydrogenated' oil. They are used by many fast food chains because they don't smoke when heated. They are generally considered a health hazard.

Depending on whether a bodybuilder is &quot;'''cutting'''&quot; or &quot;'''bulking'''&quot;, they will either try to burn more calories than they consume, or, if bulking, consume more &quot;useful&quot; calories (that is, protein) than they burn.

== Crime Fighting in The United States ==

=== Overview of ''The System'' ===
Crime Fighting is often seen as the main mission of law enforcement professionals. Professional Crime Fighting Science is often called ''Criminal Justice''. Criminal Justice is looked at as a system. That system includes the police, courts and corrections. The police deal with crime, crime control, arrest and bookings. The courts deal with charging the defendants. The courts determine if the suspect has committed a misdemeanor, an ordinance violation, or a felony. It may file an information or an indictment. An arrest warrant may be issued by the court in order that the police may arrest a suspect. 

There are a variety of pretrial stages that a defendant may go through. He may have an initial appearance, an arraignment, bail is set, and a preliminary hearing may occur. The defendant may have a bench trial or a jury trial. They may participate in plea bargaining or simply plead guilty and receive their sentence. 

The defendant then becomes part of the correctional system where he may receive probation, incarceration, or parole. There are a number of other alternate sentences that he may receive.

=== Paradigms ===
There are two basic models of the criminal justice system. The first, the Crime Control Model, reflects traditional conservative values. In this model the control of criminal behavior is the most important function of criminal justice.

The second, the Due Process Model, embodies traditional liberal values. In this model, the principal goal of criminal justice is at least as much to protect the innocent as it is to convict the guilty.

=== The Media ===
The media tends to portray crime and criminality in an often inaccurate fashion.  Alarmist and extravagant stories tend to increase viewer ratings, while concise and accurate statistics tend to bore people to tears.  One must remember that what the media shows is not always the truth, but it is certainly entertainment and information.  The problem is, the media actually influences the way that the public views crime and the response to crime.

== ''Criminal Justice'' as Institution of Social Control ==
The majority of Americans believe that criminal justice involves fighting crime and that law enforcement is the only institution with that responsibility. Identify as many institutions as you can that are involved in the societal effort of social control. Use your word processor to create a list of these institutions.  Identify how each of these agencies helps to fight crime.  

Once you have created a word processed document that lists out institutions of social control and how they help to fight against crime, you are ready to be exposed to some new concepts.  Institutions of Social Control use various definitions to express their perception of and reaction to crime.  From these definitions, we derive our definitions of crime.  There are social definitions of crime and there are legal definition of crime. 

An example social definition of crime is behavior that violates the norms of society—or, more simply, antisocial behavior.  It is not the behavior that defines the crime; it is society's reaction toward that behavior that defines it as a crime.  The legal definition of crime is established by official action from a legislative group such as Congress, a state Legislature, or a Municipal Council.  The legal definition of crime can be summed up as ''the intentional violation of the criminal law or penal code, committed without defense or excuse and penalized by the state''.  A more comprehensive definition of crime can be found in the Core Vocabulary For Criminal Justice Professionals (Core Vocabulary For Criminal Justice Professionals, Stough, 2005).  

=== Crime Is An Elementary Issue ===
Now that the definitions of crime have been discussed, the essential elements 
of a crime come to hand.  What are the elements of a crime?  How are they defined?  For a crime to have occurred the following seven essential elements must be present:  

: *Actus Reus 
: *Mens Rea 
: *Harm 
: *Causation 
: *Concurrence
: *Legality
: *Punishment    

In more advanced Crime Fighting Science courses, such as CRIJ 1310 [Fundamentals of Criminal Law], I present other elements, until you have learned all twelve.  For now, though, these seven elements will suffice.

=== Getting Out From Under It All ===
Having informed the you of the seven essential elements of a crime, this conversation now turns to a discussion of Legal defenses for criminal responsibility.  Legal defenses for criminal culpability include age, insanity, mental defect, irresistible-impulse, entrapment, necessity, and others. In some cases, criminal behavior is defined in terms such as ''mala in sel'', and ''mala prohibita''.  That is, they are evil acts in and of themselves, or they are behavior that society simply does not wish to experience.  

== Measuring Up... And Down ==
Going hand in hand with this discussion of what crime is and how one can defend against criminal culpability, is the issue of the amount of crime that is actually occurring.  The measurement of crime is always crucial for the criminal justice professional.  Let us take a moment to consider crime statistics.  Statistics are numbers.  They are a way to simply complex observations into clear, numeric and graphic representations that can be easily interpreted by an audience.  Crime Statistics are numeric and graphical representations of the amounts and types of crimes that have, are, and will in the future probably occur.  There are many official agencies, bureaus, and organizations who spend their days and nights constructing huge data sets, statistical reports, and publications that are based on those reports, all for the express purpose of informing us about crime and its characteristics in our society.  Unfortunately, however, not all crimes are accounted for in those statistical reports.  Why is that?  

=== Dark Shadows And The Crime That Hide In Them ===
The ''&quot;Dark Figure of Crime&quot;'' explains this problem.  The Dark Figure of Crime is the amount of criminal behavior that goes unreported or undetected by Society, the Criminal Justice System, and those who are responsible for collecting and analyzing crime statistics.  The collection, use, and reporting of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report's [UCR] crime data demonstrates the United States' attempt to resolve the issue of ''The Dark Figure''.  Incentives, Fines, Penalties, and the use of specially trained Crime Statisticians encourage compliance with the rules and regulations of the Uniform Crime Reporting System as outlined by the [http://web.archive.org/20050325205547/www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf Federal Bureau of Investigations Uniform Crime Reporting System Handbook].  [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm Crime Rates] are defined with some easily understood examples.  The [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm National Incident-based Reporting System (NIBRS)] provides the methodology and methods for recording and reporting crime data to the Government of The United States.  The NIBRS is a part of the [http://www.fbi.gov Federal Bureau of Investigations].  

Can you explain how crime statistics are gathered and used?  Why is it important for you to learn how to gather and use crime statistics?  The answers to these questions often point to future career success in criminal justice.   

=== Casting Light Into The Shadows ===
Crime happens every day 50% of people live and die.
One important tool that is used in filling in the gaps made by the Dark Figure of Crime is the [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS/ National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)]. This is a source of crime statistics based on interviews in which respondents are asked whether they have been victims of any of the FBI’s [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm Index Offenses] or other crimes during the past six months. The NCVS is a great way to fill the blank spots caused by the Dark Figure of Crime because it provides citizens with a way to report crimes which they would not otherwise have reported.  Self-reporting surveys useful alternatives methods of filling the Dark Figure's void, augmenting the Official Reporting Systems used by Crime Fighting Agencies across America.

== Concluding With Fear ==
Well, I am going to bring this particular chapter to an end with a discussion of the cost of crime from a little bit different perspective.  Fear of crime and the characteristics of the victims of crime are weighed heavier in this discussion.  The general concept is that more than money is at issue when one is examining the concept of Costs of Crime.  

Being victimized by crime leaves people feeling vulnerable, invaded, and at a loss for words fit to describe the hurt caused by such a violent taking of ''something'' from them.  Victims seldom feel safe in their homes after being victimized.  For that matter, they do not feel safe ''out of their homes'' either.  Stereos and cars and refrigerators can be replaced.  However, virginity, sense of self worth, and ability to trust are almost always impossible to replace.  That is where the real cost of crime is measured.  Or at least, that is how I see things.  

What do you think?  What should be included in a discussion of the costs of crime?  Write down a list of the items that you would use to measure the costs of crime.  Use your word processor to develop this list, so that you can send me a copy when you are finished with it.  

Meanwhile, I am finished with this particular lecture.  I hope that you have gained something from reading this material.  It is my goal to help you to learn about Crime Fighting from the perspective that ''you are the one who does the fighting''.  Let me know how I am doing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Tools===

The Tools menu is probably the most used panel in Flash. In it are the tools needed to  
manipulate items on the stage. It can also be used to do actions on the timeline.

[[Image:Flash_toolbar.png|right]]

Here are the main tools and their uses;

* Selection Tool ('''v''') - Selecting whole objects and moving them.
* Subselection Tool - Selecting partial objects.
* Line Tool - Drawing straight lines.
* Lasso Tool - Selecting irregular shaped pieces of an object
* Pen Tool - Drawing non-straight and curved lines. 
* Text Tool ('''t''') - Inputting a textbox onto the stage.
* Oval Tool - Drawing oval and circle shapes. (Drag + Holding Shift = Circles)
* Shape Tool - By default draws rectangles. (Drag + Holding Shift = Squares)
* Pencil Tool - Free drawing thin lines. 
* Brush Tool- Free drawing brush shapes.
* Free Transform - Scale, rotate, and skew an object.
* Fill Transform - Distort the gradient fill of an object.
* Stroke Tool - Change the color and size of a stroke.
* Fill Tool - Change the color of a fill.
* Eyedropper - Sample a color from the stage.
* Eraser - Use a brush to erase parts of an object.
* Hand Tool - Move the stage around if it is not all visible.
* Zoom - Zoom in or out.

===Properties Panel===

The properties panel is used to modify the characteristics of pre-existing objects on stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Motion Tweening is an easy method of animating an Object on the Stage, using the Timeline. Motion Tweening can only be performed on a Graphic, a Button or a Movie Clip.

For example, place an Object on the stage. This, by default, will create a Keyframe in frame 1 of the Timelime. Right click on the Keyframe in the Timeline and select ''Copy KeyFrame'' from the menu. Now right click on a frame further along the timeline and select ''Paste Frames''. You will see your Object appear in the same position on the Stage, and the frames between your two keyframes will have turned grey. 

Making sure that your second Keyframe is selected (a red line should be over it in the Timeline - if not just click on it with the left hand mouse button), move your object to somewhere else on the Stage by clicking and dragging it.

You can now create your Motion Tween. Right-click the Timeline anywhere between your two Keyframes and select ''Create Motion Tween''. The frames will turn purple and a thin back arrow will point from the first Keyframe to the second.

You can test your animation by pressing CTRL + Enter. You should see your object move smoothly from its first position to its final position.

Note that attempting to tween more than one object on the same layer doesn't often work very well. If you need to do this, it's probably best to put the objects on separate layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shape tweens are an easy way of changing shape of an object on the stage.

First, place an object such as a circle or square on the stage. The first frame should turn gray to show that there is an object on the stage. Then, right-click a frame later in the timeline and select 'insert keyframe', or just hit F6. The frames between the first frame and the keyframe should turn gray.

Click on the second keyframe to select it, and use the selection tool (the black arrow), or the free transform tool (the white box with a black border and small black squares on the side) to change the shape of your object on the stage.

To create the shape tween, select a frame between the two keyframes. In the properties panel, there is a drop-down menu next to the word 'tween'. Select 'shape' from the drop-down menu, and the frames between the two keyframes turn solid green with a long, solid line ending in an arrow.

To preview your animation, press Ctrl+Enter, or hit F12 for a more accurate HTML preview of what your animation will look like.

Note that you ''cannot'' tween an object unless it is a vector. To turn a non-vector object into a vector, use the Modify &gt; Break Apart command. 

You can use &quot;hints&quot; to control your tween. To add a hint, go to Modify &gt; Shape &gt; Add Shape Hint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ActionScript is an ECMAScript-based programming language used for scripting Adobe Flash movies and applications. Since both ActionScript and JavaScript are based on the same syntax, fluency in one translates easily to the other. However, while JavaScript's DOM is browser window-, document- and form-centric, the ActionScript DOM is movie-centric, which may include animations, audio, text and event handling.

Each action must be in a keyframe.

It's a good design strategy to keep all your actions on a separate layer named &quot;Actions&quot; or something similar.

To make a button that, when clicked, loads a [[w:Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]], right-click the button's instance, and select &quot;Actions&quot; from the menu. Then, enter this code:
 on( release )
 {
   getURL( &quot;&lt;URI&gt;&quot;, [&quot;&lt;target&gt;&quot;], [&quot;&lt;method&gt;&quot;] )
 }
where &quot;target&quot; refers to a window type (e.g. &quot;_blank&quot; for a new window).

One commonly used ActionScript function is gotoAndPlay. It takes the form gotoAndPlay( &lt;frame&gt; ). When run, it will move the player to that frame and resume play. For example, gotoAndPlay( 5 ) will move to frame 5 and resume playing, and gotoAndPlay( &quot;menu&quot; ) will go to the frame named &quot;menu&quot; and resume playing.

A similar function is gotoAndStop( &lt;frame&gt; ), which goes to the frame referenced but does ''not'' resume playing.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is intended to be used in a list in the page itself, rather than in a navigation template like [[Template:Navbox]]. Based on [[Template:Reflist]], but different in that the text to be displayed is manually created rather than a list of references.

=== Usage ===

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;columns-list|''number of columns''|
 ''text (usually a list)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note: multiple columns currently render properly only in [[Mozilla Firefox]] and other Gecko-based browsers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-11-24|date=2005-12-30|title=CSS3 Multi-Column Thriller|url=http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css3_multi-column_thriller.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Safari 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.css3.info/preview/multi-column-layout.html |title=Multi-column layout in Safari 3 and Firefox |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the feature is included in [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]] so it should work for a larger number of browsers in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/|title=CSS3 module: Multi-column layout|publisher=W3C|date=2005-12-15|accessdate=2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer does not currently support the column selector and version 8 is not scheduled to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc351024(VS.85).aspx#multicolumn |title=CSS Compatibility and Internet Explorer: Multi-column Layout |work=Microsoft Developer Network |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the number of columns is omitted, two columns will be used.

==== Example ====

An example would be

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{columns-list|2|
  * George Washington
  * John Adams
  * Thomas Jefferson
  * James Madison
  * James Monroe
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which would render as

&lt;!-- Substituted {{columns-list}} to prevent possible loop --&gt;&lt;div {{#if: 2| style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; -webkit-column-count:2; column-count:2 }};&quot;&gt;
* George Washington
* John Adams
* Thomas Jefferson
* James Madison
* James Monroe
&lt;/div&gt;


CSS styles can also be added after the number of columns. For example
  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{columns-list|2&lt;/nowiki&gt;''';width:400px;font-style:italic'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|
  * New York, I Love You
  * Hōtai Club
  * The Kon Ichikawa Story
  * Rainbow Song
  * Hana &amp; Alice]]
  * All About Lily Chou-Chou
  * April Story
  * Swallowtail Butterfly
  * Picnic
  * Fried Dragon Fish
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which would render as

&lt;div {{#if: 2| style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; -webkit-column-count:2; column-count:2; width:400px; font-style:italic }};&quot;&gt;
  * New York, I Love You
  * Hōtai Club
  * The Kon Ichikawa Story
  * Rainbow Song
  * Hana &amp; Alice]]
  * All About Lily Chou-Chou
  * April Story
  * Swallowtail Butterfly
  * Picnic
  * Fried Dragon Fish
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(This is the documentation for: {{PAGENAME}}.)&lt;/center&gt;

{{#switch:{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}
| col-2 = The [[Template:Col-2]] sets column width for each of 2 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-2 |width=40%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-3 = The [[Template:Col-3]] sets column width for each of 3 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-3 |width=25%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-4 = The [[Template:Col-4]] sets column width for each of 4 columns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-5 = The [[Template:Col-5]] sets column width for each of 5 columns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-6 = The [[Template:Col-6]] sets column width for each of 6 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-6 |width=20%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-start=The [[Template:Col-start]] begins a wikitable (same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}}
The {{tl|col-begin}}, {{tl|col-break}} and {{tl|col-end}} templates control columns of text on a page:
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - starts a table (followed by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for 1st column)
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - triggers the start of each column
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - ends the multi-column table.
The widths of columns can be specified by using various additional codes. See below for examples.

==Usage==
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin|width=70%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start table with width.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break|width=66%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start column-1 as 66% wide.
:: This is text in col-1.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break|width=33%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start column-2 as 33% wide.
:: Text column-2.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The table will have 2 columns, with column 1 twice (2x) the width of column 2.

A border of 2px (1px width on each side) corresponds to a 5%. Therefore, with a 2px border the width needs to be 95% for the table to fit within the screen. Since it's possible that some tables might not have a border, correction on the individual page could be made after substitution. Another way to create a two column table is like this:

{|
|
&lt;pre&gt;
{{col-begin|width=95%}}
|-
| 
Left column
|
Right column
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

      <comment>/* Lack of Awareness of flaws in 'standard' Renderings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Julia and Mandlebrot sets broke new ground in 1980s==
The Julia and Mandelbrot sets were the first fractals that really amazed the world when they appeared in the 1980s. These pictures displayed patterns that differed entirely from anything previously known and beyond anyone's imagination.  They could furthermore possess real beauty. The hitherto known fractal patterns were sets that had more or less interesting mathematical properties, and when they could be visualized, they could exhibit thought-provoking shapes, but they were not as impressive as the new types.

==Popularity of Fractal Art==
Because of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets - not least the simplicity of the software for drawing them - the concept of fractal became very popular.  This concept has since become extremely widespread leading on to many varieties of ''fractal art''. This development has revealed an extreme variation in possible patterns.  Pictures and animations have been made of great artistic value or displaying an elaborate piece of mathematical work. However, all the serious work has been on other things than improving the basic presentation of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Pictures of fractal sets in their &quot;pure&quot; form, without artistic elaboration, do not seem to appeal to people as much today as they did in the 1980's and work on improving the basics has slid into the background.  

==Lack of Awareness of flaws in 'standard' Renderings==
Until early 2000 there was little or no progress as regards the basic drawing technique. Until 2003 not a single picture had been made where the boundary was drawn, apart from some pictures of the usual Mandelbrot set and its Julia sets&lt;ref&gt;Boundary set renderings, [http://www.juliasets.dk/Fractals.htm juliasets.dk] (started 2003 and completed 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Also the colouring based on the real iteration number only really works when the cycle is a fixed point, and even there leads to avoidable 'banding' effects, yet this colouring is in almost universal use, even when the cycle is not a fixed point. Furthermore, until early 2000, not a single Mandelbrot set had been constructed from two finite and different critical points.&lt;!--Citation needed for last point, or needs rewording--&gt;
&lt;gallery widths=350px heights=250px&gt;
Image:Juliasetsdkpostex1.jpg|Mandelbrot set constructed from one point that is not a critical point; rendered without boundary and with jumps in the colouring
Image:Juliasetsdkpostex2.jpg|Mandelbrot set constructed using two different critical points; shows boundary in the upper half part and continuous colouring
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The two images above show the opportunity for a more mathematically correct and more aesthetically pleasing way to render fractals than the method commonly used.  The right hand image shows the boundary correctly and it does not exhibit the banding effects.  Can this opportunity for improvement really be true? Can it be true, that twenty years after the Julia and Mandelbrot sets first saw the light of day, only now are technically perfect pictures beginning to turn up? 

===A possible explanation===

The most influential book about Mandelbrot and Julia sets is probably Peitgen &amp; Richter: ''The Beauty of Fractals'' from 1986. In this book  you can see the first ''real'' pictures of the Mandelbrot set, because they were drawn by distance estimation and in black-and-white. Mandelbrot saw exciting patterns when he zoomed down into his set - stellate patterns of logarithmic spirals and uncanny and &quot;hieroglyphical&quot; reduced-size versions of the Julia sets - but he only see all this, because his maximum iteration number was low. The right hand picture below, with boundary and maximum iteration number 10,000 shows how the Mandlebrot set should look. The left picture is less mathematically precise, using 1,000 iterations, and is not calculating the boundary.  If the left picture were drawn with the same maximum iteration number of 10,000, but still without the boundary calculation, we would only have seen the mini-mandelbrot visible in the centre of the right image.  The other detail would be 'too fine' to see.  

&lt;gallery widths=350px heights=250px&gt;
Image:Juliasetsdkpictpost2.jpg|Without boundary calculation and with max iteration number 1,000
Image:Juliasetsdkpictpost1.jpg|With boundary calculation and with max iteration number 10,000
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Misconceptions from a Flawed Example Program===
''The Beauty of Fractals'' gives an almost correct computer program for the distance estimation shown in the right image.  A possible reason that that method did not gain ground is that the procedure in this program is seriously flawed: The calculation of &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; is performed (and completed) before the calculation of &lt;math&gt;z'_k&lt;/math&gt;, and not after as it ought to be (&lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; uses &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt;, not &lt;math&gt;z_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;). For the successive calculation of &lt;math&gt;z'_k&lt;/math&gt;, we must know &lt;math&gt;f'(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; (which in this case is 2&lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt;).  In order to avoid the calculation of &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; (''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ...) again, this sequence is saved in an array. Using this array, &lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1} = 2z_kz'_k + 1&lt;/math&gt; is calculated up to the last iteration number, and it is stated that overflow can occur.  If overflow occurs the point is regarded as belonging to the boundary (the bail-out condition).  If overflow does not occur, the calculation of the distance can be performed. Apart from it being untrue that overflow can occur, the method makes use of an unnecessary storing and repetition of the iteration, making it unnecessarily slower and less attractive.  The following remark in the book is nor inviting either: &quot;It turns out that the images depend very sensitively on the various choices&quot; (bail-out radius, maximum iteration number, overflow, thickness of the boundary and blow-up factor). Is it this nonsense that has got people to lose all desire for using and generalizing the method?

== What are exponents? ==
''Exponents'' are a shorthand used for repeated multiplication.  Remember that when you were first introduced to multiplication it was as a shorthand for repeated addition.  For example, you learned that: 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5.  The expression &quot;4 &amp;times; &quot; told us how many times we needed to add. Exponents are the same type of shorthand for multiplication. Exponents are written in superscript (that is, a smaller number written above) after a regular-sized number. 

For example: 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 = 8. The number in larger font is called the base. The number in superscript is called the exponent.  The exponent tells us how many times the base is multiplied by itself. In this example, 2 is called the base and 3 is called the exponent.

The expression 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is read aloud as &quot;2 raised to the third power&quot;, or simply &quot;2 cubed&quot;.

Here are some other examples:

6 &amp;times; 6 = 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;six times six is ''six raised to the second power''&quot; or more simply &quot;six times six is ''six squared''&quot;.) &lt;br&gt;
7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 = 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;seven times seven times seven times seven equals ''seven raised to the fourth power''&quot;.  There are no alternate expression for  ''raised to the fourth power''.  It is only the second and third powers that usually get abbreviated because they come up more often.  When it is clear what is being talked about, people often drop the words &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;power&quot; and might simply say &quot;''seven to the fourth''&quot;.)

== Basic Rules of Exponents ==

&lt;u&gt;'''Multiplying Powers with the Same Base'''&lt;/u&gt;
     

&lt;math&gt;a^{n} \cdot a^{m}=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; means that you have &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; a factor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times.  If you add &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; more factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; then you have &lt;math&gt;n+m&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.


'''&lt;u&gt;Dividing Powers with the Same Base&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^{n}}{a^{m}}= \frac{\overbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot ... \cdot a}^\text{n factors of a}}{\underbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot ... \cdot a}_\text{m factors of a}}=a^{n-m}&lt;/math&gt;


In the same way that &lt;math&gt;a^{n} \cdot a^{m}=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt; because you are adding on factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, dividing is taking away factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  If you have m factors of a in the denominator, then you can cross out m factors from the numerator.  If there were n factors in the numerator, now you have n-m factors in the numerator.



'''&lt;u&gt;Raising a Power to a Power&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt; (a^n)^{m}=a^{n \cdot m}&lt;/math&gt;

If you think about an exponent as telling you that you have so many factors of the base, then &lt;math&gt;(a^n)^m&lt;/math&gt; means that you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have m groups of &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and each one of those has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have &lt;math&gt;n \cdot m&lt;/math&gt; groups of a, or &lt;math&gt;a^{n \cdot m}&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Products raised to powers&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;(ab)^n = a^n b^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

You can multiply numbers in any order you please.  Instead of multiplying together n factors equal to ''ab'', you could multiply all of the ''a'' 's together, multiply all the ''b'' 's together, then finish by multiplying &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;



'''&lt;u&gt;Quotients raised to powers&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{n}=\frac{a^n}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;

You can raise a fraction to a power by raising both the numerator and the denominator to the power.


'''&lt;u&gt;Any Nonzero number Raised to the Zero Power Is One&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;a \ne 0 \implies a^{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This all means that as long as the base is not zero, when you have an exponent of zero, the expression is always equal to 1.  

&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{a^n}{a^n} = a^{n - n} = a^0 = 1 \ ,\ a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined.


'''&lt;u&gt;Negative Exponents&lt;/u&gt;'''

A negative sign on an exponent means that you need to take the reciprocal of the base, then make the exponent positive.

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{-n}=\left( \frac{b}{a} \right)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples of Basic Rules of Exponents ==

&lt;u&gt;'''Multiplying Powers with the Same Base'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3^{4} \cdot 3^{2}= (3 \cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot3) \cdot (3\cdot3)=3 \cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot3 \cdot 3\cdot3=3^{6}&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Dividing Powers with the Same Base&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Subtract the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{5^{7}}{5^{4}}= \frac{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}=\frac{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{1}=5^{3}&lt;/math&gt;



'''&lt;u&gt;Raising a Power to a Power&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(4^{3})^{2}=4^{3} \cdot 4^{3} = (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4) \cdot (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4)=4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4=4^{6}&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Any Nonzero number Raised to the Zero Power Is One&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;2^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;109^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-92^{0}=-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-92)^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Exponent Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Exponent Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

===Scientific Notation===
Scientific notation makes use of exponents. It is often used for very large or very small numbers. It's easier to write 1,574,000,000,000,000 as 1.574 * 10^15. To convert from regular notation to scientific notation, find the leftmost nonzero digit. Count how many places away it is from the ''ones'' digit. This is the exponent for 10. If the digit was on the right of the ones digit, the exponent will be negative. If it ''was'' the ones digit, the exponent will be zero. Then, move the decimal place of the original number so that exactly one nonzero digit is on the left. Write down this new number and * 10^(exponent). You're done!

==Mathematical Insights==
1. ''Motivation for the negative exponent rule'': 

Since positive exponents are defined by repeated multiplication, see if you can show that if &lt;math&gt;a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a^b a^c = a^{b + c}&lt;/math&gt; for all b and c.  Can you think of a different meaning for a negative exponent?  Would the operators + and - still have the same meaning?

2. ''Motivation for the non-definition of &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;'':

Try to define &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;.  A good definition would ensure that &lt;math&gt; a^b a^c = a^{b + c}&lt;/math&gt;.  Show that there is no good definition.  (You may find it useful that it is impossible to define 1/0 consistently -- why?)  Read the article [[w:Zero|zero]]. What happened in world history as people moved from the Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals?

3. ''The importance of the product rule'':

Use examples to show that &lt;math&gt;b^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{(a^b)}^c = a^{bc}&lt;/math&gt; are consequences of the product rule.

4. ''Fractional powers'':

What would be a sensible definition of &lt;math&gt;a^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;?  &lt;math&gt; a^{m/n} &lt;/math&gt;?

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The Java platform Event Model is the basis for event-driven programming on the Java platform.

==Event-driven programming==
No matter what the [[w:programming language|programming language]] or [[w:Programming paradigm|paradigm]] you are using, chances are that you will eventually run into a situation where your program will have to wait for an external event to happen. Perhaps your program must wait for some user input, or perhaps it must wait for data to be delivered over the network. Or perhaps something else. In any case, the program must wait for something to happen that is beyond the program's control: the program cannot ''make'' that event happen.

In this situation there are two general options for making a program wait for an external event to happen. The first of these is called ''polling'' and means you write a little loop of the for &quot;while the event has not happened, check again&quot;. Polling is very simple to build and very straightforward. But it is also very wasteful: it means a program takes up processor time in order to do absolutely nothing but wait. This is usually considered too much of a drawback for programs that have to do a lot of waiting. Programs that have a lot of waiting moments (for example, programs that have a graphical user interface and often have to wait for long periods of time until the user does something) usually fare much better when they use the other mechanism: ''event-driven programming''.

In event-driven programming a program that must wait, simply goes to sleep. It no longer takes up processor time, might even be unloaded from memory and generally leaves the computer available to do useful things. But the program doesn't completely go away; instead, it makes a deal with the computer or the [[w:operating system|operating system]]. A deal sort of like this:

:&lt;tt&gt;Okay Mr. Operating System, since I have to wait for an event to happen, I'll go away and let you do useful work in the meantime. But in return, ''&lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;'' have to let me know when my event has happened and let me come back to deal with it.&lt;/tt&gt;

Event-driven programming usually has a pretty large impact on the design of a program. Usually, a program has to be broken up into separate pieces to do event-driven programming (one piece for general processing and one or more others to deal with events that occur). Event-driven programming in Java is more complicated than non-event driven but it makes far more efficient use of the hardware and sometimes (like when developing a graphical user interface) dividing your code up into event-driven blocks actually fits very naturally with your program's structure.

In this module we examine the basis of the Java Platform's facilities for event-driven programming and we look at some typical examples of how that basis has been used throughout the platform.

==The Java Platform Event Model==
===Introduction===
One of the most interesting things about support for event-driven programming on the Java platform is that there is none, as such. Or, depending on your point of view, there are many different individual pieces of the platform that offer their own support for event-driven programming.

The reason that the Java platform doesn't offer one general implementation of event-driven programming is linked to the origins of the support that the platform does offer. Back in 1996 the Java programming language was just getting started in the world and was still trying to gain a foothold and conquer a place for itself in software development. Part of this early development concentrated on software development tooling like [[w:IDE|IDEs]]. One of the trends in software development around that time was for reusable software components geared towards user interfaces: components that would encapsulate some sort of interesting, reusable functionality into a single package that could be handled as a single entity rather than as a loose collection of individual classes. Sun Microsystems tried to get on the component bandwagon by introducing what they called a [[JavaBeans|JavaBean]], a software component not only geared towards the UI but that could also be configured easily from an IDE. In order to make this happen Sun came up with a large specification of JavaBeans (the JavaBeans Spec) dealing mostly with naming conventions (to make the components easy to handle from an IDE). But Sun also realized at the same time that a UI-centric component would need support for an event-driven way of connecting events in the component to business logic that would have to be written by the individual developer. So the JavaBeans Spec also included a small specification for an event Model for the Java platform.

When they started working on this Event Model, the Sun engineers were faced with a choice: try to come up with a huge specification to encompass all possible uses of an event model, or just specify an abstract, generic framework that could be expanded for individual use in specific situations. They chose the latter option and so, love it or hate it, the Java Platform has no generic support for event-driven programming other than this general Event Model framework.

===The Event Model framework===
[[Image:JavaEventModelBasicFramework.jpg|right|frame|The basic Event Model framework]]

The Event Model framework is really very simple in and of itself, consisting of three classes (one abstract) and an interface. Most of all it consists of naming conventions that the programmer must obey. The framework is depicted in the image on the right.

Speaking in terms of classes and interfaces, the most important parts of the framework are the &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt; abstract class and the &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt; interface. These two types are the centerpieces of the rules and conventions of the Java Platform Event Model, which are:

*A class that has to be notified when an event occurs, is called an ''event listener''. An event listener has one distinct method for each type of event notification that it is interested in.
*Event notification method declarations are grouped together into categories. Each category is represented by an event listener interface, which must extend &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt;. By convention an event listener interface is named ''&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener''. Any class that will be notified of events must implement at least one listener interface.
*Any and all state related to an event occurrence will be captured in a state object. The class of this object must be a subclass of &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt; and must record at least which object was the source of the event. Such a class is called an event class and by convention is named ''&lt;Event category name&gt;Event''.
*Usually (but not necessarily!) an event listener interface will relate to a single event class. An event listener may have multiple event notification methods that take the same event class as an argument.
*An event notification method usually (but not necessarily!) has the conventional signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] &lt;specific event&gt;(&lt;Event category name&gt;Event evt)''.
*A class that is the source of events must have a method that allows for the registration of listeners, one for each possible listener interface type. These methods must by convention have the signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] add&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener(&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener listener)''.
*A class that is the source of events may have a method that allows for the deregistration of listeners, one for each possible listener interface type. These methods must by convention have the signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] remove&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener(&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener listener)''.

[[Image:JavaEventModelGenericFrameworkUse.jpg|523px|thumb|left|A general example of how the framework is used]]

That seems like a lot, but it's pretty simple once you get used to it. Take a look at the image on the left, which contains a general example of how you might use the framework. In this example we have a class called &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; that publishes interesting events. Following the rules of the Event Model, the events are represented by the &lt;code&gt;InterestingEvent&lt;/code&gt; class which has a reference back to the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; object (&lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt;, inherited from &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt;).

Whenever an interesting event occurs, the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; must notify all of the listeners for that event that it knows about by calling the notification method that exist for that purpose. All of the notification methods (in this example there is only one, &lt;code&gt;interestingEventOccurred&lt;/code&gt;) have been grouped together by topic in a listener interface: &lt;code&gt;InterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt;, which implements &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt; and is named according to the Event Model conventions. This interface must be implemented by all event listener classes (in this case only &lt;code&gt;InterestingEventListenerImpl&lt;/code&gt;). Because &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; must be able to notify any interested listeners, it must be possible to register them. For this purpose the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; has an &lt;code&gt;addInterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt; method. And since it is required, there is a &lt;code&gt;removeInterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt; method as well.

As you can clearly see from the example, using the Event Model is mostly about following naming conventions. This might seem a little cumbersome at first, but the point of having naming conventions is to allow automated tooling to access and use the event model. And there are indeed many tools, IDEs and frameworks that are based on these naming conventions.

===Degrees of freedom in the Model===
There's one more thing to notice about the Event Model and that is what is ''not'' in the Model. The Event Model is designed to allow implementations a large degree of freedom in the implementation choices made, which means that the Event Model can serve as the basis for a very wide range of specific, purpose-built event handling systems.

Aside from naming conventions and some base classes and interfaces, the Event Model specifies the following:

*It must be possible to register and deregister listeners.
*An event source must publish events by calling the correct notification method on all registered listeners.
*A call to an event notification method is a normal, synchronous Java call and the method must be executed by the same thread that called it.

But the Event Model doesn't specify ''how'' any of this must be done. There are no rules regarding which classes exactly must be event sources, nor about how they must keep track of registered event listeners. So one class might publish its own events, or be responsible for publishing the events that relate to an entire collection of objects (like an entire component). And an event source might allow listeners to be deregistered at any time (even in the middle of handling an event) or might limit this to certain times (which is relevant to multithreading).

Also, the Event Model doesn't specify how it must be embedded within any program. So, while the model specifies that a call to an event handling method is a synchronous call, the Model does not prescribe that the event handling method cannot hand off tasks to another thread or that the entire event model implementation must run in the main thread of the application. In fact, the Java Platform's standard user interface framework ([[../Swing|Swing]]) includes an event handling implementation that runs as a complete subsystem of a desktop application, in its own thread.

===Event notification methods, unicast event handling and event adaptors===
In the previous section we mentioned that an event notification method usually takes a single argument. This is the preferred convention, but the specification does allow for exceptions to this rule if the application really needs that exception. A typical case for an exception is when the event notification must be sent across the network to a remote system though non-Java means, like the [[w:CORBA|CORBA]] standard. In this case it is required to have multiple arguments and the Event Model allows for that. However, as a general rule the correct format for a notification method is

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: Simple notification method'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void specificEventDescription(Event_type evt)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Another thing we mentioned earlier is that, as a general rule, the Event Model allows many event listeners to register with a single event source for the same event. In this case the event source must broadcast any relevant events to all the registered listeners. However, once again the Event Model specification allows for an exception to the rule. If it is necessary from a design point of view you may limit an event source to registering a single listener; this is called ''unicast event listener registration''. When unicast registration is used, the registration method must be declared to throw the &lt;code&gt;java.util.TooManyListenersException&lt;/code&gt; exception if too many listeners are registered:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: Listener registration'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void add&lt;Event_type&gt;Listener(&lt;Event_type&gt;Listener listener) throws java.util.TooManyListenersException
&lt;/source&gt;}}

[[Image:JavaEventModelUsingAnAdaptor.jpg|600px|thumb|center|An event adaptor in between the event source and the event listener.]]

Finally, the specification allows for one more extension: the event adaptor. An event adaptor is an implementation of an event listener interface that can be inserted between an event source and an actual event listener class. This is done by registering the adaptor with the event source object using the regular registration method. Adaptors are used to add additional functionality to the event handling mechanism, such as routing of event objects, event filtering or enriching of the event object before processing by an actual event handler class.

==A simple example==
In the previous section we've explored the depths (such as there are) of the Java platform Event Model framework. If you're like most people, you've found the theoretical text more confusing than the actual use of the model. Certainly more confusing than should be necessary to explain what is, really, quite a simple framework.

In order to clear everything up a bit, let's examine a simple example based on the Event Model framework. Let's assume that we want to write a program that reads a stream of numbers input by the user at the command line and processes this stream somehow. Say, by keeping track of the running sum of numbers and producing that sum once the stream has been completely read.

Of course we could implement this program quite simply with a loop in a main() method. But instead let's be a little more creative. Let's say that we want to divide our program neatly into classes, each with a responsibility of its own (like we should in a proper, object-oriented design). And let's imagine that we want it to be possible not only to calculate the sum of all the numbers read, but to perform any number of calculations on the same number stream. In fact, it should be possible to add new calculations with relative ease and without having to affect any previously existing code.

If we analyze these requirements, we come to the conclusion that we have a number of different responsibilities in the program:

{| class=&quot;messagebox&quot;
|
*Reading the number stream from the command line
*Processing the number stream (possibly multiple of these)
*Starting the entire program
|}

Using the Event Model framework allows us to separate the two main responsibilities cleanly and affords us the flexibility we are looking for. If we implement the logic for reading the number stream in a single class and treat the reading of a single number as an event, the Event Model allows us to broadcast that event (and the number) to as many stream processors as we like. The class for reading the number stream will act as the event source of the program and each stream processor will be a listener. Since each listener is a class of its own and can be registered with the stream reader (or not) this means our model allows us to have multiple, independent stream processing that we can add on to without affecting the code to read the stream or any pre-existing stream processor.

The Event Model says that any state associated with an event should be included in a class that represents the event. That's perfect for us; we can implement a simple event class that will record the number read from the command line. Each listener can then process this number as it sees fit.

For our interesting event set let's keep things simple: let's limit ourselves to having read a new number and having reached the end of the stream. With this choice we come to the following design for our example application:

[[File:JavaEventModelWikibooksJavaProgrammingBookExample.jpg|600px|thumb|center]]

In the following sections we look at the implementation of this example.

===Example basics===
Let's start with the basics. According to the Event Model rules, we must define an event class to encapsulate our interesting event. We should call this class ''something-something''Event. Let's go for &lt;code&gt;NumberReadEvent&lt;/code&gt;, since that's what will interest us. According to the Model rules, this class should encapsulate any state that belongs with an event occurrence. In our case, that's the number read from the stream. And our event class must inherit from &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt;. So all in all, the following class is all we need:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: NumberReadEvent.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.util.EventObject;

public class NumberReadEvent extends EventObject {

    private Double number;
   
    public NumberReadEvent(Object source, Double number) {
        super(source);
        this.number = number;
    }

    public Double getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Next, we must define a listener interface. This interface must define methods for interesting events and must extend &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt;. We said earlier our interesting events were &quot;number read&quot; and &quot;end of stream reached&quot;, so here we go:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.2: NumberReadListener.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.util.EventListener;

public interface NumberReadListener extends EventListener {
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent);
   
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Actually the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method is a little weird, since it isn't actually a &quot;number read&quot; event. In a real program you'd probably want to do this differently. But let's keep things simple in this example.

===The event listener implementation===
So, with our listener interface defined, we need one or more implementations (actual listener classes). At the very least we need one that will keep a running sum of the numbers read. We can add as many as we like, of course. But let's stick with just one for now. Obviously, this class must implement our &lt;code&gt;NumberReadListener&lt;/code&gt; interface. Keeping a running summation is a matter of adding numbers to a field as the events arrive. And we wanted to report on the sum when the end of the stream is reached; since we know when that happens (i.e. the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method is called), a simple &lt;code&gt;println&lt;/code&gt; statement will do:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.3: NumberReadListenerImpl.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class NumberReadListenerImpl implements NumberReadListener {
   
    Double totalSoFar = 0D;

    @Override
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        totalSoFar += numberReadEvent.getNumber();
    }

    @Override
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Sum of the number stream: &quot; + totalSoFar);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

So, is this code any good? No. It's yucky and terrible and most of all not thread safe. But it will do for our example.

===The event source===
This is where things get interesting: the event source class. This is the interesting place because this is where we must put code to read the number stream, code to send events to all the listeners and code to ''manage'' listeners (add and remove them and keep track of them).

Let's start by thinking about keeping track of listeners. Normally this is a tricky business, since you have to take all sorts of multithreading concerns into account. But we're being simple in this example, so let's just stick with a simple &lt;code&gt;java.util.Set&lt;/code&gt; of listeners. Which we can initialize in the constructor:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: The constructor'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
   
public NumberReader() {
    listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

That choice makes it really easy to implement adding and removing of listeners:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: The register/deregister'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
    this.listeners.add(listener);
}

public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
    this.listeners.remove(listener);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

We won't actually use the remove method in this example &amp;mdash; but recall that the Model says it must be present.

Another advantage of this simple choice is that notification of all the listeners is easy as well. We can just assume any listeners will be in the set and iterate over them. And since the notification methods are synchronous (rule of the model) we can just call them directly:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.3: The notifiers'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
private void notifyListenersOfEndOfStream() {
    for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener : listeners) {
        numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(new NumberReadEvent(this, 0D));
    }
}

private void notifyListeners(Double d) {
    for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
        numberReadListener.numberRead(new NumberReadEvent(this, d));
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note that we've made some assumptions here. For starters, we've assumed that we'll get the Double value d from somewhere. Also, we've assumed that no listener will ever care about the number value in the end-of-stream notification and have passed in the fixed value 0 for that event.

Finally we must deal with reading the number stream. We'll use the Console class for that and just keep on reading numbers until there are no more:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.4: The main method'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void start() {
    Console console = System.console();
    if (console != null) {
        Double d = null;
        do {
            String readLine = console.readLine(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;, (Object[])null);
            d = getDoubleValue(readLine);
            if (d != null) {
                notifyListeners(d);
            }
        } while (d != null);
        notifyListenersOfEndOfStream();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note how we've hooked the number-reading loop into the event handling mechanism by calling the notify methods? The entire class looks like this:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.4: NumberReader.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.io.Console;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class NumberReader {
    private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
   
    public NumberReader() {
        listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
    }
   
    public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.add(listener);
    }
   
    public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.remove(listener);
    }
   
    public void start() {
        Console console = System.console();
        if (console != null) {
            Double d = null;
            do {
                String readLine = console.readLine(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;, (Object[])null);
                d = getDoubleValue(readLine);
                if (d != null) {
                    notifyListeners(d);
                }
            } while (d != null);
            notifyListenersOfEndOfStream();
        }
    }

    private void notifyListenersOfEndOfStream() {
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(new NumberReadEvent(this, 0D));
        }
    }

    private void notifyListeners(Double d) {
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberRead(new NumberReadEvent(this, d));
        }
    }

    private Double getDoubleValue(String readLine) {
        Double result;
        try {
            result = Double.valueOf(readLine);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            result = null;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

===Running the example===
Finally, we need one more class: the kickoff point for the application. This class will contain a main() method, plus code to create a NumberReader, a listener and to combine the two:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.5: Main.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberReader reader = new NumberReader();
        NumberReadListener listener = new NumberReadListenerImpl();
        reader.addNumberReadListener(listener);
        reader.start();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

If you compile and run the program, the result looks somewhat like this:

{{XCode|1='''An example run'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
&gt;java org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example.Main
Enter a number: 0.1
Enter a number: 0.2
Enter a number: 0.3
Enter a number: 0.4
Enter a number:
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

{{XCode|1='''Output'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Sum of the number stream: 1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

===Extending the example with an adaptor===
Next, let's take a look at applying an adaptor to our design. Adaptors are used to add functionality to the event handling process that:

* is general to the process and not specific to any one listener; or
* is not supposed to affect the implementation of specific listeners.

According to the Event Model specification a typical use case for an adaptor is to add routing logic for events. But you can also add filtering or logging. In our case, let's do that: add logging of the numbers as &quot;proof&quot; for the calculations done in the listeners.

An adaptor, as explained earlier, is a class that sits between the event source and the listeners. From the point of view of the event source, it masquerades as a listener (so it must implement the listener interface). From the point of view of the listeners it pretends to be the event source (so it should have add and remove methods). In other words, to write an adaptor you have to repeat some code from the event source (to manage listeners) and you have to re-implement the event notification methods to do some extra stuff and then pass the event on to the actual listeners.

In our case we need an adaptor that writes the numbers to a log file. Keeping it simple once again, let's settle for an adaptor that:

* Uses a fixed log file name and overwrites that log file with every program run.
* Opens a &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt; in the constructor and just keeps it open.
* Implements the &lt;code&gt;numberRead&lt;/code&gt; method by writing the number to the &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;.
* Implements the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method by closing the &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;.

Also, we can make life easy on ourselves by just copying all the code we need to manage listeners over from the &lt;code&gt;NumberReader&lt;/code&gt; class. Again, in a real program you'd want to do this differently. Note that each notification method implementation also passes the event on to all the real listeners:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.6: NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor implements NumberReadListener {
    private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
    private BufferedWriter output;
   
    public NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor() {
        listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
        try {
            output = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;numberLog.log&quot;));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
   
    public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.add(listener);
    }
   
    public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.remove(listener);
    }
   
   
    @Override
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        try {
            output.write(numberReadEvent.getNumber() + &quot;\n&quot;);
        } catch (Exception e) {
           
        }
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberRead(numberReadEvent);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        try {
            output.flush();
            output.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
           
        }
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(numberReadEvent);
        }
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Of course, to make the adaptor work we have to make some changes to the bootstrap code:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.7: Main.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberReader reader = new NumberReader();
        NumberReadListener listener = new NumberReadListenerImpl();
        NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor adaptor = new NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor();
        adaptor.addNumberReadListener(listener);
        reader.addNumberReadListener(adaptor);
        reader.start();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

But note how nicely and easily we can re-link the objects in our system. The fact that adaptors and listeners both implement the listener interface and the adaptor and event source both look like event sources means that we can hook the adaptor into the system without having to change a single statement in the classes that we developed earlier.

And of course, if we run the same example as given above, the numbers are now recorded in a log file.

==Platform uses of the Event Model==
The Event Model, as mentioned earlier, doesn't have a single all-encompassing implementation within the Java platform. Instead, the model serves as a basis for several different purpose-specific implementations, both within the standard Java platform and outside it (in frameworks).

Within the platform the main implementations are found in two areas:

* As part of the [[../JavaBeans/Introduction to JavaBeans|JavaBeans]] classes, particularly in the support classes for the implementation of PropertyChangeListeners.
* As part of the Java standard UI frameworks, [[Java Swings/AWT|AWT]] and [[Java_Swings/Overview|Swing]].

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
==Purpose==
The purpose of the &quot;resolved&quot; tag is to give a visual hint to readers of talk page items, making it easier to ignore already-resolved issues. Also, it is hoped that the existence of such a tag will encourage the resolution of items on a talk page.

This template is to show an item on a talk page has been resolved and there is no dispute in anyone's mind about the outcome. That is, the initial comment or request has been filled, a reply to that effect has been added, and there are no disputed items or issues left to be resolved, and (if required) the article (or other page type) has been updated.

The &quot;resolved&quot; tag is '''not''' final and does not close a conversation. If new issues arise, or the item is not fully resolved, please remove the tag.  Thus, the tag also helps clarify situations that might otherwise be ignored because some users thought the issue was resolved, when it was not.

This tag can be (and is) also used in admin processes to note that an action item reported to a notice board has been dealt with, and can further be of help on user talk pages to sort messages for archival from those to be retained for continued discussion or followup action.

==Usage==
Place the following under the topic heading on a talk page:
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|1=~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
{{Resolved| [[User:JohnDoe|JohnDoe]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC) }}
(The 1= is necessary if there are any &quot;=&quot; characters in the message, for example if your raw signature contains &quot;=&quot;. Diffs include the &quot;=&quot; character and therefore require the 1=. Otherwise you can drop it.)

To make an additional comment explaining why the issue is resolved, and/or to sign so that others know who marked the thread as resolved:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|Articles have been updated with 2007 data, and are now in sync. --&amp;#126;&amp;#126;~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{resolved|Articles have been updated with 2007 data, and are now in sync. --[[User:JohnDoe|JohnDoe]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)}}

===Example===

 ==Chelonia==
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#BBFFBB&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|Error corrected in article. ~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Chelonia currently redirects to Turtle, but ''Chelonia'' is the monotypic genus containing the [[Green Sea Turtle]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Shouldn't it be Chelonian--&gt;Turtle, and Chelonia--&gt;Green Sea Turtle? [[User:OneUser123|OneUser123]] 2 July 2005 05:08 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 :Yes you are right. I changed it. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:AnotherUser789|AnotherUser789]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I think the following is wrong:
:A number is a type of variable which stores an integer
JavaScript's variables are typeless, so any variable can store anything. &quot;A number&quot; in JavaScript is the same as in natural language: it is a value composed of digits. I believe that in JavaScript there are two types of numbers, integers and floating point values, or &quot;floats&quot; for short; like in all other curly-brace languages, such as C, C++, Java, C# etc.. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 20:04, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

:No, I'm partially wrong: there are no integers in JavaScript, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Number WP:JavaScript syntax#Number]. &quot;Numbers&quot; are floating point values only.

For the rest, the Math object exists since numbers are not objects. In 
&lt;pre&gt;
  var a = 2;
  var b = 2;
&lt;/pre&gt;
there is no meaning to first create one object whose value is 2 and then another object whose value is 2, 2 is always identical to 2 wherever the respective 2:s are created and accessed. There are no need to actually create 2:s, instead one can imagine that all numbers are already preexisting &quot;objects&quot;, that might be added or subtracted to each other, but the designers of JavaScript didn't understand it that way. Therefore the Math object exists to &quot;give access&quot; to functions operating on numbers when they aren't real objects.

A jumping spider eats insects, like flies or bees.  Although spiders are generally carnivorous, there are some jumping spiders that include nectar and pollen in their diet.  A plant named Partridge Pea offers Jumping Spiders nectar and in return the spider helps to protect the plant by killing and eating pests.  Some jumping spiders eat other spiders; they also eat insects and the eggs of other spiders.

in their anterior median eyes.  Jumping Spiders are good hunters.  They use their good eyesight to 
track their meals, often for several inches.

Jumping spiders are known for their curiosity.  If a human puts its hand out, instead of running away to safety as most spider do the jumping spider will usually leap and turn to face the hand.  It may even jump on the hand.  The Jumping Spider thinks that anything that approaches it is interesting.

They are generally not harmful to humans.

After dxc5 dxe4, Qxd8+ is possible, which looks stronger than it is, due to Kxd8. This is the earliest possible queen exchange.</text>

=Ruy Lopez, Riga Variation=

White's move threatens black's queen and attempts to eliminate the dark side bishop. Note that in the main line of the Riga Variation, that bishop is sacrificed on h2 for attacking chances on white's king.

[[/8...Be7|8...Be7]] accepts the trade, usually following 9.Bxe7 Kxe7 to break the pin coming from the a5 bishop.

[[/8...f6|8...f6]] gets complicated. Now white has a piece in danger as well. White can respond Nxd4 and play can continue toward the main line. Simply moving the bishop again loses a tempo and the initiative.

[[/8...Qd6|8...Qd6]] moves the queen out of the way, though it does take the square the bishop needs to sacrifice on h2.

== How to develop a GUI Python program to click on desktop at desired position ... ==

Hello All Pythoners,

I am Raju C Padaria from India. Today whole day I read about Python programming language. I feel it very very useful in my daily office work for my users. I have been working on SAP R/3 4.6C on Windows XP since last 3 years. I need to automate some download from SAP using Python.
Is it possible to open SAP screen, enter required parameters in the screen, click on an icon to download data from SAP &amp; so on &amp; so forth. I have gone through almost all examples / tutorials but couldn't find the answer of my question.

Please guide me how should I go about it ?

Thanks well in advance !

Best Regards,

== Who is the author of Python? ==

== Python Problem ==

Given the dimensions of a rectangular grid and a sequence of robot positions and
instructions, you are to write a program that determines for each sequence of robot
positions and instructions the final position of the robot.
A robot position consists of a grid coordinate (a pair of integers: x-coordinate followed
by y-coordinate) and an orientation (N,S,E,W for north, south, east, and west). A robot
instruction is a string of the letters 'L', 'R', and 'F' which represent, respectively, the
instructions:
• Left: the robot turns left 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
• Right: the robot turns right 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
• Forward: the robot moves forward one grid point in the direction of the current
orientation and maintains the same orientation.
The direction North corresponds to the direction from grid point (x,y) to grid point
(x,y+1).
Since the grid is rectangular and bounded, a robot that moves ``off'' an edge of the grid is
lost forever. However, lost robots leave a robot ``scent'' that prohibits future robots from
dropping off the world at the same grid point. The scent is left at the last grid position the
robot occupied before disappearing over the edge. An instruction to move ``off'' the
world from a grid point from which a robot has been previously lost is simply ignored by
the current robot.
INPUT SPECIFICATION
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the rectangular world, the lowerleft
coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
The remaining input consists of a sequence of robot positions and instructions (two lines
per robot). A position consists of two integers specifying the initial coordinates of the
robot and an orientation (N,S,E,W), all separated by white space on one line. A robot
instruction is a string of the letters 'L', 'R', and 'F' on one line.
Each robot is processed sequentially, i.e., finishes executing the robot instructions before
the next robot begins execution. There will be 3 robots.
You may assume that all initial robot positions are within the bounds of the specified
grid. The maximum value for any coordinate is 50. All instruction strings will be less
than 100 characters in length.
OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
For each robot position/instruction in the input, the output should indicate the final grid
position and orientation of the robot. If a robot falls off the edge of the grid the word
``LOST'' should be printed after the position and orientation.
SAMPLE INPUT (from file) and OUTPUT (to file)
Case 1:
in.txt looks like this:
5 3
1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL
0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL
out.txt looks like this:
1 1 E
3 3 N LOST
2 3 S

== Pyserial Bill Acceptor ==

Has anyone ever tried to have python read a bill acceptor through a RS-232 serial port? If not how would one go about this? I assume using pySerial but except for the examples there isn't much information that is intuitive to me anyway.  Any information would be great. Thanks.

== Reinitializing Python Import ==

I am new to Python. I want to manipulate ready-made command line programs with scripts, and Python appears to achieve this with more control of the programs than DOS batch files. 

I have written a few Python scripts to test some programs, and I have a question about reinitializing the text ~.py module when I make a change to it. After I've imported a module into Python, e.g., &gt;&gt;&gt; import name.py, and I make a new change to the text file &quot;name.py,&quot; the change will not take effect even if I again import it into Python. 

How do I reinitialize the module once I've made changes to the module? I can't just import the module; the definitions remain unchanged, unless I exit Python and restart it. 

Thanks,

http://www.youtube.com/watch?src_vid=QaYAOR4Jq2E&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_149056&amp;v=M3g1GEkmyrw
in this tutorial what does mean x%2 ?
i think: i * 2% = always even number 
but why not 4,6 or 8? but  i * 4(6,8,10,12...)% = always even number too
for example: 100 * 2(4,6,8,10,12...)% = 2(4,6,8,10,12...)
even numbers = {2,4,6,8,10,12...}
and how pyton understanding 0(even or odd number or it is an exception?)?

Jalapeno eggs for two persons:

==Ingredients==
*4 eggs (free range
*4 slices of whole bread
*1 pack of bacon (150 grams)
*Picled jalapenos (the kind you have on tacos)
*1 can of tomato beans

*Margarine
*grated cheese (real cheese, not cheese product)

==Procedure==

===Side Dishes===
#Chop and fry the onions, set aside.
#Warm the tomato beans. Medium heat
#Fry the bacon and set it aside. Use the bacon grease to fry the eggs.

===Eggs===
#Slice the bread and apply margarine - generously.
#Heat a frying pan with a little margarine
#Start frying two eggs. Do not crack the yolk.
#When the eggs are nearly done, draw aside the egg white so the yolk is clear.
#Chop some jalapenos and spread them over the eggs. Add some of the picle juice as well.
#Spread some cheese over the eggs 
#Put a lid over the frying pan and let the cheese melt. 

Ready to serve.</text>

== Deprecate [[Cookbook:Recipes]] and [[Cookbook:Ingredients]] ==

Shall we deprecate [[Cookbook:Recipes]] and [[Cookbook:Ingredients]]? [[:Category:Recipes]] and [[:Category:Ingredients]] are already much more complete. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:46, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: Agreed. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
: Good idea. These will have to have the links pointing to them updated. I've got a bot that has done such work on Wikipedia and it seems one doesn't need authorization to use bots here (though the use is discouraged) so I offer my help if needed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
:: Actually, most of the pages linking to the page were doing so from {{tl|Cooknav}} and {{tl|Recipe}}. I've been bold and updated these. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
::: Great, thanks. I haven't had the focus to do this myself for the last few months. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

: I started updating the other pages (not template ones) and it turns out that a lot of these pages that seem to mimic categories exist. These are conveniently listed on [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]]. Should these also be changed to categories? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:23, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Mostly not. Or not yet at least. The categories were created (mostly by me) to be more complete references since they're easier to update and maintain. A lot of the other pages have information above and beyond just the recipe/ingredient list, or they have more fine grained subdivisions than the categories currently have (e.g. [[Cookbook:Dessert]] has nice subsections). In the future, I think we'll probably be using DynamicPageLists2 to include category output into a single readable page (like [[Cookbook:Dessert]]) without the extra work that hand maintaining lists brings. But DPL2's aren't enabled here as of yet. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:08, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::: Actually, most of these don't really have any text content, but are simple lists (including [[Cookbook:Dessert]]). In the current form, I'd say the automatical listing would give categories the advantage. Category pages can still have content, though only at the top of the page, above the page list.
::: What is DynamicPageLists2? An extension? I checked Meta and MediaWiki.org, but without results. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: They're a way to transclude category listings into normal pages. DPL(1)'s are currently enabled on wikibooks, but they don't allow alpha ordering, so it makes them sort of useless for the cookbook. If DPL2's were enabled, we would be able to create a page for Desserts which had appropriate subsections (you don't just want one big list of desserts, really) but do it dynamically from the categories. This would be better than just linking to the Desserts category. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: An example of DPL1's is on my scratch page [[User:Kellen/Scratch#DynamicPageList_test_.28chocolate_desserts.29:]] [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Ethnic cuisines ==

With the Ethnic cuisines, is any attempt made to differentiate between &quot;native&quot; recipes and foreign versions?  For example:  Mexican vs. American Mexican.  Thai vs. Americanized Thai.  Indian vs. English Indian, etc.  In some cases, there are major cuisine differences between the &quot;native&quot; food and the foreignized versions (such as in Chinese food).  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:57, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:Some, but spotty. For example, there is [[:Category:Southwestern recipes]], which probably has more of the Americanised Mexican recipes. See also [[Cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine]] and [[Cookbook:California cuisine]]. English Indian recipes will often be modified to more classic Indian dishes by passing editors, and I think at least one Americanised Thai recipe has been treated similarly. We could do much better, though, so ... ;-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:36, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::I think it might be good to develope some sort of policy clarifying this—for example, American Thai food is great, but it shouldn't be confused for Authentic Thai.  It might be good to have the two listed as two separate recipes, however, one American Thai, and one Thai.  And make it a policy to specify whether a recipe is &quot;foreignized&quot; or native.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:53, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::I've tried to do that in a couple of instances here, but not in any formal way. Perhaps a policy on this would be good. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:59, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I think so.  How would we go about coming up with one?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 10:35, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:It depends on what &quot;Americanized&quot; means. If that means a semi-poisonous ingredient available in a half dozen countries got replaced by a wholesome ingredient available in hundreds of countries, then the Americanized version is better. If the Americanized version is full of nasty commercial substitutions (ketchup in a lasagna!) then the Americanized version is probably junk. If the recipies are both decent and are quite distinct, then put the version less common in America on a separate page and link each page to the other. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:34, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

::This last approach is exactly what Cookbook has done with a couple of Anglicised recipes, especially classic Italian dishes that are popular in the UK. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:18, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

::: &quot;Authentic&quot; is very much a matter of opinion.  Not too long ago, a well-known  Italian writer (not so well known that I remember his name), writing a book in English on Italian food was lambasted by the New York Times for writing &quot;not all Italian grandmothers are good cooks&quot;. The Times stated derisively that 'good' was no proof of authenticity and &quot;authetic' might not necessarily be well cooked. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 01:43, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

== Contributors ==

Can anyone on Wikibooks alter recipes?  Is there a policy for that?  People have differences in taste—someone might treble garlic in a recipe, for example, or someone else might remove it entirely.  Is there any policy covering amendations to recipes in that regard?  (Sorry, I'm completely new to the Cookbooks section of Wikibooks, and I'm wondering how stuff like this is resolved.)  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:59, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Jade Knight, I don't believe we have a policy quite that strict. With traditional recipes, it's desirable to keep the recipe as authentic as possible, then note variations such as a personal preference for treble the garlic in the &quot;Notes, tips and variations&quot; section at the end of the recipe. For other recipes, I would tend to do much the same, unless I think that the recipe is plain wrong (e.g. 2 Tbs salt that probably ought to be 2 tsp). I have seen ingredients change dramatically in some recipes, and when that happens, I generally check similar recipes on other websites to see which version is the more popular before deciding whether to keep the new changes or move them to &quot;Notes, tips and variations&quot; (or reverting if necessary). 
:An interesting case on the point of traditional recipes is [[Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara]]. See its discussion page for the tussle over the ingredients and origins of this classic Roman recipe! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:25, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::So, if I post a recipe, it's fair for me to watch over it and make sure it remains true the original, with variations listed as such?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:51, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Pretty much! It is the nature of wikis that content is fair game for further editing by anyone at any time. However, silly vandalism aside, I find that most edits to recipes are for the better - e.g. sharpening the language a bit, adding personal variations at the end, or restoring the authentic ingredients to a traditional recipe. Not all though, so add your recipes to your watchlist if you care! Or just watch the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=102 recent changes] frequently. 
:::Be aware, however, that you don't [[wikibooks:Ownership|own]] the recipes you contribute to Wikibooks - so don't be upset when someone does make a change. Be prepared to accept that a different version may be better, too. You never know, your &quot;true original&quot; may less true or original than you think! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:10, 3 July 2007 (UTC)
::::Ultimately, in cookery, there's no such thing as a real &quot;original&quot;.  However, what is best is such a subjective thing—even within a recipe.  For example, I can't stand celery in tuna noodle casserole.  Some people love it.  Who is the ultimate arbiter on whether a change is an &quot;improvement&quot; to the recipe or not?  This is the sort of thing I'm talking about—naming variations is one thing, cleaning up text is one thing, but someone deciding they have (arbitrarily) a better version of a recipe doesn't really jive.  I understand reasoning between having two separate foreign and &quot;native&quot; versions of various recipes, but that's different than altering a recipe because someone else likes another version more… at the same time, though, we probably don't want to have 50 different chocolate chip cookie recipes here.  So what do we do?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 10:34, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::I'd say we try to keep a happy medium. That means accepting some changes, moving some to ''Notes, tips and variations'', and rejecting some changes. But, once again, I must remind you of [[Wikibooks:Ownership|WB:OWN]] - once you make your contribution here, it's &quot;ours&quot;, not &quot;yours&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;. It is perfectly legitimate for someone to come along and amend a recipe if they think it is wrong or sub-optimal. I've seen changes made to recipes I've submitted, and had to make the choice between the three actions I mentioned.
:::::If you are primarily concerned with preserving a recipe in the form you treasure most, and have it accessible to all on the Internet, then get a website - [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|Wikibooks pages are not personal homepages]]. The Wikibooks Cookbook is primarily a textbook on preparing food, with recipes as a necessary part of that. We are very lucky to have had so many recipes contributed to it, but ultimately it isn't everyone's personal recipe book, it's a textbook, much like the other books here. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:19, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

::::::I think you're missing my question.  It's a matter of how the selection process is made—who is to determine what constitutes an improvement or not?  I understand how changes are made at places like Wikipedia and Wikiversity, but cooking is an entirely different story.  I'm trying to understand the method here.  The more wikibooks grows, the more there are likely to arise conflicts between editors who both think they have the &quot;right&quot; cheese fondue recipe, etc.  How are these resolved?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:14, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I fail to see the difference. If two contributors got into it like that over something in a Wikibook (as has happened with other books here in the past), there would have to be some mediation. We have an option not available to WP in that each can have a separate book, or in the case of Cookbook recipes, each can have a separate recipe. I'd hate to see that happen here, however, but some people just can't seem to handle working in a collaborative environment. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:36, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

== Speaking of chocolate biscuit recipes... ==

[[Cookbook:Chocolate Chip Cookies]] seems silly to me. It currently has three actual recipes, and links to a few arbitrary external websites. I'd like to rip out the external links, and either remove the Hacked 'Neiman-Marcus' Cookies recipe or move it to a separate page on its own. Thoughts? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:07, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

:What's the Cookbook policy on external links to recipes?  Ideally, B:Cookbooks should aim to provide a few of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes imaginable.  But how do we determine which recipes are the best?  What makes the &quot;Neiman-Marcus&quot; cookies better or worse than the others?  These are the sort of things I'm wondering about.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:20, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

::External links are discouraged in general, as they often don't add much to a book. Books should be able to stand on their own without the need to make external references. Linking to recipes outside of the Cookbook itself isn't desirable, unless, for example, it is to an authoritative version of the recipe, or a more in-depth discussion about the history and procedure. Just linking to recipes isn't what the Cookbook is about. See also {{tl|spam}}. 
::Having said that, there's no actual policy position on external links (although it has been suggested that there should be). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:49, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

== Cookbook Search Template ==

I've created a new template that can be used to search the cookbook using the standard wiki search (not google). The template is [[Template:Cookbook Search]], and it looks like this:
{{Cookbook Search}}
We could even add a link to the google search into this template so that all the options are together for the user to use easily. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:24, 10 August 2007 (UTC)
:Absolutely not, thank you very much [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 06:20, 27 August 2008 (UTC)
:Looks like a great idea.  It may take some more edits to perfect it, but I do think the template belongs on the main cookbook page. [[User:Marcus2|Marcus2]] 14:44, 11 August 2007 (UTC)
: Nice, throw it up on the main cookbook page. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:03, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

: Looks good to me, the google search looked ugly anyways. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 16:26, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:Beaut, I like it! Much better, and more likely to help people find recipes and other Cookbook pages now. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:21, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

== mergefrom Chai Book ==

Found this book while categorizing. Looks like a &quot;how to make chai tea&quot;, which means to me it's &quot;recipes for making a type of food&quot;, which is another way to say a &quot;cookbook page&quot;. I think it should be merged to the cookbook. What do other people think? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:26, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:Sounds good to me. We already have [[Cookbook:Chai Tea]] and [[Cookbook:Masala Chai]], plus [[Cookbook:Yogi tea]] which is a type of chai. Will take a look at merging this when time avails itself (unless someone beats me to it - hint!) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:00, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

== Randomized featured content ==

Hi all. I used to be pretty good at rotating the featured ingredients and recipes every couple of weeks or so. However, recently, I've done a poor job of it, and we've gone months with the same featured content. I think I might have found a solution.

I was doing some portal work over at the English Wikipedia, and I found discussions of randomizing the content of the portals, things like featured articles, pictures, etc. These aren't just random articles appearing, but a randomized choice from a list of hand picked content. They're using a template, [[w:Template:Random portal component]], to accomplish this.

Now, our Table of Contents page is very much like a WP portal, with links to content modules (recipes, ingredients, equipment, cuisines, etc), and the featured item paragraphs at the top. I think if we transwikied the template and its documentation here, to give full credit to the authors, and then starting building up the subpages it needs, in a few days or weeks we'd be ready to switch over to a more dynamic TOC for the Cookbook. Anyone else think it's a good idea? 

I can see other books using this as well. Imagine the [[Spanish]] book having a &quot;Selected verb&quot; and &quot;Selected noun&quot; on its main page or TOC, or the [[Using Firefox]] book having a &quot;selected tip&quot; area. Anyway, I'm getting off target. I just thought I'd run this up the flag pole, and see if anyone saluted. If we think it's a good idea, I can handle the transwikis, as I'm an admin on both projects.

[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] ([[User talk:Gentgeen|talk]]) 11:33, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

:Sure: it's better than the same content for months!  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 08:11, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

== Drinks? ==

Is the cookbook only for food, or can we add drinks? [[Special:Contributions/82.198.250.9|82.198.250.9]] ([[User talk:82.198.250.9|talk]]) 14:22, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:::To the IP, yes drinks can be included. Thanks, '''[[User:Majorly|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Majorly&lt;/span&gt;]]''' (''[[User talk:Majorly|talk]]'') 14:42, 31 January 2008 (UTC)
:For alcoholic drinks, [[Bartending]] is probably the best place, as Herbythyme suggests. Otherwise, the Cookbook already has many drinks recipes - see [[:Category:Beverage recipes]] for a start. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:21, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

== Wok? ==

I heard you can cook just about anything in a Wok.  The [[Cookbook:Wok|Wok]] page doesn't go into detail on using a Wok to replace random pieces of cookware in certain situations (steaming with a Wok, boiling, stirfry, searing, etc).

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] ([[User talk:Bluefoxicy|talk]]) 20:00, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

:You can cook just about anything in any heat-resistant receptacle the stops liquids falling out, for that matter. People tend to use the tools that they have to hand, but some tools are better at certain jobs than others. Woks are really good for stir-frying, whereas large stock pots are really good for boiling. You can still use a stock pot to stir-fry food and a wok for boiling, but there are often better tools at hand. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:32, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== Open Source Cookbook resuming activity ==

For those of us who remember the old, OLD comments made here about my Open Source Cookbook (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Cookbook/Archive_1#Moved_from_the_page here] for the original comment), I've finally gotten things in order to get back to work on the PDF'ed version of the book. I do still take submissions, and I've registered a new domain name to get things started, as well as set up a copy of MediaWiki over there for people. The cookbook's new home is http://www.oscookbook.org, and I'm currently working on getting everything set up web-wise [ht.
For the folks who have done so much wonderful work on the WikiBooks cookbook, I would love the opportunity to collaborate with [http://www.all-auto.ro/dezmembrari-auto dezmembrari-auto] se people and help improve the for-print version of the project I started so long ago! &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mabalmer|Mabalmer]] ([[User talk:Mabalmer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mabalmer|contribs]]) 2008-03-09T02:54:47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:G'day Matt, looks good. I'll keep tabs on it to see how it progresses, and might even add the odd recipe or two. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:15, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

== Improvements needed ==

The Cookbook appears to be in a bit of a mess and contributions (and I imagine, readers) seem to be rare these days.  The cookbook should be one of the principle parts of Wikibooks yet it's lacking in many ways.

1. There are very few good quality recipes here - with illustrative pictures, clear instructions, nutritional information and good detail.
2. Too much focus on the main page is given to 'food' as opposed to recipes for things that people actually can make!  When I visit a Cookbook I want to find recipes but (apart from the two featured at the top of the page) instead I have to follow about 2 or 3 links before I get to an actual recipe -&gt; for example click 'British cuisines' then 'Bubble and Squeak'.  Links to pages like 'healthy eating' should at least include examples of such dishes rather than a long essay about what healthy eating actually is.  Maybe there should also be a 'random recipe' link prominently displayed (if there is then it's hard to find)
3. I've often edited the Cookbook but I've never used it for making a meal - there are far many better cooking websites on the Internet - see http://www.recipezaar.com/ and an example recipe http://www.recipezaar.com/87085
4. We should focus on the front page on recipes of the day, healthy dish of the day, a region of the week (Indian this week, Argentinian next week, etc.)  The quoted website is much better although still lacking good photos and doesn't show metric measurements - but strangely the nutritional facts about the dish use metric which may explain why Americans are so obese if they are able to confuse two measuring systems in one page!
5. A link to recently added recipes could be interesting.

:Far too much attention is given to recipes in this book. Yes, we have lots of recipes that haven't been properly polished up to resemble those in a nice recipe book, but what this book really needs is greater attention to the following:
:* Ingredients - many pages are bare stubs, some have information that is wrong or dicey, few are good, and there aren't enough photographs of them
:* Equipment - again, lots of bare stubs, dicey information, plus US-centric stuff that leaves everyone else cold, and again, not enough photographs
:* Techniques - there is actually some pretty good information buried in some of the recipes, and some of our techniques pages are good, but there is much to be done here
:* Measurements - these pages need consolidation, standardisation, explanatory text, and conversion tables
:* Cuisines - this is where Wikibooks could really shine, with people from all parts of the world contributing, and some have - but Wikipedia has vastly better cuisine pages (which could be transwikied as a basis for our pages; some have)
:Recipes are OK, but you can get recipes anywhere. The five points above are far more important, and more relevant for a textbook website (which is what Wikibooks is, if you recall). I hope to get back to it sometime, but have other priorities so am hoping that others will take up the challenge!
:And I don't think the metric-vs-English measures issue is why Americans, and others, are getting fatter - blame [[w:Affluenza|affluenza]] and cheap carbohydrate-rich foods for that. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:28, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

:: I agree that recipes receive too much attention. I would actually not be opposed to nuking every single recipe we have and trying to direct focus to the things which are more encyclopedic and static. As you said, recipes can be found everywhere, and there is essentially an infinite number of them. On the other hand, we have a relatively finite number of cooking techniques and utensils, and only so many ingredients (though still quite a few). Once a recipe is written, it can't really be improved in the same way as an encyclopedia article can, and they just sit there.

::: Why isn't the wiki cookbook put up on a separate wikipage, it's a good idea but the problem as I see it is that it is in faqt not as much a book as it is a database. So I would sugest that it'd be as already pointed out cleaned up and then launched on a separate wiki with the name of wikicook or something...
::://Robert
:::: I second what Robert said.  My cooking skills are fairly rudimentary and I came here hoping to develop them.  But there's no structure to this textbook - no idea where to begin, or how to progress through it.  This book really needs a structure: an introduction and a clear, linear progression. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 22:41, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
::::: P.S. What you have on this page is the index that really should go at the '''back''' of the book.  The recipes should be interspersed into the textbook where they highlight particular techniques or tools. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 00:39, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

=== No nukes, please ===
I really don't think deleting all the recipes would be a good idea. While they are in some sense static, there's no reason that this ''needs'' to be the case. For one thing, variants on a recipe could be entered in using subpages (so if I make a pancake recipe and find a slight variation I like better or need to substitute something, I can make that a variant and link it from the original recipe page). 

I also think the recipes are useful in that they give examples of how the techniques and ingredients are used. However, to do this right it would be good to set up some DPL-readable templates on recipe pages (which is why I wandered onto this page in the first place: see section below). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:16, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

::I'm not advocating the deletion of all the recipes (and I don't think Kellen is really either); I do think we seriously need to address the other aspects of the cookbook I raised above, but recipes are a necessary part of the book as they demonstrate the concepts that the other aspects should discuss. (But not the most important element - there are lots of recipes available on the Internet, but knowledge about cooking is much less available.)
::For DPL, realise that DPLs in WikiMedia projects can't be sorted nicely; however, I've added a gadget that does sort them, if you want to take advantage of that. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:22, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

::: I don't seriously think people will nuke the recipes, but if I was dictator, I might. As content, I don't really find the recipes interesting; they're not really collaborative, they're widely available, and just about any junk can &quot;qualify.&quot; One of the major things I was doing was formatting and categorizing all the existing recipes, and doing this revealed to me the deep crappiness of a large number of the recipes, which IMO would be best dealt with by deletion. The downside to deletion would be that people are probably motivated to write about techniques and ingredients because they're writing recipes, not the other way around. I agree with Xania that recipes are the &quot;most important part of the Cookbook,&quot; but at this point I tend to think that having a book of ''cooking techniques, equipment, and ingredients'' is a much better fit for a wiki than a ''cookbook''. The reason recipe sites have developed a lot of filtering techniques (search and ratings systems, in particular) is that they know they're going to get a large percentage of &quot;bad&quot; recipes and there has to be some way for their users to recognize these as such. We probably won't be able to have such software here on wikibooks; maybe they'll get something like that on the cooking wikia page, but wikimedia is too slow and wikibooks too low a priority for us to get any sexy features. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:02, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

I'm guessing it's partly a matter of perception. I've been working on the [[Bartending|Bartending Guide]], and have been looking to the Cookbook as a much better model than what the BG currently has. There is a lot of cross-book information that can and should be shared. For example, when talking about cocktail olives, it seems more logical to link to the cookbook's ingredients section on olives than to send people over to Wikipedia. I already see the reverse happening, where various alcohols (like Rum and Vodka) are linked to the BG from the Cookbook. The Bartending Guide is another Wikipedia &quot;dumping ground&quot;, and for the same reasons: Wikipedia is not a cookbook. I think that particular rule is quite annoying, because it has caused several good Wikipedia articles to be gutted of useful information, and the books here be bloated with snippets of information that basically become orphaned (after all, the editors who were interested in it originally are back on Wikipedia).

Should the cookbook be &quot;nuked&quot; and all the recipes be tossed out? Of course not! That's just deletionism taken to the extreme. We have a starting point, and it just needs to be brought back up to the good standards that it once maintained. The [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Food and Drink|WikiProject Food and Drink]] over at Wikipedia is a good starting place to find people at Wikipedia to help. It's currently a small group of people working to improve Wikipedia's F&amp;D articles, but if we get some cross-wiki communications going, the English Wikipedia can become a helpful friend instead of just a &quot;dumper&quot; over here. That's what has happened with the Bartending Guide. Working with the [[w:WP:MIX|Wikiproject Mixed Drinks]] on Wikipedia and the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending|WikiProject Bartending]] here, the amount of &quot;dumping&quot; has sharply decreased. I'm active in both projects, and that has helped to reduce the &quot;us vs. them&quot; attitude that plagued the &quot;bar recipes&quot; of both projects. So, don't &quot;throw the baby out with the bathwater&quot; by dumping the cookbook's contents. Just ask for help with the dumping issue, so that things don't snowball here while working to fix things. I eventually want to help on the Cookbook, but realistically, it's going to be a long time before the BG is finished enough for me to branch out. I'm just hoping that there's still a Cookbook left to work on when I'm done. I also like the DLP suggestions below, and would love to incorporate some of those ideas into the Bartending Guide, but do not know how to do so. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:23, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

: There's not really any tension between the Cookbook and wikipedia anymore; all the recipes that were there have been moved and integrated. The problem, my problem anyway, is that I don't think that the recipes fit wikibooks' collaborative model, and as a result we have an ever-growing collection of very low quality recipes, which can't be improved in the same way as a wikipedia article.

== Using DPL for the cookbook ==

About 2 years ago, [[User:Kellen]] had led the charge for getting DynamicPageList enabled here on Wikibooks, at least in large part as an organizational tool for the cookbook. I don't think it ever really went anywhere here, but I've been making great use of it on Wikiversity making the [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys|Bloom Clock keys]], and I think something similar (and simpler) could be done for the cookbook. What I have in mind is something like this:

#All recipe ingredient lists need to be categorized for the DPL to have something to grab onto. Probably the best way to do this would be to use a template that either just adds the categories, or perhaps adds categories at the same time as it organizes ingredients into a table (and creates links to the ingredients, etc.). 
#Ingredient pages could then have a DPL list of all recipes using an ingredient.
#Finally, a simple template could be created for use in the User namespace for finding recipes that use 3 or 4 ingredients.

The third point is the one I'm most interested in: how nice would it be if you could go to the market and pick up a few things that look good, interesting, or that you're curious about, and then come back to Wikibooks and run a DPL script to find a list of recipes you could make. They could also be categorized and searched for by time it takes to cook, ease/difficulty, etc. 

Part of my motivation is also a new clock on Wikiversity, the [[v:Fruit Clock|Fruit Clock]], which among other things will help people keep track of when fruits come into season in their location (including things like squash and tomatoes as fruit, of course). Both the bloom clock and the fruit clock make links to the cookbook for the plants they discuss, so this might help get new contributors and readers as well. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:16, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

: I did a ''lot'' of work categorizing each recipe by the &quot;major ingredients,&quot; so you should be able to get basic, useful, lists from the DPLs. Whether they're sorted or not, and whether they'll contain recipes added in the year... and a half? ... since I finished categorizing the existing recipes is another matter.

== recipe book ==

I think that wikipedia members should be able to have their own recipe books.  when you see a recipe you  like you click a button that says &quot;add to recipe book&quot; and it adds it to your personal recipe book. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:96.253.105.177|96.253.105.177]] ([[User talk:96.253.105.177|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/96.253.105.177|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Wikiversity ==

Discussion has begun at Wikiversity on how best to launch Wikiversity's own Cooking/Culinary/Food and Drink school.  What I'd like to see is collaboration and interaction between the Cookbook here and School there as much as possible.  I think some of the recent discussions here for how to improve the Cookbook are great; I was just mentioning to [[v:User:Blast|User:Blast]] that it would be great to have thorough pages documenting ingredients, alternative names, how to identify them, preparation principles, how to select when buying, etc.  The whole thorough bit.  One of the big questions in my mind is: what goes on Wikibooks, and what on Wikiversity?  I'd really appreciate brainstorming ideas anyone has on what Wikiversity can do to supplement the Cookbook.  One idea we're planning on implimenting in the next few weeks is to create a Reference Desk of sorts, where people can come in and ask any ingredient- or cooking-related question and get a helpful answer.  What else can we do?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 08:31, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

== Wikicook? ==

I agree with what the user //Robert said; Wikibooks Cookbook is a book, in a way, but it acts more like a database of recipes than an actual book. I'm thinking of proposing Wikicook or Wikirecipes on Meta, but I'd like more opinions on the subject before I actually recommend it. I only see positive effects for having WikiCook as a new wiki, especially with the probability of greater attention.

I say the same think for Wikijunior, but I'd wait until it further matures, as was done with Wikiversity.

== Here's my suggestion ==

As a few people have pointed out, Cookbook is more like a recipe database than a cookbook.  Or a cooking '''text'''book, which is presumably what we're aiming at.  I suggest using a structure something like this:
*Introduction - What is cooking? (heat + food - also touch on non-heat-based food preparation)  What are some of the principles of applying heat to food?  What will we be covering in this book?  Different culinary cultures around the world.
*Part 0 - Preparation - what equipment is needed?  Principles of mise-en-place.
*Part 1 - Frying - an explanation of applying heat through conduction - pros and cons, gotchas (burnt outside, raw inside), food density issues etc.
**Pan-frying - recipe #1: a simple omelette (+suggested variations). 3-4 progressively harder dishes.
*etc. etc.

I'd get started on it myself but unfortunately, I actually came to this page to learn about this stuff, so I'm not really up to contributing in that way. :(  But hopefully you get the idea.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using More Dimensions==

Julia and Mandelbrot sets can, of course, be constructed in spaces of higher dimension than two, but there is not very much gained with this, if we let the picture be a two-dimensional cut coloured in the usual way. We ought to let the cut be three-dimensional and let the set be seen as a body or a surface coloured in the same way as we have coloured a fractal landscape. We will here let the figure be white and let the light be artificial (with parallel rays), so that the picture becomes in grey-tone the nuance growing darker with the distance.

As to the function, we could let it be a mapping from the space into itself, but if it does not satisfy something corresponding to the Cauchy-Riemann differential-equations, the structure will be as in the non-complex case. These equations cannot be generalized to the three-dimensional space, but they can be generalized to the four-dimensional space, because in the four-dimensional space (in contrast to the three-dimensional space) we can introduce operations of calculation that are a natural extension of the operations of the complex numbers. 

==Properties of Quaternions==
The extension of complex numbers to four dimensions was discovered in 1843 by the Irish mathematician ''W.R. Hamilton'' (1805-65).  Hamilton called his new numbers ''[[wikipedia:Quaternions|quaternions]]''. The quaternions are the numbers of the form ''x + yi + uj + vk'', where ''x'', ''y'', ''u'' and ''v'' are real numbers and where the two new symbols ''j'' and ''k'', like ''i'', satisfy &lt;math&gt;j^2 = k^2&lt;/math&gt; = -1, and where the three symbols are connected by ''ij = k''.

Of these relations it follows that ''jk = i'' and ''ki = j'', but also that ''ji = -k'', that is, ''ji = -ij''. This means that the multiplication for the quaternions is not commutative. But apart from this, the quaternions, like the real numbers and the complex number, make up a ''field'': you can operate with them exactly as you operate with real and complex numbers. The ''skew-field'' of quaternions is an extension of the field of complex numbers, and the quaternions have the same nice and simple properties as the complex numbers. For instance: for a polynomial p(z) of degree n, the equation p(z) = 0 has exactly n roots (some possibly multiple), and if a quaternion function f(z) is differentiable at every point of an open domain (in the quaternions), then it is differentiable any number of times.

Therefore we can without problems generalize the theory of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets to the quaternions: all we have said (critical points, cycles, potential and distance function, ...) is valid almost without modifications - only the field lines need a comment.

==Choices in Rendering Quaternion Fractals==
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatman.jpg|thumb|right|Quaternion Mandelbrot set]]
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatjul.jpg|thumb|right|Quaternion Julia set]]
We need a startegy to get from 4 dimensional patterns to 2 dimensions.  We assume that our function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; (''z'' quaternion) is a polynomial with real coefficients, and that it only contains powers of even degree (e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(z) = pz^2 + qz^4&lt;/math&gt;), for then the three-dimensional subspace spanned by 1, ''i'' and ''j'' is left invariant by the iterations, and therefore we can restrict ourselves to this space. The critical points are complex numbers lying symmetrically around the x-axis, and we construct the Mandelbrot set from a finite critical point and ∞. A Julia set is a fractal surface, and we ought to have two ways of drawing: the filled-in Julia set, which is the complement to the Fatou domain containing ∞, and a Julia set with field lines in the inner Fatou domains (partly because there is nothing to see in an inner Fatou domain, and that the field lines are very decorative, partly because the picture is drawn faster when the domain is filled with field lines, because these lines stop the drawing procedure).

In the space we imagine a plane parallel with the ''x,y''-plane with which we intersect the fractal and look at the part of it lying back (or &quot;below&quot;) the plane. The intensity of the light is determined by the distance &quot;down&quot; to the fractal. The intersection plane parallel with the base plane (the ''x,y''-plane) is given by a height ''h''. For the Mandelbrot set the height must be positive, as we are not interested in the part lying under the ''x,y''-plane (because the Mandelbrot set is symmetric around the base plane and abates on the opposite side). The nuance of the colour is calculated by consecutive estimations of the distance to the boundary and, on the basis of these estimations, approximations in steps becoming smaller and smaller. If the boundary is too thin, the sequence of approximation may jump past the fractal (giving a black dot).

===Technical Detail of Calculation===
We can let the next step down be half of the estimated distance, but we must arrange the program so that we can make the steps smaller if there are faults in the picture. We must choose a little number ''stepmin'', so that if the calculated step ''u'' is smaller than this number, we set ''u = stepmin''. For each step, we add the calculated step to a number starting with 0, and when we have reached the boundary (or the interior of the Mandelbrot set or a filled-in Julia set or a field line), we divide the distance by the highest allowable distance, which in case of a Mandelbrot set is the height ''h'' of the plane, and in case of a Julia set is ''h'' + the maximum distance we can go below the base plane (e.g. 2). The result is a number in the interval [0, 1], and we construct a grey-tone scale indexed by the numbers t in this interval, such that 0 corresponds to white and 1 to black. We can, for instance, let the colour have (equal) RGB-values that are the integral part of the number &lt;math&gt;255/(1+turndown+tan(t \pi/2)/intensity)^{exponent}&lt;/math&gt;, with three parameters to adjust the nuance.

For the Mandelbrot set the iteration stops when the maximum number of iterations is reached or when the iterated point is outside a sphere of a very large radius. In the latter case we calculate the distance to the boundary, and let this number determine the next step down. The same applies to a filled-in Julia set. For an inner Fatou domain, the iteration stops when a point in the sequence is within a given little distance from a (given) point in the cycle. As we do not calculate the real iteration number, we need not calculate the attraction of the cycle, but we must know the order of the cycle and (on account of the field lines) the unit-quaternion corresponding to the angle of rotation in the complex case.

==Relation between Quaternion and Complex Fractals==
The intersection of the Mandelbrot set with the complex plane (that is, the base plane) is the corresponding complex Mandelbrot set, and this lies symmetrically around the x-axis (because the coefficients in our formula are real). The quaternion-Mandelbrot set (in the 3-dimensional space) is obtained by rotating the complex Mandelbrot set around the x-axis. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is thus a rotary symmetric fractal surface with the x-axis as generator, and it consists consequently of circles around the x-axis. The Julia set associated to a point in the complex plane (that is, of height 0) also consists of circles around the x-axis. But for a point outside the complex plane the Julia set consists of closed curves or segments of curves lying askew   in relation to the x-axis. In these fractal surfaces the structure is only fractal in one direction: in the direction orthogonal to this it will have the true character of a curve - a phenomenon we have seen in the non-complex fractals.

==The Field Lines==

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatfield1.jpg|thumb|right|Field lines]]
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatfield2.jpg|thumb|right|Field lines]]The norm of the quaternion ''z = x + yi + uj + vk'' is the real number |''z''| = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + v^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''z'' can be written as the product of the norm and a unit-quaternion (quaternion of norm 1), this unit-quaternion is the ''argument'' of ''z''.

In our case where the fourth coordinate is 0, the argument is a point on the unit-sphere. And the little circle around one of the points in the cycle, which in the complex case stops the iteration, must now be replaced by a little sphere, and the field lines are constructed on the basis of regularly situated domains on this sphere. As such, we can choose the domains that result from a regularly decomposition of the equator circle and from the projection onto this.

===Technical Detail of Calculation===

The technique used to draw the field lines is, however, a little complicated. Drawing is done by working our way down in as large steps as possible, but now it must be examined if a field line is hit. As the steps initially are large, we risk jumping past the field line, therefore we must (by a trial iteration) examine if a field line is in our way, and if so, alter the further procedure. If a field line is in our way, we must go forward in smaller steps, and when it is hit, we must go backwards and forwards in smaller and smaller steps, in order to find the precise point of intersection with the field line. The steps we go down are usually (that is, when we disregard field lines) half of the estimated distance, and we may now have to reduce the steps.

If we set &lt;math&gt;g(z) = f(z) + c&lt;/math&gt;, and if the order of the attracting cycle is ''r'' and if ''z*'' is a point in the cycle, then ''z*'' is a fixed point for &lt;math&gt;g(g(...g(z)))&lt;/math&gt; (the ''r''-fold composition), and near ''z*'' this map has (in connection with field lines) character of a ''rotation'' with the argument &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of the quaternion &lt;math&gt;(d(f(f(...f(z))))/dz)_{z*}&lt;/math&gt; = the product of the quaternions &lt;math&gt;f'(z_i)&lt;/math&gt;, for the ''r'' points in the cycle.

A given direction &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (= quaternion of norm 1) outgoing from ''z*'' determines a field line, and this consists of the points ''z'' such that if the argument of &lt;math&gt;z_k - z*&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; = the last point in the iteration), then &lt;math&gt;\psi \beta^{-k} = \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we must know the ''k'''th power of a unit-quaternion, and this can be calculated by this formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (x, y, u, v)^k = (cos(k \kappa), ty, tu, tv)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is an angle such that &lt;math&gt;x = cos(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; and where t is calculated recursively by the following operation performed ''k'' times and starting with ''t'' = 0 and ''i'' = 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t = cos(i \kappa) + tx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i = i + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''n'' be the number of field lines and let ''t'' be their relative thickness (a number in the interval [0, 1]). For the point ''z'', we have calculated &lt;math&gt;\psi \beta^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a unit-quaternion and therefore corresponds to a point on the unit sphere. As the domains of this determining the field lines are chosen such that they result from a regular decomposition of the equator circle, the condition depends only on the argument of the projection of this quaternion on the complex plane. If ''v'' is this angle (chosen in the interval [0, 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;[) divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, then ''z'' belongs to a field line if ''|v - i/n| &lt; t/(2n)'', for one of the integers ''i'' = 0, 1, ..., ''n''.

However, as we want to know if a field line is in our way, we do first perform a pre-calculation which calculates the distance to the boundary and determines the field line in question, and this is the one having the number ''i'' such that ''|v - i/n| &lt; 1/(2n)''. We calculate the number ''d = 2n|v - i/n| - t''. If d is negative, the point ''z'' actually belongs to the field line, and the point is coloured white. Otherwise, we regard ''d'' as a measure for the distance to the field line, and we multiply the calculated step by ''d'', so that the steps become smaller when we are near a field line.

We must find the precise point in our way down where the field line is hit. Therefore we go backwards and forwards in smaller and smaller steps. We call the actual height ''h1'' and the old height ''h2''. When we for the first time are inside a field line, we set ''h3 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h2)/2'', and calculate again if we are inside the field line. If no, we set ''h2 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h3)/2'', if yes we set ''h3 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h2)/2''. We do this until ''h2 - h1 &lt; stepmin''. The distance to the field line is then ''h - h1'' (''h'' is the height of the plane).

      <text xml:space="preserve">If, in a three-dimensional coordinate system, we imagine the plane with the Mandelbrot or the Julia set as the ''x,y''-plane and plot the distance function in the ''z''-direction, we have a surface looking like a landscape, and we can see it from the side. Such a picture has to be drawn from the top and downwards (on the screen), and from the far distance towards the near (in the landscape), so that something will grow and hide what was previously drawn.

The distance function can have singularities, which means that the surface has points in which it grows towards infinity. As these vigorous rises are unaesthetic if they are numerous and dominant, we must modify the distance function (third picture). We can also modify it in order to create a more interesting landscape (second picture).

We can let the light be &quot;natural&quot;, like the light from the sun. Then we imagine the rays are parallel (and given by two angles), and we let the colour of a point on the surface be determined by the angle between this direction and the slope of the surface at the point. The intensity (on the earth) is independent of the distance, but the light grows whiter because of the atmosphere, and sometimes the ground looks as if it is enveloped in a veil of mist (second picture). We can also let the light be &quot;artificial&quot;, as if it issues from a lantern held by the observer. In this case the colour must grow darker with the distance (third picture).

We look at the landscape in a direction inclining downward from the eye, and the drawing window has this line as normal in its centre. A vertical line (of pixels) in the drawing window corresponds to a line in the base plane with the fractal. And for each of these lines, we start in the point farthest back and go towards the observer colouring pixels in the corresponding vertical line of the window in the following way: If p is a point on the line in the base plane, we calculate the value of the distance function in p. If the line from this point on the surface to the eye intersects the window, we shall colour this pixel. We calculate the slope of the surface in the point, by calculating the distance function in two points very near p in the x- and y-direction. The little triangle spanned by the three values lies on the surface. We take the scalar product of the normal (unit) vector of the triangle and the direction (unit) vector of the light - in case of artificial light this is the direction vector from the eye to the point.

This number (multiplied by the density) can be combined with other factors determining the colour: the height over the ground or the distance to the observer, for instance.

From the scalar product of the normal (unit) vector of the surface and the direction vector to the observer, we can approximately calculate the distance we must go towards the observer in order to colour the adjacent pixel above or below the just coloured pixel (for rise or fall of the landscape in the direction towards the observer, respectively). As this calculation cannot be exact, the steps must possibly be diminished by a factor. We stop the drawing for this line, when we are so near the observer that the bottom pixel of this vertical line of the window is coloured - possibly we do continue the drawing, if something grows up nearer the observer and we want this to be seen. Instead of finishing a vertical line before we go to the next, we can make the drawing looking more fascinating by going to the next vertical line for each step towards the observer, so that the drawing looks like a wave motion from the top and downwards.

The surface is primary constructed from a function proportional to the distance function, but the program should be made so that this function can be worked up. In the first turn the singularities should be made finite by choosing a relative maximum height ''hm0''. This number times the width of the section is the maximum height ''hm'' in the landscape, and we can replace the height ''h'' by ''hm * arctan(h/hm)'', for instance. The (constant) number ''hm'' should however be made varying, by dividing it by a number proportional to the exponential function of the real iteration number, in order to lower the maximum height near the boundary. Instead of making the singularities finite, we can simply cut them down by replacing ''h'' by ''hm'' when ''h'' &gt; ''hm''. We can also regulate ''h'' by dividing it by &lt;math&gt;1 + (h/hm)^2&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, or we can convert the singularities to craters by replacing ''h'' by &lt;math&gt;hm^2/h&lt;/math&gt; when ''h'' &gt; ''hm''.

Furthermore, the surface can be smoothed out by multiplying ''h'' by (for instance) the number &lt;math&gt;1 - arctan(a*s^b)/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the slope of the surface and ''a'' and ''b'' are parameters determining the effect.

For natural light, we can get the colour growing whiter (mist) or darker with the distance and the height, by mixing the colour with grey or black, respectively, according to this number (in the interval [0, 1]): &lt;math&gt;arctan(a * (dist/maxdist)^b + c/(1 + d*h))/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a, b, c'' and ''d'' are parameters determining the effect.

For artificial light, we can get the colour growing darker with the distance, by mixing with black according to the number &lt;math&gt;arctan(l*s*(width/dist)^e)/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the scalar product of the direction vector from the eye and the slope (unit) vector, and ''l'' and ''e'' are parameters determining the effect.

===The Drawing in More Details===

We must start by choice of a scale which we apply for both the window and the landscape, namely by assigning a distance ''gg'' to the width ''ww'' (in pixels) of the window (or the picture). Then the width of a pixel is ''hh = gg/ww'', and in the coordinate system in the window having the centre as origo, the line ''i'' pixels from the left border has abscissa ''xs = -gg/2 + i×hh''.

The landscape is seen from a point on the ''z''-axis having ''z''-coordinate ''z0'', along a line ''lc'' in the direction of the (positive) ''y''-axis which intersects this in a point having ordinate ''yc''. The fractal motif is displaced such that this point (0, ''yc'') in the base plane becomes the centre of the fractal motif: if the real centre of the fractal motif is (''x1'', ''y1''), we add (''x1'', ''y1'') to the coordinate set in the ''x-y''-system when we calculate the height and the slope.

The line (in the ''y-z''-plane) from ''z0'' orthogonal to ''lc'', intersects the ''y''-axis in a point having ''y''-coordinate -''yv'' (''yv'' positive), this point is the ''vanishing point'' (seeming infinitely far away from the observer). We let ''d'' (= ''yc+yv'') be the distance from the vanishing point to the base point ''yc''. If ''m'' is the distance ''lc'' (from the observer to the base point) divided by the distance from the observer to the window, the vertical line in the window having abscissa ''xs'', corresponds to the line in the base plane going through the vanishing point (0, -''yv'') and the point (''m×xs'', ''yc''). And the point on this line having ordinate ''y'', has abscissa ''m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d''.

Now we choose a vertical line in the window (lying ''i'' pixels from the left and thus having abscissa ''xs = -gg/2 + i×hh)'', and we will colour this line by going along the corresponding line in the base plane from the distant towards the near. Assume that we on this line have reached the point having ordinate ''y''. This point has abscissa ''m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d'', and we shall calculate the height ''z'' and the slope ''s'' of the surface at the point having abscissa ''x1 + m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d'' and ordinate ''y1 + y - yc''. In the ''y-z''-plane we have the line segment ''lz'' from the observer (0, ''z0'') to (''y'', ''z''). The pixel in the window to be coloured (lying ''i'' pixels from the left), lies ''j'' pixels from the top, where ''j'' is the integral part of the number ''wh/2 - wj×tan(acz)'', here ''wh'' is the height of the window (in pixels), ''wj'' is the distance from the observer to the window also measured in pixels, and ''acz'' is the angle from ''lc'' to ''lz''.

After this pixel have been coloured, we must estimate the ordinate ''dy'' of step we shall go forward (in the direction of the negative ''y''-axis) in order to colour the next (adjacent) pixel (above or below). In the ''y-z''-plane we have the line segment ''ly'' from the observer (0, ''z0'') to (''y'', 0). We let ''ay'' be the angle from the (negative) ''z''-axis to ''ly'' and let ''ayz'' be the angle from ''ly'' to ''lz''. If we set

::&lt;math&gt;p = \left(1 + \frac{tan(ayz)}{tan(ay)}\right)\cdot \frac{cos(ay)}{ly} + \left|sin(ay)\right|\cdot \frac{s - z\cdot\frac{y - s(z0 - z)}{lz^2}}{cos(ayz)\cdot lz}&lt;/math&gt;,

''dy'' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;dy = cos(acz)^2/(wh p)&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, the new ''y'' is ''y - dy''.

As this is only an estimation (found by differential calculus), we must arrange the program so that we can multiply the steps ''dy'' by a factor ''r'' &lt; 1.

The drawing of the vertical line in the window is finished when the last pixel is drawn (number ''wh'' from the top) ''and'' when the new ''y'' is smaller than a certain ''y'' value depending on the situation of the lower border of the window, on the visual angle and on whether the landscape is turned upwards or downwards (when the surface is below the base plane and the visual angle is small, this ''y'' value can lie rather far behind the lower border of the window).

===Gaps Between the Iteration Bands===

There is a circumstance which can make it necessary to move forward in smaller steps, namely the tendency for gaps to develop between iteration bands, especially if a largish power appears in the formula. At the moving towards the boundary, the value of the distance function becomes smaller and smaller, but at the curves where the iteration number is increased by 1, there is a tendency towards that the calculated distance is a little smaller than it should be. The reason is, that the iteration number used in the calculation of the distance estimation must be very large, and this presupposes that the bail out radius is very small (- or very large for iteration towards infinity), but ''if'' the bail out radius is as small as it ought to be, the colouring between the iteration bands becomes unclean, because the calculation of the slope is uncertain - in the same way as a fractal picture always becomes unclean when we zoom in sufficiently many times: the precision of the computer is no more enough.

===Interpolation===

We can solve the problem with gaps between the iteration bands by applying interpolation: if (in the downward drawing, that is, the drawing of the visual side of the surface) the next pixel drawn is not the pixel next below, we can fill the gap by applying interpolation of the colour values. With this technique we can always produce a picture which is without perceptible faults. Furthermore, the technique means that if we let the reducing factor ''r'' be larger than 1, we can draw a picture which is good enough for choice of motif and colouring very fast (faster than usual fractal pictures, because the fine fractal pattern is lesser discernible).

===Drawing Pixel for Pixel===

The above drawing method is rather effective because we estimate beforehand the situation of the next pixel to be drawn. However, every time something grows up and hide the previous drawn, pixels are drawn again. Furthermore, the irregular way of drawing means that a well working program can be rather complicated (interpolation and calculation of the place in the landscape where to start at the top and stop at the bottom). It is possible to make a simpler program where the picture is drawn regularly from pixel to pixel, implying that each pixel is coloured only one time, but then several calculations are necessary for each pixel. For a given pixel on the screen we go in steps along the line from the observer through this pixel, and we stop when the calculations show that we are below the surface. In principle we could let the steps have one and the same size, but then this size had to be very small and the number of calculations would consequently be very large. Fortunately we have a tool by which we can adjust the steps so that they at first are rather large and then become smaller in the right rate, namely the distance estimation by which the landscape is constructed. But this method presupposes (or rather, works best) when the landscape is turned downwards, that is, formed below instead of above the base plane, because we then can start the stepwise approximation at the point where the line from the observer intersects the base plane and because we can let (the horizontal extent of) all the steps be ruled by the distance estimation.

From the point where the line from the observer intersects the base plane, we go successively forward in steps whose projection on the base plane is half of the estimated distance, for instance. At each step we calculate the height of the step point (on the line) and the height of the surface (below or above this point), and continue as long as the first is smaller than the later. When this is no more the case, we are below the surface, and then we must go backwards and possibly again forwards. Also these steps must be ruled by the distance estimation, because they must be smaller near the boundary. We can let step be ''e×d×dist'', where ''dist'' is the distance estimation and ''e'' = ±1 for the step point above/below the surface, and where ''d'' is a factor which is at first fixed to a given small number (e.g. 0.5) and which is divided by 2 every time ''e'' alters sign. We perform the stepwise approximation until the difference between the two heights is smaller than a given smal number, ''or'' until the maximum iteration number or the boundary is reached, or the number of performed operations is larger than a given large number in order to ensure that the procedure stops. If the found point on the surface corresponds to the complex number ''z'' (in the base plane), we calculate the height of the surface at two points very near ''z'' in the ''x''- and ''y''-direction, in order to find the slope of the surface.

===Shade effect===

We can (as the pictures below show) get the landscape to look more realistic by drawing shades (in the case of natural light or light not coming from the observer): a point on the surface is in shade, and thus made darker, if the line from the point in the direction of the light source has a point below the surface. The method is most profitable in the case of a turned downwards landscape, but even in this case it can be necessary to perform calculations for points outside the visible part of the landscape (unless the light source is above the visible part of the landscape):

1. Identify five independent variables that you believe affect trip generation. Pose hypotheses about how each variable affects number of trips generated.

2. Identify three different types of trip distribution models. Which one includes the most information? Which one is most common?

3. You are given the following situation: The towns of Saint Cloud and Minneapolis, separated by 110 km as the crow flies, are to be connected by a railroad, a freeway, and a rural highway. Answer the following questions related to this problem


Trip Generation and Distribution


Your planners have estimated the following models for the AM Peak Hour

&lt;math&gt;
T_i = 500 + 0.5 * HH
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
T_j = 250 + 0.5 * OFFEMP_j + 0.355 * OTHEMP_j + 0.094 * RETEMP_j
&lt;/math&gt;

Where: 
&lt;math&gt;
T_i = &lt;/math&gt;Person Trips Originating in Zone i


&lt;math&gt;
T_j = &lt;/math&gt;Person Trips Destined for Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
HH_i = &lt;/math&gt; Number of Households in Zone i


&lt;math&gt;
OFFEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Office Employees in Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
OTHEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Other Employees in Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
RETEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Retail Employees in Zone j


Your are also given the following data

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Saint Cloud !! Minneapolis
|-
| HHi || 47,604 || 476,040
|-
| OFFEMPj || 33,675 || 336,750
|-
| OTHEMPj || 14,500 || 145,000
|-
| RETEMPj || 22,000 || 220,000

|}
			
		
		
		

The travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! To Minneapolis !! To Saint Cloud
|-
| From Minneapolis || 5 || 70
|-
| From Saint Cloud || 70 || 5
|}
			

(a) (10) What are the number of AM peak hour person trips originating in and destined for Saint Cloud and Minneapolis.

(b) (10) Assuming the origins are more accurate, normalize the number of destination trips for Saint Cloud and Minneapolis.

(c) (10) Assume a gravity model where the impedance &lt;math&gt;f(Cij) = C_{ij}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. Estimate the proportion of trips that go from Saint Cloud to Minneapolis. Solve your matrix within 5 percent of a balanced solution.

1. Identify five independent variables that you believe affect mode choice. Pose hypotheses about how each variable affects share of travel by each mode.

2. Explain Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives

3. You are given the following mode choice model. 

&lt;math&gt;
U_{ij} = -2 C_{ijm} + 5 D_T -5 D_W 
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
&lt;math&gt;C_{ijm} = &lt;/math&gt; travel time between i and j by mode m

&lt;math&gt;D_T = &lt;/math&gt; dummy variable (alternative specific constant) for transit

&lt;math&gt;D_W = &lt;/math&gt; dummy variable (alternative specific constant) for walking

Here auto is assumed the baseline mode.

The auto travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 5 || 9
|-
| From New Fargo || 9 || 4

|}
		


The transit travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 10 || 15
|-
| From New Fargo || 15 || 8

|}



The walk travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 10 || 30
|-
| From New Fargo || 30 || 10

|}


Using a logit model, what is the probability of a traveler taking transit?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Homework ==
1. If trip distribution depends on travel times, and travel times depend on the trip table (resulting from trip distribution) that is assigned to the road network, how do we solve this problem (conceptually)?

2. Do drivers behave in a system optimal or a user optimal way? How can you get them to move from one to the other.

3. Identify a mechanism that can ensure the system optimal outcome is achieved in route assignment, rather than the user equilibrium. Why would we want such an outcome? What are the drawbacks to the mechanism you identified?

4. Assume the flow from Dakotopolis to New Fargo, is 5300 vehicles per hour. The flow is divided between two parallel facilities, a freeway and an arterial. Flow on the freeway is denoted &lt;math&gt;Q_f&lt;/math&gt;, and flow on the two-lane arterial is denoted &lt;math&gt;Q_r&lt;/math&gt;. The travel time on the freeway (&lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:

&lt;math&gt;C_f = 5 + Q_f/1000&lt;/math&gt;

The travel time on the arterial (Cr) is given by

&lt;math&gt;C_r = 7 + Q_r/500.&lt;/math&gt;

(a)	Apply Wardrop's User Equilibrium Principle, and determine the flow and travel time on both routes from Dakotopolis to New Fargo. 

(b)	Solve for the System Optimal Solution and determine the flow and travel time on both routes. 

5. Given a flow of 10,000 vehicles from origin to destination traveling on three parallel routes. Flow on each route A, B, or C is designated with &lt;math&gt;Q_A, Q_B, Q_C&lt;/math&gt; in the Time Function Respectively. Apply Wardrop's Network Equilibrium Principle (Users Equalize Travel Times on all used routes), and determine the flow on each route. 


&lt;math&gt;T_A = 500 + 20Q_A&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_B = 1000 + 10Q_B&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_C = 2000 + 30Q_C&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PL/SQL==
===Introduction===
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extension of SQL. It is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages and it enhances the capabilities of SQL by injecting the procedural functionality, like conditional or looping statements, into the set-oriented SQL structure.

===Advantages of PL/SQL===
* Procedural Language Capability: PL/SQL consists of procedural language constructs such as conditional statements (if else statements) and loops like (FOR loops).
* Block Structures: PL/SQL consists of blocks of code, which can be nested within each other. Each block forms a unit of a task or a logical module. PL/SQL Blocks can be stored in the database and reused.
* Better Performance: PL/SQL engine processes multiple SQL statements simultaneously as a single block, thereby reducing network traffic. 
* Exception Handling: PL/SQL handles exceptions (or errors) effectively during the execution of a PL/SQL program. Once an exception is caught, specific actions can be taken depending upon the type of the exception or it can be displayed to the user with a message.

===Limitation===
PL/SQL can only use SELECT, DML(INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE) and TC(COMMIT,ROLLBACK,SAVEPOINT) statements, DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) and DCL(GRANT, REVOKE) cannot be used.

===Basic Structure===
Each PL/SQL program consists of SQL and PL/SQL statements which form a PL/SQL block. A PL/SQL Block consists of three sections: 

'''Declaration Section:'''
This section is optional and it starts with the reserved keyword DECLARE. This section is used to declare any placeholders like variables, constants, records and cursors, which are used to manipulate data in the execution section. 

'''Execution Section:'''
This section is mandatory and it starts with the reserved keyword BEGIN and ends with END. This section is where the program logic is written to perform any task. The programmatic constructs like loops, conditional statement and SQL statements form the part of execution section. 

'''Exception Section''':
The section is optional and it starts with the reserved keyword EXCEPTION. Any exception in the program can be handled in this section, so that the PL/SQL Blocks terminates gracefully. If the PL/SQL Block contains exceptions that cannot be handled, the block terminates abruptly with errors.

Every statement in the above three sections must end with a ; (semicolon). PL/SQL blocks can be nested within other PL/SQL blocks. Comments can be used to document code. 

This is how PL/SQL looks. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
/* multi-lines comments */
-- single line comments
DECLARE 
    Variable declaration
BEGIN 
    Program Execution 
EXCEPTION 
    Exception handling
END;
&lt;/source&gt;

===PL/SQL Placeholders===
Placeholders are temporary storage area. Placeholders can be any of Variables, Constants and Records. Oracle defines placeholders to store data temporarily, which are used to manipulate data during the execution of a PL SQL block. 

Depending on the kind of data you want to store, you can define placeholders with a name and a datatype. Few of the datatypes used to define placeholders are as given below. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
Number(n,m), Char(n), Varchar2(n), Date, Long, Long Raw, Raw, Blob, Clob, Nclob, Bfile 
&lt;/source&gt;
The placeholders, that store the values, can change through the PL/SQL Block. 

====PL/SQL Variables====
The General Syntax to declare a variable is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := value ]; 
&lt;/source&gt;
* variable_name is the name of the variable.
* datatype is a valid PL/SQL datatype. 
* NOT NULL is an optional specification on the variable. If NOT NULL is specified, you must provide the initial value.
* value or DEFAULT value is also an optional specification, where you can initialize a variable.
* Each variable declaration is a separate statement and must be terminated by a semicolon. 

The below example declares two variables, one of which is a not null.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE 
  emp_id varchar2(10);
  salary number(9,2) NOT NULL := 1000.00;
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of a variable can change in the execution or exception section of the PL/SQL Block. We can assign values to variables in the two ways given below. 

1) Directly assign value to variable. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
variable_name:=  value;
&lt;/source&gt;

2) Assign values to variables directly from the database columns.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
SELECT column_name
INTO variable_name 
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];  
&lt;/source&gt;

The example below will get the salary of an employee with id '12345' and display it on the screen.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
  var_emp_id varchar2(10) = 'A12345'; 
  var_salary number(9,2);  
BEGIN 
  SELECT salary
  INTO var_salary
  FROM employee
  WHERE emp_id = var_emp_id;
  dbms_output.put_line(var_salary);
  dbms_output.put_line('Employee ' || var_emp_id || ' earns salary ' || var_salary); 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt;
NOTE: The slash '/' indicates to execute the above PL/SQL Block. 

====PL/SQL Records====
Records are composite datatypes, which contains a combination of different scalar datatypes like char, varchar, number etc.  Each scalar data types in the record holds a value. A record can store values of a row in a table. 

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
TYPE record_name IS RECORD 
  (col_name_1 datatype, 
   col_name_2 table_name.column_name%type); 
&lt;/source&gt;
A datatype can be declared in the same way as you create a table, like col_name_1. If a field is based on a column from database table, you can define the datatype as col_name_2. You can also use %type method to declare datatype of variable and constant.
Similar to %type, if all the fields of a record are based on the columns of a table, it can be declared by using %rowtype method.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
record_name table_name%ROWTYPE;
&lt;/source&gt;

For Example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  TYPE rec_employee IS RECORD 
   (emp_id          varchar2(10), 
    emp_last_name   employees.last_name%type, 
    emp_dept        employees.dept%type,
    salary          number(9,2)
   ); 
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  rec_employee employees%ROWTYPE; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Declaring the record as a ROWTYPE
Advantages:
1) Do not need to explicitly declare variables for all the columns in a table.
2) If the column specification in the database table is altered, the code does not need to update.

Disadvantage:
1) When a record is created as a ROWTYPE, fields will be created for all the columns in the table and memory will be used to create the datatype for all the fields. 

'''Assign values to record'''
Similar to variable, you can assign value to record either by direct assign or through the SELECT statements
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
record_name.col_name := value;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
SELECT col_1, col_2 
INTO record_name.col_name_1, record_name.col_name_2 
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition]; 
&lt;/source&gt;
If the records is declared as ROWTYPE, SELECT * can be used to assign values.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
SELECT * INTO record_name
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition]; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The column value of the record can be retrieved as below syntax
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
var_name := record_name.col_name; 
&lt;/source&gt;

====Scope of Variables and Records====
PL/SQL allows the nesting of Blocks within Blocks i.e, the Execution section of an outer block can contain inner blocks. Variables which are accessible to an outer Block are also accessible to all nested inner blocks; however, the variables declared in the inner blocks are not accessible to the outer blocks. 

Based on their declaration we can classify variables into two types. 
*Local variables - These are declared in a inner block and cannot be referenced by outer blocks.
*Global variables - These are declared in an outer block and can be referenced by its itself and by its inner blocks. 

In the below example, two variables are created in the outer block and assigning their product to the third variable created in the inner block. The variables 'var_num1' and 'var_num2' can be accessed anywhere in the block; however, the variable 'var_result' is declared in the inner block, so it cannot be accessed in the outer block.  
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
  var_num1 number;
  var_num2 number;
BEGIN 
  var_num1 := 100; 
  var_num2 := 200; 
  DECLARE 
    var_result number;
  BEGIN
    var_result := var_num1 * var_num2; 
  END;
  /* var_result is not accessible to here */ 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt;

====PL/SQL Constants====
As the name implies a constant is a value used in a PL/SQL Block that remains unchanged throughout the program. A constant is a user-defined literal value. You can declare a constant and use it instead of actual value.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;
&lt;/source&gt;
For example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  comm_pct CONSTANT number(3) := 10; 
&lt;/source&gt;

You must assign a value to the constant while declaring it. If you assign a value to the constant later, Oracle will prompt exception. 

===PL/SQL Conditional Statements===
PL/SQL supports programming language features like conditional statements, iterative statements.

The syntax of conditional statements:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
IF condition_1 THEN 
 statement_1; 
 statement_2; 
[ELSIF condtion_2 THEN 
 statement_3;] 
[ELSE 
 statement_4;] 
END IF;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note: be aware of the keyword ELSIF, there is no 'E' before 'IF'.

===PL/SQL Iterative Statements===
An iterative statements are used when you want to repeat the execution of one or more statements for specified number of times. There are three types of loops in PL/SQL:

'''1. Simple Loop'''
A Simple Loop is used when a set of statements is to be executed at least once before the loop terminates. An EXIT condition must be specified in the loop, otherwise the loop will get into an infinite number of iterations. When the EXIT condition is satisfied the process exits from the loop.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
LOOP 
  statements; 
  EXIT; 
  {or EXIT WHEN condition;}
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) Initialize a variable before the loop body.
b) Increment the variable in the loop.
c) Use a EXIT WHEN statement to exit from the Loop. If you use a EXIT statement without WHEN condition, the statements in the loop is executed only once.

'''2. While Loop'''
A WHILE LOOP is used when a set of statements has to be executed as long as a condition is true. The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. The iteration continues until the condition becomes false.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
WHILE &lt;condition&gt; 
 LOOP statements; 
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) Initialize a variable before the loop body.
b) Increment the variable in the loop.
c) EXIT WHEN statement and EXIT statements can be used in while loops it is seldom used.

'''3. FOR Loop'''
A FOR LOOP is used to execute a set of statements for a pre-determined number of times. Iteration occurs between the start and end integer values given. The counter is always incremented by 1. The loop exits when the counter reaches the value of the end integer.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
FOR counter IN start_val..end_val 
  LOOP statements; 
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) The counter variable is implicitly declared in the declaration section, so it's not necessary to declare it explicitly.
b) The counter variable is incremented by 1 and does not need to be incremented explicitly.
c) EXIT WHEN statement and EXIT statements can be used in FOR loops but it is seldom used.

===PL/SQL Cursors===
A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it. This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved from the database, and manipulate this data. A cursor can hold more than one row, but can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the active set. 

There are two types of cursors in PL/SQL: 

====Implicit cursor:====
When you execute DML statements like DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE and SELECT..INTO statements, implicit statements are created to process these statements.

Oracle provides few attributes called as implicit cursor attributes to check the status of DML operations. The cursor attributes available are %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ROWCOUNT, and %ISOPEN.

For example, When you execute INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements the cursor attributes tell us whether any rows are affected and how many have been affected.
When a SELECT... INTO statement is executed in a PL/SQL Block, implicit cursor attributes can be used to find out whether any row has been returned by the SELECT statement. PL/SQL returns an error when no data is selected.

The status of the cursor for each of these attributes are defined in the below table.  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attribute !! Return Value 
|-
| SQL%FOUND || The return value is TRUE, if the DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE affect at least one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement return at least one row.
The return value is FALSE, if DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE do not affect row and if SELECT….INTO statement do not return a row. 
|-
| SQL%NOTFOUND || The return value is FALSE, if DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE at least one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement return at least one row.
The return value is TRUE, if a DML statement like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE do not affect even one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement does not return a row.
|-
| SQL%ROWCOUNT || Return the number of rows affected by the DML operations INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT
|-
| SQL%ISOPEN || Always return FALSE
|}

uses implicit cursor attributes:
&lt;SOURCE lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE  var_rows number(5);
BEGIN
  UPDATE employee 
  SET salary = salary + 2000;
  IF SQL%NOTFOUND THEN
    dbms_output.put_line('None of the salaries where updated');
  ELSIF SQL%FOUND THEN
    var_rows := SQL%ROWCOUNT;
    dbms_output.put_line('Salaries for ' || var_rows || 'employees are updated');
  END IF; 
END; 
&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

In the above PL/SQL Block, the salaries of all the employees in the 'employee' table are updated. If none of the employee's salary are updated we get a message 'None of the salaries where updated'. Else we get a message like for example, 'Salaries for 100 employees are updated' if there are 100 rows in 'employee' table.

====Explicit cursor:====
An explicit cursor is defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL Block. It must be created when you are executing a SELECT statement that returns more than one row. Even though the cursor stores multiple records, only one record can be processed at a time, which is called as current row. When you fetch a row the current row position moves to next row.

There are four steps in using an Explicit Cursor.
* '''DECLARE''' the cursor in the declaration section.
* '''OPEN''' the cursor in the Execution Section.
* '''FETCH''' the data from cursor into PL/SQL variables or records in the Execution Section.
* '''CLOSE''' the cursor in the Execution Section before you end the PL/SQL Block.

Declaration
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;
&lt;/source&gt;
For example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE
   CURSOR cur_emp IS 
   SELECT * 
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary &gt; 10000; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Using Cursor
When a cursor is opened, the first row becomes the current row. When the data is fetched it is copied to the record or variables and the logical pointer moves to the next row and it becomes the current row. On every fetch statement, the pointer moves to the next row. If you want to fetch after the last row, the program will throw an error. When there is more than one row in a cursor we can use loops along with explicit cursor attributes to fetch all the records.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
OPEN cursor_name;
FETCH cursor_name INTO record_name|variable_list;
CLOSE cursor_name;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
* We can fetch the rows in a cursor to a PL/SQL Record or a list of variables created in the PL/SQL Block.
* If you are fetching a cursor to a PL/SQL Record, the record should have the same structure as the cursor.
* If you are fetching a cursor to a list of variables, the variables should be listed in the same order in the fetch statement as the columns are present in the cursor.
* When we try to open a cursor which is not closed in the previous operation, it throws exception.
* When we try to fetch a cursor after the last operation, it throws exception.

For Example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  rec_emp employees%rowtype;
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary &gt; 10000; 
BEGIN 
  OPEN cur_emp; 
  FETCH cur_emp INTO rec_emp; 
    dbms_output.put_line (rec_emp.first_name || '  ' 
                       || rec_emp.last_name); 
  CLOSE emp_cur; 
END; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Oracle provides some attributes known as Explicit Cursor Attributes to control the data processing while using cursors. We use these attributes to avoid errors while accessing cursors through OPEN, FETCH and CLOSE Statements.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attributes !! Return Values
|-
| Cursor_name%FOUND || TRUE, if fetch statement returns at least one row. 
FALSE, if fetch statement doesn’t return a row.
|-
| Cursor_name%NOTFOUND || TRUE, , if fetch statement doesn’t return a row.
FALSE, if fetch statement returns at least one row.
|-
| Cursor_name%ROWCOUNT || The number of rows fetched by the fetch statement.
If no row is returned, the PL/SQL statement returns an error.
|-
| Cursor_name%ISOPEN || TRUE, if the cursor is already open in the program.
FALSE, if the cursor is not opened in the program.
|}

Cursor with a Simple Loop:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
  rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  IF NOT cur_emp%ISOPEN THEN 
    OPEN cur_emp; 
  END IF; 
  LOOP 
    FETCH cur_emp INTO rec_emp; 
    EXIT WHEN cur_emp%NOTFOUND; 
    dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
      || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary); 
  END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
&lt;/source&gt;

The cursor attribute %ISOPEN is used to check if the cursor is open, if the condition is true the program does not open the cursor again.
The cursor attribute %NOTFOUND is used to check whether the fetch returned any row. If there is no row found, the program would exit. Typically, when the cursor reach the last row, no more row can be fetched.

Cursor with a While Loop:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
  rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  IF NOT cur_emp%ISOPEN THEN 
    OPEN cur_emp; 
  END IF; 
  FETCH cur_emp INTO sales_rec;  
 WHILE cur_emp%FOUND THEN  
 LOOP 
   dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
   || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary); 
   FETCH cur_emp INTO sales_rec; 
 END LOOP; 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt; 
Using %FOUND to evaluate if the first fetch statement returned a row, if TRUE, the program moves into the while loop. Inside the loop, use fetch statement again to process the next row. If the fetch statement is not executed once before the while loop, the while condition will return false in the first instance and the while loop is skipped. 

Cursor with a FOR Loop:
When using FOR LOOP, you do not need to declare a record or variables to store the cursor values, do not need to open, fetch and close the cursor. These functions are accomplished by the FOR LOOP automatically.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
 CURSOR cur_emp IS 
   SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
 rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  FOR rec_emp in cur_emp 
  LOOP  
    dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
    || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary);  
  END LOOP; 
END;
/
&lt;/source&gt;
When the FOR loop is processed a record 'rec_emp' of structure 'cur_emp' gets created, the cursor is opened, the rows are fetched to the record 'rec_emp' and the cursor is closed after the last row is processed. By using FOR Loop, you can reduce the number of lines in the program.

===PL/SQL Exception Handling===

===PL/SQL Procedures===
When calling store procedure from the PL/SQL Block, you simply use the store procedure name to call. If you prefix the 'EXECUTE' keyword in front of the store procedure name, you will receive an error.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
my_sproc;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
EXECUTE my_sproc;

PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol &quot;my_sproc&quot; when expecting one of the following:
:= . ( @ % ; immediate
The symbol &quot;:=&quot; was substituted for &quot;my_sproc&quot; to continue.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE my_sproc;

PLS-00222: no function with name exists in this scope
&lt;/source&gt;

===PL/SQL Functions===

===Parameters-Procedure,Function===
{{...}}
===PL/SQL Triggers===

If you were to download this version of Bodhisattva-caryavatara (the #1 above) to your computer, I believe you'll be able to access the links to the footnotes interactively.  It worked when I did it, but right now I'm not sure if it's because I set it up as a .PDF file.  If it works, please enjoy. :-) Let me know too.

The overhand knot is a very simple knot. It jams very easily, so you may want to use an [[Knots/Stopper knots/Overhand knot with draw-loop|overhand knot with a draw loop]].

The overhand knot with draw-loop similar to the [[Knots/Stopper knots/Overhand knot|overhand knot]]. It releases with a tug on the free end, which allows it to be untied easily. To tie it, form a loop, then make a bight out of the working end and put it through, tightening by pulling on the standing end.

==Cells==
[[Image:Chloroplasten.jpg|thumb|right| Plant cells]]

All living things are made of cells. They are the components and building blocks of life.

==What is a cell?==
''A cell is a bag of liquid that holds in the stuff of life.''


A '''cell''' is the smallest unit of living (things)organism.  If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.  '''Robert Hooke''', a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.  They looked like rooms.  Small rooms are sometimes called ''cells'', so he named them that.

==What types of cells are there?==
There are two kinds of cells:
'''eukaryotes''', which have a large ball in them called a ''nucleus'', and '''prokaryotes''', which do not.

Most prokaryotes are very small.  Prokaryotes include just two '''kingdoms''': '''Bacteria''' and '''Archea'''.
All of the rest of the kingdoms are Eukaryotes: '''Animals''' , '''Plants''', '''Fungi''', and '''Protists'''.

==What do cells look like?==
Cells are surrounded by a thin oil layer called the ''cell membrane''.  It separates the inside of the cell from the outside.  Some cells also have a firm box around them called a ''cell wall'' that keeps it from breaking.  The water that fills a cell is called the ''cytoplasm''.  Inside a cell, knowledge is stored in a thing called a ''chromosome''.  It tells the cell how to work, like steps in a book.

Eukaryotic cells hold their chromosomes in a structure called a '''nucleus''', which has its own oily membrane around it.  Cells also have many other membrane-bound things called '''organelles''', which means &quot;little organs&quot;.  Some organelles found in eukaryotic cells are called ''ribosomes'', ''vacuoles'', ''mitochondria'', and ''chloroplasts''.
[[Image:Human spermatozoa.png|left|600px|Human sperm cell]]


Cells that do different things have different shapes. A plant leaf cell takes light and uses it to make sugar. To do this, it has green organelles called ''chloroplasts''. To get the most light  it pushes cytoplasm in circles around a hollow bubble of water in the center of the cell called a ''vacuole''. 

A human sperm cell carries its chromosomes, found in the nucleus, to an egg cell in order to make a new baby. It has a large tail called a ''flagella'' that helps it to swim. It also has many organelles called ''mitochondria'' that give it power like gasoline gives power to a motor.

====Words====
:'''nucleus''' - A ball of membrane in the middle of the cell that holds the chromosomes.
:'''chromosomes''' - Things that hold the knowledge of the cell.
:'''prokaryote''' - A cell without a nucleus.
:'''eukaryote''' - A cell with a nucleus.
:'''organelles''' - Little things inside a cell.
:'''cytoplasm''' - The gel-like inside of a cell.
:'''membrane''' - An oil bag that holds water.
:'''vacuole''' - An organelle full of water and waste inside a cell.
:'''mitochondria''' - An organelle that makes power in a cell.
:'''chloroplast''' - An organelle that makes sugar found in a plant or protist.
:'''flagella''' - A tail on a cell that makes it swim.
:'''golgi body''' - An organelle which helps in secretion.
:'''ribosome''' - An organelle which helps in synthesis of proteins.

'''Biology''' is the study of ''Life''.  It helps us understand many things, such as how our body works, how our body keeps warm, and what we are made of.  Biology is very important to know.  Some subjects in Biology are Genetics, Zoology, Botany, and Ecology.

A Biologist is someone who studies Biology.

==What is life?==
Living things are different from things that are not alive.  It is usually easy to tell what is living and what is not, except with really small &quot;microscopic&quot; life forms and colorless, lifeless-looking mosses.

Here are some properties of living things.  Some non-living things can have some of these properties.

:Living things can change and grow.  However, volcanoes also change and grow.

:Living things can move.  However, the wind is moving air, and water always moves downhill.

:: You probably want to know how plants can move.  They can grow, and sometimes move more rapidly than that, in response to things such as the sun or water. One example is that sunflowers will turn during the course of the day so that they are always facing the sun.  Another example is that if a plant gets tipped over, it will want to turn upwards.

:Living things can reproduce.  That is they can produce copies of themselves, over and over.  This is the most important difference between living and non-living things.

:: In order to reproduce,  living things need nutrition, that is chemicals and energy sources in order to assemble the materials needed to reproduce themselves.  In this process , living things must excrete waste.  Waste is material which is of no use, or harmful.

Animals, bacteria, and plants are examples of living things.  Rivers, mountains, oceans, and soil are examples of non-living things, but often they are homes for living things.

Cars and tables are not living things because they cannot reproduce themselves.

== Levels of Life==
Living things can be many sizes. Also, biologists organize the structures and groupings of living creatures according to size.   A living creature is called an organism.  Organisms can consist of single cells or multiple different types of cells grouped into tissues and organs.  
From small to large, these are how living things are grouped.

*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|Cells]]
*:Most cells are only a few microns wide, so small they can only be seen with a microscope.  A micron is one thousandth of a millimeter.
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues|Tissues]]
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Organs|Organs]]
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems|Organ systems]]
*Organisms
*Populations
*Communities
*Ecosystems
*Biomes
*Biosphere
*: The biosphere is the whole network of living things on planet Earth &amp;mdash; eight thousand miles in diameter, twenty five thousand miles around the equator.

Each thing in the list is made up of the things above it.  For example, communities are made of many populations and populations are made up of many organisms.

==Kingdoms==

When we look at living things we divide them up into groups and give the groups names. This is called '''classification'''.

Living things are classified into groups of different sizes.  The biggest groups contain almost everything.  The smallest groups have only a few types of living things in them.

The groups are, from large to small:

:Domain
:Kingdom
:Phylum
:Class
:Order
:Family
:Genus
:Species


The domains are ''Bacteria'', ''Archaea'', and ''Eukarya'', but most people still find it easiest to divide things by '''kingdom'''.

The six kingdoms are:
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Archaea|Archaea]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|Bacteria]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Animals|Animalia (Animals)]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Plants|Plantae (Plants)]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Fungi|Fungi (Funguses and mushrooms)]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Protists|Protista (Protists and Algae)]]

==Animals==

Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move. Only animals have brains (though not even all animals do; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).

Animals are found all over the earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.

Humans are a type of animal.  So are dogs, cats, cows, horses, frogs, fish, and so on and on.

Animals can be divided into two main groups, vertebrates and invertebrates.  Vertebrates can be further divided into mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  Invertebrates can be divided into arthropods (like insects, spiders, and crabs), mollusks, sponges, several different kinds of worms, jellyfish &amp;mdash; and quite a few other subgroups.  There are at least thirty kinds of invertebrates, compared to the five kinds of vertebrates.

[[Image:Colourful_Thermophilic_Archaebacteria_Stain_in_Midway_Geyser_Basin.jpg|thumb|400px|Colorful archea]]
Archea are creatures made up of single cells. They have been on Earth for a long, long time. Their name means old.

Archea have no nucleus in their single cell. They were once called bacteria, but they were taken out of the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|kingdom bacteria]] because they are so different.

==Bacteria==

'''Bacteria''' are single celled creatures with no nucleus. They are very, very small. They grow all over the Earth, in the ground, in the water, and even in our bodies.

Some bacteria can cause diseases, but most do good things like break down waste and make ''oxygen''.

==Fungi==

'''Fungi''' are mostly made of many cells. Fungi made of single cells are called ''yeasts''. They are also part of a group of living things called 'Eukaryotes', just like animals and plants. We're closer to mushrooms and yeasts than you think!

Lots of people, when they see fungi, think of mushrooms, however there are lots of different types of fungi, not just mushrooms and toadstools.

Fungi are very important because they break down waste. The leaves on the bottom of a forest would get higher and higher if fungi were not there to eat it.

Fungi are also important producers of food for humans. Also, yeasts are used to make wine, beer, and bread.  Some fungi are bad for our food, however, such as mould.

==Protists==

[[Image:Protist_collage.jpg|thumb|300px|protists]]

Most '''protists''' are made of single cells.  They are bigger than [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Archaea|archaea]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]], and protist cells have a nucleus.

There are many different kinds of protist cells.  Most live in the water, but some live in the soil or in animals.  Some protists can cause diseases.

Green Algae is in the kingdom Protista.  These can be small single cells or very large with many cells.  ''Sea weed'' is algae and is in the kingdom Protista.

==Plants==

Plants are made of many [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]].  Plants are usually green.  Plants make their food from the sun.  They use the light, carbon dioxide, and water to make glucose (sugar).  Animals, fungi, some bacteria, and some protists eat plants for food.


Plants make ''oxygen'' which humans breathe, and they take in ''carbon-dioxide'' which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).  Plants make their food from the sun by ''photosynthesis''.  They also provide shade.  We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants.  Most foods that we eat are plants.  Without plants, animals could not survive.

==What is photosynthesis?==

Photosynthesis is making sugar using the energy of light.

===Why are plants green?===
Plants are green because they have green Chloroplasts. 

But why are Chloroplasts green?
Chloroplasts are green because they contain the green pigment ''chlorophyll'' in their thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs red and blue light.

[[Image:Humhrt2.jpg | A heart|thumb]]
Many living things have '''Organs'''.

Your Heart, Brain, Lungs, Liver, and Kidneys are organs.

Organs are made of two or more [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues |tissues]].

Organs each have something that they do. The heart pumps blood. The lungs give you air. 

Organs work together in groups called [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems|Organ systems]].

==The Circulatory System==

The '''Circulatory System''' moves blood around your body. This blood carries food and ''oxygen'' around to all of the cells of the body. It also carries signals called '''hormones''' that help the body work together.

The major organ of the circulatory system is the '''heart''', which pumps the blood.  Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called '''arteries''' and comes back to the heart in tubes called '''veins'''.  The smallest tubes are called '''capillaries'''.

[[Image:Digestive_system_diagram_en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Digestive system]]
==The Digestive System==
The '''digestive system''' is what a human uses to eat. Food comes in through our ''mouth'' is broken down in our ''stomach'' and our body takes the food in through the ''intestines''. Then the waste goes out through the ''anus''.

The digestive system is made of many organs. Here are some of the organs and their functions:
:'''Oesophagus''' - Pushes food down into the stomach. 
:'''Stomach''' - Breaks down complex sugar by acid.  
:'''Liver''' - Makes a thing called ''bile'' that breaks down fat.

==The Endocrine System==

The human body is made of many, many cells. To make the cells work together, the body sends signals through the blood called ''hormones'' that tell the cells in the body what to do. 


The '''Endocrine System''' is the [[../|organ system]] made of the organs that make hormones.

The endocrine system organs:

#Pineal gland
#Pituitary gland
#Thyroid gland
#Thymus
#Adrenal gland
#Pancreas
#Ovary
#Testis

==Immune System==
[[Image:PBEosinophil.jpg|thumb|A disease, that our Immune System tries to fight against.]]
The '''immune system''' protects our bodies from disease. Cells called ''white blood cells'' found in our blood are able to kill bad things such as [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Viruses|viruses]].

There are many different types of white blood cells. Some of them make things called '''antibodies''' that stick to things that enter our bodies making them easy to find. Other white blood cells get rid of bacteria and stop viruses like the flu.

When our immune system does not work well, we are vulnerable to disease caused by [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Viruses|viruses]].  Problems with the immune system include '''allergies'''; in allergies, white blood cells attack things that are not bad, like pollen in our eyes or cat dander.  '''AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)''' is a disease caused by a virus that kills some white blood cells, leaving our bodies vulnerable to bacteria or viruses.

==The Integumentary System==

The '''Integumentary System''' is the system of the body made up of the skin, the nails, and the hair.

Skin keeps you cool by sweating. It also protects you by keeping things out of your body. The hair on your body keeps you warm.
Skin also holds [[../Nervous System|nerves]] that we use to touch and hold and kiss.  Your nails help you pick up things.  The skin is the largest organ of the human body.

==Muscular system==
[[Image:Illu head neck muscle.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The ''muscles'' of the body are what make the body move. 
They are made of muscle [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues|tissues]].

All of the muscles of the body together make up the '''muscular system'''. 

Signals from the [[../Nervous System#Senses|nervous system]] tell the muscles when to move.  The muscles are attached to the [[../Skeletal System|skeleton]] which holds them up.

[[Image:Nervous system diagram-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The nervous system]]

==The Nervous System==

The ''nervous system'' helps you sense the world around you. It includes the ''brain'' and the ''nerves'' as well as the ''senses''.

The nervous system can sense changes inside and outside the body through specialized cells called ''receptors''. 
This information, in the form of small electric currents, is analyzed and responses are generated in the nervous system.  These responses, again in the form of small electric currents, are conveyed to the appropriate organs such as muscles or glands, at a great speed.

==={{anchor|Senses}}The Senses===
Your five senses are: ''smell'' (with your nose), ''taste'' (with your tongue), ''touch'' (with your fingers, and so on), ''sight'' (with your eyes), and ''hearing'' (with your ears). 
[[Image:Nose with glasses.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A child's nose]]

If human beings couldn't smell, they wouldn't know if their food had a bad odor.  If they couldn't taste either, they might like to eat everything, or, also bad in a different way, they might not like to eat anything.  If they couldn't see, it would be harder for them to find their way around and avoid danger.  And if they couldn't hear, they could not communicate with each other as easily.

==How are babies made?==

In humans there are two sexes: ''Men'' and ''Women''.  Babies are made when [[Wikijunior:Biology/Cells|cells]] called ''sperm'' (produced by men) get together with cells called ''eggs'' (produced by women) in a process called '''fertilization'''.  When the cells combine, they form a new cell, called a '''zygote''' (''zy'' rhymes with ''eye''; ''gote'' sounds like ''goat'') which has all it needs to make a new man or woman.  The zygote will make a baby like his mother and father.

==Where do babies come from?==
[[Image:Month_6.svg‎ |thumb|right| A baby grows in its mother.]]

Babies come from their mother. To make a baby, the father must put his sperm into the mother's body. This is called ''having sex''. The man puts his ''penis'' into the woman's ''vagina'' and the sperm cells swim into the mother's body.
Fertilization happens in the mother. The new zygote grows into a ball which will stick to the mother's '''womb'''. This ball grows into a baby.

Nine months later (266 days after fertilization) a new baby will come out of the mother's vagina in a process called '''birth'''.

====Words====
'''cell''' - Things that are alive are made of little boxes called cells.

'''womb''' - The place in a body where a baby grows. 

'''zygote''' - The one cell made from a sperm cell and an egg cell that will grow into a person.

'''sperm''' - A sex cell made by a man.

'''egg''' - A sex cell made by a woman.

'''fertilization''' - When sperm and egg get together and make a zygote.

==The Respiratory System==
The '''Respiratory System''' is how air gets into our bodies. We breathe in and out with our '''lungs'''. The air we breathe in has something called ''oxygen'' that our cells need. Cells make ''carbon dioxide'' which can poison our bodies. Our lungs push this out of our bodies.

The respiratory system works together with the [[../Circulatory System|circulatory system]] to make sure that air gets to each cell of the body.

Parts of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. 

*Air comes in through the nose and mouth. 
*Dust is removed by the hair in the nose. 
*Air goes through the pharynx (in the back of the mouth), the larynx or the voice box, and down the trachea (windpipe). 
*The trachea splits into two major bronchi, one for each lung. 
*This further splits into smaller bronchi, then into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles'' which lead into the air sacs called ''alveoli''. 
*This is where the oxygen goes into the blood and carbon dioxide comes out.

==The Skeletal System==
[[Image:Human_skeleton_front_en.svg|thumb|The human skeleton.]]
The '''Skeletal System''' is made of all of the bones in the body.  It protects the [[../Reproductive System|reproductive organs]] and is a place for [[../Muscular System|muscles]] to attach.  Bones are a very important part of the human body.  Without them, we would simply collapse, and be very unstable.  They support all of our tissue and muscles, and they are very difficult to break.

The inside of the bones is called the ''bone marrow''.  This is where most [[../Circulatory System|blood cells]] are made.

==The Urinary System==

The '''Urinary system''' takes bad things out of the blood and washes it out of the body.  This liquid waste is called '''urine'''.  Without the urinary system, poisons would fill up the blood and kill a person.  The '''kidneys''' are [[Wikijunior:Biology/Organs|organs]] that filter the blood and remove poison.  Urine is stored in a bag called the '''bladder''' and it leaves the body through a tube called the '''urethra'''.

==Tissues==

Organisms are made of tissues.  Tissues are groups of [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]] that work together.  
Plant leaves have tissues that capture light and make sugar. Most animals have '''muscle''' tissues that help them move.

When two or more tissues work together to do one thing they make up [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Organs | organs]].

In plants, there are two types of tissues:

*'''Meristematic tissue''': This has actively dividing cells.
*'''Permanent tissue''': This type of tissue has developed cells. They do not divide.
**'''Simple permanent tissue''': This type of permanent tissue has only one kind of cells.
***'''Parenchyma''': They have loosely packed cells. The cells do not have a particular function.
***'''Collenchyma''': They have cells which have layers called [[w:pectin|pectin]]. They contain chlorophyll.
***'''Sclerenchyma''': They have dead cells. Between the cells, there are layers called lignin.
**'''Complex permanent tissue''': This type of tissue contains different kinds of cells.
***'''Xylem''': This type of tissue contains mainly dead cells. They help to move water from the roots to leaves.
***'''Phloem''': This type of tissue contains mainly living cells. They help moving food materials from leaves to other parts.

==Viruses==
[[File:Rotavirus Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|A virus called a rotavirus, which can cause diarrhoea.]]
Viruses are much smaller than other living things like [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]], so small that it would take around one hundred viruses laid end to end just to make the length of a bacterium! Viruses are not really alive.  They do not do all of the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Introduction#What is life?|things that living things do]].  They can only make more copies of themselves when they are inside living cells.

Viruses often kill [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]], and also make you ill. Lots of diseases are caused by viruses, the most famous ones being the flu and many colds.

==Too many subcategories?==
The use of 13 sub-categories makes more work when checking for recent changes. Why not cut them down to a smaller number (1 if possible). [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:23, 21 May 2010 (UTC)
:I have modified the template [[Template:French/Section_template]], [[Template:French/Grammar/Tenses and moods]] &amp; [[Template:French/Grammar]] to use the {{BookCat}} template to put all the book's pages into the French category, without removing the old sub-categories yet. This is because the templates are quite elaborate and I am not confident about making large changes. Some more simplification in the templates could make the book easier to maintain I think, as well as helping to fix the print version of the book which seems to be broken at present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a complete step-by-step guide on how to run your own [[pywikibot]] on Wikimedia projects, from your Mac, hopefully more easy and readable than the original one.

== Downloading ==
=== Downloading MacPython ===
Apple provides an installation of Python with every Mac OS X installation, by default. You don’t need to install Python, but you might want to update it. Here are the instructions.

First of all, you need to download Python, the application that reads the scripts and does something with them. Download MacPython from [http://python.org/download/ here], choosing “Python 2.5.2 for Macintosh OS X”. Open the downloaded dmg file and install it. In Applications in Finder you should now find a folder named “MacPython 2.5”. Nothing else needs to be done here, close Finder.

'''NOTE:''' A new application will be installed on your Mac, with the name “IDLE”. It’s just difficult and confusing, and nothing worth spending time on trying to use.

=== Downloading SVN ===
Many Wikimedia projects require that you always should run the latest version of the Pywikipedia framework. The easiest option is to use SVN. This is no harder than running the bot itself. 

If you are using 10.5 or below, download “My Subversion-1.5.5 Package” from [http://web.archive.org/20040404043620/homepage.mac.com/martinott/ this page]. Open the Subversion-1.5.5 package, and complete the installation. Now, everything is all set to download the scripts.

=== Downloading the scripts ===
Open Terminal, you can find it by searching for it in Spotlight. Now, copy-paste the following into Terminal, and press enter/return:
&lt;pre&gt;svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/ pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;

A folder will be created in the ''“home”'' folder (look in the left column in the Finder for the house icon and your username), with the name “pywikipedia”, in which all the scripts will be when the downloading is finished. You can see when it’s finished by looking for the following in the last line in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;NAME_OF_COMPUTER:~ USER_NAME$&lt;/pre&gt;
This text is equal to the one appearing when you open Terminal (it is called ''prompt'').

== Configuring ==
You need to configure your bot before you can use it.
For this purpose we’ll use pico, a simple and straight [[w:Text user interface|TUI]] text editor.
Go in Terminal and &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; to your pywikipedia directory, e.g.:
 cd pywikipedia
Then type &lt;tt&gt;pico user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;.
Follow the instructions below; when you’re done press CTRL-O to write the file on disk and CTRL-X to quit the editor.

=== Language ===
&lt;pre&gt;mylang = 'xx'&lt;/pre&gt;
“xx” is the main language you want your bot to work on, equivalent to the language code of the Wikimedia project in which the bot’s going to run.

=== Family ===
If the bot’s main wiki is Wikipedia, go right to the Username(s) section. If the bot’s main wiki is for instance Wikibooks, add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;family = 'wikibooks'&lt;/pre&gt;

'''NOTE:''' Running bots on Wiktionary is more complicated than on the other projects, and is not recommended for beginners. This will not be described further in this guide. If you’re running your bot on Commons, both &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;family&lt;/tt&gt; are to be set to “commons”.

=== Username(s) ===
Now, you’ll define the desired username(s) of the bot. Don’t register the bot on the wikis yet. You can do this by using the following:
&lt;pre&gt;usernames['FAMILY']['MYLANG'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;/pre&gt;
“MYLANG” is the same as you defined in the &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt; option, and the same with “FAMILY”. If you’re running the bot on Wikipedia, the &lt;tt&gt;family&lt;/tt&gt; option is not defined, but should be “wikipedia” in the above line (se examples below). The line can be defined as many times as you like (only one per wiki), for each of your bots on different WM wikis. The default will be what’s defined in &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt;, except when running interwiki; the bot will edit on all the wikis defined in user-config.py.

=== Encoding ===
It’s recommended that you change the encoding to UTF-8. Especially if you are editing a wiki with non-ASCII characters, this is important, if you don’t change the encoding, you’ll end up with “?”s all over the place. For example, the Spanish name María will render like Mar?a. Add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;console_encoding = 'utf-8'&lt;/pre&gt;

=== API login ===
Because of some problems with SUL bots, the bot must log in via API. Add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;use_api_login = True&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, by using Save as, save the file in the “pywikipedia” folder. Then, close TextEdit.

=== user-config.py examples ===
==== EksempelBot on no.wikipedia ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'no'
usernames['wikipedia']['no'] = u'EksempelBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== ExampleBot on Commons ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'commons'
family = 'commons'
usernames['commons']['commons'] = u'ExampleBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== BeispielBot on de.wikipedia and de.wikibooks, with de.wikipedia as main wiki ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'de'
usernames['wikipedia']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
usernames['wikibooks']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Registering the username on the wanted wikis ===
It is recommended that you are registered on the wikis where you want to run your bot. Then, when you’re logged into your own user account, write “Special:Userlogin” in the search box, then, choose to register an account. Now fill out the required fields on the page and continue. If the account creation is successful, you should now be able to run the bot.

With '''[[m:Help:Unified login|SUL]]''' it’s easy to run bots on several wikis. If you’ve created the bot account recently, the account is already merged.

If you created it some time ago and it’s not merged, or if it was created some time ago on other wikis, you’ll have to merge it in Special:MergeAccount. Now, when [[#Logging in|logging in]], the other accounts will automatically be registered as you enter the same password for all wikis.

=== Bot flag and test edits ===
'''Don’t forget to apply for bot flag/permission to run the bot!''' On en.wikipedia and he.wikipedia (there may be more), you have to apply before you make test edits. On other wikis you can apply and make test edits right away. When you make test edits, use the [[#Arguments|argument]] -pt:15, which tells the bot to wait 15 seconds between each edit (4 edits/min), so the recent changes list doesn’t get flooded with the bot’s edits.

== Running ==
=== Navigating to the right folder ===
To run the scripts, you first need to navigate to the folder in which the scripts are. Write the following in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;cd /Users/USER_NAME/pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;
“USER_NAME” is the ''home'' text to the right of the house icon in Finder.

==== Tip ====
The above can be unnecessarily boring to write each time you want to use the bot. Terminal saves every command you use, and you can use old commands by pressing arrow up. With one press on the arrow up button, you see the last command used. Most likely, the command you see is not the right one; simply keep pressing arrow up until you see the right one. Then, press enter/return. Now, you can start running the bot. When you’re running a script followed by another when the first one is done, you don’t have to use the navigation command once again; only if you close Terminal.

=== Logging in ===
Now, you need to log into the bot accounts on the wiki(s), by typing the following into Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;python login.py&lt;/pre&gt;
Terminal will ask for the password. Type the password you used when you registered the bot’s username.

If you have accounts on multiple wikis, use
&lt;pre&gt;login.py -all&lt;/pre&gt;
Type in the passwords, as above.

Logging in is only necessary once, the bot stays logged in.

=== Running the scripts ===
After navigating to the right folder, you can now select scripts, by writing:
&lt;pre&gt;python SCRIPT_NAME.py&lt;/pre&gt;

To see an overview of some scripts with description pages, look [[Pywikipediabot/Scripts|here]].

==== Arguments ====
Arguments are written by using a dash: - and then the name of the argument, &lt;tt&gt;-pt:15&lt;/tt&gt; for instance. Many scripts require arguments, for example [[interwiki.py]]:
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -start:! -autonomous&lt;/pre&gt;
As default, the bot will run interwiki from the main language and project, and correct them on all registered wikis. The -start and -autonomous arguments says that it’ll check all pages on the wiki and add/modify interwikis. It will not remove anything, and it will give up when discovering conflicts, see [[interwiki.py]].

===== Global arguments =====
All scripts recognize the following arguments:
;-help
:Shows the script’s help text
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-lang:xx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Selects the language you want to work on. Overrides the mylang option in user-config.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-family:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Selects the family you want to work on. Overrides the family option in user-config.
;-log
:Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs subdirectory.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-log:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Enable the logfile, using “xyz” as the filename.
;-nolog
:Disable the logfile (if it's enabled by default).
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-putthrottle:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt; or short &lt;nowiki&gt;-pt:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between saving pages. The default value is zero.

== Maintenance ==
=== Updating ===
To update your scripts, simply write the following into Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;svn update pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;
When it’s done, it will say “At revision XXXX” (“XXXX” depending on the latest revision). If you have [[#Modifying|modified]] some of the scripts, don’t worry, your modifications will be merged with the changes made by updating.

If you have experience using [[w:Automator|Automator]], you can do the Shell process in a workflow and save it to your desktop or on your dock, so you can reach it more easily. It’s a good idea to secondary click on it, then, while pressing Alt/Option, hold the cursor over Always open in, then choose Automator runner.

=== Modifying ===
You might want to go through the script text before you run it, because for some languages the script may be bot specific. Secondary-click on it, hold the cursor on Open in, then choose Other, scroll down and double-click on TextEdit. However, this is not mandatory, and not recommended for beginners, but if you have to; be careful when editing the scripts!

=== Reverting ===
If you want to revert your changes to a script, simply run the following:
&lt;pre&gt;svn revert NAME_OF_SCRIPT.py&lt;/pre&gt;

If a script suddenly doesn’t work, and produces the output &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, you have encountered an SVN conflict.

Revert the script as described above. Then try to run it. If it works, run the following in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;svn resolved NAME_OF_SCRIPT.py&lt;/pre&gt;

You can now try to make the same edits again, if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Configuration==
&lt;includeonly&gt;You do not need to &quot;install&quot; this package to be able to make use of it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked it or where you have your copy of the SVN sources.&lt;/includeonly&gt;

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
&lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt; in your &lt;tt&gt;pywikipedia&lt;/tt&gt; directory. You can create it manually (it needs at least two or three variables configured, see below) or run the script &lt;tt&gt;generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt; by typing &lt;tt&gt;python generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt; in the command line shell and hit ENTER. That helps to complete this process.

===For [[Special:SiteMatrix|Wikimedia projects]]===
Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad in Windows) and save the text file as &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, in the &lt;tt&gt;pywikipedia&lt;/tt&gt; folder.

Add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;:

{| cellpadding=5
|'''Code'''
|'''Explanation'''
|-
|valign=top width=400px| 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
family = 'wikipedia'
mylang = 'en'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top| 
xx is the code for the language code you are working on, &quot;en&quot; is English&lt;ref name=&quot;mylang&quot;&gt;If you want to work with more than one language, choose the most common one. You can override this on the command line by using &lt;code&gt;-lang:zh&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/ref&gt;. Family is the project name&lt;ref name=&quot;family&quot;&gt;[[Main Page|Meta]] uses 'meta' for both language code and wiki family, [[commons:Main Page|Commons]] uses 'commons' for both, and [[testwiki:Main Page|Testwiki]] uses 'test' for both. You can override this on the command line by using &lt;code&gt;-family:wikibooks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.
|-
|valign=top|
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
usernames['wikipedia']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;The 'u' in front of the username stands for [[:w:en:Unicode|Unicode]]. The 'u' is required if your username contains non-ASCII characters.&lt;/ref&gt;
|valign=top|
Your &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file needs to specify the bot's username. 

In this example, the user is working on English Wikipedia, and has created a bot account with the username &quot;ExampleBot&quot;.
|-
|valign=top|
''(Optional)''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
usernames['wikipedia']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
usernames['wikipedia']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'
usernames['wiktionary']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top|
''(Optional)'' 

If you are working on more than one Wikimedia project, you can also add several usernames.
|-
|valign=top|
''(Optional)''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
console_encoding = 'utf-8'
textfile_encoding = 'unicode_escape'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top|
''(Optional, and rarely needed)'' 

If this is the encoding used by your system. Always try without first.
|}

Now save &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; again.

The [[pywikibot]] may be used to do all kind of things that are important for the maintenance of a [[MediaWiki]] project. When this software is to be used outside of the [[m:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] projects, some configuration needs to be done.

Some non-Wikimedia projects, or ''families'', are already supported. These can be found in the ''families'' folder [http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/families/] which can be [[Using_the_python_wikipediabot#Download|downloaded]]. 

Using the existing files as examples, it should be easy to adapt the bot to your own project. 

{{:../Overview}} &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;#REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;

==Instructions==
===user-config.py file===
Open a text file. (Notepad.exe is a text file editor)

Save the text file as &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, in the main pywikipedia folder.

Add the following '''three''' required lines to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;:

{| cellpadding=5
|'''Code'''
|'''Explanation'''
|-
|valign=top width=400px| 
 mylang = 'xx'
|valign=top| 
xx is the code for the language code you are working on, &quot;en&quot; is English.&lt;ref name=&quot;lan&quot;&gt;If you want to work with more than one language, choose the most common one, as you can override configured value in command line by &lt;tt&gt;-lang&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|valign=top|
 usernames['sitename']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;The 'u' in front of the username stands for Unicode. The 'u' is important if your username contains non-ASCII characters. If you are using ASCII characters only, you can remove the 'u' (if you have troubles loging in with your bot, otherwise you can leave the 'u' as is).&lt;/ref&gt;
|valign=top|
Your &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file needs to specify the bot's username. 

In this example, the user is working on English sitename, and has created a bot account with the username &quot;ExampleBot&quot;.
|-
|valign=top|
 family = 'sitename'
|valign=top|
&quot;Sitename&quot; is the name of the site you're working on. 

Sitename is the same name as the sitename in the above username line (usernames[''''sitename'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;]['en'] = u'ExampleBot'.) 

|}

Now save &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; again.

===family.py file===

Modify the existing files, or create a new file, in a [[w:text editor|text editor]]. 

Save the file in the pywikipedia/families folder, with a name such as &lt;code&gt;mozilla_family.py&lt;/code&gt;

Follow the sections below in order (each section makes the following section easier). 

You must have the correct details as described in the sections below. Potential problems (this might help you in troubleshooting):
* errors in the custom namespaces mean the family file won't work properly (though you'll get a warning when you login?)
* an error in specifying index.php will prevent you logging in; 
* an error in specifying api.php seems likely to lead to problems, since the wiki is accessed via API.

The &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in the families folder offers considerable documentation of the options available to family files. In fact, &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; is a simple 'prototype' family file. You can just copy &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; to sitename_family.py, then open up the sitename_family.py file in a text editor, and tweak it per the instructions below. 

==== index.php ====

To check you have the correct path for your index.php, test which address redirects to your wiki's homepage - probably one of these:
* wikidomainname.org/wiki/index.php
* wikidomainname.org/w/index.php
* wikidomainname.org/index.php

(You may be able to guess from the address of a regular wiki page, but you need to check it - e.g. a wiki page may be wikidomainname.org/Foo but the correct path may be ''''w/index.php'''' - this occurs at fr.ekopedia.org for example.)

Near the end of your file, you find this, for example. Modify or remove the &quot;/w&quot; as necessary:

&lt;pre&gt;
     def path(self, code):
         return '/w/index.php' #The path of index.php, look at your wiki address. 
# This line may need to be changed to /wiki/index.php or /w/index.php, 
# depending on the folder where your mediawiki program is located.&lt;/pre&gt;

==== api.php ====

The API.php file is found in the same place as index.php - but you can test by navigating to (say):
: your.domain.org/wiki/api.php
or
: your.domain.org/w/api.php
or
: your.domain.org/api.php

The correct address will give you an auto-generated MediaWiki API documentation page (the important thing is that it confirms you have the correct address).

For the '/w/api.php' case, api is defined like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
     def apipath(self, code):

         return '/w/api.php' #The path of api.php&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Custom Namespaces ====

Adding a custom namespace to a family file is not well documented in the &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; file. The [[#Example: Uncyclopedia|Uncyclopedia]] example below has some examples using custom namespaces, but the addition of these namespaces to your family file requires knowing the numerical ID of each namespace.

'''Finding the details you need''': Start with the api url (which you found above) and add this string to the end:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;?action=query&amp;meta=siteinfo&amp;siprop=general|namespaces|namespacealiases|statistics&lt;/nowiki&gt;

...so your address might look something like:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://your.domain.org/wiki/api.php?action=query&amp;meta=siteinfo&amp;siprop=general|namespaces|namespacealiases|statistics&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The resulting page will will list the information about your namespaces that you need for the family file, including the numerical ID.

Typically these numerical IDs start at 100, and each even number is a content space and the following odd number is the talk space for that content space. However, to get the exact list, directing your browser to your Wiki's API.php file, and calling certain commands, is ideal.

Also, note that &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; lists two ways to provide ''translations'' of namespaces - either changing a specific language's namespace like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[2]['en'] = u'Wikiuser'
self.namespaces[3]['en'] = u'Wikiuser talk'&lt;/source&gt;
Or else changing an entire batch of languages in one go:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[4] = {
    '_default': [u'WIKINAME', self.namespaces[4]['_default']], # REQUIRED
    'de': 'Name des wiki',
    'es': 'Nombre del wiki',
    'fr': 'Nom du wiki',
    # ETC.
}&lt;/source&gt;
When adding custom namespaces, you '''do not have a choice''' - you '''must''' use the second style. The first method only works because &lt;code&gt;self.namespaces[2]['en']&lt;/code&gt; already exists. With custom namespaces, they do not, so you must use the second style, with curly braces and everything, even if you only have one language. For example, suppose you have a News namespace, and your Wiki only operates in English:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[100] = { 'en': 'News' }
self.namespaces[101] = { 'en': 'News talk' }&lt;/source&gt;

If you do not use this format, the family file '''will not work''' - and more importantly, the resulting error message '''will not help''' - it will ask you to create a &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file, even if that file already exists and works correctly.

==== Custom User Groups &amp; Permissions ====

PyWikipedia assumes that the Wiki it is running on uses the standard, default user groups and that each group is assigned the usual permissions. This means that it may refuse to do things that its account would allow, and it may attempt to do things that its account is not allowed to do (these attempts will fail, so this is not a security issue).

The fact that it will attempt things it is not allowed to do is minor, but the inability to perform certain actions (e.g. deleting pages) without being in the &quot;Sysop&quot; group can be a sizable limitation. If the bot account has such permissions without being in the &quot;Sysop&quot; group (being part of some other, non-standard group), the only known work-around is the edit Wikipedia.py itself. This file controls most bot actions, and is found in the main folder PyWikipedia has been installed to.

In the _getUserData() function within Wikipedia.py, a pair of lines like this exists:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;        if 'Sysop' in self._rights[index]:
            self._rights[index].extend(['delete', 'undelete', 'block', 'protect', 'import', 'deletedhistory', 'unwatchedpages'])&lt;/source&gt;
In version 2008-10-29T19:21:05.438703Z 6043, this is line 4705 and 4706, but that line number may be different, even very different, in other versions. Using the Find function of your text editor to find &quot;&lt;code&gt;def _getUserData(&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (to find the function definition) is recommended.

In order to get the rights listed in the second line, the first line must be changed to recognize your custom user group (note: if your custom user-group has some, but not all of those rights, changing this will not give you those rights - it will simply let PyWikipedia attempt to exercise them if you direct it to. Doing so is strongly '''not''' recommended as the program's behavior in such a case is undefined). The exact name of the user group can be found by logging in manually as the bot, and viewing the HTML code of any Wiki page. Near the top, a line as follows should appear:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;var wgUserGroups = [ ... ]&lt;/source&gt;
Where the ellipsis is replaced by a list of the groups that the bot is a member of. Choose the one that matches the custom user group that gives you the rights that you are attempting to exercise, and replace Sysop in the above code from Wikipedia.py with that name. This should activate those rights for PyWikipedia.

===Running the PyWikipedia Bot===

Refer to [[Using_the_python_wikipediabot#Use|Using the python wikipediabot]] on how to run the bot.

==Examples==
=== Example: Mozilla wiki === 
The Mozilla Foundation's wiki, wiki.mozilla.org, is a very simple example because it is only available in one language.

This is the contents of &lt;code&gt;families/mozilla_family.py&lt;/code&gt;. Hints for you to write your own family specification are underlined.

&lt;source lang=python&gt; # -*- coding: utf-8  -*-
 
import family
 
 # The official Mozilla Wiki. #Put a short project description here.
 
class Family(family.Family):
 
     def __init__(self):
         family.Family.__init__(self)
         self.name = 'mozilla' # Set the family name; this should be the same as in the filename.
         self.langs = {
             'en': 'wiki.mozilla.org', # Put the hostname here.
         }

         # Translation used on all wikis for the different namespaces.
         # Most namespaces are inherited from family.Family.
         # Check the family.py file (in main directory) to see the standard
         # namespace translations for each known language.
         # You only need to enter translations that differ from the default.
         self.namespaces[4] = {
             '_default': u'MozillaWiki', # Specify the project namespace here.
         }
 
         self.namespaces[5] = {
             '_default': u'MozillaWiki talk', # Specify the talk page of the project namespace here. 
         }
 
     def version(self, code):
         return &quot;1.4.2&quot;  # The MediaWiki version used. Not very important in most cases.
 
     def scriptpath(self, code):
         return '' # The relative path of index.php, api.php : look at your wiki address. 
# This line may need to be changed to /wiki or /w, 
# depending on the folder where your mediawiki program is located.
# Note: Do not _include_ index.php, etc.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example: Starwars ===
This is the content of the Starwars wiki at wikia. The file is located at &lt;code&gt;families/starwars_family.py&lt;/code&gt;. 

[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/User:Sikon/Pywikipedia Here] explains how to configure the Pywikipedia bot to work at this site.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;import family
   
class Family(family.Family):
   def __init__(self):
       family.Family.__init__(self)
       self.name = 'starwars'
   
       self.langs = {
           'en': None,
           }
   
       # Translation used on all wikis for the different namespaces.
       # Most namespaces are inherited from family.Family.
       # Check the family.py file (in main directory) to see the standard
       # namespace translations for each known language.
       # You only need to enter translations that differ from the default.
       self.namespaces[4] = {
           '_default': u'Wookieepedia', # Specify the project namespace here. 
       }
       self.namespaces[5] = {
           '_default': u'Wookieepedia talk', # Specify the talk page of the project namespace here. 
       }
       
       # A few selected big languages for things that we do not want to loop over
       # all languages. This is only needed by the titletranslate.py module, so
       # if you carefully avoid the options, you could get away without these
       # for another wiki family.
       self.languages_by_size = ['en']
   def hostname(self,code):
       return 'starwars.wikia.com'
   def path(self, code):
       return '/index.php'
   def version(self, code):
       return &quot;1.9&quot; # Which version of MediaWiki is used?
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example: Memory Alpha === 
'''memoryalpha_family.py''' is the &quot;family&quot; definition of Memory Alpha, www.memory-alpha.org, a Star Trek wiki. This specification is a little bit more difficult because it has several languages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 # -*- coding: utf-8  -*-
 import family
 
 # The Memory Alpha family, a set of StarTrek wikis.
 
 class Family(family.Family):
     def __init__(self):
         family.Family.__init__(self)
         self.name = 'memoryalpha'
 
         self.langs = {  # All available languages are listed here.
             'de': None, # Because the hostname is the same for all languages,
             'en': None, # we don't specify it here, but below in the hostname()
             'nl': None, # function.
             'sv': None,
         }
 
         # Most namespaces are inherited from family.Family.
         self.namespaces[4] = {
             '_default': u'Memory Alpha', # All languages use the same project namespace name.
         }
         self.namespaces[5] = {
             '_default': u'Memory Alpha talk',
             'de': u'Memory Alpha Diskussion',
             'nl': u'Overleg Memory Alpha',
             'sv': u'Memory Alphadiskussion',
         }
 
         # A few selected big languages for things that we do not want to loop over
         # all languages. This is only needed by the titletranslate.py module, so
         # if you carefully avoid the options, you could get away without these
         # for another wiki family.
         self.biglangs = ['en', 'de'] # Not very important
 
     def hostname(self,code):
         return 'www.memory-alpha.org' # The same for all languages
 
     def scriptpath(self, code):
         return '/%s' % code # The language code is included in the path
 
     def version(self, code):
         return &quot;1.4&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example: Uncyclopedia === 
The various [[Uncyclopedia:Babel:Main_Page|Uncyclopedias]] are slightly more awkward as not all are hosted at the same domain or under the same name. Domain names and paths must be specified individually. Just over half are [[Wikia:Main_Page|Wikia]]-hosted; exceptions include fi: hu: ja: ko: no: pt: sv: and zh-tw:. Many have their own registered domain names and many use custom namespaces.

The approaches which work for an Uncyclopædia or a Memory Alpha project typically can be adapted to other Wikia.

''Note: There have been subsequent updates and changes, see [[botwiki:python:uncyclopedia_family.py]] or [[uncyclopedia:es:usuario:Chixpy/uncyclopedia_family.py]] for more current versions of the Uncyclopedia interwiki bot configuration. There are also unresolved issues in which some interwiki languages are not available from all Uncyclopedia projects or point to incorrect/inconsistent destinations; proceed with caution.''

        return '/wiki'

    def version(self, code):
        return &quot;1.7&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Notes ==

=== Language ===
For a single-language site, the language specified does not matter as long as it is consistent between the user-config.py and families/foo_family.py

=== Login failed. Wrong password? ===

Pywikipedia does not report anything more useful than success, failure, or host connection failure.  If possible, try accessing the web server logs (apache uses access_log by default) and take a look at the URL strings.  

You could also try running login.py in 'very verbose' mode, ie: &lt;code&gt; python login.py -v -v &lt;/code&gt;  . This will dump a lot of information, including possibly the html code from the server, so you can see exactly what is going on. (this option does however run the risk of possibly revealing some security sensitive info so be careful...)

Make sure your ''scriptpath'', the relative path to your api.php and index.php files, is defined appropriately for your wiki in your families file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def scriptpath(self, code):
    return '/wiki' 
&lt;/source&gt;

If this does not help, add a line like

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
  authenticate['www.mywiki.com'] = ('botName','botPassword')
&lt;/source&gt;

to your user-config.py file.

See the [[#Example: Mozilla wiki|mozilla configuration ]] for clues.

=== Mismatched interwiki configuration ===
In some projects (such as Uncyclopedia), each language operates as an independent wiki. This may mean that interwiki tables differ from one individual wiki to another within the same project. Interwiki.py is built on the assumption that, if outbound interlanguage links are available at all from a language, the list of available link-destination languages and the destination URL for each will match perfectly across all wikis in the project.

This leads to some potential pitfalls:
* If one language is missing outbound language interwiki support entirely, one must avoid giving pywikipediabot an account on that wiki (in user-config.py) in order to ensure that interwiki.py leaves that one language wiki untouched. 
* If one language is using a valid but incomplete interwiki table, running interwiki.py on that language wiki will create broken links. Unlike the case where one language is missing project-wide, there is no clean and easy workaround.
* If a language in a project has been forked (not just mirrored), the interwiki for each individual language pair will point to only one of the multiple forks. Verify the wiki your bot is looking at is the same one that is being linked from the wiki you're editing - otherwise the bot will delete some valid links as &quot;page does not exist&quot;.

=== Customisation of namespaces ===
Some projects use non-standard extensions to provide [[mw:Extension:Special page to work with the interwiki table|Special:Interwiki]] and [[mw:Extension:Simple namespaces|Special:Namespaces]] lists; where available, these lists should be checked against the configuration files to detect any additional namespace customisations.

=== Short URL rewrites ===
If your site uses short URL rewrites, you may have to add &quot;/api.php&quot; to the blacklists, Otherwise, your bot scripts will not be able to access api.php.

Check your rewrite conditions in your apache conf file, and make an appropriate addition.

=== Bot &amp; private wikis ===
Some wikis require logging in into mediawiki before being able to view any wikipage. If you have any such site, add to your custom family file :
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def isPublic(self):
    return False
&lt;/source&gt;

Fixing '''Permission Denied''' problems
&lt;pre&gt;
Creating page [[Category:Help]] via API                                     
Unknown Error. API Error code:permissiondenied                              
Information:Permission denied 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Your wiki may require users to be part of a particular group in order to edit pages.  If so, login to your wiki as an administrator and use [[Special:UserRights]] to put your bot into the proper group(s) to avoid API permission problems.

=== Bot &amp; HTTP auth ===
Some sites will require password identication to access the HTML pages at the site. If you have any such site, add lines to your user-config.py of the following form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
authenticate['en.wikipedia.org'] = ('John','XXXXX') # where John is your login name, and XXXXX your password.
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
===Select and run a bot script===
Now we are ready to really start using the bot. You need to get to a textual interface to your Operating System. 

On '''Windows''' this is done by opening the start menu, and clicking on 'Run'. You are asked to give the name of a program, type &quot;cmd.exe&quot;. 
* Change the root to C: by typing chdir C:\
* Type chdir \&quot;name of the folder where pywikipedia bot has been [[../Installation|downloaded]]&quot; ''(For example: chdir \&quot;pywikipedia&quot; if the file is in the C: folder.)''

Windows has known problems with supporting Unicode in its standard system terminal. You may need to use alternative consoles (such as [http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/ ConEmu]) if your wiki is in language requiring Unicode encoding.

On '''Mac''', find Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities.

On '''Linux''' or any other '''Unix''', use any terminal application such as gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, or simply the text-mode console.

Run the script [[../login.py/]] by typing &quot;python login.py&quot; (or just &quot;login.py&quot;). 

Python will then return:

'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000000; color:#c0c0c0; font-family:Lucida Console; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
Password for user your_bot on your_site:en:&lt;/pre&gt;'''


Use the password you used for the bot's login name. Note that your input will not be visible for privacy reasons. The bot can't work anonymously. Unless you change your password, you normally need to run this program only once, the bot usually does not get logged off.

The bots are in the main pywikipedia folder when downloaded. But if necessary, use the command cd to go to the directory where the bot files are saved. 

Now run any of the bots here by typing &quot;python botname.py&quot; (If you are using Windows, you can leave out &quot;python&quot;).

==Scripts==
:''Main page: [[../Scripts/]]''

===Command-line arguments===
Although many bot scripts have their own command line arguments, which should be documented on their respective pages (or in their source code), all bots unless specifically stated to the contrary recognize the following command line arguments:

; -help
: Print a list of global bot arguments (this list), followed by bot-specific help if available.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-lang:xx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the language of the wiki you want to work on to language code &lt;code&gt;xx&lt;/code&gt;, overriding the configuration in &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-family:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the family of the wiki you want to work on, ''e.g.'', wikipedia, wiktionary, wikivoyage, ...  This will override the configuration in &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;.
; -log
: Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs subdirectory.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-log:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Enable the logfile, using &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; as the filename.
; -nolog
: Disable the logfile (if it's enabled by default).
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-putthrottle:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between saving pages. The default value is 10.

For example, &lt;code&gt;python scriptname.py -family:wiktionary&lt;/code&gt; will run the &quot;scriptname&quot; bot on wiktionary articles, overriding the default family setting in your user configuration.

==Permission on Wikimedia projects==
Make sure that your bot is approved by the wiki community where you are going to use it. Strictness of this differs greatly between various projects; at some you need to announce it in advance and get approval before you start, at others you can do whatever you want.

Using your normal browser, create a login name and password for the bot. It is best to use a name that makes clear that it is a bot, and preferably also who is operating it. A common method is to use your own login name and add the word 'bot' to it, but several other forms also exist.

On the English Wikipedia, bots are only allowed to be used if they are approved at [[w:en:Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval|Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval]].

====Request a bot flag====
If you heavily use a bot, it will clutter recent changes. To avoid that, you can get your bot registered as such. In that case it will not be shown on Recent changes unless a user specifically asks to get bots included.

This can be done by a bureaucrat. You can put a request to get your or someone else's bot registered at [[m:Steward requests/Bot status|Requests for bot status]]. You will probably be asked for some kind of evidence that your local community agrees with your bot.  On the English language Wikipedia, requests should be made at [[w:Bots/Requests for approval|Requests for approval]].  It is probably good to get your bot registered whenever it will edit many pages in a single run.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to report a bug==
When you report a bug please try to include:

* PyWikipediaBot version in use. It's recommended to test if the bug is still present in latest SVN revision available.
* Python version (python -V) and operating system you use (e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS...)
** For above purpose, [[../version.py/]] will be useful.
* A nice summary
* Full description of the problem/report
* How to reproduce bug full information (script, command line, family, and language used)
* The console output provided by the script (included the Python traceback if you are reporting a crash)

To submit a new bug visit the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=93107 bug tracker] provided by SourceForge.

==Development==
If you have a function you want to have a bot for that is not yet provided by one of the bots, you can ask one of the programmers to write it for you. Or even better, you can try to work on the bots yourself. Python is a nice language, and not hard to learn. We will welcome you.

===Tips===
Here and in [[../wikipedia.py/]], there are some very basic tips for getting started writing your own bot:
*be sure you've set up your user-config.py file (see [[#Configuring for Wikipedia|above]])
*To gain access to the pywikipedia framework, use: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import wikipedia
&lt;/source&gt;
*to retrieve a page, use the following, where pageName is, e.g., &quot;Wikipedia:Bots&quot; or &quot;India&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
site = wikipedia.getSite()
page = wikipedia.Page(site, u&quot;pageName&quot;)
text = page.get(get_redirect = True)
&lt;/source&gt;
*to update a page, use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
page.put(u&quot;newText&quot;, u&quot;Edit comment&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
*look at some of the pywikipedia files for other ideas -- basic.py is relatively easy to read even if you're new to pywikipedia.
*you can find all available Page methods in the wikipedia.py file.
*basic.py gives you a setup that can be used for many different bots, all you have to do is define the string editing on the page text.
*To [[w:iteration|iterate]] over a set of pages, see pagegenerators.py for some objects that return a set of pages. An example use of the CategoryPageGenerator that does something for each page in the [[w:Category:Living people|Category:Living people]] category:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import catlib
import pagegenerators
import wikipedia
site = wikipedia.getSite()
cat = catlib.Category(site,'Category:Living people')
gen = pagegenerators.CategorizedPageGenerator(cat)
for page in gen:
  #Do something with the page object, for example:
  text = page.get()
&lt;/source&gt;

===Contributing changes===
If you changed the bot and want to send a patch to the maintainer, 
# Update to the current version (it will merge your changes with the improvements already committed to the SVN Repository), 
# Resolve any conflicts caused by the update (grep for &quot;=====&quot; ;-) and
# Type:
:&lt;pre&gt;$ svn diff &gt; svn.diff&lt;/pre&gt;

Review the diff to ensure it only includes the changes you want to contribute.  The lines at the beginning starting with &quot;?&quot; should be removed.

If you are in direct contact with a Pywikipediabot developer, you can send the file svn.diff to him, but preferably attach the patch to a ticket in the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=603140&amp;group_id=93107&amp;func=browse Pywikipedia bug tracking system].

===Multiple accounts===
It is a common need to run python wikipedia bot under different accounts (main and/or multiple bot accounts). It can be done in two ways.

====Separate pywikipedia distributions====
One can install completely separate instances of pywikipedia in different directories (1 for each account) and have diferent &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; files in each of them. However, when updating the installation ''via'' SVN, one needs to run &lt;code&gt;svn update&lt;/code&gt; on each folder separately. Also, every installation takes some disk space, which might be a problem on accounts with limited quota.

====One pywikipedia distribution with symbolic links====

Let's assume user &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; has a current SVN working copy of pywikipedia in &lt;code&gt;/home/foo/pywikipedia&lt;/code&gt;. For each of the accounts, he creates a separate directory:

 foo@bar:~$ '''mkdir foobot'''
 foo@bar:~$ '''cd foobot'''

Pywikipedia needs then some symlinks to the main code tree created in the working directory:

 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''ln -s ~/pywikipedia/families'''
 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''ln -s ~/pywikipedia/userinterfaces'''
&lt;!-- THAT'S ALL IT NEEDED IN MY CASE - ADD MORE IF NECESSARY --&gt;

Then, &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; for this account must be created as described in [[#Configuration|Configuration section]] above.

Finally, the bot must be logged in the usual way:

 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''python ~/pywikipedia/login.py'''

The working directory is ready. The scripts will however require a slight modification to run (the path to the pywikipedia tree must be added to Python's path).
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 import sys, os
 sys.path.append(os.environ['HOME'] + '/pywikipedia')
 import wikipedia
&lt;/source&gt;

That's all. Updating to the newest version of pywikipedia on ''all accounts at once'' is now a matter of running &lt;code&gt;svn update&lt;/code&gt; only in the &lt;code&gt;~/pywikipedia&lt;/code&gt; directory.

=====On Windows 2000+ with NTFS=====
&lt;!-- This works on my VirtualBox running Windows XP Pro with an NTFS file system. --&gt;
A similar set-up can be created on Windows systems running Windows 2000 or later that use NTFS as their filesystem. This can be achieved by using the &lt;code&gt;junction&lt;/code&gt; tool (available from [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx Microsoft's website, part of the sysinternals suite]). 

As above, create your new directory, but to create the symlinks, create &lt;code&gt;families&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;userinterfaces&lt;/code&gt; as directories inside of that. ('''NB''': The cmd.exe &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; appears not to work properly in all the time, so using the Right-click-&gt;New menu or File-&gt;New menu is suggested.)

 C:\...&gt; junction families C:\pywikipedia\families
 C:\...&gt; junction userinterfaces C:\pywikipedia\userinterfaces

The rest of the method is the same as above.
 
Symlink/junctions should be deleted using the &lt;code&gt;junction&lt;/code&gt; program, as you may accidentally lose data in the original directory (see [http://www.shell-shocked.org/article.php?id=284]).

==Bot &amp; Proxy==
There is probably (not tested!) draft workaround described 
[http://nl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Overleg_gebruiker:Andre_Engels&amp;oldid=10418345#pywikipedia_proxy here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{pywikibot/SVN}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This is a script which helps to add a text '''at the end''' of the page but above categories, interwiki and template for the stars of the interwiki (default setting), or add a text '''at the top''' of the page.

This needs Python with at least v2.4 (not v2.3).

==Parameters==
These command line parameters can be used to specify which pages to work on:
 
&amp;params;
 
Furthermore, the following command line parameters are supported:
 
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
-page               Use a page as generator
-text               Define which text to add
-summary            Define the summary to use
-except             Use a regex to check if the text is already in the page *
-excepturl          Use the html page as text where you want to see if there's the text, not the wiki-page.
-newimages          Add text in the new images
-untagged           Add text in the images that don't have any license template
-always             If used, the bot won't ask if it should add the text specified
-up                 If used, put the text at the very top of the page *
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 
== Example ==

=== Adding a template to specific pages ===
It will add the text &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; at the very top of the pages with &quot;Category:Template documentation&quot;. Pages which have the text &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; .

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;add_text.py -cat:template_documentation -text:&quot;{{Documentation subpage}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Dd]ocumentation [Ss]ubpage&quot; -up&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;-cat:template_documentation&lt;/code&gt; : only target entries categorized in the page of &quot;Category:Template documentation&quot;
* &lt;code&gt;-text:&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; : add the template &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (excluding the quotes)
* &lt;code&gt;-except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Dd]ocumentation [Ss]ubpage&quot;&lt;/code&gt; : regex commands to exclude entries which have this template already in the page
* &lt;code&gt;-up&lt;/code&gt; : Put the text at the top of the page instead

Another example:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;python add_text.py -cat:catname -summary:&quot;Bot: Adding a template&quot; -text:&quot;{{Something}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Ss]omething&quot; -up&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Adding category to pages without any category ===
This is a real instance that is used on it.wikipedia to put the template in the page without any category.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python add_text.py -excepturl:&quot;class='catlinks'&gt;&quot; -uncat -text:&quot;{{Categorizzare}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Cc]ategorizzare&quot; -summary:&quot;Bot: Aggiungo template Categorizzare&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Script which manages categories. This needs Python with at least v2.4 (not v2.3). 

== Syntax ==
The syntax is:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py [global-arguments] action [-option]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
where action can be one of these:
 * add         - mass-add a category to a list of pages
 * remove      - remove category tag from all pages in a category
 * move        - move all pages in a category to another category
 * tidy        - tidy up a category by moving its articles into subcategories
 * tree        - show a tree of subcategories of a given category
 * listify     - make a list of all of the articles that are in a category

and option can be one of these:
 * -person     - sort persons by their last name (for action 'add')
 * -rebuild    - reset the database
 * -from:      - The category to move from (for the move option)
                 Also, the category to remove from in the remove option
                 Also, the category to make a list of in the listify option
 * -to:        - The category to move to (for the move option)
               - Also, the name of the list to make in the listify option
         NOTE: If the category names have spaces in them you may need to use
         a special syntax in your shell so that the names aren't treated as
         separate parameters.  For instance, in BASH, use single quotes,
         e.g. -from:'Polar bears'
 * -batch      - Don't prompt to delete emptied categories (do it
                 automatically).
 * -summary:   - Pick a custom edit summary for the bot.
 * -inplace    - Use this flag to change categories in place rather than
                 rearranging them.
 * -nodelsum   - An option for remove, this specifies not to use the custom
                 edit summary as the deletion reason.  Instead, it uses the
                 default deletion reason for the language, which is &quot;Category
                 was disbanded&quot; in English.
 * -overwrite  - An option for listify, this overwrites the current page with
                 the list even if something is already there.
 * -showimages - An option for listify, this displays images rather than
                 linking them in the list.
 * -talkpages  - An option for listify, this outputs the links to talk pages
                 of the pages to be listified in addition to the pages
                 themselves.
 * -recurse    - Recurse through all subcategories of categories.
 * -match      - Only work on pages whose titles match the given regex (for
                 move and remove actions).
 * -create     - An option for add: if a page doesn't exist, do not skip it,
                 create it instead

If action is &quot;add&quot;, the following options are supported:

 -cat             Work on all pages which are in a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-cat:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-cat:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -catr            Like -cat, but also recursively includes pages in
                  subcategories, sub-subcategories etc. of the
                  given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-catr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-catr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -subcats         Work on all subcategories of a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcats:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-subcats:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -subcatsr        Like -subcats, but also includes sub-subcategories etc. of
                  the given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname&quot; or

 -uncatcat        Work on all categories which are not categorised.

 -uncatfiles      Work on all files which are not categorised.

 -file            Read a list of pages to treat from the named text file.
                  Page titles in the file must be enclosed with [[brackets]]
                  or separated by newlines. Argument can also be given as
                  &quot;-file:filename&quot;.

 -filelinks       Work on all pages that use a certain image/media file.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-filelinks:filename&quot;.

 -search          Work on all pages that are found in a MediaWiki search
                  across all namespaces.

 -google          Work on all pages that are found in a Google search.
                  You need a Google Web API license key. Note that Google
                  doesn't give out license keys anymore. See google_key in
                  config.py for instructions.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-google:searchstring&quot;.

 -namespace       Filters the page generator to only yield pages in the
                  specified namespaces.  Separate multiple namespace
                  numbers with commas.

 -interwiki       Work on the given page and all equivalent pages in other
                  languages. This can, for example, be used to fight
                  multi-site spamming.
                  Attention: this will cause the bot to modify
                  pages on several wiki sites, this is not well tested,
                  so check your edits!

 -links           Work on all pages that are linked from a certain page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-links:linkingpagetitle&quot;.

                  will work on the x newest images.

 -ref             Work on all pages that link to a certain page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-ref:referredpagetitle&quot;.

 -start           Specifies that the robot should go alphabetically through
                  all pages on the home wiki, starting at the named page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-start:pagetitle&quot;.

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,
                  &quot;-start:Template:!&quot; will make the bot work on all pages
                  in the template namespace.

 -prefixindex     Work on pages commencing with a common prefix.

 -titleregex      Work on titles that match the given regular expression.

 -transcludes     Work on all pages that use a certain template.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-transcludes:Template:Title&quot;.

 -unusedfiles     Work on all description pages of images/media files that are
                  not used anywhere.
                  Argument can be given as &quot;-unusedfiles:n&quot; where
                  n is the maximum number of articles to work on.

 -unwatched       Work on all articles that are not watched by anyone.
                  Argument can be given as &quot;-unwatched:n&quot; where
                  n is the maximum number of articles to work on.

 -usercontribs    Work on all articles that were edited by a certain user :
                  Example : -usercontribs:DumZiBoT

 -weblink         Work on all articles that contain an external link to
                  a given URL; may be given as &quot;-weblink:url&quot;

 -withoutinterwiki Work on all pages that don't have interlanguage links.
                  Argument can be given as &quot;-withoutinterwiki:n&quot; where
                  n is some number (??).

 -random          Work on random pages returned by [[Special:Random]].
                  Can also be given as &quot;-random:n&quot; where n is the number
                  of pages to be returned, else 10 pages are returned.

 -randomredirect  Work on random redirect target pages returned by
                  [[Special:Randomredirect]].  Can also be given as
                  &quot;-randomredirect:n&quot; where n is the number of pages to be
                  returned, else 10 pages are returned.

 -gorandom        Specifies that the robot should starting at the random pages 
                  returned by [[Special:Random]].

 -recentchanges   Work on new and edited pages returned by [[Special:Recentchanges]].
                  Can also be given as &quot;-recentchanges:n&quot; where n is the number
                  of pages to be returned, else 100 pages are returned.

 -redirectonly    Work on redirect pages only, not their target pages.
                  The robot goes alphabetically through all redirect pages
                  on the wiki, starting at the named page. The
                  argument can also be given as &quot;-redirectonly:pagetitle&quot;.

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,
                  &quot;-redirectonly:Template:!&quot; will make the bot work on
                  all redirect pages in the template namespace.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For the actions tidy and tree, the bot will store the category structure locally in category.dump. This saves time and server load, but if it uses these data later, they may be outdated; use the -rebuild parameter in this case.

Or to do it all from the command-line, 

== Example ==

=== Adding category ===

If your list of pages is in a file, enter:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py add -file:FILENAME
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you don't enter a filename, you will be prompted for a page that has the file list.

Follow the on-screen instructions - you will be prompted for the category name.

To create a new category from a list of persons, you will usually want them to be sorted alphabetically by last name (assuming Western surname conventions). E.g. Adding the &quot;Artist&quot; category to the page &quot;Jane Smith&quot;, it would be added in the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Artists|Smith, Jane]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Type:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py add -person
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and follow the on-screen instructions.

=== Move category ===
If you want to move all pages in a category to another category, you could do the following:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You will be prompted for the old category (that you also want to keep but enter it)
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
OldCategoryname
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Enter the name of the category without the 'Category:' prefix.

You will now be prompted for the new category, now enter the old and new Category like this:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
NewCategoryName
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

To do it all from the command-line, use the following syntax:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move -from:&quot;OldCategoryname&quot; -to:&quot;NewCategoryName&quot;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, this syntax will move all pages in the category US to the category United States.
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move -from:US -to:'United States'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Interwiki.py creates Interlanguage links between the different language versions of a project.

==Getting started==
We assume you have taken these steps (downloading Python and bot, creating &lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;, running &lt;tt&gt;login.py&lt;/tt&gt;). Now to start, type &quot;interwiki.py&quot; (without the &quot;'s), or if that does not work, &quot;python interwiki.py&quot;.

The bot will ask for a page to check. Give a page on your home Wikipedia, preferably one with one or more interwiki-links that could however have more. The bot will read this page, and if it has any interwiki-links, it will check those pages as well, and the interwiki-links from those, etcetera. After it has finished that, what happens on what pages it found.
* If the page has no interwiki links, or if the links found are identical to the ones on the page, the bot will stop silently.
* If the bot finds interwiki links to new languages, or finds that an interwiki-link has to be changed, it will do so.
* If the bot finds that an interwiki link is to be removed, it will ask your permission to do so.
* If the bot finds more than one page for a language, it will go into an interactive mode. It will give the pages found with the pages that link to that page, and ask for each language with more than one link, which if any should be linked to, then ask for each language with one link whether it should be linked.

Note that these behaviours can be changed using options, see below.

You can also specify the page to work on directly, using &quot;interwiki.py pagename&quot;. But there are more possibilities, see below.

== Working on more than one page ==
Using the XML Export, the pywikipediabot-software can get more pages at once, upto 60 at a time. To use this possibility, you can use the bot on a set of pages. The most common form is getting pages in alphabetical order from Special:Allpages, using the -start option.

=== -start ===
If you add the option -start, the bot will go through the pages alphabetically, starting at the word specified. If you want to start at the letter B, for example, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -start:B&quot;. In particular, if you want to do the whole Wiki, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -start:!&quot;

=== Restarting: -continue, -restore ===
Going through the whole wiki can, in large or even moderately large wikis, take a long time. Thus, it may well happen that you are forced to end the program before it has finished. In that case you can use &quot;interwiki.py -continue&quot; next time. The bot, when it crashes or is stopped (through control-c), will make a file specifying the pages it is working on. If you use the continue-option, it will continue with those pages, and after that continue alphabetically. If you want to restart a non-alphabetical run, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -restore&quot; instead. It will just restart the pages it was working on.

Be warned that only the '''last''' bot run that was stopped will be recoverable. The bot will save its information to a file interwiki.dump, and if another run is broken off, even if it is only on one page, it will overwrite the file.

=== Autonomous mode ===
When working on a lot of pages, you may want the bot to just continue, rather than asking you every time it sees a problem. This is done by adding the option &quot;-autonomous&quot;. If this option is used, the bot will skip all problems and removals, and save a log of those in &lt;tt&gt;autonomous_problems.dat&lt;/tt&gt;. If you want it to do removals as well, add the &quot;-force&quot; option too; in that case it is good to check the removals afterward (often a page is removed because of a correctable typo).

==== The file sax_parse_bug.dat ====
Sometimes there is an error message mentioning a file &lt;tt&gt;sax_parse_bug.dat&lt;/tt&gt; on the screen while running interwiki.py, and then it starts retrieving some pages one-by-one instead of in a single batch. This is caused by an illegal character in one of the pages to be retrieved.

The tool &lt;tt&gt;xmltest.py&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to trace this problem. Run it with the filename as argument:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python xmltest.py sax_parse_bug.dat&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will generate a python stack trace. The last line of that stack trace will show a line number and column where the illegal character is in the file. Please check this position, and if possible, correct the wiki page associated with it.

=== Running on years AD ===

There is a special option '''-years''' that makes sure not to follow links to centuries and decennia that are common on some wikipedias (like ja:). Even then, this option should be used in combination with an exceptions file (see below) because the la: and ia: number pages are about the numbers and not about the years.
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -autonomous -years&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will take a while to start up while it is preparing hints for all pages named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; through &lt;nowiki&gt;[[2050]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you stop the robot during a -years run and want to restart it later, you can tell the robot at which page to restart by using '''-years:XYZ''' where XYZ is the year where the robot stopped last time. You can also make the robot start B.C. by making XYZ a negative number.

&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -autonomous -years:-500&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== Running on a simple list of pages ===

Sometimes you have a list of pages available. Just a file of subjects, each subject on a separate line, formatted as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[xx:yyy]] comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The '''-file''' option can be used to run the interwiki bot over such a list of subjects. An example of such a file could be an &lt;tt&gt;autonomous_problem.dat&lt;/tt&gt; file that you want to treat manually:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -file:autonomous_problem.dat&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Using hints ==
Upto now, we have only worked on adding interwikis on pages that already have some. But the bot can also be used to add them on pages that have none yet. This is done by using hints. If for example you want to add interwikis to the page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[en:House]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and think there might be a page at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[fr:Maison]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that would be about the same subject, you can type (if your bot is set to run on English by default) &quot;interwiki.py House -hint:fr:Maison&quot;.

If the link is to the same title, you can remove the title, and even the second :. Also, if you want to link to the same word in several languages, you can combine them with commas. So instead of &quot;interwiki.py Albert Einstein -hint:de:Albert_Einstein -hint:fr:Albert_Einstein -hint:id:Albert_Einstein&quot; (those underscores are necessary, otherwise the bot will regard the 'Einstein' part of the pagename), you can write &quot;interwiki.py Albert Einstein -hint:de,fr,id&quot;,

=== Special hints ===
Some special hints have been defined to do a number of languages at once. You can use them instead of the language part of a hint. Currently the following special hints exist for Wikipedia:
* 10: Ten of the largest Wikipedias
* 20,30,50: Idem, for twenty, thirty and fifty languages
* all: All Wikipedias with at least ~100 articles
* cyril: All languages in Cyrillic script
The same are defined for Wiktionary, but at the moment of writing, 30, 50 and all are the same for Wiktionary. It is intended to add more options.

=== Asking for hints ===
When working on multiple pages such hints in the command line are rarely useful. In that case (or if you want to decide on the hints later), you can use the options &quot;-askhints&quot;, &quot;-untranslated&quot; and &quot;-untranslatedonly&quot;. If you choose the -askhints option, for each page you will be asked for one or more hints. They can be like the hints after -hint: on the command line, but the ':' may not be omitted, and spaces are allowed. Thus, valid hints would for example be &quot;en:John Smith&quot;, &quot;de,nds,af:&quot; or &quot;50:&quot;. &quot;-untranslated&quot; asks for hints only if there are no interwiki links yet; &quot;-untranslatedonly&quot; is like -untranslated, but other pages are not worked on at all.

Instead of giving a hint, you can give an empty line. This specifies that all hints for this page have been given (or that you have no hints for it). Note that if you have given a hint, the bot will keep asking for more hints until you press enter. Another option is to input a question mark and nothing else; in that case you get shown the beginning of the text to the page. If after that you input the question mark again, it will give a larger part of the text, etcetera.

It might in these cases be useful to have the &quot;-confirm&quot; option added, so the bot gets interactive before making a change. This can be used to check whether the links are correct and/or as an impetus to create a backlink.

=== Wiktionary ===
For Wiktionary there is the special &quot;-wiktionary&quot; option. It works like &quot;-hint:all&quot;, but has some extras because on Wiktionary some languages use capitalisation and others don't, and links to another word are never correct.

On non-capitalising wiktionaries, links to capitalising wiktionaries are only added for capitalised words. Also, any link found to a word that differs more than just in capitalisation, is ignored completely.

== Automatic translation ==
For years (both AD and BC) and days of the year, the bot can automatically translate it in a large number of languages. If you do not want this automatic translation (for example because it takes long to go over such a large number of languages), it can be switched off with the &quot;-noauto&quot; option.

With the option &quot;-years:&quot; followed by a number (positive or negative), the bot goes through the years from the given year to 2050. If &quot;-years&quot; without any addition is given, the beginning year is taken to be the year 1.

With the option &quot;-days&quot; the bot goes through the days of the year; however, this bot only works correctly on nl:.

== Avoiding unwanted links ==
If you want to run the bot, but know that for a given page, it will get to links that it should not get, you can use the -noredirect or -neverlink or -select or -ignore options.

-noredirect means that if a redirect page is found, the redirect is not followed, as is the normal behaviour, but the page is skipped.

-neverlink:xx with xx: a language code means that '''any''' links to the language xx: are ignored.

-select lets you select or deselect every single links that is being found individually, before any page is changed.

-ignore:zxx:pagetitle excludes the page named &quot;pagetitle&quot; in language &quot;zxx&quot; and its interwiki links from inclusion, even if there are interwiki links pointing to it.

== Working with the logfile ==

Each run of the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; program will write not only to the screen, but also to a file called &lt;tt&gt;logs/interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt;. You may have seen that once a subject is completed, a list of ''other'' Wikipedias interwiki links is printed preceded by 'WARNING:'. To use these lines, the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt; file is more convenient than the screen.

First an explanation why this is important. Assume you have a page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Subject]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that links to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[fr:Mon Sujet]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[nl:Mijn Onderwerp]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Assume also that neither the nl: nor the fr: page list your en: page: they only know each other. A run of &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; on either fr: or nl: will not find your en: page. This can be referred to as ''the backlink problem'': there can be an ''unknown'' language that link to the others, but as long as none of the others link back, there is no way of discovering the existance. Do we really need to add these ''back''links manually? No, that is where the warnings come in. In the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;WARNING: fr:[[Mon Sujet]] does not link to [[en:My Subject]]
WARNING: nl:[[Mijn Onderwerp]] does not link to [[en:My Subject]]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
If the person running &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; either on fr: or on nl: would have this information, that would be sufficient to get the network of links completed. 

For this reason there is another option for the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; program:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -warnfile:english_treelang.log&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
In this mode the program will read the warnfile, and start to process all of the pages that are mentioned for its home language using the &quot;does not link to&quot; lines as hints. 

This process can still take a long time. If you trust the operator that sent you the log, and the log is recent, you can also do:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python warnfile.py english_treelang.log&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will not verify any of the suggestions in the warnfile, but blindly implement them at full speed, saving the Wikipedia server a lot of efforts.

Now, instead of sending the whole &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt; file to everyone, there is a special program to split it up:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python splitwarning.py&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will read your interwiki.log and create files called &lt;tt&gt;warning_XX.log&lt;/tt&gt; (one for each language) that are more convenient to use..

== Overview of the options ==
Here is a list of the options, with an explanation of those that have not yet been discussed.
* '''-array:''' (usage: &quot;-array:nn&quot; with nn a number) When working on several pages, make sure to have at least this number of pages the bot is working on, if possible. The default value is 100; when using -untranslatedonly or a similar option, you might want to set it lower.
* '''-always:''' Always save the page, even if only one byte has changed (default: save the page only if at least one link has actually changed)
* '''-askhints:''' Ask hints (see above)
* '''-async:''' Puts the page on a queue to be saved to wiki asynchronously. This enables loading pages during saving throtteling and gives a better performance.
* '''-autonomous''' Work in autonomous mode (see above)
* '''-confirm''' Always ask permission before changing a page.
* '''-select''' Ask for each link whether it should be include before changing any page.
* '''-days:''' Work on the days
* '''-file:''' (usage: &quot;-file:filename&quot;) Specifies a file containing a list of pages to process.  (Page names are specified as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[project:lang:pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[lang:pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* '''-force:''' When an interwiki link is to be removed, just do it, don't ask for permission
* '''-hint:''' Give a hint (see above)
* '''-name:''' Old option; equivalent to &quot;-hint:all&quot;, but capitalizes the last word when trying on eo:. Might get deprecated.
* '''-namespace:''' Number or name of namespace to process. Can be used multiple times. Do not use with the -start parameter (use something like -start:Category:! instead)
* '''-neverlink:''' Do not link to a specific language (see above)
* '''-noauto:''' Do not use automatic translation (see above)
* '''-nobacklink:''' Do not give a list of missing links on pages linked to
* '''-nobell:''' Give no audio sign when asking for input.
* '''-noredirect:''' If the bot finds a page linked to is a redirect, it is skipped (normal behaviour: It follows the redirect)
* '''-noshownew:''' Do not show new links found
* '''-number:''' (usage&quot;-number:nn&quot; with nn a number) In combination with -start, checks only the first nn pages rather than the whole wiki.
* '''-same:''' Old option; equivalent to &quot;-hint:all&quot;; might get deprecated
* '''-showpage:''' When using -askhints or some such option, always show the page text, even if not prompted.
* '''-skipfile:''' (usage &quot;-skipfile:filename&quot;) On a run using -start, do not do the pages in the file start
* '''-untranslated:''' Ask hints for untranslated pages (see above)
* '''-untranslatedonly:''' Ask hints for untranslated pages (see above)
* '''-warnfile:''' Use the logfile for pages and hints (see above)
* '''-wiktionary:''' Special wiktionary options (see above)
* '''-years:''' Work on the years

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Pywikibot/SVN}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Script which fixes double redirects, and  deletes broken redirects.

Requires access to MediaWiki's maintenance pages or to a XML dump file.
Delete function requires adminship.

==Syntax==
Syntax:
  python redirect.py ''action'' ''[-argument]''

where ''action'' can be one of these:
* double - fix redirects which point to other redirects
* broken - delete redirects where targets don't exist. Requires adminship.

and ''argument'' (optional) can be:
* xml:filename.xml - Retrieve information from a local XML dump (http://download.wikimedia.org). If this argument isn't given, info will be loaded from a special page of the live wiki. Cannot be used with moves or api.
* api - Retrieve information using Mediawiki's API. Cannot be used with xml.
* moves - Instead of using Special:Doubleredirects, use the page move log to find double-redirect candidates (only works with action &quot;double&quot;, does not work with -xml)
* namespace:n - Namespace to process. Works only with an XML dump or API. Can be repeated multiple times.
* offset:n - With XML number of redirect to restart with (see progress).  With -moves, the number of hours ago to start scanning moved page
* always - Don't prompt you for each replacement.
* start:page - with API start page
* until:page - with API last page
* number:page - with API number of pages to process

If neither api nor api nor moves are present, information will be loaded using a special page

==Example==
This syntax fixes all the double redirects. Since no argument is defined, it uses [[Special:DoubleRedirects]] of the live wiki to find double redirects by default. It will ask for confirmation before making changes:
  redirect.py double

'''Replace.py''' is part of the [[Pywikibot]] framework.

This bot replaces text. It will retrieve information on which pages might need changes either from an XML dump or a text file, or only change a single page. To get some more information, use
 python replace.py -help

==Files ==
The bot uses three files in addition to the framework:
;&lt;tt&gt;replace.py&lt;/tt&gt; : the main module
;&lt;tt&gt;fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt; : a few predefined &quot;fixes&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;user-fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt; : a file to add ones own fixes. The file is created nearly empty by &lt;tt&gt;generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt;

Files that may be used for input and/or output:
;&lt;tt&gt;filename.txt&lt;/tt&gt; : a file with a list of articles if specified with the parameter &quot;-file&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;filename.xml&lt;/tt&gt; : a local XML dump if used with parameter &quot;-xml&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;replacelog&lt;/tt&gt; : the log with a name that may be specified with parameter &quot;-log&quot;

==Parameters==
===Local===
You can run replace.py with the following parameters (for example, &lt;code&gt;python replace.py -file:articles_list.txt &quot;errror&quot; &quot;error&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;| Source
|-
| -xml
| Retrieve information from a local XML dump (pages_current, see http://dumps.wikimedia.org/). Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-xml:filename&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
|-
| -file
| Work on all pages given in a local text file. Will read any &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiki link]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and use these articles. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-file:filename&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
|-
| -cat
| Work on all pages which are in a specific category. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-cat:categoryname&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. 
|-
|| -subcat
|| Works in the same way as '''-cat''', but including subcategories.
|-
| -transcludes
| Work on all pages which transclude a specific template. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-transcludes:referredtemplate&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;&lt;code&gt;-transcludes:stub&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means transcluding stub template.
|-
| -page
| Only edit a specific page. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-page:pagetitle&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. You can give this parameter multiple times to edit multiple pages.
|-

| Work on all pages that link to a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-ref:referredpagetitle&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
|-
| -filelinks
| Works on all pages that link to a certain image. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-filelinks:ImageName&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
|-
| -links
| Work on all pages that are linked to from a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;&lt;code&gt;-links:linkingpagetitle&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
|-
| -start
| Work on all pages in the wiki, starting at a given page. Choose &quot;&lt;code&gt;-start:!&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to start at the beginning. '''Note''': You are advised to use &lt;code&gt;-xml&lt;/code&gt; instead of this option; this is meant for cases where there is no recent XML dump.
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;| Replace parameters
|-
| -except:XYZ ''(older versions only)''
| Ignore pages which contain XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -excepttitle:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip pages with titles that contain XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -excepttext:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip pages which contain the text XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -exceptinside:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip occurences of the to-be-replaced text which lie within XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -exceptinsidetag:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip occurences of the to-be-replaced text which lie within an XYZ tag. Possible values of XYZ include link, nowiki, ref, header, interwiki, and hyperlink.
|-
| -summary:XYZ

The -regex argument and given replacements will be ignored if you use -fix. Currently available predefined fixes are:
* HTML - convert HTML tags to wiki syntax, and fix XHTML.
* syntax - try to fix bad wiki markup.
* case-de - fix case errors in German.
* grammar-de - fix grammar and typography in German.
|-
| -namespace:n
| Number of namespace to process. The parameter can be used multiple times. It works in combination with all other parameters except for the -start parameter. (If you want to change all pages in a particular namespace, add the namespace prefix; for example, &lt;code&gt;-start:User:!&lt;/code&gt;.)
|-
| ''unnamed''
| First unnamed argument is the old text, second argument is the new text. If the -regex argument is given, the first argument will be regarded as a regular expression, and the second argument might contain expressions like \\1 or \g&lt;name&gt;.
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;| Options
|-
| -always
| Don't prompt you for each replacement.
|-
| -recursive
| Recurse replacement until possible.
|-
| -nocase
| Use case insensitive search expressions (including regex).
|-
| -allowoverlap
| When occurrences of the pattern overlap, replace all of them. '''Warning!''' Don't use this option if you don't know what you're doing, because it might easily lead to infinite loops then.
|-

| Make replacements using regular expressions. If this argument isn't given, the bot will make simple text replacements.
|-
| -dotall
| a dot (.) also matches linebreaks when using regex
|}

==Examples==

If you want to change templates from the old syntax, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, to the
new syntax, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, download an XML dump file (page table) from
http://dumps.wikimedia.org/, then use this command:

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -xml -regex &quot;{{msg:(.*?)}}&quot; &quot;{{\1}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that the you can match patterns across more than one line:

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -regex -start:! &quot;First line\nSecond line&quot; &quot;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Replace.py can be used to insert or append text to a page (note the replacement text has an embedded new line):

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -regex '(?ms)^(.*)$' &quot;\1
    &gt; [[Category:NewCat]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you have a dump called foobar.xml and want to fix typos, e.g.
Errror -&gt; Error, use this:

    python replace.py -xml:foobar.xml &quot;Errror&quot; &quot;Error&quot;

If you have a page called 'John Doe' and want to convert HTML tags to wiki
syntax, use:
    
    python replace.py -page:John_Doe -fix:HTML

If you run the bot without arguments you will be prompted multiple times for replacements:

    python replace.py -file:blah.txt

The script asks the user before modifying an article. It is recommended to double-check the result to be sure that the bot did not introduce errors (especially with misspelled words).  It is possible to specify a set of articles with an external text file containing Wiki links : 

&lt;pre&gt;
 [[plane]]
 [[vehicle]]
 [[train]]
 [[car]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The bot is then called using something like : 

  python replace.py [global-arguments] -file:articles_list.txt &quot;errror&quot; &quot;error&quot; 

Rather than specifying regular expressions at the command line, it's preferable to add them to &lt;tt&gt;user-fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt;

  python replace.py -file:articles_list.txt -fix:example2

=== Example: Replacing multiple paragraphs ===
The original text of the page [[Meta:Sandbox]] is:
&lt;pre&gt;This page is for any tests.

Welcome to the sandbox!&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to switch the statement (the second one goes before the first one), you type the following syntax:
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;replace.py -page:Meta:Sandbox -regex &quot;This page is for any tests.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the sandbox!&quot; &quot;Welcome to the sandbox!\n\nThis page is for any tests.&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

To add a new line we use &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Solve disambiguation.py screenshot ck.jpg|thumb|450px|Helping you choose the right page out of several disambiguated ones.]]

'''solve_disambiguation.py''' is a [[pywikibot|python bot]] script to help a human solve links to disambiguation pages by presenting a set of options.

Type in the disambiguation page on the command line. The program will pick up the page, and create a menu of all outbound links found on the page, with a unique number adjacent to each link.   It will then automatically loop over all pages which refer to the disambiguation page, and show 30 characters of context on each side of the reference to help you make the decision between the alternatives. It will ask you to type the number of the appropriate replacement, and perform the change.

It is possible to choose to replace only the link (just type the number) or
replace both link and link-text (type '&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;' followed by the number).

Multiple references in one page will be scanned in order, but typing '&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;' (next)
on any one of them will leave the complete page unchanged. To leave only some reference unchanged, use the '&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;' (skip) option.

Command line options (in addition to the general options for all bots):

;&lt;nowiki&gt;-pos:XXXX&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
:adds &lt;code&gt;XXXX&lt;/code&gt; as an alternative disambiguation
;-just
:Only use the alternatives given on the command line, do not read the page for other possibilities.
;-redir      
:If the page is a redirect page, use the page redirected to as the (only) alternative; if not set, the pages linked to from the page redirected to are used. If the page is not a redirect page, this will raise an error.
;-primary    
:&quot;Primary topic&quot; disambiguation (Begriffsklärung nach Modell 2).  That's titles where one topic is much more important, the disambiguation page is saved somewhere else, and the important topic gets the nice name.  All links found on page &lt;code&gt;XXXX&amp;nbsp;(disambiguation)&lt;/code&gt; will be listed as options for the user, but the bot will still work on links to &lt;code&gt;XXXX&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-primary:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Like the above, but use XY as the only alternative, instead of searching for alternatives in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Keyword (disambiguation)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Note: this is the same as &lt;code&gt;-primary -just -pos:XY&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-file:XYZ&lt;/nowiki&gt;   
:Reads a list of pages, which can for example be gotten through extract_names.py. XYZ is the name of the file from which the list is taken. If XYZ is not given, the user is asked for a  filename.
:Page titles should be listed one per line, with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[brackets]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:The &lt;code&gt;-pos&lt;/code&gt; parameter won't work if &lt;code&gt;-file&lt;/code&gt; is used.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-always:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Instead of asking the user what to do, always perform the same  action. For example, &lt;code&gt;XY&lt;/code&gt; can be &quot;r0&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or &quot;2&quot;. '''Be careful''' with  this option, and check the changes made by the bot. Note that  some choices for XY don't make sense and will result in a loop, ''e.g.'', &quot;l&quot; or &quot;m&quot;.
;-main
:Only check pages in the main namespace, not in the talk,  wikipedia, user, etc. namespaces.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-start:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Goes through all disambiguation pages in the category on your wiki that is defined (to the bot) as the category containing disambiguation pages, starting at XY. If only '-start' or '-start:' is given, it starts at the beginning.

To complete a move of a page, one can use:

    python solve_disambiguation.py -just -pos:New_Name Old_Name

'''Table2wiki.py''' is part of the [[pywikibot]] framework.

Converts HTML-tables to MediaWiki's language.

Example of the simplest syntax:

table2wiki.py &quot;article name&quot; 
This way only 1 article is changed.

The process can also take place automatically, to do this a xml dump is needed:

 table2wiki.py -xml:20050406_cur_table.xml -lang:en 
-xml = name of the xml dump.

Note: Every change needs to be checked. This bot can make mistakes.

This [[pywikibot]] script replaces a template with another, and converts the old MediaWiki boilerplate format to the new template format.

== Usage ==
: Syntax: &lt;code&gt;python template.py [-remove] [xml[:filename]] &quot;oldTemplate&quot; [&quot;newTemplate&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;
: Example: &lt;code&gt;python template.py &quot;Cities in Washington&quot; &quot;Cities in Washington State&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
Specify the template on the command line. The program will pick up the template page, and look for all pages using it. It will then automatically loop over them, and replace the template.

=== Command line options ===
* -remove: Remove every occurence of the template from every article
* -subst: Resolves the template by putting its text directly into the article. This is done by changing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; into &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* -xml: retrieve information from a local dump (http://download.wikimedia.org). if this argument isn't given, info will be loaded from the maintenance page of the live wiki. argument can also be given as &quot;-xml:filename.xml&quot;.
* -namespace: Only process templates in the given namespace number (may be used multiple times).
* -summary: Lets you pick a custom edit summary.  Use quotes if edit summary contains spaces.
* -always: Don't bother asking to confirm any of the changes, Just Do It.
* -category: Appends the given category to every page that is edited.  This is useful when a category is being broken out from a template parameter or when templates are being upmerged but more information must be preserved.
* oldTemplate: old template name
* newTemplate: new template name. If only one argument is given, the bot resolves the template by putting its text directly into the article. This is done by changing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; into &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If you want to address a template which has spaces, put quotation marks around it.

Script to upload images to MediaWiki wikis.
== Usage ==
 python upload.py [Global-arguments] [-keep] [-filename:targetFilename] [-noverify] [URL-or-filename [description-text]]

{{Pywikibot/global options}}

== Arguments ==
{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 | -keep
 |Keep the filename as is
 |-
 | -filename
 |Target filename
 |-
 | -noverify
 |Do not ask for verification of the upload description if one is given
 |}

If any other arguments are given, the first is the URL or filename to upload, and the rest is a proposed description to go with the upload. If none of these are given, the user is asked for the
file or URL to upload. The bot will then upload the image to the wiki.

The script will ask for the location of an image, if not given as a parameter,
and for a description.

If the -filename argument is given, then it is used as the name of the image on the wiki; otherwise it is based on the filename or url of the input file.

If -keep is not specified, then the target filename undergoes some further checking, and the user is asked for confirmation. The / character is forbidden, and the filename extension (after the dot) must be one of these: gif, jpg, jpeg, mid, midi, ogg, png, svg, xcf, djvu. If the check is failed, then the user is prompted for a new filename.

Spaces in the filename will automatically be converted to underscores, since mediawiki doesn't allow spaces. The encoding of the filename will also be converted to the encoding used on the target site (typically unicode). The script also attempts to convert the description to the wiki's target encoding, or, as a last resort, will convert characters to html entities.

Error detection is based on both the http status and the contents of the response, which is assumed to be in English; error detection may fail if the bot's account has been set not to show an English interface.

'''weblinkchecker.py''' is a script from the [[pywikibot]] framework. The script finds broken external links.

weblinkchecker.py can either check all URLs found in a single article, or in all articles (in alphabetical order). It will only check HTTP and HTTPS links, and it will leave out URLs inside comments and nowiki tags. To speed itself up, it will check up to 50 links at the same time, using multithreading.

The bot won't remove external links by itself, it will only report them; removal would require strong artificial intelligence. It will only report dead links if they have been found offline at least two times, with at least one week of waiting between the first and the last time. This should prevent users from removing links just because of a temporary server failure. Please keep in mind that the bot can't yet differentiate between '''failures of your own connection''' and a server failure, so make sure you're on a stable Internet connection.

The bot will save a history of broken links to the &lt;code&gt;deadlinks&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, e.g. &lt;code&gt;deadlinks/deadlinks-wikipedia-de.dat&lt;/code&gt;. This file is not intended to be read or modified by humans. The dat file will be written when the bot terminates (because it is done or the user pressed CTRL-C).

After the bot has checked some pages, run it on these pages again at a later time. This can be done with this command:

&lt;code&gt;python weblinkchecker.py -repeat&lt;/code&gt;

If the bot finds a broken link that was already broken at least one week earlier, it will log it in a text file, e.g. &lt;code&gt;deadlinks/results-wikipedia-de.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The written text has a format that is suitable for posting it on the wiki, so that others can help you to fix or remove the broken links from the wiki pages.

Additionally, it's possible to report broken links to the talk page of the article in which the URL was found (again, only once the linked page has been unavailable at least twice in at least one week). To use this feature, set &lt;tt&gt;report_dead_links_on_talk = True&lt;/tt&gt; in your &lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;.

Reports will include a link to the [http://web.archive.org/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine] if available, so that important references can be kept.

For syntax explanation run:
 python weblinkchecker.py -help

'''cosmetic_changes.py''' makes little changes in one or several wiki pages that make the source code look cleaner. These changes are not supposed to change the look of the rendered wiki pages.

Before running it on a specific wiki, each sub-module should be reviewed and checked if it is helpful for this wiki.


This script performs the following operations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/cosmetic_changes.py source code, function &quot;change&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''fix self interwiki'': interwiki links to the site itself are displayed like local links, removing their language code prefix.
* ''standardize page footer'': makes sure that categories, stars templates for featured articles and interwiki links are put to the correct position. templates and interwiki links are sorted into the right order.
* ''clean up links'': improves how links are presented by doing the following:
** replaces underlines by spaces, also multiple underlines.
** removes unnecessary leading spaces from a title.
** removes unnecessary trailing spaces from a title.
** converts URL-encoded characters to unicode.
** removes unnecessary initial and final spaces from a label.
** tries to capitalize the first letter of the title.
* ''clean up section headers'': for better readability of section header source code, puts a space between the equal signs and the title; for example: &quot;==Section title==&quot; becomes &quot;== Section title ==&quot; .
* ''put spaces in lists'': for better readability of bullet list and enumeration wiki source code, puts a space between the * or # and the text.
* ''translate and capitalize namespaces'': makes sure that localized namespace names are used. Does not change &quot;image&quot; alias on en-wiki or fr-wiki.
* ''resolve html entities''
* ''valid xhtml'': tries to make a valid XHTML document, for example, replacing &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; by &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;
* ''remove useless spaces''
* ''remove non breaking space before percent'': newer MediaWiki versions automatically place a non-breaking space in front of a percent sign, so it is no longer required to place it manually.
* ''fix syntax'': correct mediawiki syntax for external links
* ''fix HTML'': translates some HTML-entities into the corresponding mediawiki syntax; remove unneeded &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag.
* ''fix style'': convert wikitable to wikitable class (de-wiki and en-wiki only).
* 'fix typo'': change ccm with preleading number to cm³; change º to ° if it concerns degree Celsius or Fahrenheit
* ''hyphenate isbn numbers'': tries to hyphenate an ISBN

'''login.py''' is the python program that logs the user running the pywikipedia bot on to the system using the data that can be found in '''user-config.py'''.

==Logging in as a bot==
Bots provide specified result and as a consequence, they should not need the attention that other changes require. By having a specific user to run the bot software, the changes created in this way will be hidden on a typical '''recent changes''' screen. Bot status is given when a community is in favour with someone running a bot.

If you want to login also with your sysop account (deleting moved categories...) you have to add
&lt;pre&gt;
sysopnames['wikiproject']['languagecode'] = u'YourSysopUsername'
&lt;/pre&gt;
to ''user-config.py'' and start ''login.py'' with the '''-sysop''' parameter

==How it knows where to login==
In the user-config.py file there are three components:
#the language: mylang
#the family: family - this indicates wiki name, including [[w:|wikipedia]] or [[wikt:|wiktionary]]
#the username: username - this can be any user but it should be a user who is registered to run as a bot.

In order to login to all the projects/languages mentioned in user-config.py, the option &lt;tt&gt;-all&lt;/tt&gt; can be used, and if the same password is used throughout all these projects, it can be combined with &lt;tt&gt;-pass&lt;/tt&gt; so that the program doesn't ask for a password for each site.
 login.py -all -pass
will login on all projects in user-config.py, using the same password for all.

'''archivebot.py''' is a script to archive discussion pages.

The bot examines backlinks (Special:Whatlinkshere) to the requested page(s).
It then goes through all pages (or a specific page if specified using options)
and archives old discussions. This is done by breaking a page into threads,
then scanning each thread for timestamps. Threads older than a specified
threshold are then moved to another page (the archive), the name of which can
be based on either the thread's name or a counter that is incremented when the
archive reaches a certain size.
The archive bot is usually used in the article talk page, user talk page, and Reading room.

==Parameters==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Usage: archivebot.py [options] [LINKPAGE(s)]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  load list of pages from FILE
  -p PAGE, --page=PAGE  archive a single PAGE
  -n NAMESPACE, --namespace=NAMESPACE
                        only archive pages from a given namespace
  -s SALT, --salt=SALT  specify salt
  -F, --force           override security options
  -c PAGE, --calc=PAGE  calculate key for PAGE and exit
  -l LOCALE, --locale=LOCALE
                        switch to locale LOCALE
  -L lang, --lang=lang  current language code
  -T TIMEZONE, --timezone=TIMEZONE
                        switch timezone to TIMEZONE
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Examples==

(Got any good examples? This page could use them.)

'''basic.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework. It is not a complete bot; rather, it is a template from which simple bots can be made. You can rename it to mybot.py, then edit it in whatever way you want.

== Parameters ==
The following parameters are supported:

;-debug:If given, doesn't do any real changes, but only shows what would have been changed.

All other parameters will be regarded as part of the title of a single page,
and the bot will only work on that single page.

== Example ==
&lt;code&gt;python basic.py -debug User:MyUserName&lt;/code&gt;
:This tries to add 'Text ' in front of the page ''User:MyUserName''. Since the -debug option is given, the page wouldn't be changed.

'''category_redirect.py''' will move pages out of redirected categories.

The bot will look for categories that are marked with a category redirect
template, take the first parameter of the template as the target of the
redirect, and move all pages and subcategories of the category there. It
also changes hard redirects into soft redirects, and fixes double redirects.
A log is written under &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;userpage&gt;/category_redirect_log&lt;/code&gt;. Only category pages
that haven't been edited for a certain cooldown period (currently 7 days)
are taken into account.

==Parameters==

No bot-specific parameters.

'''Copyright.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework that checks copyright text in Google, Yahoo! and Live Search.

Google search requires to install the pyGoogle module from http://pygoogle.sf.net and get a Google API license key from http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/ (but since December 2006 Google is no longer issuing new SOAP API keys).

Yahoo! search requires pYsearch module from http://pysearch.sourceforge.net (Debian and Ubuntu package this as &lt;tt&gt;python-pysearch&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;python-yahoo&lt;tt&gt;, depending on your version) and a Yahoo AppID from http://developer.yahoo.com.

Windows Live Search requires to install the SOAPpy module from http://pywebsvcs.sf.net (Debian and Ubuntu package this as &lt;tt&gt;python-soappy&lt;/tt&gt;) and get an AppID from http://search.msn.com/developer.

== Configuration ==
Before use the script you have to add to user-config.py one or more search engine keys. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
yahoo_appid = 'Key'
msn_appid = 'Key'
&lt;/source&gt;

== Parameters ==

;g
:Use Google search engine
;ng
:Do not use Google
;y
:Use Yahoo! search engine
;ny
:Do not use Yahoo!
;maxquery
:Stop after a specified number of queries for page (default: 25)
;new
:Check only the new pages
;repeat
;output
:Use this option to enable the output
:Append results to a specified file (default: 'copyright/output.txt')
;file
:Work on all pages given in a local text file. Will read any [[wiki link]] and use these articles. Argument can also be given as &quot;-file:filename&quot;.
;cat
:Work on all pages which are in a specific category. Argument can also be given as &quot;-cat:categoryname&quot;.
;subcat
:When the pages to work on have been chosen by -cat, pages in subcategories of the selected category are also included. When -cat has not been selected, this has no effect.
;page
:Only check a specific page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-page:pagetitle&quot;. You can give this parameter multiple times to check multiple pages.
;ref
:Work on all pages that link to a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-ref:referredpagetitle&quot;.
;filelinks
:Works on all pages that link to a certain image. Argument can also be given as &quot;-filelinks:ImageName&quot;.
;links
:Work on all pages that are linked to from a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-links:linkingpagetitle&quot;.
;start
:Work on all pages in the wiki, starting at a given page.
;namespace:n
:Number of namespace to process. The parameter can be used multiple times.

== Examples ==

If you want to check first 50 new articles then use this command:
 python copyright.py -new:50

If you want to check a category with no limit for number of queries to
request, use this:
 python copyright.py -cat:&quot;Wikipedia featured articles&quot; -maxquery:0

This script can be used to delete pages en masse. You will need an admin account on the relevant wiki. Also add:

&lt;tt&gt;sysopnames['wikipedia']['en'] = 'adminname'&lt;/tt&gt;

To &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;

Where ['wikipedia'] is the name of the the family in which you are working on.

'adminname' is the username.

===Examples===

*Delete everything in the category &quot;To delete&quot; without prompting.

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -cat:&quot;To delete&quot; -always&lt;/tt&gt;

*Delete everything in the pages linked to the page, without prompting.

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py &quot;deletepage&quot; -always&lt;/tt&gt;

*Delete pages inside a text file:

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -file:nuke.txt -always -summary:&quot;Because I feel like it&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

The format of the text file should be as the following:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# [[Main Page]]
# [[Talk:Main Page]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

*Restore pages:

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -undelete -file:respawn.txt -summary:&quot;It was a foolish mistake&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

===Arguments===

* -cat:   Delete all pages in the given category.
* -links:      Delete all pages linked from a given page.
* -always      Don't prompt to delete pages, just do it.
* -summary:    Supply a custom edit summary.
* -undelete:   Actually undelete pages instead of deleting. Works only with -page and -file.
* -file:       Delete all pages listed in a given text file.  The list should be of the format
** &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# [[page1]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# [[page2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;''etc.''&lt;/code&gt;

===Usage output===

Usage is reported thus;

 Global arguments available for all bots:
 
 -lang:xx          Set the language of the wiki you want to work on, overriding
                   the configuration in user-config.py. xx should be the
                   language code.
 
 -family:xyz       Set the family of the wiki you want to work on, e.g.
                   wikipedia, wiktionary, wikivoyage, ...
                   This will override the configuration in user-config.py.
 
 -log              Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs
                   subdirectory.
 
 -log:xyz          Enable the logfile, using xyz as the filename.
 
 -nolog            Disable the logfile (if it is enabled by default).
 
 -putthrottle:nn   Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between
                   saving pages.
 
 
 This script can be used to delete and undelete pages en masse.
 Of course, you will need an admin account on the relevant wiki.
 
 Syntax: python delete.py [-cat:categoryName|-page:pageName|...] [-summary:&quot;text&quot;] [-undelete] [-always]

'''Imageharvest.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework. It is used to copy multiple images to a wiki.  It takes a URL as an
argument and finds all images (and other files specified by the extensions in 'fileformats') that URL is referring to, asking whether to upload them. If further arguments are given, they are considered to be the text that is common to the descriptions.

A second use is to get a number of images that have URLs only differing in numbers. To do this, use the command line option &quot;-pattern&quot;, and give the URL with the variable part replaced by '$' (if that character occurs in the URL itself, you will have to change the bot code, my apologies).

Other options:
&lt;pre&gt;
-shown      Choose images shown on the page as well as linked from it
-justshown  Choose _only_ images shown on the page, not those linked
&lt;/pre&gt;

Syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
    python imageharvest.py http://www.sitename.org/folder 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Imagetransfer.py''' is a script of the [[pywikibot]] framework. It is used to copy images from one wiki to another wiki. If you want to transfer image to Wikimedia Commons you should use [[../imagecopy.py/]].

Syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
    python imagetransfer.py [common-arguments] pagename [-interwiki] [-tolang:xx] [-tofamily:yy]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Arguments:
&lt;pre&gt;

  -interwiki   Look for images in pages found through interwiki links.

  -tolang:xx   Copy the image to the wiki in language xx

  -tofamily:yy Copy the image to a wiki in the family yy

  -file:zz     Upload many files from textfile: [[Image:xx]]
                                                [[Image:yy]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

If pagename is an image description page, offers to copy the image to the target site. If it is a normal page, it will offer to copy any of the images used on that page, or if the -interwiki argument is used, any of the images used on a page reachable via interwiki links.

 &amp;nbsp;
 -prefix           Move pages by adding a namespace prefix to the names of the pages.
                   (Will remove the old namespace prefix if any)
                   Argument can also be given as &quot;-prefix:namespace:&quot;.
 &amp;nbsp;

'''Pagefromfile.py''' is part of the [[pywikibot]] framework.

With this script you can create pages from a textfile.

The file should be in UTF-8 and if you want to create multiple pages from a file you should separate the articles as specified by the '''-start''' and '''-end''' arguments.

The pagename will be the first headword in your textfile (the first word between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''' '''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). It is currently automatically inserted in the uploaded page.

'''WARNING''': the script parses the input text in a recursive way, so it can easily run out of memory if the text contains several pages. It is advisable to break the input text into single pages and upload them individually.

Specific arguments:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!| arg || Description || Default
|-
|| -start:xxxx  
|| Specify the text that is the beginning of a page
|| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{-start-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -end:yyyy 
|| Specify the text that is the end of a page
|| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{-stop-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -file:zzz   
|| Give the filename we are getting our material from  
|| &lt;tt&gt;dict.txt&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -include   
|| The beginning and end text should be included in the page.
|| do not include
|-
|| -notitle
|| Do not include the title line in the page.
|| include title line
|-
||-titlestart:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for identifying the beginning of the page title
|| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||-titleend:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for identifying the end of the page title
|| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||-summary:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; as the summary for the upload.&lt;br /&gt;Leave &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; empty so as to use mediawikis autosummary.
|| depending on language
|-
||-minor
|| Set minor edit flag on page edits.
|| not selected
|-
||-dry
|| Do not really upload pages, just check and report messages.
|| not selected
|-
||-safe
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, do nothing, i.e. skip it.
|rowspan=&quot;4&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot;| -safe
|-
||-appendtop
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, add the text to the top of it.
|-
||-appendbottom
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, add the text to the bottom of it.
|-
||-force
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, overwrite the existing page.
|}

E.g.: &lt;tt&gt;Filename.xml&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
xxxx
'''PageName'''
Text here

yyyy
xxxx
'''AnotherPageName'''
Another text
yyyy
&lt;/pre&gt;
Usage:
&lt;pre&gt;
pagefromfile.py [global-arguments] -start:xxxx -end:yyyy -file:Filename.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''protect.py''' can be used to protect and unprotect pages en masse. To do this, you need an admin account on that wiki.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import wikipedia

def protect(pageName, reason):
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    page = wikipedia.Page(site, pageName)
    page.protect(reason, False)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    try:
        protect('Test', &quot;Bot: Test&quot;)
    except:
        wikipedia.stopme()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()     
&lt;/source&gt;

See [[Pywikibot/wikipedia.py|wikipedia.py]] for more details of the protect function.

Docs in code:
&lt;pre&gt;

-always:     Don't prompt to protect pages, just do it.
-summary:    Supply a custom edit summary.
-unprotect:   Actually unprotect pages instead of protecting
-edit:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set edit protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL
-move:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set move protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL

## Without support ##
## -create:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set move protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL ##

Values for PROTECTION_LEVEL are: sysop, autoconfirmed, none.
If an operation parameter (edit, move or create) is not specified, default
protection level is 'sysop' (or 'none' if -unprotect).

'''standardize_interwiki.py''', this bot moves the interwiki links on top of the articles. It is recommended to check whether this kind of bot is accepted on your wiki. This bot should '''not''' be used if you are not sure what you are doing. You should run this bot under strict supervision because when it is launched, it will parse all articles starting from the one you specified and will not stop : 

 python standardize_interwiki.py -start &quot;plane&quot;

Paramaters:

'''-start''' - Will ask you which page you want to start from. For example, entering &quot;plane&quot;, will start at &quot;plane&quot; and then move to the next article starting with &quot;pl&quot;, etc. This may flood the edits.

'''standardize_notes.py''' is a [[pywikibot]] script for improving references and citations.

The current version
* Uses [[en:Wikipedia:Footnotes]] numbered link format through &quot;ref&quot; and &quot;note&quot; templates.
* Converts inline URLs to Footnotes format links to citation entries.
* Converts older link formats such as Footnotes2 to Footnotes format.
* Searches for existing footnotes or citations in several section names, such as &quot;Notes&quot; or &quot;References&quot;.
* Creates citation entries using [[en:WP:CITE]] citation templates.
** For citations for which only a URL is known, attempts to access the URL.
*** Attempts to get title information from HTTP or PDF information.
** &quot;Web reference&quot; citations are created by default.
** &quot;News reference&quot; citations are created for certain URLs.
* Rebuilds notes section in same sequence as text references.
* Some multiple references are converted to &quot;ref_label&quot; and &quot;note_label&quot; multiple links.
* Detects some duplicate citations, labels them with &quot;see above&quot;.
* Keeps existing notes, does not yet examine content of notes other than leading &quot;*&quot; or &quot;#&quot; list indicator.

Default behavior includes displaying changes and asking for confirmation to perform the intended changes.

If no title information is found or there are errors in accessing the URL, the title will contain the URL.

'''Welcome.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework used to welcome new users. This script works out of the box for wikis that have been defined in the script. It is currently used on the Dutch, Norwegian and Italian Wikipedia, and Wikimedia Commons and English Wikiquote.

If you want download the latest version of this code use [[Pywikibot/SVN|SVN]] or copy the script from [http://botwiki.sno.cc/wiki/Python:Welcome.py this wiki].

Ensure you have community support before running this bot!

== URLs to current implementations ==
* Arabic Wikipedia: http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/ويكيبيديا:سجل_الترحيب
* Wikimedia Commons: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Welcome_log
* Dutch Wikipedia: http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Logboek_welkom
* English Wikiquote: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Welcome_log
* Persian Wikipedia: http://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/ویکی‌پدیا:سیاهه_خوشامد

Because of the fact that every project has different settings, the Bot won't work if you don't put the right translation of the dictionaries that are already in the script.

== Description of basic functionality ==
* Request a list of new users every period (default: 3600 seconds)
* Ignore local bot accounts and users with ''bot'' as part of his name which may be a global bot
* Check if new user has passed a threshold for a number of edits (default: 1 edit)
* Optional: check username for bad words in the username or if the username consists solely of numbers; log this somewhere on the wiki (default: False)
* If user has made any edits, check if user has an empty talk page
* If user had an empty talk page, add a welcome message
* Optional: Once the set number of users have been welcomed, add this to the configured log page, one for each day (default: True)
* If no log page exists, create a header for the log page first.

== Parameters ==
This script (by default not yet implemented) uses two templates that need to be on the local wiki:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{WLE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: contains mark up code for log entries (just copy it from Commons)
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: contains the information for new users

This script understands the following command-line arguments:
&lt;pre&gt;
    -edit[:#]      Define how many edits a new user needs to be welcomed
                   (default: 1, max: 50)

    -time[:#]      Define how many seconds the bot sleeps before restart
                   (default: 3600)

    -break         Use it if you don't want that the Bot restart at the end
                   (it will break) (default: False)

    -nlog          Use this parameter if you do not want the bot to log all
                   welcomed users (default: False)

    -limit[:#]     Use this parameter to define how may users should be
                   checked (default:50)

    -offset[:TIME] Skip the latest new users (those newer than TIME)
                   to give interactive users a chance to welcome the
                   new users (default: now)
                   Timezone is the server timezone, GMT for Wikimedia
                   TIME format : yyyymmddhhmmss

    -timeoffset[:#] Skip the latest new users, accounts newer than
                    # minutes

    -numberlog[:#] The number of users to welcome before refreshing the
                   welcome log (default: 4)

    -filter        Enable the username checks for bad names (default: False)

    -ask           Use this parameter if you want to confirm each possible
                   bad username (default: False)

    -random        Use a random signature, taking the signatures from a wiki
                   page (for instruction, see below).

    -file[:#]      Use a file instead of a wikipage to take the random sign.
                   If you use this parameter, you don't need to use -random.
                   
    -sign          Use one signature from command line instead of the default

    -savedata      This feature saves the random signature index to allow to
                   continue to welcome with the last signature used.

    -sul           Welcome the auto-created users (default: False)

    -quiet         Prevents users without contributions are displayed

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Extra-functionality guide ==
 
Report, Bad Word and White List Guide:
 
# Set in the code which page it will use to load the bad word list, the white list and the report.
# In these pages you have to add a &quot;tuple&quot; with the names that you want to add in the two lists. For example: ('cat', 'mouse', 'dog'). You can also write other text in the page; it will work without problems.
#What will the two pages do?  Well, the Bot will check if a badword is in the username and set the &quot;warning&quot; to True. Then the Bot checks if a word of the white list is in the username. If yes, it removes the word and rechecks in the bad-word list to see if there are other bad words in the username.
# '''Example''':
#* dio is a badword
#* Claudio is a normal name
#* The username is &quot;Claudio90 fuck!&quot;
#* The Bot find dio and set &quot;warning&quot;
#* The Bot find Claudio and set &quot;ok&quot;
#* The Bot find fuck at the end and set &quot;warning&quot;
#* Result: The username is reported.
#When a user is reported you have to check him and do the following:
#* If he's ok, put out the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#* If he's not, block him
#* You can decide to put in a &quot;you are blocked, change to another username&quot; template or not.
#* Delete the username from the page.

'''Important''': The Bot checks the user in this order:
* Searches to see if he has a talkpage (if yes, skip).
* Searches to see if he's blocked, if yes he will be skipped.
* Searches to see if he's in the report page, if yes he will be skipped.
* If no, he will be reported.

== Random sign guide ==
 
* Set the page that the bot will load
* Add the signs in this way:
&lt;pre&gt;*&lt;white space&gt;SIGN
&lt;new line&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
'''Example''':

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
* [[User:Filnik|Filnik]]
* [[User:Rock|Rock]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
 
'''Note''': The white space and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; aren't required but I suggest you to use them.

==  Known issues/FIXMEs ==
* exits when wiki is down.
* add variable for how many users to skip (f.e. the 10 latest users, that may not have made any edits)
* use default pages if a wiki is not configured, so no configuration of the script would be required at all. Suggestion: use English language defaults.
* The regex to load the user might be slightly different from project to project. (in this case, write to [[User:Filnik|Filnik]] for help...)
* If the User talk: translation has non-standard character it won't work.
* Add in the report, the badword used to detect the user.

{{Prerequisite|Python}}

'''wikipedia.py'''([http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/wikipedia.py]) is a module available with the [[Pywikibot|pywikibot framework]]. This module offers some internal classes and functions to be used in front-end scripts to provide automated editing and retrieve information from edit histories of users and pages, categorization of pages and so on. Based on the APIs explained here, you can create your own front-end program for automating actions at Wikipedia. Running wikipedia.py itself directly, one would get the version information as output.

== Page class, site class and wikipedia.stopme() function ==
The most important class (and the most used) is the Page class. It provides all the common action for a wikipage. To use that, you must first of all call it, and only afterwards can you use its internal function.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia # Import the wikipedia module

site = wikipedia.getSite() # Taking the default site
page = wikipedia.Page(site, 'PAGENAME') # Calling the constructor
print page
wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example, you import the wikipedia module. After that it's needed to define the site where the page is. If you take it how it's done in the example, you'll take the page that is in the project set in user-config.py. 

If you want to load the page of a different project you have to do as in the following example. At the end, there is &lt;tt&gt;wikipedia.stopme()&lt;/tt&gt; that is needed so that your other bot processes aren't slowed down.
 
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
enWikisrcSite = wikipedia.getSite('en', 'wikisource') # loading a defined project's page
page = wikipedia.Page(enWikisrcSite, 'Main Page')
text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
print text
wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

== Rewrite code better  ==
In the previous example, you import wikipedia. The site is defined as English Wikisource, with the parameters 'en' and 'wikisource'. Then we define the Main Page as the page to take. And we load the text.

Then we print the text to the screen to let the user read it.  Actually, this code is not really clean and good. An experienced coder can improve it as follows.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    titleOfPageToLoad = u'Main Page' # The &quot;u&quot; before the title means Unicode, important for special characters
    wikipedia.output(u'Loading %s...' % titleOfPageToLoad)
    enwiktsite = wikipedia.getSite('en', 'wikisource') # loading a defined project's page
    page = wikipedia.Page(enwiktsite, titleOfPageToLoad)
    text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
    wikipedia.output(text) # Print the text, encoding it with wikipedia's method

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

This code is better than before for many reasons. First of all, it uses a function and it's not procedural as before. In this way, the main function will only be invoked if the script is called directly. This makes it possible to import it from another script, making the code more modular and reusable.

Furthermore, the try/finally block guarantees that stopme() is always called, even when an exception is raised. This prevents the slowing down of other process and is quicker when you test a script.

Another interesting new thing is the use of wikipedia.output(). It does the same job of printing &quot;something&quot; but, and this is the important thing, it encodes and decodes the text using the encoding defined in user-config. This makes sure that special characters like Umlauts or Cyrillic letters are shown correctly. '''Note:''' If you don't put the text in the u&quot;something&quot; (with the u) the function will return a (handled, but ugly to see) error. (the text variable contain already the code encode in a good way, so it won't raise an exception).

Unfortunately, you can't always be sure that the page you are trying to load exists. To prevent that, wikipedia.py will raise a NoPage exception. You can use an except block to solve the problem, as in the following example.

== site.allpages() function and the wikipedia.py errors ==
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    startpage = '!'
    for page in site.allpages(startpage): # Use a generetor object, this will yield all pages one by one
        pagename = page.title() # Take the title of the page (not &quot;[[page]]&quot; but &quot;page&quot;)
        wikipedia.output(u&quot;Loading %s...&quot; % pagename) # Please, see the &quot;u&quot; before the text
        try:
            text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
        except wikipedia.NoPage: # First except, prevent empty pages
            text = ''
        except wikipedia.IsRedirectPage: # second except, prevent redirect
            wikipedia.output(u'%s is a redirect!' % pagename)
            continue
        except wikipedia.Error: # third exception, take the problem and print
            wikipedia.output(u&quot;Some error, skipping..&quot;)
            continue     
        wikipedia.output(text) # Print the output, encoding it with wikipedia's method

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we can see our first generator object that is in wikipedia.py. First of all, we define the site (it's suggested to do it immediatly, because it's quite impossibile not to use a site's function if you need to work with wikipedia). The second variable is the page from which the Bot will load all the pages on your wikimedia's project. 

Then, in the line below, you start a for cycle parsing every page on Wikipedia. Look out, because the function allpages() isn't a sub-function of wikipedia, but of site! (so, you can determine from what project you want to load all the pages). 

The allpages() function has optional parameter, one of these are the start page (default = '!'), then there is the namespace (default = 0), then if you want to include redirects (default: True), and the throttle (default: True). In the example, if you wanted to use the optional parameters as well, you would have used:
&lt;pre&gt;
def allpages(self, start = '!', namespace = 0, includeredirects = True, throttle = True)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the line below, we load the page's title, in this way you don't print &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but Page, so it's a better output. Two lines below, you find the try/except block. 

The Bot tries to load the page and if it doesn't exists (maybe someone has deleted it while the bot was running) it will print only a empty text (you can do what you want, I've choosen this only for explanation purpose). If the page is a redirect, it will notify it and, to make sure that nothing will happend, we put an extreme Exception that don't block the Bot (for example, if there is a Spamfilter's problem, it will be handled in this way). The possible Wikipedia's Errors are:

&lt;pre&gt;
*wikipedia.Error                General Error
*wikipedia.NoUsername           the Username is not in user-config.py
*wikipedia.NoPage               The Page does not exist
*wikipedia.IsRedirectPage       The Page is a redirect page
*wikipedia.IsNotRedirectPage    The Page is not a redirect page
*wikipedia.LockedPage           The Page is locked
*wikipedia.LockedNoPage         Page does not exist, and creating it is not possible because of a lock (cascading protection)
*wikipedia.NoSuchEntity         No entity exist for this character
*wikipedia.SectionError         The section specified by # does not exist
*wikipedia.PageNotSaved         Saving the page has failed (General Error)
*wikipedia.EditConflict         There has been an edit conflict while uploading the page
*wikipedia.SpamfilterError      Saving the page has failed because the MediaWiki spam filter detected a blacklisted URL.
*wikipedia.ServerError          Got unexpected server response
*wikipedia.UserBlocked          Your username or IP has been blocked
*wikipedia.PageNotFound         Page not found in list
&lt;/pre&gt;

== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).get() and wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).put() analysis ==
Now we have only done a few tests, but the real job of a Bot, on Wikipedia, is to modify pages! It's not made to print in a DOS screen what is in a page. So, let's try to make the Bot to put the text inside a page.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    pagename = 'Wikipedia:Sandbox'
    page = wikipedia.Page(site, pagename)
    wikipedia.output(u&quot;Loading %s...&quot; % pagename) # Please, see the &quot;u&quot; before the text
    try:
        text = page.get(force = False, get_redirect=False, throttle = True, sysop = False, 
                                             change_edit_time = True) # text = page.get() &lt;-- is the same
    except wikipedia.NoPage: # First except, prevent empty pages
        text = ''
    except wikipedia.IsRedirectPage: # second except, prevent redirect

In this script there are options specified that are already set by default. This is to show examples of options that can be used with this useful function. So, you can use &lt;tt&gt;text = page.get()&lt;/tt&gt; to load the text and only &lt;tt&gt;page.put(newtext, 'Bot: Test')&lt;/tt&gt; to put the changes, if you don't need to change the other options.

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).get() ===
*force = False : if force is set as True, the Bot will ignore all the exceptions raised, included redirects, so you won't get errors (but your code can make mistakes..)
*get_redirect = False : if it is set to True, the Bot won't stop himself but it will follow the redirect (f.e. if you have &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Php]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that redirect to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[PHP]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the bot will load PHP).
*throttle = True : to slow down the Bot so as not to over-stress the Server. Within wikimedia projects, you must to set it to be True.

*sysop = False: To get the page as sysop (if you need to do some sysop's actions with this page (you can log-in as sysop if you need to edit protected pages or to do something that only sysops can do).
*nofollow_redirects=False : Like force it won't raise an exception if you load a redirect... but it will raise in all the other cases.
*change_version_date = True : set it to False if you have already loaded the page before and do not check this version for changes before saving.

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).put() ===
.put(newtext, comment='Bot: Test', watchArticle = None, minorEdit = True)
*newtext is the text that you'll put on Wikipedia
*comment = None : is the comment that the Bot will use when it will make a change. (default = &quot;Wikipedia python library&quot;)
*watchArticle = None : if you want to put the article edited to your bot's watchlist you have to change it to True
*minorEdit = True : The Bot will make a minor-edit. If it's not necessary, set it to True also if you make big-changes. '''Note''': If you edit a user's talk page, if you want to let them know of the change that you've done, set this parameter to False otherwise set it to True.

If you want to change the default comment, you can use the function wikipedia.setAction(text) to use text instead of &quot;Wikipedia python library&quot; to be sure that your code won't have strange summary's messages.

== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).getReferences(), .move(), .protect(), .delete() and .undelete() ==
The Page class has a lot of function that let you make what you want and there are so many function that also what you think that was impossibile to do with a Bot can become reality. For example, do you know that (if you are a sysop) you can load a deleted revision, using the Bot? (and you can also undelete it!) But now it's better to explain the main and most used function (by the way, you can find what you need also taking a look at the code and searching &lt;tt&gt;def getDeletedRevision(&lt;/tt&gt;)

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).getReferences() ===
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
def main():
    page = wikipedia.Page(wikipedia.getSite(), 'Wikipedia:Sandbox')
    for pagetoparse in page.getReferences(follow_redirects=True, withTemplateInclusion=True, onlyTemplateInclusion=False, redirectsOnly=False):
        wikipedia.output(pagetoparse.title())
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;
It's a generator, this means that it returns all the pages that reference to the page defined with the wikipedia.Page() class. If you need to load the entire list of referred pages to work with them, use:
&lt;pre&gt;
pages = [page for page in s.getReferences()]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Like the previous examples, you can use the reference function as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in page.getReferences():
    wikipedia.output(i.title())
&lt;/source&gt;
The parameters available are:
(follow_redirects=True, withTemplateInclusion=True, onlyTemplateInclusion=False, redirectsOnly=False):
*follow_redirect=True : as above, it returns also redirects if it's True (otherwise it won't return the redirects)
*withTemplateInclusion=True : if you use a page as template, in the references appears a &quot;included in page [...]&quot; so, if you need only to load the pages that links to the page, set to True otherwise set to False.
*onlyTemplateInclusion=False : if True, it will load only the pages that use the page as a Template and not the other.
*redirectsOnly=False : if True, it will return only the redirects to the page
&lt;!--
=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).move() ===
This function can be useful when you are writing a script. But you have to know that there is already a script, &lt;tt&gt;movepages.py&lt;/tt&gt;, that can be used in most of cases. By the way, can be useful to know how to implement this feature in one of your script, so, here we are, ready to explain how to use it.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
site = wikipedia.getSite()
page = wikipedia.Page(site, 'Project:Sandbox')
page.move('Project:Sandbox new', 'Bot: Test', movetalkpage = True, sysop = False, throttle = False)
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example you can see that we--&gt;

*[[Pywikibot/add_text.py]] &amp;mdash; This is a Bot written by Filnik to add a text at the end of the page but above categories, interwiki and template for the stars of the interwiki (default).
*[[Pywikibot/archivebot.py]] &amp;mdash; discussion page archiving bot.
*[[Pywikibot/articlenos.py]] &amp;mdash; A script that displays the ordinal number of the new articles being created visible on the Recent Changes list.
*[[Pywikibot/basic.py]] &amp;mdash; This is not a complete bot; rather, it is a template from which simple bots can be made.
*[[Pywikibot/BeautifulSoup.py]] &amp;mdash; 
*[[Pywikibot/blockpageschecker.py]] &amp;mdash; This is a script originally written by Wikihermit and then rewritten by Filnik, to delete the templates used to warn in the pages that a page is blocked, when the page isn't blocked at all. Indeed, very often sysops block the pages for a setted time but then they forget to delete the warning! This script is useful if you want to delete those useless warning left in these pages.
*[[Pywikibot/capitalize_redirects.py]] &amp;mdash; Bot to create capitalized redirects where the first character of the first word is uppercase and the remainig characters and words are lowercase.
*[[Pywikibot/casechecker.py]] &amp;mdash; &quot;&quot;&quot; Script to enumerate all pages on the wiki and find all titles with mixed latin and cyrilic alphabets.
*[[Pywikibot/catall.py]] &amp;mdash; Add or change categories on a number of pages.
*[[Pywikibot/category.py]] &amp;mdash; Scripts to manage categories.
*[[Pywikibot/category_redirect.py]] &amp;mdash; The bot will look for categories that are marked with a category redirect template, take the first parameter of the template as the target of the redirect, and move all pages and subcategories of the category there. It also changes hard redirects into soft redirects, and fixes double redirects. A log is written under &lt;userpage&gt;/category_redirect_log. Only category pages that haven't been edited for a certain cooldown period (currently 7 days) are taken into account.
*[[Pywikibot/catlib.py]] &amp;mdash; Library to work with category pages on Wikipedia
*[[Pywikibot/censure.py]] &amp;mdash; &quot;&quot;&quot;Bad word checker bot
*[[Pywikibot/cfd.py]] &amp;mdash; This script processes the Categories for discussion working page.  It parses out the actions that need to be taken as a result of CFD discussions (as posted to the working page by an administrator) and performs them.
*[[Pywikibot/checkimages.py]] &amp;mdash; Script to check recently uploaded files. This script checks if a file description is present and if there are other problems in the image's description.

== Wikibooks ==

As this is becoming more and more textbook-like, I'd like to import it to [[Wikibooks]], where it can be integrated and linked with other texts, such as [[b:Linux Guide|Linux Guide]], which will be very helpful to readers. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt;]].[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[:b:en:User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;@en.wb&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 22 January 2010 (UTC)
:It should go somewhere else, that's for sure. If not Wikibooks, maybe Wikiversity or MediaWiki.org. Meta-wiki needs to be depopulated of stuff that applies to MediaWiki installations in general (rather than just Wikimedia projects). Also, isn't the name &quot;Pywikipediabot&quot; kinda misleading, since it can be used on other wikis? [[User:Tisane|Tisane]] 22:13, 8 April 2010 (UTC)

== Login issues ==

When trying to login (login.py) I am asked for the password for the relevant user. I supply this. It then asks for the CAPTCHA solution. I enter this. It then tells me that Login failed. Obvious answer is I am entering one or the other incorrectly. However, I have tried many times. I have changed my password on the wiki and then retried. Same result. Am I coming up against a known issue? Apart from entering wrong answers, which I am sure I am not doing, is there another reason that I cannot log in?[[Special:Contributions/88.108.210.61|88.108.210.61]] 08:58, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

== Python Subject and Category ==

Hi, I read the message on the mailing list and thought I should suggest that this book be categorized under [[:Category:Python programming language]], and listed on [[Subject:Python programming language]].  As I am not part of this community I do not think it appropriate to [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] in this case. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 02:37, 23 May 2010 (UTC)
:While Pywikibot does ''use'' Python, and it does discuss some Python code, it does not appear to be a book ''on'' Python, which the books in that category/subject cover specifically.  It would be like putting books on software that runs on Windows in [[Subject:Microsoft Windows]].  That said, a different category below [[:Category:Computer software]] (or that category itself) or some other category may be appropriate.  [[:Category:Utility software]] is the best I could come up with at this time. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:51, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

== missing important info ==

The page says how to download and configure the package but doesn't say what the package actually does.  Yes, automates some bot tasks.  But WHAT tasks does it automate?  I'm trying to examine the evolution of a bunch of enwiki articles through their edit history, which means I have to pull a lot of diffs and process them.  It would help a lot if the front page or overview page of this document listed the main functions that the bot framework supplies, so I could tell at a glance if it was going to be useful.  Is it just a lightweight wrapper for the MW API?  I'm beginning to get that impression.

== CVS diff ==
You recommend using &quot;cvs diff&quot;. Surely you want to recommend &quot;cvs diff -u&quot;? This gives a much more robust diff format than the default (submitting patches in a format other than unidiff is a common newbie dev mistake). Subversion uses that format by default, and is nicer than CVS in lots of other ways, so you might want to move to that instead :) [[User:Hairy Dude|Hairy Dude]] 08:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:pywikipediabot is a framework for which most of the users have installed CVS tools, and these users are not using CVS for anything else. It is bad enough that we required normal users to use developers tools to use the programs, migrating to subversion will not happen any time soon! You are completely right that -u should be used to generate patches against cvs. [[User:Rob Hooft|Rob Hooft]] 12:01, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

I have installed Python25 and downloaded pywikipedia from cvs today, the pywikipedia files are on a different disk than the Python25 folder, and it works.

:I've always thought this was false because I think I have Python 2.5 on the other computer I used to run Pywikipediabot on. But I just verified. I installed Python 2.5 and altered my environment variable so that the system would use Python25 instead of Python24, and Pywikipediabot runs the exact same as it did with Python 2.4 so this line must be false. I really don't get why anyone would have added this line. It's more unproductive than productive, IMHO you should never go and put frameworks like Pywikipediabot into the core folder of the programs running them.

I think we need a bit more options described in the configuration section.  There's a few options that were essential for getting the bot to work (e.g. adding 'Colorized_output = False') that are not described on the main page - and if there are other variables available, they should be listed. Of course, the necessity of that variable probably counts as a bug. --[[Special:Contributions/76.10.156.14|76.10.156.14]] 20:33, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

I uploaded the lastest version of pywikipedia framework on my account on toolserver and it works fine. But, is there any method to leave the server to work alone (I won't need to leave the terminal open)? Thank you in advance. [[User:Firilacroco|Firilacroco]] 11:02, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

I am using the http://DeveloperSide.NET package and currently running:

MediaWiki: 1.11.0, 
PHP: 5.2.5 (apache2handler), 
MySQL: 5.0.45-community-nt-log

In order for me to get the bot working I had to add the following to my LocalSettings.php:

&lt;code&gt;
$wgEnableAPI=true;

:Far as I know, ''interwiki.py'' will always place a new iwl, where the other iwls on this page already are placed. If the bot sets the first iwl on page, it sets on bottom of the page. So I think, placing to bottom is default. ''standardize interwiki.py'' just means to go through the pages, moving existing iwl to the top. But I've just tried it on a test page and it didn't move any iwl there. Strange. --[[User:Plasmarelais|Plasmarelais]] 18:05, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

===answer===
modify your &quot;pflegewiki_family.py&quot; like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8  -*-

import family

# The meta family

class Family(family.Family):
    name = 'PflegeWiki'
    def __init__(self):
        self._addlang('de',
                        location = 'www.pflegewiki.de',
                        namespaces = { 4: u'PflegeWiki',
                                      5: u'Diskussion' })

    def path(self, code):
        return '/index.php'

&lt;/pre&gt;
should work then

=== wont work for me neither ===

The script claimns that my password is wrong but when I use the url (login and passord) from the config in a browser everything works. The family looks like.
&lt;pre&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8  -*-

import family

class Family(family.Family):
    name = 'fridewiki' #Set the family name; this should be the same as in the filename.

    def __init__(self):
        family.Family.__init__(self)
	
	self.langs = {
            'de':'vierzig4.dyndns.org',
	}


    def version(self, code):
        return &quot;1.4.2&quot;  #The MediaWiki version used. Not very important in most cases.

    def path(self, code):
        return '/mediawiki/index.php' #The path of index.php
&lt;/pre&gt;

did i forget something?

Whats annoying is that my installation was working but now it throws errors about character sets so I down loaded the latest files to see if that fixed it

::Probably not everybody else is as stupid as I am, but check that all your cases are consistent - i.e. if you've used lowercase in the filename, use lowercase when you refer to the family. Also, check what case your login uses. Just a tip that would have saved me about an hour... :$

=== Or Me ===
I created the user-config.py with the 3 lines in it needed to work with a non Wiki project. I created the family file and tried to login and I get

One line saying &quot;mylang='language'&quot;
One line saying &quot;usernames['wikipedia']['language']='yy'&quot;

...filling in your username and the language code of the wiki you want to work

== Uploaded images blank or corrupt ==

I'm having trouble using upload.py to upload images correctly to our MediaWiki 1.4-based site. I've been able to login to the server with the bot account, run the upload script, and the script reports a correct upload. However, when I look at the images on the site, they are the correction dimensions, but are either: a) blank, or b) blank with a few lines of corrupted pixels at the top of the image.

Here's some of the things I've tried:
* Uploading with the standard web browser user interface using the bot account (works fine).
* Tried using my standard administrator user account with the script (same bad result).
* Tried using other image formats; .png, .gif, .jpg (same result).
* Tried different image files (same result).
* Moved image location to the same location as the script on disk (same result).

I don't think it's a permissions problem, since I'm able to upload the files manually using the same account, though I admit I don't know much about MediaWiki permissions. Any ideas?

==Pagefromfile.py==
I've tried to load a file into my own MediaWiki. But I get the message 'DBG&gt; page may be locked?' and 'Page &lt;title&gt; already exists, not adding!' However the page doesn't exist in my MediaWiki. whats wrong?

I'm having problems loging using login.py on my non-wikimedia project, so I wonder if there is any incompatibilities between Compatibility between Mediawiki 1.6.1 and Pywikipedia &quot;snapshot-20060312&quot; ?

== Solution to a problem connecting to a wiki more than one directory under the URL domain ==

When trying to connect pywikipedia bot to a wiki in location www.example.com/folder/folder/wiki/index.php the failure displayed below occured. Basically it seemed the URL in the families file was not recognised.

In families file I had specified 
 self.langs         = { 'en':         'www.example.com/folder/folder/wiki/', }

The solution to the failure was to specify only the domain the self.langs, and the subfolders in the call to &quot;path&quot;, 
    def path(self, code):
        return '/folder/folder/wiki/index.php'

== Working with LDAP authentication? ==

Does anyone know if there's a way to get this bot working with [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:LDAP_Authentication#Making_work_with_Pywikipediabot LDAP Authentication]?  I had no problems running it before I went to LDAP, but now it doesn't seem to work, any ideas?

[[User:HotMonkeyAC|HotMonkeyAC]] 20:28, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

: in login.py, there's a block of code that sets wpName, wpPassword, etc. To get LDAP working, add this
&quot;wpDomain&quot; : &quot;MYDOMAIN&quot;,

===This doesn't work===
I did this, replacing MYDOMAIN as above with my LDAP domain name, and no change in behavior - it still fails, complaining of either a bad password or bad CAPTCHA data.


I got this to work with LDAP by putting self.domain = 'domain here' in wiki_family.py, where domain here is the LDAP domain. It did not work with self.name = 'domain here' as it says it should in the documentation README-family.txt -[[User:Funkmaster 801|Funkmaster 801]] 18:45, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

This also does not work - when I added the &lt;tt&gt;self.domain = 'domain here'&lt;/tt&gt; line, (substituting my actual domain, of course) it simply generates a syntax error.  Can you post a family file that works so I can see what I might be doing wrong?

:--[[User:Gene Turnbow|Gene Turnbow]] 20:47, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

In Login.py replace line 121 which is {&quot;wpDomain&quot;: self.site.family.ldapDomain,}  with {&quot;wpDomain&quot;: 'domain here',} 
:--[[User:AdrianArcher|AdrianArcher]] 14:34, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

With the embedded colon??  Not sure how that's supposed to map to a MediaWiki variable that way, but I'll try it.

Okay - this doesn't work, just tested it.  I didn't expect it to, with the colon embedded in the key name like that.  Removing the colon and trying again - okay, once I checked my path override in my family file, '''''it finally worked'''''.  Now I'll test it with the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; login.py file from the latest version and see if that works - it may have been my family file the entire time.

My conclusion is that a lot of people are confusing the rendered path that MediaWiki generates with the raw URL you need to reach the login page itself.  You have to get there without the use of the MediaWiki-massaged path, which will ''not'' succeed.

Also, the new login.py does ''not'' work.  Hard-coding the LDAP domain as AdrianArcher identified, however, did work.

:--[[User:Gene Turnbow|Gene Turnbow]] 17:06, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

:The name=&quot;blah&quot; of the family file must match the family=&quot;blah&quot; in the user-config.py file. Also, this same name has to be applied to the name of the family file, so it is &quot;blah_family.py&quot; (mercs, presumably, in this case).

:Further, it looks like (hard to be sure once you've copied and pasted it into the webpage) that your indentation is kind of messed up. &lt;code&gt;name=&lt;/code&gt; should be &lt;code&gt;self.name=&lt;/code&gt;, and it should be after &lt;code&gt;def __init__&lt;/code&gt;. Also, I don't know what &lt;code&gt;_addlangs()&lt;/code&gt; is, it might be a valid function, but it's not mentioned in the README file for families (which I recommend you read). Same thing with &lt;code&gt;path()&lt;/code&gt; - it's not in the readme, &lt;code&gt;scriptpath()&lt;/code&gt; is. It doesn't even look like the Mercs Wiki ''uses'' a script path...

I added a bunch of information that I could not find ''anywhere'' when I was trying to set up my installation of PyWikipedia to work on a Wiki with custom namespaces (much thanks to the people on #pywikipediabot for helping me out with this in the first place). It's a bit wordy and some of it ''probably'' ought to go elsewhere, but I didn't know where and I figured it'd be easier for people to move what I wrote to someplace appropriate.

== Re: Custom User Groups &amp; Permissions ==

As a suggestion, you can try to add:

&lt;tt&gt;sysopnames['wikipedia']['en'] = 'adminname'&lt;/tt&gt;

to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, where ['wikipedia'] is the name of the the family in which you are working on, and 'adminname' is the username (as seen in on [[Pywikipediabot/delete.py]]).

I've tried this and works, it solved my problems with &quot;redict.py broken&quot;.

I haven't a user on this wiki but if this is ok please add it to the main page.

I'm having this error while trying to login.py in a 1.17alpha wiki:

 Error downloading data: No JSON object could be decoded

 Retrying in 1 minutes...

I've checked the user,pass and scriptpath and everything is allright. The strange thing is that in apache's access.log I've seen this:

 &quot;POST /wiki/api.php HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 3930 &quot;-&quot; &quot;PythonWikipediaBot/1.0&quot;

So it is trying to connect, but it don't work. 

Does anyone know what is happening?? What other things can I check?

== Login failed. Wrong password or CAPTCHA answer? ==

I have not used in the bot in about 18 months. I returned to it yesterday and having got as far as the login.py prompt everything seemed good. It asks me for the password for the relevant user. I supply it. It tells me it is logging in to the wiki as the relevant user name. It then says &quot;Opening CAPTCHA in your web browser...&quot;. It asks me for the solution. I supply it. It returns the message: &quot;Login failed. Wrong password or CAPTCHA answer?&quot;. I cannot remember having this problem 18 months ago and nothing has changed in my set-up files. I went for the obvious, i.e. wrong passwords. I checked five times, ensured caps lock was off; I changed my password; I then shifted to an alternate user name.....every time the same message. Can anyone help? Is there something obvious I am missing?[[Special:Contributions/88.108.210.61|88.108.210.61]] 09:56, 5 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Add text to empty pages ==

I've got a problem. I want to add a (long) text to ~150 pages. I've got [http://www.kaffeewiki.de/index.php?title=BotListe a List of all these pages]. Unfortunately it doesn't work.

Here is what I've tried so far (Do not punch me. The error logs prooves that I'm using windows -- and german...):

Does anybody know how to solve this? I do not really understand the error message. --[[Special:Contributions/91.33.195.178|91.33.195.178]] 08:02, 5 October 2009 (UTC) (Felix)

== Policy ==

I wonder what policies different Wikimedia projects (mostly, enwiki) have for using this, and other things that require &lt;tt&gt;sysopnames&lt;/tt&gt; to be set. Enwiki has no bots with admin flag, but are people using this with their regular admin account?

== file parameter  ==

i've used the bot with the -file parameter but nothing happens on my wiki.

the pages (which are all redirects) are still there

what's the syntax of the textfile, i used one article name (without &quot; ' or something like that) per line

== File Format ==

I am having the same file problem, I've tried with and without delimiters and the script still does nothing, no error message, just ends. [[User:82.38.112.222|82.38.112.222]] 11:11, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Useable==
Is autonomous_problems.dat intended to be usable as an argument for the -file: option? My version of the bot (04-22-2005 CVS) seems not to like it. It'd be of great help if it could be used; I wrote a simple script to perform the task, but at the cost of losing quite a lot of stored information. [[User:Taragui|Taragui]] 14:52, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

== probably bug ==

I run this bot within th (Thai) and en (English) Wikipedia(s). In English Wikipedia, instead of editing articles as my bot username, my IP-Address is shown in edit history (similar to un-login user). In Thai Wikipedia it worked well to me.

== crashing bug ==

== Incorrect (?) inclusion of subheadings ==

I had a short exchange to a Interwiki.py bot operator.  Wikipedia bot user account [[w:User:SieBot]] undid some changes I made to the [[w:Albert]] article: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert&amp;curid=1504&amp;diff=121027984&amp;oldid=120965264]. The Mandarin update is fine, but the German and Swedish changes are incorrect. I don't think the subheadings are appropriate for those linked articles -- the articles are each about the name; using the subheadings would be appropriate only if the English article were simply a list of the people with the name, I think. -- [[User:JHunterJ|JHunterJ]] 20:27, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== Blocking unwanted links ==

We need a per-page way for local editors to specify that a given interwiki link on a given page is unwanted, and a default configuration of the bots that will understand and honor such a request. The bots should never be allowed to make edits against local consensus of human editors. So we need a way for human editors to tell the bot what not to do. 

The case I have in mind is [[:w:en:Ingria]], which is visited almost daily by a dozen different interwiki bot accounts and gets a link added to the highly controversial ru-sib wiki, which always get reverted. There is a local consensus among the editors of the article that this link is not wanted. I'm not going to delve into the policies and politics of why one should or shouldn't link to ru-sib, or whether or not it is okay for editors of one language wiki to boycott another. The point is simply that it shouldn't be up to the bot to decide.

In this particular case the issue could be solved by having all bot operators set their bots to &quot;-neverlink ru-sib&quot;, but we can't really expect all bot owners to know about this case in advance. Also, there might be cases where the rejection is not of a whole language but specific to individual pages. So, we really need something ''on the page'' to stop the bot, and we need the bot to understand that ''in its default configuration''.

As this constant revert war against a dozen different bots is getting disruptive, I very strongly urge developers to come up with a technical solution. Otherwise, I might take the step of blocking every interwiki bot on enwiki that runs without &quot;-neverlink ru-sib&quot;.

Apparently this is where I'm supposed to report that [[:en:User:Wybot]] is misbehaving. It's incorrectly inserting/removing interwiki links on templates.

The first change causes the interwiki links to be included on all transcluded pages, while the second change removed valid interwiki links intended for the main template and inserted other interwiki links that should have been wrapped in a noinclude section to avoid being included on the main template. --[[:en:User:PEJL|PEJL]] 08:06, 16 September 2007 (UTC)

::(I'm not sure if this is the right place to post; if not, feel free to move the discussion to someplace more appropriate, but please notify me.)  One of the issues seems to be (at least in the case of the second link) the fact that the IW links are kept on a transcluded subpage (along with other documentation).  Apparently, this confuses the bot.  This may be bad practice, I don't know, but it certainly simplifies life when dealing with a protected template.  The other issue, where it moves the IW links outside of the noinclude tags appears to simply be a bug in the bot.

== Running on template space on EN ==

Is there a way that we could get an interwiki bot running on EN that will add links to the [[en:WP:DOC|/doc sub page]] and recognize other iw links from templates using this pattern too?

==Removal of links==
Can someone please explain on what basis the bot decides that links are to be ''removed''? How can this ever be done safely without human confirmation? There is no one-one correspondence between articles in different language wikipedias, so linking can't be expected to be one-one either. (User:Kotniski from en:WP)


:It seems to remove some based on whether both articles are categorised/tagged as disambiguation pages. This sometimes has unhelpful results. 

:I would say that the pywiki bot SoxBot III removed these interwiki links incorrectly on 1 March 2008. Having noticed the first one, I checked a dozen or so others from that date and found the others.  

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abimelech&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=195066608] Removed 2 valid interwikis, perhaps because the EN is tagged as disam but the others are not. 

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adoni_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=195193341&amp;oldid=185702822] Removed valid disambiguation to disambiguation link, perhaps because the EN has disambiguation subcategories/specific templates rather than the general disambiguation category/template.

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_2:_Freddy%27s_Revenge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=195040153] Removed redirects rather than replacing them.  

:I raised these with the editor who ran the bot and he referred me here. User:Fayenatic_london on en:WP

The above is not meant to be an answer to the question raised by user:Kotniski, but additions to it with specific examples of problems. Please would someone who is able to improve the program look into these faults and answer us? - User:Fayenatic_london on en:WP, 23 July 2008
:A problem like the one above was reported today on enwiki at [[en:Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#SassoBot]]. While looking at the code of interwiki.py, I discovered [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/interwiki.py?revision=6103&amp;view=markup this change] that was put in by a_engels in November, 2008. It allows the hard cases (DAB in one language and non-DAB in the other) to be skipped. So the bot will either do nothing or allow the operator to fix the pages up manually. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] 04:16, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

== Algorithm used ==

Can someone explain how bot works in some cases? For example,&quot;finds that an interwiki-link has to be changed&quot; - how bot recognizes this? Another case - &quot;finds that an interwiki link is to be removed&quot; - when it happens? Thanks [[User:DixonD|DixonD]] 11:20, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
:I guess the bot finds iwls needing a change either by following redirects or in the following situation. If en:A and de:A were connected right, then de:A moved to de:B and kept its iwl. Later the bot finds de:B pointing to en:A but en:A still linking on de:A which is a broken link. With one direction working it can repair the broken one.&lt;br&gt;The bot finds links to be deleted, if none of the cases above worked or a page has a link to a moved or deleted page without redirect. Another case is, that the iwl is incorrect or pointing on a page that never existed. --[[User:Plasmarelais|Plasmarelais]] 17:27, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== where do we put the option? ==

*''If you add the option -start, the bot will go through the pages alphabetically, starting at the word specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Logging the bot in to Wikia Wikis==
I made a bot on Wikia, but I can't log it into my specific wiki. It says that there is a token error or something. Can anyone explain why?[[User:Cradrock|Cradrock]] 23:37, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

==403 Error (Forbidden)==
When I attempt to log in to Zelda Wiki.org, it comes up with a 403 error (forbidden.) The one who runs our other bot thinks that it may be blocking access to to the server login and that it may require different settings for when it is used client-side. Does anyone know how to remedy this and get the bot logged in?[[User:Neo of ZW|Neo of ZW]] 19:26, 10 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

:You can use &lt;code&gt;movingpages.py -pairs:&quot;pairs.txt&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, where your file pairs.txt contains pairs of pages to move and their targets:

==Arguments==

This may be a n00bish question, but why isn't there a full list of the available arguments for this script on the page? To get this, I had to run the script with the -help switch, which gave the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
This script can move pages.

These command line parameters can be used to specify which pages to work on:

-cat              Work on all pages which are in a specific category.

                  subcategories, sub-subcategories etc. of the
                  given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-catr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-catr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

                  the given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname&quot; or

                  multi-site spamming.
                  Attention: this will cause the bot to modify
                  pages on several wiki sites, this is not well tested,
                  so check your edits!

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==limitation?==

I've used pagefromfile.py and when i try to import an article that is greater than a certain (250?) characters then it will fail. Does anyone know if there is a limitation to the length of the article? And so yes, what can you do about it? --[[User:BB70|BB70]] 13:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:I have not experienced anything like that error.  Do you mean the page ''title'' is over 250 characters?  --[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 13:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

::The article itself is over 250 characters including the title [[User:BB70|BB70]] 12:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

:::Don't work : it uploads only a part of each page.

== title ==

I dont like to have automatically title in page so I inserted line 
            &lt;nowiki&gt;contents = re.search(&quot;'''.*?'''([^\Z]*)&quot;,contents).group(1) &lt;/nowiki&gt;

before line
            &lt;nowiki&gt;page.put(contents, comment = commenttext, minorEdit = False)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

--[[User:Liso|Liso]] 07:26, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== What didn't work? ==

Looking at a recent edit to this page, I see a complaint from someone that the proper technique didn't work.  I ''know'' that on the English Wiktionary, the alternate technique now listed does not work correctly.  Could someone please explain where/when/how that technique doesn't work, and what unexpected results were encountered?  --[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 14:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

:python script which I downloded (I dont know if there is new version or not) does not found title of article because it search it betveen xxxx and yyyy ... --[[User:Liso|Liso]] 21:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== Creating Redirects ==

I tried creating redirects using Pagefromfile but it became an article.

My text file is like so...

 xxxx
 #REDIRECT &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;'''Article'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 yyyy

the script created was so, except for the xxxx and yyyy.  What I need is that the &lt;nowiki&gt;'''Article'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; be not included.  That the end result will become 

 #REDIRECT &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What can be added to the script to achieve this?  I do not know phyton programming.  -- Hiong-eng

:So do you need strip title from contents of inserted article? Please see [[Talk:Pagefromfile.py#title]]! (you need to edit pagefromfile.py file):) --[[User:Liso|Liso]] 21:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::oops, sorry, I missed that :) thanks! -- Hiong-eng

This has been fixed now, there is a -notitle keyword.
To make a redirect, make a file dict.txt that looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{-start-}}
'''Article title'''#REDIRECT[[New title]]
{{-stop-}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

and type:
 python pagefromfile.py -notitle

== redirected page ==

Lets there are two pages A and B. B is redirected to A (B--&gt;A)

I try to do the following
&lt;pre&gt;
xxxx
'''B'''
bla-bla
yyyy
&lt;/pre&gt;

and as result I've got the error:
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/export1/wiki/pywikipedia/pagefromfile.py&quot;, line 324, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File &quot;/export1/wiki/pywikipedia/pagefromfile.py&quot;, line 320, in main
    bot.run()
  File &quot;/export1/wiki/pywikipedia/pagefromfile.py&quot;, line 141, in run
    self.put(title, contents)
  File &quot;/export1/wiki/pywikipedia/pagefromfile.py&quot;, line 170, in put
    contents = page.get() + contents
  File &quot;/export1/wiki/pywikipedia/wikipedia.py&quot;, line 638, in get
    raise IsRedirectPage, self._redirarg
&lt;/pre&gt;

I would like to have such behavior: if B is redirected page then script have to use A as target page.

How I can do it? Can anybody help me?  --[[User:Dnikitin|Dnikitin]] 03:00, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

Category-based replace seems to be invariably giving no results, &lt;tt&gt;Getting 0 pages from ...&lt;/tt&gt;. Is this a bug or am I missing something?

==regex BUG==
tried with several version of pywikipedia
any change with regular expression leads to a crash
can you fix this huge bug? thanks

== Bug: &quot;\n&quot; in replacement text ==

I can't put a newline in the replacement text.  For example:
  python replace.py &quot;AbcDef&quot; &quot;Abc\nDef&quot;
actually inserts the literal characters &quot;\n&quot; rather than a newline.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:128.165.16.45|128.165.16.45]] ([[User talk:128.165.16.45|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/128.165.16.45|contribs]]) 20:46, 9 July 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:If you are using a bash command line, you can add a literal new line by simply press enter:

 $ python replace.py &quot;AbcDef&quot; &quot;Abc
 &gt; Def&quot;

Cheers, [[User:Jayvdb|John Vandenberg]] 23:16, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Correct command for interwiki purposes ==

Suppose that we have a page, say [[:w:Door]], with 19 links to it. We decide to tarnswiki it to Wiktionary, and we want all links to [[:w:Door]] to be directed towards [[:wikt:door]]. What is the correct command to achieve that, using replace.py? [[User:Huji|Huji]] 17:28, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== use xml dump ==

if I use a xml dump with the option -xml the program must modify not only the online page, but also the xml version, so if I redo the same operation the script finds that the page is already modified. --[[User:Wiso|Wiso]] 15:36, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Isredirect and putthrottle ==

2 issues:

I have tried to edit pages using -ref:, and when I use that, it says &quot;Isredirect&quot;. When I don't use that, it works. 

I have also tried putting -putthrottle: to 12, and it does it in shorter amounts of time. 

why are these happening?

== How could I replace the text wich contain two or more lines? ==

For example I must change the text:

 ==Subtitle==

with the following:

 ==Subtitle==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

How could I do it? The problem is that I could not press enter while typing the replaceing text and I couldn't use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; because it will not cause the expected effect --[[User:A1|A1]] 20:04, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Nothing happens ==

I need some help with replace.py

I installed Python25 and Pywikipedia on my computer

The purpose : use it on a MediaWiki installation (in french), in version 1.6.7

I configured my user-config.py, my [name_of_the_wiki]_family.py that I put in families directory...

And i launched the /cmd on Windows in order to use Python

I've already created an account for the bot on the Wiki ( its name is Orthobot)

Then I launch python.exe login.py (and there isn't any problem)

Then I launch replace.py like that :

python.exe replace.py -page:Abheva &quot;sanscrit&quot; &quot;sanskrit&quot;

The bot finds the page, finds the word, asks me if I want to replace it...

And it says the page has been replaced.

But the problem is that, when I look at this page, the replacement hasn't been made

So, I don't understand : everything seems to be ok but It doesn't work

Any idea ?

[[User:Urobore|Urobore]] 22:39, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

:Try the following: run replace.py -page:Abheva (without anything else) and type enter the text when prompted.

:::Some thoughts: is the page locked? Or semiblocked (and You just registered), do You have the newest version of pywikipedia (easiest is to update via tortoise).

:: No, the page isn't locked, nor semiblocked. However, I just found a means to resolve the problem even if I don't understand why. In fact, it is a public Wiki but blocked for non-registered users (only registered one can Edit a page). Moreover, a non-registered user can't create a new account (it means I create accounts for users who wants to participate to the wiki). Concretly, my LocalSettings.php contains :
:: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: So, I put the second line = ''true'' instead of ''false'' and it resolved the problem (the page &quot;''Abhava''&quot; has been edited). 
::&lt;br /&gt;
:: It means I'll have to edit my &lt;code&gt;LocalSettings.php&lt;/code&gt; each time I'll want to use a Pywikipedia. But I don't understand exactly why because the Bot has an account and should be able to edit a page without the autorization as a non-registered user : in Edit History of the page &quot;''Abhava''&quot;, the Bot only appears as a non-registered IP address (mine) and not as a user. It means there should be a problem with the login of the Bot (it can't log in on the wiki and, so, is able to edit a page only as a non-registered user). So : have you got an idea about this problem of login identification of the bot ?

:: Thank you, anyway.

Hi,

When I try to upload an image using this script I get a 403 Forbidden page back. Manually uploading using the bot user account works and editing an article using the editarticly.py script works to. Anybody knows why upload.py does not work? I'm running Mediawiki 1.6.3 and am using the newest upload.py available. thnx --[[User:GrandiJoos|GrandiJoos]] 18:16, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

=== An Idea ===
GrandiJoos -
You should be able to get information about why the page is forbidden by checking the server logs. These should be available through your web hosting service, and are automatically kept by the web server program (like Apache). In general there are two reasons for a 403 error: wrong permissions on the file, or wrong un/pw. If you are able to access your wiki when you log in, then you are probably requesting a nonexistent file. The server logs should record every file that was requested by a client that it couldn't find.

Also, make sure you check the path specified by grandijooswiki_family.py (or whatever_family.py) is accurate. This is the default:

    def path(self, code):
        return '/wiki/index.php'

And if your wiki is in the root folder of your server, you might need this:

    def path(self, code):
        return '/index.php'

Hope that helps

Any advice?

It would be pretty neat if one day this could also check whether a page is saved in the Internet Archive (which should be pretty easy to do, since all you have to do is append the page's address which you are checking to &quot;http://web.archive.org/web/&quot;, and see whether it returns &quot;$PAGE is not available in the Wayback Machine.&quot;).

Even neater would be if one could take a positive result and have the bot automatically insert in the article a link to the most recent archived copy, but that would not be as easy. --[[User:129.21.121.171|129.21.121.171]] 21:16, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Environment proxy variables (http_proxy, no_proxy) support ==

Weblinkchecker now uses httplib which does not honor environment proxy variables http_proxy, no_proxy.
So if you are behind a proxy and your wiki is NOT in the outer world, there is no way to check the links normally.
Here's a patch which adds the support for these variables, though the resulting proxy support is very buggy - works only in Python 2.6 with your wiki address first in no_proxy variable, like no_proxy=&quot;www.wiki.local, *.local&quot;
It would be great to merge this patch (or its fixed version) into your SVN...

    PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE
    YOU CAN EDIT THE TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS COMMENT
--&gt;
== Usage ==
{{tl|Multicol}} is used to start a multi-column section of a page. Between each block of column text insert &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|Multicol-break}}&lt;/tt&gt; and close the last column with &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|Multicol-end}}&lt;/tt&gt;. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol}}
 This text appears in the first column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the second column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the third column.
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have any number of columns. Each column will be the same width, equally dividing the available horizontal space. Each column has a small right margin (20 pixels), creating a &quot;gutter&quot; that prevents text in one column from touching text in the column to its right.

== Parameters ==
This template has two optional parameters: the overall width of the set of columns and the width of the gutter.  The overall width of the set of columns can be an absolute value (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;40em&lt;/tt&gt;) or a percentage of the available page width (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;50%&lt;/tt&gt;). This parameter defaults to &lt;tt&gt;100%&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, to create a multi-column section that is only 50% the width of the page:

&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol|50%}}
 This text appears in the first column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the second column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the third column.
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The multi-column region is always positioned on the left side of the containing block. To change this, place the above Wikitext in a &lt;tt&gt;div&lt;/tt&gt; block that has the [[Cascading Style Sheet|CSS]] attribute &lt;tt&gt;text-align&lt;/tt&gt; set to either &lt;tt&gt;center&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;right&lt;/tt&gt;, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;{{center|
 {{Multicol|50%}}
 ...
 {{Multicol-end}}
 }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Related templates ==
The templates {{tl|Col-begin}} and friends do something similar to this template and its friends, but this template may be easier to use. Each of the following examples produce the same result (a 3-column table in which all columns have equal width):

&lt;center&gt;
{{Multicol|50%}}
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol}}
 Column 1
 {{Multicol-break}}
 Column 2
 {{Multicol-break}}
 Column 3
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Multicol-break}}
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Col-begin}}
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 1
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 2
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 3
 {{Col-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/center&gt;

It's simpler to add more columns to the {{tl|Multicol}} example than to the {{tl|Col-begin}} example, because in the latter case, all occurrences of {{tl|Col-3}} would need to be changed to {{tl|Col-4}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''clean_sandbox.pl''' is a simple script using the unreleased 3.0 version of perlwikibot. It simply cleans a wiki's [[WB:SB|sandbox]] by submitting an edit with some standard text, overwriting whatever was there previously.

==Preamble==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use utf8;
use Carp;
use Getopt::Long;
use Pod::Usage;
use Config::General qw(ParseConfig);

use MediaWiki::Bot 3.0.0;

my $VERSION = '0.0.1';
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we use two pragmas that should be considered mandatory: &lt;code&gt;strict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;warnings&lt;/code&gt;. These are tools to make you a better programmer by forcing you to follow some rules.

We also use &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; to get command line options from the user. This greatly simplifies parsing @ARGV - you should never do it yourself. Always use a Perl module - &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; is one, but there are others.

&lt;code&gt;Pod::Usage&lt;/code&gt; allows us to give the user man-style documentation using Perl's POD markup embedded in the source code.

&lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;/code&gt;allows us to easily parse configuration files. Again, there are others, but this one provides several features we'll make use of, like heredocs.

Finally, we need &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; version 3.0.0 or higher. 3.0.0 is still under development, so method calls are subject to change.

The &lt;code&gt;$VERSION&lt;/code&gt; string will be used later, and might be used by other scripts that &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; this file, like we did for &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;.

==POD==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
=head1 NAME

clean_sandbox.pl - Cleans a wiki's sandbox

=head1 SYNOPSIS

clean_sandbox.pl --wiki=meta --summary=&quot;Cleaning the sandbox&quot;

Options:
    --help      Opens this man page and exit
    --version   Print version information and exit
    --dry-run   Do everything but edit
    --debug     Print debug output
    --wiki      Sets which wiki to use
    --text      Sets what text to use
    --page      Sets what page to edit
    --summary   Sets an edit summary
    --username  Sets a non-default username
    --password  Request a password prompt

=head1 OPTIONS

=cut
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we provide some documentation for the user. This uses POD (see &lt;code&gt;perldoc perlpod&lt;/code&gt;), and will be parsed and shown to the user if they provide the &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; option. The &lt;code&gt;=head1&lt;/code&gt; control inserts a heading with the rest of the text on the line. More POD is included in the rest of the file, but isn't included in this page.

== Parsing the command line ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $help;
my $version;
my $dry_run;
my $debug;
my $wiki;
my $text;
my $page;
my $summary;
my $username;
my $password;

GetOptions(
    'help|h|?'      =&gt; \$help,
    'version|v'     =&gt; \$version,
    'dry-run'       =&gt; \$dry_run,
    'debug|verbose' =&gt; \$debug,
    'wiki=s'        =&gt; \$wiki,
    'text=s'        =&gt; \$text,
    'page=s'        =&gt; \$page,
    'summary=s'     =&gt; \$summary,
    'username=s'    =&gt; \$username,
    'password:s'    =&gt; \$password, # We can ask for it interactively!
);
&lt;/source&gt;
This declares variables for all our command line options, and gets &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; to parse &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt; and assign to those variables for us. This is much better than attempting to do so manually.

On the left, is the option name, and any aliases. For example, &lt;code&gt;help|h|?&lt;/code&gt; provide a name (help) and two aliases (h and ?). The presence of that option on the command line is assigned to &lt;code&gt;$help&lt;/code&gt;. Others, like &lt;code&gt;dry-run&lt;/code&gt; have only the canonical name. Still others take a mandatory parameter, like &lt;code&gt;wiki=s&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the parameter is mandatory; the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; indicates that it is a string. Lastly, password has an optional string parameter indicated by &lt;code&gt;:s&lt;/code&gt;. This option's parameter is optional because we prefer to prompt for the password interactively. Command line arguments are visible to all users on the system, so doing that should be avoided.

==Version data==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ($version) {
    require File::Basename;
    my $script = File::Basename::basename($0);
    print &quot;$script version $VERSION\n&quot; and exit;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the user specified &lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, &lt;code&gt;$version&lt;/code&gt; will be true. We print a simple message containing the version string we declared above, then exit.

==Prompt for password==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (defined($password)) { # I think this is wrong, actually... we'll prompt interactively even if they do --password pass. Should check defined and false.
    require Term::ReadKey;

    print &quot;[clean_sandbox.pl] password: &quot;;
    Term::ReadKey::ReadMode('noecho');      # Don't show the password
    $password = Term::ReadKey::ReadLine(0);
    Term::ReadKey::ReadMode('restore');     # Don't bork their terminal
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;--password&lt;/code&gt; was specified on the command line, we interactively prompt for their password. To do this, we can use &lt;code&gt;Term::ReadKey&lt;/code&gt;, which provides several methods useful for this task. First, note that &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated at runtime, whereas &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated at compile-time, even if it would never run. &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; also &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt;s default methods into the current context, whereas &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; doesn't. We could &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt; ourselves, but it is just as easy not to in this case.

We'll use a standard method of reading in the password. First, we show the prompt, then set the terminal to 'noecho' readmode. This means the user's keystrokes won't display anything on-screen. Next, we read in the user's input and assign it to &lt;code&gt;$password&lt;/code&gt;. Previously, this variable simply told us whether &lt;code&gt;--password&lt;/code&gt; was specified on the command line - now it holds the text of the password. Finally, we restore the original characteristics of the user's terminal. If we don't do that, it continues operating in 'noecho' mode, which they won't like.

==Reading configuration==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (!$username or !$password or !$wiki) {
    warn 'Reading config/main.conf' if $debug;
    my %main = ParseConfig (
        -ConfigFile     =&gt; 'config/main.conf',
        -LowerCaseNames =&gt; 1,
        -AutoTrue       =&gt; 1,
        -UTF8           =&gt; 1,
    );
    $username = $main{'default'} unless $username; warn &quot;Using $username&quot; if $debug;
    die &quot;I can't figure out what account to use! Try setting default in config/main.conf, or use --username&quot; unless $username;
    die &quot;There's no block for $username and you didn't specify enough data on the command line to continue&quot; unless $main{'bot'}{$username};

    $password = $main{'bot'}{$username}{'password'} if (!$password);
    warn &quot;Setting \$password&quot; if $debug;
    $wiki = $main{'bot'}{$username}{'wiki'} unless $wiki;
    warn &quot;Setting \$wiki to $wiki&quot; if $debug;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If we don't have all of username, password, and wiki already, then we should read them in from a config file. &lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;code&gt; provides the &lt;code&gt;ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; method to do this.

We give it the filename (relative to the current file), and a few options. &lt;code&gt;UTF8&lt;/code&gt; is important because this file can and will include UTF8 characters under many circumstances. An example config file:

&lt;pre&gt;
default = Mike's bot account

&lt;bot Mike's bot account&gt;
    password    = fake password
    wiki        = enwikibooks
&lt;/bot&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

When &lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;/code&gt; reads this in, it creates a [http://pacific-design.com/perl/perldata.html hash] which represents the data. Once we have that hash, we try to get the data we're missing, and warn the user if we can't accomplish that.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $bot = MediaWiki::Bot-&gt;new(); # Create a default object so we can query sitematrix if need be
$bot-&gt;{'debug'} = $debug;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that some of the &lt;code&gt;warn&lt;/code&gt; statements are conditional on &lt;code&gt;$debug&lt;/code&gt;. This is another command line flag that asks the script to output additional information about what it is doing to make debugging easier. We ask &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; to do the same.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $domain;
if (!$text or !$page or !$summary) {
    warn 'Reading config/clean_sandbox.conf' if $debug;
    my %conf = ParseConfig (
        -ConfigFile     =&gt; 'config/clean_sandbox.conf',
        -LowerCaseNames =&gt; 1,
        -UTF8           =&gt; 1,
    );
    if ($wiki =~ m/\w\.\w/) {
        $domain = $wiki;
        $wiki = $bot-&gt;domain_to_db($wiki);
    }
    %conf = %{ $conf{$wiki} }; # Keep just the part we want.

    $text    = $conf{'text'} unless $text; warn &quot;Setting \$text to $text&quot; if $debug;
    $page    = $conf{'page'} unless $page; warn &quot;Setting \$page to $page&quot; if $debug;
    $summary = $conf{'summary'} unless $summary; warn &quot;Setting \$summary to $summary&quot; if $debug;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we use &lt;code&gt;Config::General::ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; to parse another config file. This one contains data for many wikis about where their sandbox is located, what standard text should be put on it, and what edit summary they want to be used. This is useful because some bot operators might not speak the language where their bot cleans the sandbox. It also means they don't have to always specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;--page &quot;Project:Sandbox&quot; --text &quot;{{/Don't edit this line}}\n&amp;lt;!--Practice your editing here--&gt;&quot; --summary &quot;Bot: cleaning sandbox&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; every time. That data can be stored in the config file instead.

Because this file contains data for many wikis, and we don't need all of it, we throw away most of it. &lt;code&gt;ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; creates a large hash, but we keep only the part about the wiki we actually want to edit. Then, we find any data we're missing.

== Create a bot object ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$domain = $bot-&gt;db_to_domain($wiki) if ($wiki !~ m/\w\.\w/);
$bot = MediaWiki::Bot-&gt;new({
    host        =&gt; $domain,
    login_data  =&gt; { username =&gt; $username, password =&gt; $password },
});
&lt;/source&gt;
Unlike earlier versions of Perlwikibot, 3.0 will handle lots automatically to make writing scripts easier. Here, we create a new bot object, which will automatically be logged in and configured for us. Check POD documentation for &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; for details about the &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; constructor.

== Make the edit ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
die &lt;&lt;&quot;END&quot; if $dry_run;
This is where we would attempt the following edit:
\$bot-&gt;edit({
    page        =&gt; $page,
    text        =&gt; $text,
    summary     =&gt; $summary
    is_minor    =&gt; 1,
});
on $domain
END
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a here-document (heredoc) - it allows us to print a multi-line string easily. If the user specified &lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, we want to do everything up to this point, but not actually edit. So, if &lt;code&gt;$dry_run&lt;/code&gt; is set, we print out this multi-line string showing what ''would'' have happened, and die. The &lt;&lt; part of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&quot;END&quot;&lt;/code&gt; tells Perl that a heredoc follows; END tells Perl what delimiter to look for to know the heredoc has ended; the double-quotes tell Perl that we want it to be an interpolated string.

===Actually make the edit===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
warn &quot;Editing...&quot; if $debug;
$bot-&gt;edit({
    page        =&gt; $page,
    text        =&gt; $text,
    summary     =&gt; $summary
    is_minor    =&gt; 1,
}) or die &quot;Couldn't edit&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
This actually makes the edit by calling &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt; method, and passing it the page name, what text to put, the edit summary, and that it is a minor edit. See POD for details on &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt;.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |Question Options allows you to offer different types of content as answer options.  For example you could ask a user to sequence a list of images, or match images to names or use animations of sounds as options for answers.  You can add Options to the Partial Credit, Matching, Sequencing and Plugin question types.


[[File:QW Question Options.png|center]]

To add an option you right click on the question and choose ''Add - Option''.  You can then add text, images, sounds or animations.  Here is a link to a short quiz on British Design Classics featuring the options feature [[http://www.questionwritertracker.com/quiz/6235/TTPKZF4N.html]]


Question Writer still uses the text answers you have defined but adds the options.  For matching question types, each match follows the choice.  The plugin questions can be programmed to use the option content in any way.  For example the Horizontal Slider Plugin Question uses the first option as the slider background and the second option as the slider button.

Here is a step by step description of how to add images to a matching question.

First add your question, it must be either a Partial Credit, Matching, Sequencing or Plugin question types but for this example we are using a matching question.

In the question properties you can type in the Question, eg “Match the colours to the images?”  You do not need to add any text into the choices or matches fields.

The next step is to add options to the Question.  With your mouse over the question, right click and select '''Add''' and then, from the drop down list that appears, select '''Option'''

[[File:QW Options add option.jpg|center]]

You need to add an option for each possible answer option you want to give, ie the choice and it’s respective match. 

After you have added your first option you can add your image to that option.  So with your mouse on the option, right click and select Add and then Image 

[[File:QW Options add image.jpg|center]]

You can then add the option to match with that image, eg a text option, though it could be another image or a sound.

When you have added all your choices and matches you can preview your question.

[[Image:Groene kikker achter Bekaert-draad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A frog is a kind of Amphibian.]]
'''Amphibians''' are animals that live on land and in water. When they are young, they need to be in water like fish, or they will die. They don't die because they breathe oxygen from the water with their [[w:gills|gills]], lung-like breathing slits that separate oxygen from water. Then, when they are adults, they have to breathe oxygen from the air to stay alive. They will drown if they try to breathe water as adults.

'Amphibian' comes from two [[Greek]] words: &quot;amphi&quot; and &quot;bio&quot;. Amphi means &quot;both&quot;. Bio means &quot;life&quot;. 

One example of an amphibian is a frog. A frog starts as a [[w:tadpole|tadpole]], which looks like a fish, with a tail. Then it goes through a stage called ''metamorphosis'', and grows up into a frog, and it lives like a mammal or a bird, where it breathes air and only goes into the water sometimes.

'''Birds''' are vertebrates. Their bodies have feathers, which keep them warm and waterproof. Birds usually have different kinds of feathers for warmth and waterproofing. Birds breathe oxygen. They usually eat fish, insects, worms and plants. There are birds on every continent of the world. Some birds do not fly but use their wings so they can move through the water. Some birds are so large that they are the same size as people. Some scientists believe dinosaurs evolved into birds.

Birds get their food in many ways. If they are trying to eat worms, they will peck around at the ground until they find one or if they see one on the dirt, they will pick it up. Some birds like fish. To get fish to eat, they will land on the water if they see some fish, and then they will usually jab their neck and mouth under the water to try and bite the fish.

*Penguin
*Flamingo

A '''fish''' is an animal that has to spend all its time in the water. If it comes out of the water for too long of a time, it will die. A fish uses gills to get oxygen (air to breathe) from the water. Fish are usually covered with scales. One kind of fish is the shark. Some people keep fish as pets, and some people like to eat fish. 

Some fish live in fresh water (or sweet water), and some fish live in salt water. It is also possible for fish to live in water where a river runs into an ocean and the water mixes. This is called brackish water.

People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. Some people keep fish as pets. Goldfish are a popular type of pet fish.

Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones (their skeletons are made of cartilage). Some scientists say that these are not real fish, but most people call them fish. Some other animals that live in the sea, such as starfish and jellyfish, are called fish, but are not really fish.

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called fishing.

A fish is a cold-blooded, water dwelling animal with a backbone and gills throughout its life.

There are over 27,000 known living fish species,
Since the dawn of humanity, people and fish have been linked. Fish provide humans much of their protein, offer fun by fishing and provide a sense of beauty. The relationship has not been as favorable for fish: in 1999, seventy percent of the world's major fish species were determined to be fully- or over-exploited.

There are more insects than any other creature in the world. For every person on this earth, there are hundreds or possibly thousands of insects. Insects are usually very small and easy to kill, but because there are so many of them, it would be difficult to kill them all.

Insects have probably been around longer than any other animal. They are called insects because they are divided into a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Insects always have six legs, which is why spiders are not insects. Insects have an exoskeleton instead of a regular skeleton, which means they are easy to destroy, but the exoskeleton keeps them relatively intact.

Insects usually live in giant colonies of themselves, although some of them, such as flies, do not. They start as maggots and later begin to fly. Insects usually eat leaves or other insects.

Throughout human history, people have been bothered by insects. Some insects are parasites who cause diseases and might even feed on human blood, like mosquitoes. This is why humans have developed various techniques for trying to destroy insects.

Some insects have been good for people. Bees help farmers by spreading flower pollen which makes more flowers.

A '''mammal''' is one of the animal kingdoms, and because people are mammals we know much about them.
==Features==

Mammals are warm blooded; the heat they need to live is made inside their body.
Usually, mammals feed their young with milk they make from their body.
Mammals have  what is called hair or blubber, even if there is not much of it.
Mammals give birth to living young (although ''monotremes'', like the platypus, lay eggs).
Mammals' babies grow completely inside its mother's uterus (in marsupials, like the kangaroo, a baby grows mostly in a pocket of skin on the mother's stomach).

'''Mollusks''' are not members of the insect family, but many people think they are. Mollusks can be distinguished from insects by their lack of wings, and the fact that they are not warm-blooded. Although one might be tempted to be scared of mollusks, they are normally quite gentle and harmless. Mollusks have not been known to attack human beings in the wild or in captivity. To care for a mollusk, wash it ''gently'' and feed it small leaves or twigs. Most people do not recommend keeping mollusks as pets, however. A mollusk may or may not have a shell. This is not how you distinguish a mollusk; other animals have shells such as turtles. Nevertheless mollusks are often considered pesks, and are hunted in gardens and by small children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''reptile''' is a member of the Animal Kingdom reptiles. 

==Features==
[[Image:Alligator grin-scubadive67.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An alligator is a kind of reptile.]]
Every reptile has features that make them different from other animals.

*Reptiles always have a backbone, even if it is a very small one.
*Their bodies are covered in scales. 
*They have lungs.
*They are cold blooded. This means that their body temperature changes depending on the weather. If it is hot outside, their body temperature rises. If it becomes cold, their body temperature drops.

==Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parts of the instrument==
Parts of the instrument include, starting at the mouthpiece end of the instrument, the mouthpiece, leadpipe, main tuning slide, main body of the instrument, and bell.  The main body of the instrument conatins three (sometimes four) valves, each valve connected to a separate and distinct slide.  When no valves are pressed, the air moves through the instrument without entering any of the valve slides.  When a valve is pressed, the air moves through the instrument and through the slides of the valves which are depressed, thus lengthening the instrument and lowering its fundamental pitch.

==Posture and hand position==
Proper posture can be obtained by either standing or sitting tall with the elbows at a 45 degree angle with the ground.  The angle of the trumpet to the plane of the player's face generally should be slightly less than 90 degrees.  An upward horn angle (i.e. &quot;bells up&quot;) can be obtained by altering posture at the waist or neck, but this should be used only for special effect as it can interfere with proper breathing.  The angle of the trumpet with the plane of the player's face should never be significantly altered.

==Proper breathing==
A perfect inhalation breath can be accomplished the following way:  Exhale fully and count out loud to twenty without breathing in any additional air.  The natural inhalation which occurs upon reaching the number twenty is a natrually good breath, provided the throat stays open and relaxed and the shoulders also stay relaxed and do not rise closer to the ears.  Proper exhalation, the basis of proper breath support, occurs when the muscles in the diaphragm and abdominal area push the air out of the lungs.  The throat must stay relaxed in order for proper tone production to occur.  The abdominal area should be firm during proper exhalation.

==Embouchure formation==
In proper embouchure formation, the corners of the lips are firm and slightly drawn down.  The center of the lips will be slightly firm, but not nearly as firm as the corners.  The teeth are separated to approximately a pencil's width.  The lips are rolled in slightly so that the buzz can occur near where the moist inside of the lip meets the dry outside of the lip.  Both lips must be even; they should touch but not overlap one another.  The chin must remain firm, and air pockets should never be allowed to form between the teeth and the outer walls of the mouth with which the teeth make natural contact.  The mouthpiece should rest approximately 50% on the upper lip and 50% on the lower lip.  Common causes of a tight tone quality are 1) teeth which are too close together, and 2) too much tightness in the center part of the lips (where wet meets dry).

==Proper tonguing==
To tongue properly, the upper side of the tongue's tip is placed where the upper front teeth meet the gumline.  A seal must be made between all of the upper teeth and the edge of the tongue so that no air can escape in the instant before actual tonguing occurs.  The tongue should never be allowed to protrude between the top and bottom front teeth, and the tip of the tongue should never be so far back that it only touches the gums/membranes of the mouth and not the front teeth.

==First sounds on the mouthpiece==
The mouthpiece should be held with the thumb and first finger of the non-dominant hand.  It should be held on the &quot;dirt line&quot; which may be slightly scratched or worn away from repeated insertions into the leadpipe.  The first sound on the mouthpiece should be air-based.  This can be accomplished by forming the embouchure, placing the mouthpiece on the lips, and blowing air (no buzz) through the mouthpiece.  While continuing to try to blow air, cover up the tip of the mouthpiece with the dominant hand first finger and let the pressure build up for a second or two.  When the finger is released, the pressure will be released and the air will once again pass through the mouthpiece, but if everything is properly lined up, the sudden release of pressure will automatically start a proper air-based buzz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening SPSS==
There are two ways to open SPSS.  The first way is quite simple if the SPSS icon is already on your desktop all you have to do is double click the icon:

[[File:02openingSPSS01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Double-clicking the SPSS icon should open the program, as illustrated below:
[[File:02openingSPSS02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Alternatively you can open SPSS through the start button on your computer (if you're running Windows).  If the SPSS icon is not on your desktop you must go through your computer's Start button. Click “Start” → “All programs” → “SPSS Inc.”  From this point if you have more then one version of SPSS on your computer you have to pick the version you are going to open. I am going to use version 16.0. From here click SPSS 16.0 , and finally click the SPSS 16.0 icon.  All the steps are shown below in a screen shot:
[[File:02openingSPSS04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

If you followed the steps above when you click SPSS 16.0 the program should open on your computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The previous chapter mentioned Syntax and how it may be included in the Log of your Output Window.  

Syntax usually refers to a language's rules of valid sentence and phrase formation but it is also what SPSS has chosen to name its user command language. 

By default, SPSS logs into the Output Window the Syntax commands corresponding to its user's GUI commands, retaining a history of every command run.  Note this is also an opportunity to be painlessly tutored in use of Syntax.  (The utility of learning Syntax is explained on page [[../SPSS_syntax]].)

If your Syntax logging is turned off and you want to turn it back on, the below shows how.

First, what basic analysis looks like without Syntax:
[[File:07syntaxinoutput01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To tell SPSS to include Syntax in your Output Window, click “Edit” → “Options.”
[[File:07syntaxinoutput02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you click Options, this window will pop up.  Click the &quot;Viewer&quot; tab.
[[File:07syntaxinoutput03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

On the “Viewer” tab, check the box at the bottom left hand that says “Display commands in the log.”
[[File:07syntaxinoutput04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click “OK.”

Now run any analysis and the Output Window's Log will include the Syntax.  This is illustrated below with a Frequencies analysis:

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page will illustrate how to change SPSS' settings in order to have its variable lists alphabetically sorted. 

By default, SPSS arranges the variable list in the same order as found in the data editor, however, arranging the list alphabetically is useful when you have many variables, because it allows searching for variables by simply pressing the first letter of their name:  the selected list item will jump to the first matching variable name.

To set SPSS to display the variables alphabetically is easy.  To begin, click “Edit” → “Options”:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

After having selected the “Options” tab, you will see this window:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the &quot;Display names&quot; and “Alphabetical” options in the “Variable Lists” box on the top left:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on the “OK” button as shown above. 

Once you have done this, another dialog notifies that any dialogs currently open will be closed.  Click “OK” once again:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To see the new behavior, check any option that includes a variable list, e.g., click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  →  “Descriptives”: 
[[File:08variablesalphabetical05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You should end up with a window similar to the below one, with the variables in the left hand side box ordered alphabetically:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can now easily search through a list of variables by typing in the first letter of a variable name: SPSS will jump directly to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The previous page showed how to create a new variable by Transform of an existing one.  In this exegesis we will show you how to create entirely new variables.  

Creating a new variable is a foundational skill for users of SPSS, as it is necessary to perform many statistical tests and procedures (see Part II).  

Step one in creating a variable is switching the Data Editor window to “Variable View”, by clicking on its tab: 
[[File:11creatingnewvariables01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then click in the first empty row and provide your nascent variable with a name, e.g., “Age”:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can specify the type of the variable by clicking in the cell under the column labeled “Type.”  An ellipsis will appear:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on the ellipsis to open the Variable Type Dialog box, which looks like:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Most variables will be “Numeric,” meaning they will be number based, either because the number itself is meaningful (interval/ratio variables) or because it represents distinct categories.  Other common variable types are String, for text, Date, and Currency.  Select the desired type and click OK.

Next, input a label (description) for your variable as a whole: 
[[File:11creatingnewvariables06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Moving right in the Variable View, the next field is Values. Click there and then on its ellipsis to expose
[[File:11creatingnewvariables07.png|center|thumb|400px]] 
If the variable is ordinal you must assign a unique number to each label.  E.g., for a variable holding participant race you might specify &quot;1&quot; as Value with &quot;White&quot; as the Label, and continue with such mappings as 2=Black, 3=Native American, etc.

Next up is [[../Understanding the missing values dialog|Missing]]. Click here and as usual on the ellipsis to specify how missing (did not respond, not applicable, lost, etc) values will be denoted so they are not used in any calculations by default:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables08.png|center|thumb|400px]] 
While you have free hand to choose your designation, it is common to uses iterations of 9 to indicate missing values in numeric fields, where that value would otherwise be impossible.  For instance, if a variable holds an integer in range 1 - 4 plus a missing value, you can assign a “9” to indicate that a value is missing.  If there are 20 categories, &quot;20&quot; is two decimal places and &lt;99, so you could use two “9”s to indicate a missing value in that variable, and so on. If the variable is of type String, you would usually use more description missing values, such as &quot;NA&quot;.

Finally, you must specify your [[../Understanding the Measure Column|level of measurement]].  This may be done by clicking on the cell under the column labeled “Measure” and choosing from Nominal, Ordinal, and Scale:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables09.png|center|thumb|400px]] 
Nominal and ordinal variables should be labeled under their corresponding names, while interval and ratio variables should be labeled as “Scale.”

Repeat this process for as many variables as you need to create.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Descriptive statistics are used to describe variables.  Examples of descriptive statistics include: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.  Here we'll describe how to have SPSS calculate three of them, the mean, median and mode, for a variable “age”, plus introduce the concept of skewed distribution.

In order to generate descriptives in SPSS, you first need to open up a data set. In this book a Genetic Counseling example data set is utilized.

Once it's open, we click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  → “Frequencies...”:
[[File:15descriptives01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

A Frequencies Window will appear on the screen. Select the variable labeled “age” on the left and click the blue arrow to move it into the Variable(s) box:
[[File:15descriptives02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Please then click on the Statistics... button. A new window will appear, with a grouping named &quot;Central Tendency.&quot;  There, select Mean, Median, and Mode and click Continue:
[[File:15descriptives03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once the box disappears, click “OK” in the Frequencies Box.  The valid versus missing breakdown, along with the mean (average), median (middle), and mode (most common) age of participating genetic counselors will appear at the top of the Output window:
[[File:15descriptives04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

In the example above, the mean age of participants is 35.93. The data set's median age is 33, and the mode is 28.

==Distribution Curves in SPSS==
If you want to see where the mean, median, and mode fall on a frequency distribution curve, SPSS can show you. This is useful when you are trying to determine if your value's distribution is normal or skewed.  (A discussion of skewness statistics is beyond the scope of this book).  

Please repeat the above example, again utilizing the variable of “age”, until the “Frequencies” window is open again.  Click the button labeled “Charts...” to open a window offering Chart Type:
[[File:15descriptives05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the radio button labeled “Histograms” and check “With normal curve.” Click “Continue” then “OK” and your chart will pop up in the Output box:
[[File:15descriptives06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The frequency curve in this example shows a positively skewed distribution, i.e., values off the normal curve in a positive direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An independent samples t-test is used for comparing the means on an interval/ratio variable between two categories on a nominal/ordinal variable. It answers the question of whether the difference between means is statistically significant in the population of interest (assuming good sampling) or whether the difference is due to sampling error. To do this test, you need two variables from one population and sample.  The independent variable is nominal/ordinal and the dependent is interval/ratio. 

To illustrate this concept, this chapter tests to see if there is a statistically significant difference between whether or not Genetic Counselors believe in life after death and how spiritual they consider themselves.  

To run the t-test you will click “Analyze” → “Compare Means”  → “Independent Samples T-Test”:
[[File:18independentttest01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Since the spirituality scale is the interval/ratio variable it will act as the dependent variable. That is, how spiritual one considers himself depends on his belief in life after death.  Find the spiritual scale variable (labeled “sprscale”) and click the arrow to move it over to the test variable section.  Next, find the views on life after death variable (labeled “postlife”) and click the arrow to move that over to the grouping variable section. 

You will see question marks next to the grouping variable. This is because SPSS allows you to choose which categories of the independent variable you want to include (the variable could include more than just two categories).  You will need to tell SPSS which groups to compare by clicking the “define groups” button. To find these labels, go back to the Data Editor in Variable View and click on the “Values” button for the “postlife” variable. You will see this screen:
[[File:18independentttest02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The above screenshot shows that not believing in an afterlife is labeled “0” and believing is labeled “1.”  Once you know what your values are for believing in an afterlife, return to the t-test dialog.  In the define groups window, add zero for “No” and one for “Yes”:
[[File:18independentttest03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Once you've defined your groups, click “Continue.”  You'll return to the primary “Independent-Samples t-test” window:
[[File:18independentttest04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Click OK, and SPSS will run the T-Test. Two tables will appear in the output:
[[File:18independentttest05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A lot of information appears in these tables. The first table is simply the “Group Statistics” table, which includes: sample sizes, means, standard deviations and standard errors of the means. 

The second table, labeled the “Independent Samples Test,” is what you use for determining whether or not you can reject the null hypothesis.  Because you are comparing two means, two different variances are obtained. There is a long equation used to determine which variance to use, but SPSS does this for you by running the Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances. If the variances are relatively equal, that is one sample variance is no larger than twice the size of the other, then you can assume equal variances. By looking at the output of the Levene’s test you decide which row to use. If the significance is .05 or below, use the bottom row, or “equal variances not assumed.” If the significance is above .05 use the top row.  In this example, since the significance is .000, we'll examine the bottom row. 

Both the top and bottom row provide the same information, they just use different tests to calculate the test statistic, which results in slightly different calculations.  This table provides the test statistic or t value, the degrees of freedom and other values helpful for determining confidence intervals.  A key statistic provided is the p-value, listed in the “Sig (2-tailed)” column.  If your p-value is greater than .05 you fail to reject the null (meaning the difference in means is likely due to chance or sampling error).  If your p-value is less than .05 you can reject the null (meaning there is in fact a statistically significant difference in the means and it is not due to sampling error). In this case, you can reject the null hypothesis (because the significance is .000, which is substantially less than .05).  

You should always interpret your analysis, “How spiritual someone considers him/herself is affected by someone's belief in an afterlife.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chi-Square test is used when trying to find a relationship between two nominal or ordinal variables.  To reiterate, a nominal variable is one that is only measured by naming categories such as class, quality or kind.  An ordinal variable is similar to a nominal variable, but the categories can be put in an order (e.g., ranked highest to lowest).

To calculate Chi-Square, we use a cross-tabulation, crosstab for short, which shows the frequencies of joint occurrences between two variables.

The hypothesis we will test in this chapter is whether or not there is a relationship between religious affiliation and belief in the afterlife.  We will test this using an alpha of .05.
To do a Chi-Square test in SPSS, complete the following steps:

You must have two nominal variables from a single sample that you can use to see if there is a relationship between them.  For this example we will use religion (relig) and belief in the afterlife (postlife).  For this example religion is the independent variable and belief in the afterlife is the dependent variable.  This will be important later.

To run the test, select: Analyze → Descriptives → Crosstabs.

Once you click Crosstabs, a window will pop up where you will enter your chosen variables to be tested.  Select the independent variable (relig)  to go in the column and the dependent variable (postlife) to go in the row.

Next, click the statistics button and check the Chi-Square box.
[[File:20chisquare02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Hit continue and then click on the cells button and check observed, expected and column percentages.
[[File:20chisquare03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then hit OK and an output window with the resulting cross-tabulation will pop up.
[[File:20chisquare04.png|center|thumb|400px|NOTE:  The expected frequency of each cell must be at least five in order to rely on the Chi-Square test.  If it is not five, a different statistical test must be completed.]] 

Next you must interpret the data.  At the bottom of each column and end of every row there is a total for that specific group.  The bottom right cell is the total number of cases in the sample.  In each cell, it shows the observed joint occurrence between the two variables and the expected occurrence based on the totals that were observed.  If there is NO relationship between the variables, the observed and expected frequencies will be the same.  For our example, this is clearly not the case.  They are different but we must look at the last box from our output window to see if our relationship is legitimate or if it was due to sampling error.
[[File:20chisquare05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

As we stated in the beginning, our alpha is .05.  If the “Asymp. Sig. (2-sided)” for the Pearson Chi-Square statistic is less than .05, there is a relationship between the variables based on the level of confidence we stated in the beginning.  As seen in the table below, the Chi-Square significance value is .000 which is less than our value of .05 which shows that there is a relationship between one’s religion and their belief in the afterlife.

Finally, we interpret the test in everyday terms, which also means we look more closely at the crosstab table as well.  In the crosstab table it is clear that Protestants and Catholics are much more likely to report a belief in the afterlife than are Jews or Nones.  Thus, we can say, “Jews and the non-religious are significantly less likely to believe in an afterlife than are Protestants and Catholics.”  Do note that care must be taken in interpreting Chi-Square crosstabs as it is not always perfectly clear where the significant differences between scores lie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ANOVA is an extension of the two group difference of means test (t-test). The t-test is used to  compare two group means, but ANOVA allows for comparing three or more group means, which is easier than conducting numerous t-tests.

To conduct a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test in SPSS, you must first begin by choosing two variables.  The variables we will use in this example are religious affiliation and frequency of prayer.  Basically we are asking, “Does religion affiliation have an influence on how often people pray?”

Once you know what you want to compare, you can tell SPSS to run the analysis by clicking on “Analyze” → “Compare Means” → “One-Way ANOVA”:
[[File:21ANOVA01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The One-Way ANOVA dialog box will appear:
[[File:21ANOVA02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

In the list displayed on the left, click on the variable that corresponds to your dependent variable (should be an interval/ratio variable).  In our example this is frequency of prayer. Move it into the Dependent List by clicking on the upper arrow button. In this example, we are asking if religious preference has any effect on how often people pray.

Now select the (quasi) independent variable from the list on the left and click on it. Move it into the Factor box by clicking on the lower arrow button.  In our example this is religious affiliation.
[[File:21ANOVA03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on the Options button in the One-Way ANOVA dialog box. The One-Way ANOVA dialog box appears:
[[File:21ANOVA04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click in the check box to the left of Descriptives (to get descriptive statistics), Homogeneity of Variance (to get a test of the assumption of homogeneity of variance) and Means plot (to get a graph of the means of the conditions). 

Click on the Continue button to return to the One-Way ANOVA dialog box. In the One Way ANOVA dialog box, click on the “OK” button to perform the analysis of variance. The SPSS output window will appear. The output consists of six major sections. The first is the descriptives section:
[[File:21ANOVA05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The Descriptives table provides various descriptives for the groups being compared, including the group sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, standard error, and confidence interval for the mean. In this example, there were 64 Jewish individuals, the mean frequency of prayer was 4.70 (on a six point scale; technically it is an interval-like ordinal variable), and the standard deviation was 1.217. There were 132 Catholic individuals with a mean frequency of prayer at 3.38, and a standard deviation of 1.438.

The ANOVA output gives us the analysis of variance summary table. There are six columns in the output:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Column !! Description
|-
| Unlabeled (source of variance) || This column describes each row of the ANOVA summary table. It tells us that the first row corresponds to the between-groups estimate of variance. The between-groups estimate of variance forms the numerator of the F ratio. The second row corresponds to the within-groups estimate of variance. The within-groups estimate of variance forms the denominator of the F ratio. The final row describes the total variability in the data.
|-
| Sum of Squares || The sum of squares column gives the sum of squares for each of the estimates of variance. 
|-
| Df || The third column gives the degrees of freedom for each estimate of variance. The degrees of freedom for the between-groups estimate of variance are given by the number of levels of the IV-1. In this example there are five levels of the independent variable.
|-
| Mean Square || The fourth column gives the estimates of variance (the mean squares). Each mean square is calculated by dividing the sum of square by its degrees of freedom.
|-
| F || The fifth column gives the F ratio. It is calculated by dividing mean square variance between-groups by the mean square variance within groups.
|-
| Sig. || The final column gives the significance of the F-ratio. This is the p-value. If the p-value is less than or equal to your alpha level, then you can reject null hypothesis that all means are equal. In our example, the p-value is .000. 
|}

Here is the actual ANOVA table from the example:
[[File:21ANOVA06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that religious affiliation does significantly affect frequency of prayer for genetic counselors.

It's great that this has been imported here.  Keep in mind, though, that most of these pages were, and still are, tagged as stubs.  I agree with that assessment of the pages.  Each ends with a short bulleted list of animals, presumably with the notion that there would be something about each one.  Those lists have now been made links to Wikipedia articles, which I think is ultimately inappropriate; Wikibooks are supposed to be largely self-contained, and this has had the unfortunate effect of making these pages feel like annexes to Wikipedia.

Note that some of the additional content one might consider adding is at least similar to stuff that's redundant to other Wikijunior books &amp;mdash; [[Wikijunior:Bugs]] comes to mind.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:13, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:I agree.  Though I just noticed that some of the links changed when I imported.  For example, on [http://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/Animal_Kingdoms/Content/Amphibians this page] all the links point to simple.wikipedia, where as on [[Wikijunior:Animal Kingdom/Amphibians]] everything points to wikipedia.  This was not exactly intentional, but ultimately we don't intend to link to either form of wikipedia, so I am not too worried about the change. But maybe it is something to kept on the back of my mind if I do other imports from simple.wikibooks. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:41, 22 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

;Important note
:This release includes breaking changes. These release notes will guide you through the process of updating your calling code.
}}

The 3.0 release marks a major transition. For starters, all methods use the API where possible. This means that return formats have changed in some cases. Likewise, some method calls have changed. Some of these still accept a backward-compatible form; this will be noted where applicable.
__TOC__
==Breaking changes==
===All methods===
;Overview
:Nearly all methods now return &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; on failure.

;Rationale
:Separating errors from returned data is important. If you require the error code or error details, they are available in &lt;code&gt;$bot-&gt;{'error'}-&gt;{'code'}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$bot-&gt;{'error'}-&gt;{'details'}&lt;/code&gt; respectively.

;Impact
:Any method calls which did not ignore the return value must now check for &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example: &lt;code&gt;get_text()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_pages()&lt;/code&gt;====
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=These methods now return &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; for non-existent pages instead of an error code.
|rationale=per above
|impact=Any special cases you had for handling error codes must now look for &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; instead. Calls involving pages which exist are unaffected.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $text = $bot-&gt;get_text('Non-existent page');
print $text if defined($text);

my @pages = ('Page 1', 'Page 2', 'Page 3');
my $thing = $bot-&gt;get_pages(\@pages);
foreach my $page (keys %$thing) {
    my $text = $thing-&gt;{$page};
    print &quot;$text\n&quot; if defined($text);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $text = $bot-&gt;get_text('Non-existent page');
print $text unless ($text eq &quot;2&quot;);

my @pages = ('Page 1', 'Page 2', 'Page 3');
my $thing = $bot-&gt;get_pages(\@pages);
foreach my $page (keys %$thing) {
    my $text = $thing-&gt;{$page};
    print &quot;$text\n&quot; unless ($text eq &quot;2&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===&lt;code&gt;login()&lt;/code&gt;===
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=This method now returns true on success; false on failure.
|rationale=In Perl, non-zero is true and means success. Even the syscall wrappings in Perl follow this convention.
|impact=All calls to &lt;code&gt;login()&lt;/code&gt; which checked return values must be updated.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$bot-&gt;login({
    username =&gt; &quot;Mike's bot account&quot;,
    password =&gt; $password,
}) or die &quot;Couldn't log in&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $failure = $bot-&gt;login(&quot;Mike's bot account&quot;, $password);
die &quot;Couldn't log in&quot; if $failure;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===&lt;code&gt;linksearch()&lt;/code&gt;===
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=This method now uses keys 'url' and 'title'
|rationale=This reduces confusion in cases where the programmer wishes to use a callback hook to do incremental processing. Without this change, accessing data would have been done with two different sets of keys.
|impact=Any call needs to have the key names updated.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $options = { max =&gt; 10, }; # I only want some results
my @links = $bot-&gt;linksearch(&quot;slashdot.org&quot;, 1, undef, $options);
foreach my $hash (@links) {
    my $url = $hash-&gt;{'url'};
    my $page = $hash-&gt;{'title'};
    print &quot;$page: $url\n&quot;;
}

# Use a callback:
my $options = { hook =&gt; \&amp;mysub, }; # I want to do incremental processing
$bot-&gt;linksearch(&quot;slashdot.org&quot;, 1, undef, $options) or die;
sub mysub {
    my ($res) = @_;
    foreach my $hashref (@$res) {
        my $url   = $hashref-&gt;{'url'};
        my $title = $hashref-&gt;{'title'};
        print &quot;$title: $url\n&quot;;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @links = $bot-&gt;linksearch(&quot;slashdot.org&quot;, 1) or die;
foreach my $hashref (@links) {
    my $link = $hashref-&gt;{'link'};
    my $page = $hashref-&gt;{'page'};
    print &quot;$page: $link\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===&lt;code&gt;what_links_here()&lt;/code&gt;===
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=This method now uses keys 'title' and 'redirect'. It also returns ''only'' links (incl. redirects). Transclusions are handled by &lt;code&gt;list_transclusions()&lt;/code&gt;.
|rationale=This reduces confusion in cases where the programmer wishes to use a callback hook to do incremental processing. Without this change, accessing data would have been done with two different sets of keys.
|impact=Any call to this method needs to be evaluated as to whether it needs to be replaced with or supplemented by a call to &lt;code&gt;list_transclusions()&lt;/code&gt;. Also, key names must be updated.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @links = $bot-&gt;what_links_here(&quot;Meta:Sandbox&quot;, undef, 1, {hook=&gt;\&amp;mysub});
sub mysub{
    my ($res) = @_;
    foreach my $hash (@$res) {
        my $title = $hash-&gt;{'title'};
        my $is_redir = $hash-&gt;{'redirect'};
        print &quot;Redirect: $title\n&quot; if $is_redir;
        print &quot;Page: $title\n&quot; unless $is_redir;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
# dunno
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Hello! ==

Hi there,

I came to your talk page after seeing your book stubs, [[Role Playing Games]] and [[Print (command)]]. Please don't be scared by the deletion warnings! I think I understand what you want to write, and it makes sense. The warnings and messages are just because we got a little confused by the formatting and organization of the text and pages. For that reason, it would be nice if you explained in more detail what are your plans for the books you intend to write, so that we can clear any misunderstandings and help you to sort out the rough edges and technical details of a Wikibook. You can reply directly here, on my talk page (link at the sig) or just post a more public question at [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance]]. See you, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:27, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

:(cross-replying from my talk page) No need to apologize, everyone must start as a newbie :) A couple general suggestions to get you started:

:* First of all, familiarize yourself with the basics of markup - things like wiki links, section headers and such. There are a couple good links on the &quot;Welcome&quot; box above; [[Using Wikibooks]] in particular should make for a good read. Another approach is taking advantage of the fact that all pages here use the same syntax, so if you want to see how something was done in a page just click &quot;Edit&quot; and check the source.

:* Name the pages within your book hierarchically. For instance, you might want to create pages like [[Role Playing Games/Introduction]] or [[Role Playing Games/Dungeons and Dragons]].

:* Arguably the most important thing to keep in mind for creating a book is structure. Think of the subjects you want to cover (History of RPGs, pen-and-paper game systems, typical fantasy settings, or whatever else you'd like) and arrange them in a logical, nice-flowing order. Then, convert each topic into a new chapter (which could be one or a few pages), and link these from a table of contents in the main page (you can even link to non-existing pages, just to remind yourself and others that there is a gap in the book that should be covered eventually).

:* Be careful with writing style, too. Avoid speculation, wild/unsupported claims or writing in an excessively personal point of view. Also, for your particular book one thing that could become problematic would be diving too deep into particular games/series (say, by writing character guides).

:* Don't be afraid to ask more questions! A good place to go is the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading room]], where you are certain to find nice people willing to help.

:Good luck! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:22, 1 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Command line usage ===
OpenSCAD can not only be used as a GUI, but also handles command line arguments. Its usage line says:

OpenSCAD 2014.03+ has these options:

 openscad     [ -o output_file [ -d deps_file ] ]\
              [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] \
              [ --version ] [ --info ] \
              [ --camera=translatex,y,z,rotx,y,z,dist | \
                --camera=eyex,y,z,centerx,y,z ] \
              [ --imgsize=width,height ] [ --projection=(o)rtho|(p)ersp] \
              [ --render | --preview[=throwntogether] ] \
              [ --csglimit=num ] \
              filename

Openscad 2013.05 had these options:

 openscad     [ -o output_file [ -d deps_file ] ]\
              [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] [ --render ] \
              [ --camera=translatex,y,z,rotx,y,z,dist | \
                --camera=eyex,y,z,centerx,y,z ] \
              [ --imgsize=width,height ] [ --projection=(o)rtho|(p)ersp] \
              filename

Earlier releases had only these:

 openscad [ -o &lt;i&gt;output_file&lt;i&gt; [ -d &lt;i&gt;deps_file&lt;/i&gt; ] ] \
          [ -m &lt;i&gt;make_command&lt;/i&gt; ] [ -D &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;i&gt;val&lt;/i&gt; [..] ] &lt;i&gt;filename&lt;/i&gt;

The usage on OpenSCAD version 2011.09.30 (now deprecated) was:

 openscad [ { -s stl_file | -o off_file | -x dxf_file } [ -d deps_file ] ]\
          [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] filename

=== Export options ===

When called with the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; option, OpenSCAD will not start the GUI, but execute the given file and export the to the &lt;i&gt;output_file&lt;/i&gt; in a format depending on the extension (&lt;code&gt;.stl&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.off&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.dxf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.csg&lt;/code&gt;).  

Some versions use -s/-d/-o to determine the output file format instead; check with &quot;openscad --help&quot;.

If the option &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; is given in addition to an export command, all files accessed while building the mesh are written in the argument of &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; in the syntax of a Makefile.

==== Camera and image output ====

For 2013.05+, the option to output a &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; image was added. There are two types of cameras available for the generation of images.  

The first camera type is a 'gimbal' camera that uses Euler angles, translation, and a camera distance, like OpenSCAD's GUI viewport display at the bottom of the OpenSCAD window.

!!! There is a bug in the implementation of cmdline camera, where the rotations do not match the numbers in the GUI. This will be fixed in an upcoming release so that the GUI and cmdline camera variables will work identically. 

The second camera type is a 'vector' camera, with an 'eye' camera location vector and a 'lookat' center vector. 

--imgsize chooses the .png dimensions and --projection chooses orthogonal or perspective, as in the GUI. 

By default, cmdline .png output uses Preview mode (f5) with OpenCSG. For some situations it will be desirable instead to use the full render, with CGAL. This is done by adding '--render' as an option.

=== Constants ===

In order to pre-define variables, use the &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; option. It can be given repeatedly. Each occurrence of &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; must be followed by an assignment. Unlike normal OpenSCAD assignments, these assignments don't define variables, but constants, which can not be changed inside the program, and can thus be used to overwrite values defined in the program at export time.

If you want to assign the -D variable to another variable, the -D variable MUST be initialised in the main .scad program

 param1=0;   // must be initalised
 len=param1; // param1 passed via -D on cmd-line
 echo(len,param);

without the first line len wound be undefined.

The right hand sides can be arbitrary OpenSCAD expressions, including mathematical operations and strings. Be aware that strings have to be enclosed in quotes, which have to be escaped from the shell. To render a model that takes a quality parameter with the value &quot;production&quot;, one has to run

 openscad -o my_model_production.stl -D 'quality=&quot;production&quot;' my_model.scad

=== Command to build required files ===

In a complex build process, some files required by an OpenSCAD file might be currently missing, but can be generated, for example if they are defined in a Makefile. If OpenSCAD is given the option &lt;code&gt;-m make&lt;/code&gt;, it will start &lt;code&gt;make &lt;i&gt;file&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; the first time it tries to access a missing &lt;i&gt;file&lt;/i&gt;.

=== Makefile example ===

The &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; options only make sense together. (&lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; would not consider modified dependencies when building exports, &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; would require the files to be already built for the first run that generates the dependencies.)

Here is an example of a basic Makefile that creates an .stl file from an .scad file of the same name:

 # explicit wildcard expansion suppresses errors when no files are found
 include $(wildcard *.deps)
 
 %.stl: %.scad
 	openscad -m make -o $@ -d $@.deps $&lt;

When &lt;code&gt;make my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is run for the first time, it finds no .deps files, and will just depend on &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt;; since &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is not yet preset, it will be created unconditionally. If OpenSCAD finds missing files, it will call &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; to build them, and it will list all used files in &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl.deps&lt;/code&gt;.

When &lt;code&gt;make my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is called subsequently, it will find and include &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl.deps&lt;/code&gt; and check if any of the files listed there, including &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt;, changed since &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; was built, based on their time stamps. Only if that is the case, it will build &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; again.

==== Automatic targets ====

When building similar .stl files from a single .scad file, there is a way to automate that too:

 # match &quot;module foobar() { // `make` me&quot;
 TARGETS=$(shell sed '/^module [a-z0-9_-]*().*make..\?me.*$$/!d;s/module //;s/().*/.stl/' base.scad)
 
 all: ${TARGETS}
 
 # auto-generated .scad files with .deps make make re-build always. keeping the
 # scad files solves this problem. ([[Talk:OpenSCAD User Manual/Using OpenSCAD in a command line environment|explanations are welcome]].)
 .SECONDARY: $(shell echo &quot;${TARGETS}&quot; | sed 's/\.stl/.scad/g')
 
 # explicit wildcard expansion suppresses errors when no files are found
 include $(wildcard *.deps)
 
 %.scad:
 	echo -n 'use &lt;base.scad&gt;\n$*();' &gt; $@
 
 %.stl: %.scad
 	openscad -m make -o $@ -d $@.deps $&lt;

All objects that are supposed to be exported automatically have to be defined in &lt;code&gt;base.scad&lt;/code&gt; in an own module with their future file name (without the &quot;.stl&quot;), and have a comment like &quot;&lt;code&gt;// make me&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the line of the module definition. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;TARGETS=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; line picks these out of the base file and creates the file names. These will be built when &lt;code&gt;make all&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, for short) is called.

As the convention from the last example is to create the .stl files from .scad files of the same base name, for each of these files, an .scad file has to be generated. This is done in the &quot;&lt;code&gt;%.scad:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; paragraph; &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt; will be a very simple OpenSCAD file:

 use &lt;base.scad&gt;
 my_example();

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;.SECONDARY&lt;/code&gt;&quot; line is there to keep &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; from deleting the generated .scad files. If it deleted it, it would not be able to automatically determine which files need no rebuild any more; please post ideas about what exactly goes wrong there (or how to fix it better) on the [[Talk:OpenSCAD User Manual/Using OpenSCAD in a command line environment|talk]] page!

=== Windows notes ===

On Windows, openscad.com should be called from the command line as a wrapper for openscad.exe. This is because Openscad uses the 'devenv' solution to the Command-Line/GUI output issue. Typing 'openscad' at the cmd.exe prompt will, by default, call the .com program wrapper.

=== MacOS notes ===

On MacOS the binary is normally hidden inside the App folder. If OpenSCAD is installed in the global Applications folder, it can be called from command line like in the following example that just shows the OpenSCAD version:

 macbook:/$ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD -v
 OpenSCAD version 2013.06

[[Image:Twarog.jpg|thumb|Curd]]
'''Curds''' are a [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy product]] obtained by ''curdling'' (coagulating) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] with rennet or an edible acidic substance such as [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] and then draining off the liquid portion (called whey). Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria or yeast) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheese is produced this way.

In India, the word ''curd'' is frequently used to mean [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]. In South India, it is common practice to finish any meal with curd or buttermilk. In Sweden, curds is a major ingredient of the traditional baked cheesecakes Ostkaka (with egg, flour, almonds), which is eaten with jam and cream.</text>

:Make by default deletes intermediary files under certain conditions, see [http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/make/Special-Targets.html].  The .PRECIOUS target is also used for this purpose, and the linked page is not really clear which one is more appropriate. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:67.232.185.87|67.232.185.87]] ([[User talk:67.232.185.87|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/67.232.185.87|contribs]]) 04:24, 23 May 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:: using .PRECIOUS would be inappropriate here as it might leave partially completed files (as of reading your link, i should probably add the .DELETE_ON_ERROR target as well). the question is not what .SECONDARY does, but why, when the intermediate files are deleted, make would re-bulid the whole project on subsequent runs *although not a bit was changed*. --[[User:Chrysn|chrysn]] ([[User talk:Chrysn|talk]]) 22:44, 26 May 2010 (UTC)
::: For each .stl make will check if the sources are newer. Since the .scad files are regenerated, they are newer than the .stl files. Hence make will rebuild them. 

Could someone include a real world example that shows/explains why 'Automatic targets' is useful? [[User:Mimarx|Mimarx]] ([[User talk:Mimarx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mimarx|contribs]]) 02:29, 23 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rendering a movie: see Anim8tor help file.

'''Exporting a movie with an alpha mask:''' 
Anima8tor allows you to export a movie with an alpha channel. This option allows you to create very advanced professional effects once the footage is imported into a video editing program such as AfterEffects. You can export your movie in three ways: AVI, BMP sequence or JPG sequence. It is recommended you export your 3D movie (with alpha) as a BMP sequence with alpha. In the render movie window, make sure you have checked the box Movie with Alpha. With a BMP sequence each frame will be exported with no compression at the highest possible quality. Always import raw footage into a video editor with no compression. Compress you movie out of AfterEffects, but not going into AE. All source footage and images should be extremely high resolution.

NOTE: In the SAME folder you have selected to accept your BMP sequence, there will be two sets of files. This is not evident at first, so look carefully. On a PC choose LIST from window viewing option. If you scroll down there will be a second sequence of BMP pics, but these will be the ALPHA channel pics. They will be black and white. They will have nearly the same name as the movie bmp sequence and this can trip you up if you don't look carefully. It is the reason I have taken time to get online and write this page. I want to save others two days of wasted time. 

You will have two sequences in the same folder. Recommend you drag-select and cut-paste the second BMP alpha sequence to its own folder, to avoid confusion. 

In the editor, we will use AfterEffects as example, create a new file and new composition. IMPORT FILE and navigate to your folder where you saved your anim8tor sequence. RIGHT CLICK on the first name001.bmp file and then BMP SEQUENCE will become an option in that window. Repeat and now import your alpha (black and white) bmp sequence. The two names will be separated only by one letter, pay attention. Drag your movie onto the timeline. Drag your alpha on top of that layer. You can now use the AE track matte feature to turn the alpha sequence into a mask. Google 'track matte' if you are not sure how to do get that going. 

Anim8tor is not a complex 3D program overall, there is no argument with that fact - however, the creator of Anim8tor, Steven, is/was a coder involved in 3D video card drivers - so interestingly his particular approach involved putting many basic, powerful functions into Anim8tor.

'''Using Modifiers in Anim8tor:''' 
The Anim8tor help manual is thin when it comes to explaining MODIFIERS so I'd like to share some of my trouble solving research and hopefully save you some time. Please read the basic tutorials on modifiers available in the anim8tor manual and within online tutorials and refer back to this article later if you find something not obvious with those guys. 

There are probably two basic reasons to use the modifier. When building your model, perhaps to get an exact shape or angle of a piece. Secondly down the road when you have finished your model and you want to animate the object so it moves and bends realistically in the SCENE MODE time line. 

Select the MODIFIER tool. The yellow modifier grid box will begin to grow exactly at the tip of the cursor arrow. As you drag the mouse the yellow box will grow but if you position the cursor in the middle of an object and click-drag, note that you will not see the yellow box until you have dragged it to be large enough to see outside of object. Don't get fixated on drawing the modifier yellow grid box too exactly. Its quite adjustable after and I recommend you draw it next to the object or part of your object to be modified so you can see the box growing as you drag. After you finish click-dragging out the modifier box you can select the MOVE TOOL and move the yellow box around as you would any object. As well you can select either one of the SCALE tools. Try selecting the NON-UNIFORM SCALE tool as this will allow you to adjust the width of the modifier box. To scale the height, grab the uniform scale tool, and then again the non-uniform to tweak the width. Move the yellow modifier box over the area to be modified. Use the ARCH ROTATE viewing tool to rotate your view, so you can get the yellow box exactly in place. One thing to keep in mind when sizing your modifier box and placing it over the area to be deformed, is how completely the modifier box encompasses the object. You may need to experiment and what I have found is that you may get strange results if you put the modifier box over a portion of an object and not all. Which may result only part of the object deforming and leaving some jagged artifact bits stretched out. Again, it just depends so experiment and if all else fails just put the box over the whole portion, so all of the mesh moves together. 

Another note about the modifier box, in BEND mode I have noticed that after you have positioned and scaled your yellow grid box, you might want to ROTATE the grid box so you it bends in the direction you want. The modifier box can be rotated in place easily. Select VIEW and then LEFT from the top menu so you are looking at the side of the object now. Select the modifier box and then select the ROTATE tool and rotate the modifier box one quarter turn. Remember you can deselect any of the XYZ buttons so that the modifier box will only rotate about its axis, so it wont get all wobbly when you try to rotate it around a bit. Don't forget to toggle XYZ back on if you turned one off, btw. 

After you have drawn a modifier box, moved it into position and rotated the box if needed, you can grab the SELECT tool and drag the marquee over the modifier box and the object so they are selected together and turn white - then choose BUILD at the top menu - then MODIFIERS and in the sub window you select BIND MODIFIER. Now the box is locked to your object, but nothing has happened. Next double click your modifier box and a window will pop-up allowing you to enter values. After you enter your values and hit OK, the modifier will bend, twist, or whatever you have chosen. To have an object bend in the opposite direction just put a minus before the number, example -45. Save often and experiment with different values. If you find that your box doesn't seem to be oriented right, you can go back to the top menu and choose UNBIND MODIFIER, now the yellow box will separate from the object as it was in the beginning and you can move the box around, or rotate it, or scale it. After you tweak, don't forget to BIND AGAIN. A subtle, quirky thing is to make the yellow box wide enough so even though the box may end mid portion of the object, if you imagine its lines continuing down, and you ensure that all of the object falls within the box (by scaling the box wider, taller etc.) you will probably be able to get the right bend you want without any weird left over distortions. It seems that the cubical influence of the modifier box extend further than the visible yellow lines, so just make sure everything in the zone of the box sort of falls within it. So why not just extend the modifier box entirely over the area to be bent - the problem with that is that everything within the box will bend uniformly. Imagine you've made a snake. Its straight as a stick after you model him. You could use the bend modifier to put some smooth bends in his body at various points, but if you put ALL of the snake inside the yellow box, he will bend in one big crescent arch. So you have to position the box over a portion of him, but as I explain making sure the although only a portion is within the yellow box, all of the snake is within the yellow box zone. What I do is use the ARCH ROTATE view tool, and move around so I can peek down into my yellow modifier box, like looking down a gun barrel, to make sure all the bits of the object fall within this box scope. As I say, you might not have problems with your modifier box and areas outside of it, but if you do, try the above. 

After you have entered your values and hit OK and the object deformed, you need to finish up the modifier session by selecting again from the TOP MENU, BUILD, then choose MODIFIERS then choose EFFECT MODIFIERS. Now you have closed the that particular modifier session and the object will forever retain that shape. You can move on to another part of your object and repeat the process. 

Someone posted an interesting tutorial on using a combination of MODIFIERS and MORPH TARGET so that you can create little movement groups and use the MORPH TARGET clips within the SCENE time line, thereby creating some sophisticated and ordered movements. Movements can as well be done with bones and joints, but using MODIFIERS and MORPH TARGET bundles is another animal and may suit your needs in particular cases better.</text>

*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 8608540;'''1996''' -- '''Final report of a phase I/II trial of hyperfractionated and accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy with carmustine for adults with supratentorial malignant gliomas. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Study 83-02.''' (Werner-Wasik M, Cancer. 1996 Apr 15;77(8):1535-43.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The use of HF with BCNU and dose escalation up to 81.6 Gy is both feasible and tolerable, although late toxicity increases slightly with increasing dose. The best MST with the least toxicity were observed for AA in the lower received HF doses (72 and 64.8 Gy). Accordingly, 72 Gy in two 1.2 Gy fractions was used as the investigational arm of a completed Phase III trial (RTOG 90-06). In contrast, for GBM patients, longer survival times were noted in the higher received HF doses (78.6 and 81.6 Gy), suggesting the role for further dose escalation. The low toxicity rate with AHF arms suggest that further dose escalation is possible and is currently occurring in RTOG 94-11.&quot;

(Scott CB, Cancer.  1995 Jul 15;76(2):307-13.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This examination of a central versus an institutional pathology review demonstrates a low level of agreement on AAF classification and a high level of concordance on GBM classification. The results indicate the need to adjust sample size for trials of both AAF and GBM tumors to have adequate statistical power. A central pathology review remains essential for trial entry for patients with AAF and could be omitted for trials enrolling patients with GBM only.&quot;
**PMID 7852106; '''1995''' -- '''Quality-adjusted survival analysis of malignant glioma.

(Murray KJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Feb 1;31(3):453-9.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;This quality-adjusted survival methodology can be successfully applied to malignant glioma patients and permits a quantitative assessment of the influence of investigational therapies on patient quality of life. This analysis confirms the potential benefit of intermediate dose (72.0 Gy) hyperfractionated RT for selected malignant glioma patients.&quot;

(Corn BW, Cancer.  1994 Nov 15;74(10):2828-35.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;A well described toxicity scale for white matter injury was applied successfully to patients with malignant glioma treated with definitive irradiation. Severe white matter changes continued to increase significantly as the total dose of hyperfractionated cranial irradiation was escalated. The time to onset of the white matter abnormalities appeared to be independent of dose. An ongoing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study will allow correlation of white matter injury with prospective neuropsychometric testing.&quot;

{{Wikijunior article stub}}
== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Islam is the second-largest religion in the world and one of the fastest-growing religions, with about 1.5 billion Muslims (followers of Islam) in the world (more than 20% of the world's population).     

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Islam is practiced in Arabia, North Africa many parts of Asia and some parts of south-east [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]].

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Allah is the god of Islam. The major prophet in Islam is Muhammad. The Islamic Messiah(Man sent from Allah)is Isa.
The Pillars of Islam are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all Muslims. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the shahadah (creed), (2) daily prayers (salat), (3) almsgiving (zakah), (4) fasting during the month of Ramadan and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) which has to be made at least once in a lifetime. The Shia and Sunni sects both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts:

# The Shahadah, which is the basic creed of Islam that must be recited under oath with the specific statement: &quot;'ašhadu 'al-lā ilāha illā-llāhu wa 'ašhadu 'anna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh&quot;, or &quot;I testify that there is none worthy of worship except God and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&quot; This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the shahadah in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.
# Salah, or ritual prayer, which must be performed five times a day.
# Sawm, or fasting during the month of Ramadan. Muslims must not eat or drink (among other things) from dawn to dusk during this month, and must be mindful of other sins.
# Zakat, or alms-giving, which is giving a fixed portion of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy, and also to assist the spread of Islam.
# The Hajj, which is the pilgrimage during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the city of Mecca. Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime.

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==
The Qur'an (also spelled as ''Koran'') is the holy book of Islam. Muslims consider it as &quot;The Word of Allah (God)&quot;.

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Plugin Question Requirement==

Plugin Questions need to follow certain rules very closely in order to function correctly within the Question Writer environment.

===Plugin Question Specification===

Plugin Questions are Flash components and are created in exactly the same way. If you are not familiar with creating Flash MX components, there is a good tutorial at

http://www.flashcomponents.net/tutorials/triangle/triangle.html

===Constructor===

The following values are made available in the constructor:

this._maxScore (String, points for fully correct answer)

this._isFeedback (String, either true or false, indicates whether feedback is being displayed)

this._responseid (String, response name)

this._listener (String, path to listener)


For each response option, a symbol id will be provided in the variables, 

this._option0, this._option1, this._option2 and so on.


For each response option, an identifier will be provided as Strings in the variables,

this._option0ident, this._option1ident, this._option2ident, and so on.


A number of tabIndex values will be provided as Strings in the variables,

this._option0TabIndex, this._option1TabIndex and so on.


Also, for each response option, an accessibility String will be provided in the variables,

this._option0access, this._option1access, this. _option2access, and so on

The name/value pairs specified in the parameters of the Plugin Question are also made available in the constructor. All the values are provided as strings.

===Requirements===

Your component should implement the following methods.

'''isFullyAnswered()'''

This method should return a boolean, true/false. It is primarily used when the user is required to answer all the questions on a page. Question Writer will use this method to ask the Plugin Question if the question can be regarded as being in a 'fully answered' state. Note, this state has nothing to do with the answer being correct, just that a full attempt has been made.

'''getAnswers()'''

This method should return an Array of Strings containing the score as the first element of the array followed by the current response(s) in subsequent elements of the array. If the responses relate to the options that have been passed into the question, the strings that represent these options are available in the constructor as the variables, this._option0ident, this._option1ident, this. _option2ident, etc.

If you aren't using options as your answers, then it is fine to return meaningful string(s) as the response(s). This must return an array of Strings - even if the question deals with numbers, it should convert those values to strings before returning them as answers.

The plugin should also use this function to store the answers to be used when question feedback is provided. It can do this by calling this method:
 
this.respObject.setPair(this._responseid+&quot;answers&quot;,answerArray);
 
'''setAnswers(Array)'''

This method should set the state of the Plugin Question based on the answers in the Array. This array will either send an empty array (when no attempt has yet been made on the question), or will return the Array that it had previously received when calling the 'getAnswers' method.

If the plugin is shown as feedback, it must access the answers from a stored location using the following method,

 
answerArray=this.respObject.getPairValue(this._responseid+&quot;answers&quot;);

　

A final requirement is that your Plugin Question should call this code when the state of the component changes.

eval(this._listener).updateFlash(this._responseid);

===Sequence of events===

This is the order in which events happen when the Plugin Question is placed on screen.

#The user clicks the next button and moves onto a page that contains the question.
#Question Writer places the question on screen, calling the Plugin Question's constructor.
#Question Writer calls the setAnswers(Array) method. If this is the first time this instance is appearing on screen, the Array will be empty.
#The user makes an attempt at the question
#The question calls 'eval(this._listener).updateFlash(this._responseid);'
#Question Writer calls 'getAnswer()' method and stores the array.
#Repeat steps 4 – 6 many times.
#The user clicks 'next' to move out of the page.
#Question Writer removes the question from the screen, destroying all information apart from the last answers array, which it stores.

===Packaging===

To package your component, first need to create a blank flash file. Drag your component onto the stage and then delete it. Your component should then be present in the library. Compile the flash file (as version 8 or less) as a .swf and this file is your finished Plugin Question.

===Filename===

The filename must be the same name as the symbol used for the Flash component plus the file extension (.swf).  The filename also contains additional parameters, as per the following example.

QWPQ-0-20-0-ComboBoxV1_7.swf

'''First Parameter''': (0) - This tells Question Writer how much on-screen space to allow for the Plugin Question. It should have a value of either:
0 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate as much space as the largest option requires

1 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate as much space as the first option requires

2 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate enough space to display all the options

3 - To indicate that Question Writer should not allocate any space based on the option sizes

'''Second Parameter''': (20) - This is the number of additional pixels in width that QW understands your component to require.

'''Third Parameter''': (0) - This is the number of additional pixels in height that QW understands your component to require.

　

===Identification===

To make your component easy to use, you can change the dimensions of your flash file to 200x200 and add the following actionscript to the first frame in the main timeline to identify the symbol name, version and copyright information:

Note: It is best to make the check (this._parent==null), rather than (this==_root) as _root is replaced by Question Writer.

if(this._parent==null){
this.createTextField(&quot;version&quot;, 10, 0, 0, 200, 200);
this.version.multiline = true;
this.version.wordWrap = true;
this.version.text = &quot;Symbol: QWPQ-0-20-0-ComboBoxV1_7.swf\nVersion 1.0\nCopyright
2003-2010 Central Question Ltd.&quot;;
}

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |The '''plugin question type''' allows for an unlimited number of question types. Anything that can be programmed in Flash (up to version 8) can be used as a question type. Plugin Questions allow you to ask any type of question, with any type of layout or display, and any type of scoring logic. 

Plugin Questions can also use content that is entered in Question Writer. This means that a programmer is only required to create the initial question type – the content can be supplied through the usual Question Writer interface. And once a Plugin Question is created, it can be used over and over again in different quizzes

Three sample Plugin Questions are provided with Question Writer. Check in the samples directory to open the 'PluginQuestions.qwz' file in Question Writer. View the quiz here[[http://www.questionwritertracker.com/index.php/quiz/display?id=6077&amp;token=P6PGB9ZK]], to see how the questions integrate seamlessly into a quiz.{{clr}}
|}


[[File:QW Plugin.PNG|center]]


Plugin Questions are created as .swf files - this file contains all the layout code and scoring logic. Question Writer then provides the file with the parameters and options of the question. Take the Horizontal Slider Plugin Question provided with Question Writer for example. 


[[File:QW Plugin parameters.PNG|center]]


The parameters are used to tell it the maximum and minimum values that the slider can take and whether to display the slider's current value. The first option is used to provide a background graphic, and the second option is used to provide the slider button. In this way, the Plugin Question is programmed once, but virtually any type of slider can be created with it using the parameters and options.

To create your own Plugin Question, you'll need the services of a Flash programmer. The interface is described in [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Plugins/Plugin Interface|Plugin Question Requirements]], and you can also download the source code (.fla) to a sample Plugin Question (The Cycle Plugin Question) as a basis to work from [[http://www.questionwriter.com/downloads/QWPQ-0-0-0-CycleV1_2.zip]].

{{closed|Closed as {{keep}}.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:07, 23 May 2010 (UTC)}}As per [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1794200#The_Nature_of_Angelic_Beings above].  Original research and point of view problems. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:03, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Keep}} There are four content pages linked from the main page. From these, only [[The Ten Commandments/Do Not Covet]] strikes me as wholly unacceptable POV - and note the bulk of the text was not written by the same editors responsible for the rest of the book. The other pages are, in spite of being written from a Judeo-Christian perspective, quite reasonable actually. There are other annoying - but theoretically correctable - issues, such as the lack of references and the thinness of the contents. All things considered, take my position as a weak keep. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:59, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Keep}}  I find the fact that the book attempts to address multiple religions speaks a long way to its attempt at NPOV.  The fact it discusses specifics of translations without reference is very problematic.  It is also quite a stalled stub, and has not received any attention for a few years.  If this pattern continues I could see deleting it at some point in the future. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:43, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' - I believe that in this case a POV cleanup would be rather difficult, and giving it time to improve probably won't help much, in my opinion.

Even though it were empty (which it's not) the creator ([[User:PAC]] who has several hundred edits to [[R Programming]] and continues to [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/R_Programming|contribute]] under the username [[User:PAC2]]) saw it as useful. Since the book is still active, I suggest taking this up with the book contributors first. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:22, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' as the page creator and major book contributor agrees. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

I quote the User PAC here from the talk page:

&lt;nowiki&gt;== Speedy deletion ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I agree with the speedy deletion of this page 

[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]]) 08:24, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

There is already consensus that Wikipedia's Reference desk is the correct place for asking questions.

My favorite quote from the last discussion ''I mean, whoever saw books automatically answering people's questions!'' by Kayau. 

--[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 03:56, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: Considering [[User_talk:PAC2#Request for deletion|this message]] written a couple hours ago it can only be assumed that Swift had not seen the &quot;I agree&quot; message from PAC2 and therefore set out to ask for his input, in perfectly good faith. No need to make a war about that... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 04:35, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Its hard to assume good faith, as it seemed to me Swift did not read [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] before opposing on all Q&amp;A. Regardless, I will Take a break from editing ''Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion'' for a few days. As this will be my last message here, WB:RFD, for a few days, I will take the opportunity to apologize to Swift, for any misgivings that may be construed. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 05:21, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: 33rogers, you're misunderstanding the point of [[WB:AGF]]. The idea is to go beyond what seems to you and assume good faith regardless. The reason for this is that based on limited information we often draw false conclusions regarding the intent of others. In some cases emotions even lead us astray and skew our rationality.
:::: The trigger seems to be that you believe that I hadn't read the discussion on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] before taking part in the discussion. The logical flaw in that conclusion appears to be that you believe one can only come from that discussion with one view. You furthermore make the mistaken assumption that a (prematurely closed) discussion on the deletion of a single page somehow demonstrates community consensus on where to ask questions (whether this applies only to WikiMedia projects or the wider Internet community is unclear). Quite on the contrary, there are comments noting both that these are well within scope (Adrignola) and potentially useful (Panic2k4).
:::: You then seem to argue that I had ignored the note on the talk page from the user and my note on [[User talk:PAC2]] somehow supports your view that I was not acting in good faith. At this point you're not making any sense at all.
:::: &quot;''[...] I will take the opportunity to apologize to Swift, for any misgivings that may be construed.''&quot; After your thinly veiled allegation of bad faith, don't cut your break short on my account. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Again, I agree with the deletion of the page [[:R Programming/Q&amp;A]]. [[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]]) 08:30, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

'''Speedy delete''' requested by creator who is also the only notable contributor. If you don't count the person who asked a question. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:13, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' As far as I'm concerned, this now satisfies the [[WB:SPEEDY]] criteria and can be deleted without further delay but will leave that up to a less involved admin. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::Agreed and done. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:08, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

If you have the '''Professional''' version of Question Writer you can add your own background images (or piece of Flash) in place of the Quiz Background, Loader Background or Finished Background images found in the theme. See also [[../../../Look and Feel/Change Background and Loader|Background Image]] for more information about the images you can use.{{clr}}

This section allows you to use HTML or a variety of embedded fonts (selected from a drop down box) and to select a different font  or font size for your title or body text to replace the default fonts set up within the theme used.

[[Image:QWText settings2.jpg|center]]


===Use HTML To Format Text===
In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 this option can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

When this option is switched on, you can change the way text is displayed by using HTML formatting. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags bold. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags italic. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Arial Red at point size 24&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags point size 24, color red, font face Arial. Relative sizes can be used - eg -2,-1,+1,+2 to make the text relatively larger or smaller. Absolute sizes can be used also - eg 36. Absolute sizes smaller than 8 are treated as HTML sizes (1 is very small, 7 is very large). Font colors can be HTML colors(red, yellow, white etc) or RGB style colors (color=&quot;#FFCCFF&quot;) 


[[Image:QW3 Using html1.jpg|left]]


[[Image:QW3 Using html2.jpg|right]]

{{clear}}
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Center Alignment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This causes a new paragraph to be created and any text in that paragraph to be aligned in the center. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates a new line.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;
E = MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a superscript.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt;
The chemical symbol for Oxygen is 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a subscript

HTML formatting can be used in all text fields with one exception - it cannot be applied to the text that appears on next and back buttons.

===Respect Newlines in HTML===

If you are using the ''' Professional''' version of Question writer you can tick this box is ticked so that you can use HTML text formatting but still respect newlines in the text.


===Optimize Text for Small Screens===
Ticking this box is especially useful for small fonts and small screens like mobile devices.{{clr}}
|}

===Embed Font===
In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 this option can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

When the quiz taker enters text at the keyboard, the quiz can either use a system font or (with this option checked) an embedded font. Using an embedded font guarantees that the font will be used and the chosen characters will be available. You can ensure that all the letters and accents that a user might want to enter are embedded by choosing the right character set for the quiz taker's language.

The embedded font is used in the Fill in the Blank and Essay style questions. It is also used when the user is prompted for Name/UserID at the start of the quiz.

For text entry in Japanese and other languages with large character sets, it is usually better to switch off this option as the number of characters is very large and leads to a very large file size.

In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 these options (apart from Override Body Text Font Color) can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

[[File:QW Body text font.jpg|center]]

===Override Body Text Font===
By ticking the box and selecting a font you can override the default font used in the theme, for example if you want to customize the appearance of the quiz

===Override Body Text Font Size===

You can override the default font size used in the body text.  This might be useful eg if you have particularly long questions and have trouble fitting them on to a single page.

If you are using the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4, these options (apart from the Override Title Text Font Color) can be found in Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings.
 

[[Image:QW Title text font.jpg|center]]


===Override Title Text Font===

Each theme defines a different font to use in the quiz for titles - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.


===Override Title Text Font Size===

As well as changing the font used you can also change the default font size for the titles.  This could be useful eg if you want to display your quiz using an OHP and need to make sure everyone in the room can read the text.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to insert an empty, 1px wide, table cell into an HTML table or wikitable.  It can be used whenever an empty cell is required to balance a table, for instance when hardcoding mbox templates.

This template takes no parameters.

=== Technical details ===

Most browsers are not so picky about balancing the table. However some are. For instance in Safari you can get partly missing left or right border of the table if some table rows do not contain the right number of table cells.
&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS HERE, THANKS --&gt;

==What is this thing?==
Perlwikibot is a bot framework, similar to [[Pywikibot]], except it's written in [[Subject:Perl programming language|Perl]].

==Does that mean you're trying to make pywikibot obsolete?==
Of course not! Pywikibot is a valuable bot framework (the Tawkerbot2 code, as well as most major bots, are written using it), however, if Perl coders are confined to using Python, they can't customize and extend the code to fit their needs. With an open-source framework written in their &quot;native language,&quot; they'll be able to better write bots in a language that they are comfortable with, and even customize the framework to fit needs it wasn't originally imagined for.

==How complete is perlwikipedia?==
Perlwikibot is almost completely cross-wiki, so you can write bots for virtually any [[MediaWiki]] wiki with it. As of version 5.005007, Perlwikibot does not support WikiData-specific queries or edits. 

===Editing and querying wikis===
* Retrieve the wikitext of articles, sections, and old revisions
* Edit pages
* Retrieve the history of articles
* Revert to old revisions of articles (manually, with undo, or with rollback)
* Retrieve the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] log
* Retrieve [[Special:WhatLinksHere|backlinks and transclusions]]
* Purge page caches
* Retrieve a listing of all pages in a category
* Run [[Special:Linksearch|linksearches]]

===Admin functions===
* Deleting and undeleting pages
* Blocking and unblocking users
* Protecting and unprotecting pages
* Performing transwiki imports (XML upload is in the works)

== Installation ==
The [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MediaWiki::Bot latest stable version] can be installed from [[w:CPAN|CPAN]]:
 user@host:~$ cpan
 cpan&gt; install MediaWiki::Bot
 ...

Or download from [http://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/downloads/list] and install it like you would any other Perl module:
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 sudo make install

=== Development versions ===
The latest unstable source code can be acquired from [https://github.com/MediaWiki-Bot/MediaWiki-Bot the github repo]. 

  &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/MediaWiki-Bot/MediaWiki-Bot.git&lt;/code&gt;

Unlike pywikibot, we ''do not'' recommend using the unstable source tree for production.

==Who wrote perlwikibot?==
perlwikibot is maintained by [[w:User:ST47|ST47]], [[w:User:Shadow1|Shadow1]], [[w:User:Jmax-|Jmax-]], [[w:User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]], and [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]].

==Can I help?==
Sure! Check out the [https://openhatch.org/+projects/Perlwikibot OpenHatch page] for ways to get started, or jump into the [https://github.com/MediaWiki-Bot/MediaWiki-Bot/issues list of issues] and start hacking!

== Parameters ==
All parameters are optional.

; name: name of software (Note: If you don't put the right thing here it breaks the latest release / latest preview fields when &quot;frequently updated&quot; is enabled. If you want the title at the top of the infobox to be different than the software templates, use the &quot;title&quot; parameter instead.)
; title: title
; logo: logo
; screenshot: screenshot image
; caption: caption for screenshot
; collapsible: can be set to &quot;yes&quot; in case of long vertical screenshot
; author: original author of the program
; developer: current developer of the program
; released: the release date of version 1.0 (or closely-matching release). For subsequent or prior releases, use &lt;code&gt;latest release date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Can use {{tl|Start date}} template.
; discontinued: whether this product is no longer being developed (changes the words 'Latest release' to 'discontinued).  Any value will do, though 'yes' or 'true' are preferred for clarity.  Use the last release version and date in the 'latest release' parameters, below.
; latest release version: latest released version number 
; latest release date: release date of the latest released version; suggested use of {{tl|Start date and age}} template
; latest preview version: version number of preview version or development branch
; latest preview date: preview date; suggested use of {{tl|Start date and age}} template
; frequently updated: if set to &quot;yes&quot;, latest release/preview date and version have to be defined in subtemplate by clicking the numbers directly in the infobox (make sure the &quot;name&quot; parameter above exactly matches the name of the subtemplate pages)
; programming language: programming language
; operating system: operating system.  For Unix-like multi-OS programs use: Any Unix-like
; platform: (Java, .NET).  For multi-platform programs use: Cross-platform
; size: in megabytes
; language: natural language (English, French)
; status: Should probably be one of: Planned, Active, Unmaintained, Discontinued, Abandonware
; genre: Type of program.  Probably wikilinked to an article such as Geographic information system.
; license: License such as &lt;code&gt;proprietary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;GPL&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Pick either ''license'' (American English) or ''licence'' (Commonwealth English), not both - select the one which matches the content of the article the template is used in.
; website: Web site of software package.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==Usage==
This template returns a date, or date-time. It also includes the same date (and time) duplicated in a hidden (by CSS) ISO date format, for use in [[w:microformat|microformat]]s. This hidden date degrades gracefully when CSS is not available.

==Syntax==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|year|month|day}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|year|month|day|HH|MM|SS|TimeZone}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (MM and SS are optional; TimeZone may be a numerical value, or &quot;Z&quot; for [[w:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]; see examples)

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||+01:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||+01:00}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||-07:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||-07:00}}&quot;
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|Z}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|Z}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|+01:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|+01:00}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|-07:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|-07:00}}&quot;

An optional parameter, df, can be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; (or indeed any value) to display the day before the month. This is primarily used in articles about events in parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date.

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|df=y}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|df=y}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|df=yes}}&quot;

'''Note:''' The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank (as seen above).

|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
|''yyyy''
|Four digits indicating the year in question. The year must always appear in a 4-digits form.
|-
|''mm''
|A number between 1 to 12, indicating the month. Leading zeros in the number are ignored.
|-
|''dd''
|A number between 1 to 31, indicating the day of the month. Leading zeros in the number are ignored.
|-
|'''df='''
|The optional parameter '''df''' can either be set to '''yes''' or anything other than '''yes'''. When set to '''yes''', date will be displayed in DMY format: Day appears to the left, month in the middle and year to the right. When set something other than '''yes''' or when this parameter is not included, date will be displayed in MD,Y format: Month appears to the left, day appears in the middle, a comma follows the day and finally year appears to the right.

As for choosing the right format to use, consult [[Wikipedia:MOSNUM#Full date formatting|Manual of Style (dates and numbers): Full date formatting]].
|-
|'''br='''
|The optional parameter '''br''' can either be set to '''yes''' or anything other than '''yes'''. When set to '''yes''', a line break will be inserted between the date and the age. When set something other than '''yes''' or when this parameter is not included, a breaking space will be inserted between the date and the age. In either case, a semicolon separates the date and age, immediately before the line break or space.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template returns a date, or date-time. It also include the same date (and time) duplicated in a hidden (by CSS) ISO date format, for use in [[w:microformat|microformat]]s. This hidden date degrades gracefully when CSS is not available.

===Syntax===

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|year|month|day}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24|08|30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24|08|30}}&quot;

An optional parameter, df, can be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; (or indeed any value) to display the day before the month. This is primarily used in pages about events in parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date.

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24|df=yes}}&quot;

These templates ('''{{tl|Birth date}}''' and '''{{tl|Birth date and age}}''') return a person’s date of birth and optionally his/her age.

&lt;big style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;Do NOT use this template when the person’s exact date of birth is disputed or unknown.&lt;/big&gt;

Using this template rather than simply inserting the date into articles allows for the inclusion of hidden metadata about the date. This metadata can be used by web browsers and other software tools to extract the details, and display them using some other website or mapping tool, index or search them.

=== Syntax ===
==== To display the birth date only ====

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|year of birth|month of birth|day of birth|additional parameters}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Do not use with non-Gregorian dates''' because the resulting hCard hidden date will be false.

==== To display a birth date with calculated age ====
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|year of birth|month of birth|day of birth|additional parameters}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''This form is only intended for living persons.''' In the rare case that a living person's birth date is given in a non-Gregorian calendar this template should not be used. The parameter names 'year', 'month', and 'day' can be used instead of the first, second, and third parameters for 'Birth date and age' only. These parameter names are not available for the 'Birth date' template.

Examples:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|df=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}

=== Month First (mf) and Day First (df) options ===

The '''df''' (day first) and '''mf''' (month first) parameters indicate the intended date format to display. The appropriate parameter should be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''mf=y'''.

The default output of this template is to display the month before the day. This default may not be appropriate for articles about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date. In such articles the parameter, &quot;df&quot;, should be set to display the day before the month.

The parameter &quot;mf&quot;, while not actually used by the template, will indicate that month first format is intended. Using these parameters can assist bots or other automated processing to detect which date format is intended; leaving the format as default may lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value.

Do not specify both &quot;df&quot; and &quot;mf&quot; parameters in the same use of the template, as these formats are mutually exclusive.

Examples:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;.

=== See also ===
*{{tl|Death date and age}} &amp;ndash; same as {{tl|Death date}}, except that &quot;(aged ##)&quot; appears after the death date
*{{tl|Death date}} &amp;ndash;  displays the date and related hidden metadata

__NOTOC__
Returns a person's date of death and age at that date.

&lt;big style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;Do NOT use this template when the person's exact date of birth or death is disputed or unknown.&lt;/big&gt;

=== Syntax ===
==== To display the death date with age ====
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''year of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''month of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''day of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''year of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''month of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''day of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|''additional parameters''}}&lt;/tt&gt;

; Format:
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|yyyy|mm|dd|yyyy|mm|dd|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|yyyy|mm|dd|yyyy|mm|dd|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== Examples ====
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; returns {{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; returns {{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}

'''Note''': The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank.

=== Day First (df) and Month First options ===
The '''df''' (day first) parameter indicates the intended date format to display. It is switched on by setting it to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''df=y'''.

The default output of this template is the month before the day (American-based style). This default may not be appropriate in pages about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date (e.g. Europe). In such cases the parameter df should be set.

It is possible to use similar parameter &quot;mf&quot; to stress the month-first format so that relying on the default does not lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value; however, it is ignored by the template itself. (So, should both parameters be mistakenly used at once, df takes precedence.)

Examples:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt; displays &quot;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt; displays &quot;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&quot;

Using this template rather than simply inserting the date into articles allows for the inclusion of hidden metadata about the date.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date|1993|2|4|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Death date|1993|2|4|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date|1993|2|4|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Death date|1993|2|4|mf=yes}}&quot;

'''Note''': The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank.

=== Day First (df) and Month First (mf) options===
The '''df''' (day first) and '''mf''' (month first) parameters indicate the intended date format to display. The appropriate parameter should be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''mf=y'''.

The default output of this template is to display the month before the day (American-based style). This default may not be appropriate articles about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date (e.g. Europe). In such articles the parameter, &quot;df&quot;, should be set to display the day before the month.

The parameter &quot;mf&quot; will indicate that month first format is intended. Using these parameters can assist [[WP:BOT|bots]] or other automated processing to detect which date format is intended; leaving the format as default may lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value.

Do not specify both &quot;df&quot; and &quot;mf&quot; parameters in the same use of the template, as these formats are mutually exclusive.

Examples:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date | 1993 | 2 | 24 | df=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays &quot;24 February 1993&quot;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date | 1993 | 2 | 24 | mf=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays &quot;February 24, 1993&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Fact, the annotated code on the eclipselink implementation did not generate FKs btw the entity table and the collection table. I wonder why it happens. By the way, no PK is generated either, what can be a headache if you intend to design the database from the ORM mappings....

:Foreign key constraints should be generated, although the JPA does not require this (or schema creation in general).  Sounds like a bug in EclipseLink's schema creation.  Please log a bug on EclipseLink for this.  As for the primary keys, JPA does not define an Id for Embeddables, so defining a primary key would be difficult.  EclipseLink does allow defining a primary key on Embeddables used in an ElementCollection, so this may work.

== Section on calling files in other directories ==

I wonder if this section should not be moved to a separate item, since the information contained here is common to any command which calls another file (e.g. graphicx commands)? Also, the reference to *nix may be too cryptic for some of the readership this manual addresses. This section could thus be reduced to a single-sentence reference to a more complete and generally useful section.

==Sub folders issue==
Trying to implement subfiles example I encounter a problem. If you put your subfiles in subdirectories e.g. chapter 1, chapter 2 etc and use this subfiles to call subsubfiles (this may seem peculiar but it normal if you have a plot in chapter 1 and want to call it with \includegraphics{./plot.pdf}) when you try to compile the chapter 1 tex file it works ok but if you go on and try to compile the main tex file you will end up with an error &quot;./plot.pdf&quot; not found. This is most probably because the main tex file and the chapter1.tex are in different directories.

==Moved chapter==
This chapter was previously called General Guidelines and I could never figure out what it was supposed to contain, I renamed it to Modular Documents, which is actually 95% of the chapter. I moved the last 5% (the last paragraph) to the programming part. I left a link to the Macros chapter in the Basic chapter so that first time readers will get to know how much macros are important. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 14:28, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

It might be a good idea to incorporate data from [http://en.flossmanuals.net/Blender/Introduction| this FLOSS Manual].  It's GPL, so that shouldn't be a problem.  The [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page| Blender Wiki] could also be useful, and it's under the Open Content License.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Version==

It is unclear what version of the program is being used here; the screenshot looks slightly different from my install of 0.46 (but that could just be OS/personal preference differences). I think there is a need for guidelines with respect to software versions (especially unfinished software) and guides to said software. With 0.47 out now a lot of information will become obsolete or inaccurate, and this is a potential problem that can be prevented with proper guidelines. I'm going to start a discussion on this in the reading room as well. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 02:30, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that it doesn't seem to completely fall under anything in [[WB:SPEEDY]]. Specifically, under criteria #5 it should go to [[WB:RFD|RFD]], but on the other hand it's ''not actually CSD'd yet''. Granted, it doesn't seem like this module has much hope so maybe it should go to RFD sooner, but the template used does give 7 days before it gets CSD'd and it's only been a bit more than 2.

I've found two orphaned pages that are not linked anywhere in page text:
*[[A Quick Introduction to Unix/Links]]
*[[A Quick Introduction to Unix/Starting a Unix terminal]]

{{User:Xerol/OrphanNotice}}

I have added A Quick Introduction to Unix/TODO to outline planned expansions/additions.[[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|talk]]) 10:41, 13 October 2010 (UTC)


I have reverted the status of this wikibook to 75% after it was changed.  Looking at the todo list, the purpose of the wikibook, the title of the wikibook and the state of the wikibook I remain convinced that this is the correct status.  Wikibooks are collective efforts, so while I initiated this book; designed it; wrote most of the content, I understand that others may take different views.  Could I ask that if the status is changed the wikipedian *explains* the change so that I can understand why I should revert it to reflect my view of the completion status?

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you insert a random complex rational function in a fractal program, it is very unlikely that you will find an interesting locality in the Mandelbrot set. But sometimes you will witness a startling spectacle when you zoom in. And this is usually where two domains of different structures meet each other.

If you come across an interesting formula, then let the rest of us see it. You can here write the formula and the coordinates of the locality, and show a picture. You should also state the critical points, however you can neglect this, if you use ∞ and a real point of smallest numerical value, or if you (in case of iterations towards finite cycles) use two conjugate complex numbers of largest distance.

You should fell free to remove formulas that clearly have been surpassed by others.

:&lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + z^4/4 + c&lt;/math&gt; c = (0.7, 1.3)
:&lt;math&gt;1 - z^2 + z^5/(2 + 4z) + c&lt;/math&gt; c = (-0.163, 0.085)

Und wüßten's die Blumen, die kleinen,
wie tief verwundet mein Herz,
sie würden mit mir weinen
zu heilen meinen Schmerz.

Und wüßten's die Nachtigallen,
wie ich so traurig und krank,
sie ließen fröhlich erschallen
erquickenden Gesang.

Und wüßten sie mein Wehe,
die goldenen Sternelein,
sie kämen aus ihrer Höhe,
und sprächen Trost mir ein.

Die alle können's nicht wissen,
nur Eine kennt meinen Schmerz;
sie hat ja selbst zerrissen,
zerrissen mir das Herz.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
And if they knew it, the blooms, the little ones,
how deeply wounded my heart is,
they would weep with me
to heal my pain.
 
And if they knew it, the nightingales,
how I am so sad and sick,
they would loose the merry sound
of refreshing song.
 
And if they knew my pain,
the golden little stars,
they would descend from their heights
and would comfort me.
 
All of them cannot know it,
only one knows my pain,
she herself has indeed torn,
torn up my heart.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding License Information to a media in WikiCommons ==

Hello,

I added a file by name Shekar.jpg yesterday and forgot to add license information to it. Now I can see that it is asking me to add license information to the file to prevent it from getting deleted, but I am not able to do that. Please help me. I donot want the file to get deleted. Thanks

:If you take a look at [[WB:MEDIA]], you will see information on the basics.  You can see the full list of license tags at [[commons:Commons:Copyright tags|Commons:Copyright tags]].  Be sure to do that at [[commons:File:Shekar.jpg]] and not at Wikibooks, though.  In the future, the upload wizard at Commons will help you to select the correct license automatically. If you can't figure out the license that applies, you can ask the experts at [[commons:Commons:Help desk|Commons:Help desk]].  I hope that gets you pointed in the right direction. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:51, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

Unregistered user [[Special:Contributions/208.75.10.42|208.75.10.42]] has repeatedly added this link in spite of being warned. I think the link overnightpools.com should be blacklisted and the user possibly blocked. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:15, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this topic, students learn and enhance their knowledge about how to be an astronaut! Yes, they will be taught about that cool suit they will wear and the great feelings and experiences of landing on such surfaces like the moon. However, this topic contains an element of challenge as students are encouraged to research an astronaut and then give extended responses on their favourite type of chocolate cake. Yum, cake.

      <comment>/* The &quot;Stinchcomb Principles&quot; */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The Crown must disclose all materials information that is in its possession or control that is not clearly irrelevant, regardless of if the evidence is to be called at trial or is inculpatory or exculpatory.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Stinchcombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp 1991 CanLII 45] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 326 at 339 and 343 (Stinchcombe #1)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Stinchcombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frl8 1995 CanLII 130] (SCC), [1995] 1 SCR 754 at 755 (Stinchcombe #2)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wickstead, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr47 1997 CanLII 370], [1997] 1 SCR 307&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to disclosure is founded in the principle of fair play between parties&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lemay [1952] 1 SCR 232; R. v. Boucher, [1955] SCR 16&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the right to make full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
s.650(3)&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
:'''To make defence'''&lt;br&gt;
::(3) An accused is entitled, after the close of the case for the prosecution, to make full answer and defence personally or by counsel.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Right to make full answer and defence'''&lt;br&gt;
802. (1) The prosecutor is entitled personally to conduct his case and the defendant is entitled to make his full answer and defence.
&lt;P&gt;
R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, stated disclosure by the crown is &quot;one of the components of the right to make full answer and defence which in turn is a principle of fundamental justice embraced by s. 7 of the Charter.&quot;&lt;Br&gt;
See also:R. v. Wood (1989) OntCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has an obligation to obtain from an investigative agency any relevant information that it is aware of and must &quot;take reasonable step to inquire about ...relevant information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Darwish [2010] O.J. No. 604 (C.A.) at para 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligation also requires the Crown to preserve all relevant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R v La [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), at para 17&lt;/ref&gt;

This obligation is jointly held by both Crown and police.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] para 14&lt;/ref&gt;

 
The &quot;Stinchcombe disclosure regime&quot; only applies to &quot;material relating to the accused’s case&quot; that are &quot;in the possession or control&quot; of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==The &quot;Stinchcombe Principles&quot;==
The Martin Committee produced a report considering the decision. The report detailed the principles of the case, at p. 146:
# The fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of the Crown are not the property of the Crown for the use in securing a conviction, but, rather, are the property of the public to ensure that justice is done. Stinchcomb, at para. 12
# The general principle is that all relevant information must be disclosed, whether or not the Crown intends to introduce it in evidence. The Crown must disclose relevant information, whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory, and must produce all information which may assist the accused. If the information is of no use, then it is irrelevant and will be excluded by Crown counsel in the exercise of the Crown's discretion, which is reviewable by the trial judge.

{{reflist|2}}

==Defence Raising Disclosure Issues==
The duty to disclose is engaged once the accused requests information from the crown any time after the charge has been laid. &lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe #1 at 342&lt;/ref&gt;
If defence fails to raise the issue and remains passive, they are less able to claim that non-disclosure affected trial fairness.&lt;ref&gt;R v Dixon at 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence have an obligation to diligently pursue disclosure by actively seeking and pursuing disclosure once they become aware or ought to have been aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stinchcombe #1 at 341; Dixon 1998 CanLII 805 at para 37&lt;/ref&gt; This means the defence should bring any failure to disclose to the Court's attention at the earliest opportunity so that the judge can remedy any trial unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe at 341&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==When the Obligations Exist==
The Crown will only be subject to disclosure obligation where there is evidence in its possession or control ''and'' it is relevant.

===Burden===
Once the right to disclosure has been invoked by the Defence the onus is upon the Crown to comply with the obligation. The Crown may refuse to disclose certain information, but has the burden of proving why full disclosure should not be applied.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Durette, 1994 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 469 at para 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The information will not be considered disclosure where it is:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Chaplin, 1995 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 727 at para 25 (The Crown &quot;must justify non-disclosure by demonstrating either that the information sought is beyond its control, or that it is clearly irrelevant or privileged&quot;)&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. Bottineau, [2005] O.J. No. 4034 at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
# Irrelevant
# Not in the control of the Crown
# Privileged

Satisfying any one of these requirements will eliminate any disclosure obligations upon the Crown.

{{reflist|2}}
===Control===
:See also ''[[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure/Third Party Records]]''

Where evidence is not in the control of the Crown it may be the subject of a [[Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure/Third Party|third party records]] application, also known as an &quot;O'Connor Application&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frdh 1995 CanLII 51] (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an O'Connor application the Defence must show that the evidence is &quot;likely relevant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
O'Connor&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Relevance===
Not all information in possession of police must be disclosed. It must only be &quot;relevant&quot; evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Banford, 2011 SKQB 418 (CanLII), 2011 SKQB 418, [2012] 3 W.W.R. 835 at para. 5 citing Stinchcomb, among others&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;threshold question in any instance of non-disclosure is whether the evidence was relevant&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Banford, 2010 SKPC 110 (CanLII), 2010 SKPC 110, 363 Sask. R. 26 (SKPC) at para. 13
&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is upon the crown to prove that the information was &quot;clearly irrelevant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 (S.C.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance refers to whether &quot;it could reasonably be used by the defence in meeting the case for the Crown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McQuaid, 1998 CanLII 805 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 (S.C.C.) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Dixon, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805] (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at para. 20&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;That is to say there is &quot;a reasonable possibility that the information could be useful to the accused in making full answer and defence.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Banford, 2011 SKQB 418 at para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of relevancy is where there is a “reasonable possibility that the information will be useful” to the accused in making full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Egger [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs37 1993 CanLII 98], [1993] 2 SCR 451 at 467 and para 20&lt;br&gt;
R v Dixon [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805], [1998] 1 SCR 244 at 22&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Utility consists of information used for:&lt;ref&gt; Dixon at 22&lt;/ref&gt;
# meeting the case for the Crown
# advancing a defence
# influencing the defence’s trial strategy, such as the decision to call evidence 

Relevance is not limited solely to inculpatory evidence nor only evidence that the Crown would adduce at trial. &quot;Relevant materials&quot; includes all materials for which there is a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that it may be useful for the Defence. All possible exclupatory evidence must be provided as well, however, this obligation does not extend to a duty to examine the exculpatory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1zkbl 2008 BCCA 257], [2008] B.C.J. No. 1341 at paras. 13-15, and by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Darwish,  [http://canlii.ca/t/2843v 2010 ONCA 124]&lt;br&gt;, 252 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at paras. 28-30 and 39-40 leave to SCC denied&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Duration of the Obligation==
The duty is engaged upon the request of the Defendant. It is continuous throughout the proceedings up to and including the trial. The Crown may object to the request on the basis that it is irrelevant, outside of their control, or otherwise privileged.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Chaplin, [1995] 1 SCR 727&lt;/ref&gt; The burden is on the Crown to justify the refusal to disclose.

The duty to disclose is ongoing and so any new information received must also be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stinchcombe #1 at 343&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===After Verdict===
:''[[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Appeals#Fresh_Evidence|Fresh Evidence]]''

The right to disclosure may not extend to the into a conditional sentence breach hearing as there is less of a right to full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sitaram [http://canlii.ca/t/fl4r3 2011 ONCJ 199]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Specific Type of Disclosable Evidence==
Materials including statements and police notes are required to be disclosed under s. 603:
{{quotation|
603. An accused is entitled, after he has been ordered to stand trial or at his trial,
:(a) to inspect without charge the indictment, his own statement, the evidence and the exhibits, if any; and
:(b) to receive, on payment of a reasonable fee determined in accordance with a tariff of fees fixed or approved by the Attorney General of the province, a copy
::(i) of the evidence,
::(ii) of his own statement, if any, and
::(iii) of the indictment;
but the trial shall not be postponed to enable the accused to secure copies unless the court is satisfied that the failure of the accused to secure them before the trial is not attributable to lack of diligence on the part of the accused.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 603; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 101(E).|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec603 CCC]
}}

At a minimum, the Crown should disclose &quot;can say&quot; or &quot;will say&quot; statements from any witness it proposes to call at trial.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Stinchombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp 1991 CanLII 45], [1991] 3 SCR 326 at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that is in an undecipherable form, such as unlockable encrypted data, does not need to be given to defence as disclosure as the Crown cannot properly vet it for disclosable and non-disclosable information.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Beauchamp, [http://canlii.ca/t/1x5pv 2008 CanLII 27481] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
{{reflist|2}}

===Examples of Typical Disclosure===
Police compile a package of the evidence consisting of the notes, reports and statements generated during their investigation that is forwarded to the Crown Attorney's office. This usually comprises the initial disclosure package that is made available to the Defence counsel.

Disclosure packages can contain any of the following:
# the '''Information''' outlining the charges laid;
# the '''Crown Sheet''' or '''Crown Brief''' summarizing in the evidence in narative form and listing the witnesses that are available;
# the '''Police Notes''' consisting of handwritten notes made by all the officers involved in the case during their investigation;
# the '''Witness statements''' consisting of the verbatim recollection of the potential witnesses to the offence (written, audio, or video form);
# A '''Cautioned Statement''' of the accused
# the '''Criminal record''' of the accused as recorded in provincial databases or CPIC (Canadian Police Information Centre) printout;
# Copies of '''Court Orders''' (Probation Orders; Prohibition Orders; Recognizances)
# '''Expert Reports'''
# '''Certificates of analysis''' (often for breathalizer machine results; drug analysis; or firearms test results);
# the '''Medical records''' of the victim in cases of resultant injuries;
# '''Restitution claims''' where property has been lost or damaged;
# '''Photographic evidence''' often consisting of photos of the scene of the incident or injuries.

Further material requested often includes:
# '''Videos or images''' of accused while in police custody
#  computer printouts of any police database searches related to the accused
# '''Demands''' made to client by the police from a script (e.g. Charter caution, breath demand, etc) 
# '''Printed logs''' and '''audio recordings''' of police, 911 dispatch, or ambulance transmissions
# '''Notes''' of any professionals, such as doctors, ambulance crew, fire crew, etc. who was present at scene of incident
# records of testing, maintenance, usage, and calibration of breath device used by accused
# notes and reports regarding searches of accused (including strip searches)
# Police action reports: Use of Force Reports, Use of Pepper Spray Reports
# reports and materials related to police procedure on (use of force, taking statements, crowd control, parking violations, use of taser)
# discipline record of officers 
# criminal records of witnesses
# police reports regarding witnesses 
# records of outstanding charges of witnesses

{{reflist|2}}

==Vetting Disclosure==
When documents are to be released for disclosure, the police and crown are permitted to vet the materials for the purpose of removing information that may not be disclosable. Types of information that can be validly redacted from the disclosure before going out to the defence include:
# clearly irrelevant information
# information tending to identify a confidential police source
# police investigative techniques
# advice that would be covered by solicitor-client privilege (either defence counsel or crown counsel)

See further details on [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Privilege|Privilege]] section.

==Disclosing to Third Parties==
A third party request for the production of materials that are part of a proceeding must be made to the presiding judge.

Where a matter has been concluded, the superior court does not have jurisdiction to order the release or production of any documents or evidence to third party applicants.&lt;ref&gt;
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Canada (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/27gdn 2009 NSSC 400] (CanLII) upheld at [http://canlii.ca/t/2dsvw 2010 NSCA 99]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

==Police Obligations to Collect Evidence==
:''See also [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Weighing_Evidence#Lack_of_notes]]''

There is no violation of the disclosure obligation arising from a failure to collect information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hanano, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pj31 2006 MBQB 202] (CanLII) at para. 20
&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no burden on the police to record evidence of all conversations with witnesses, even important ones.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wicksted, 1996 CanLII 641 (ON CA), [1996] O.J. No. 1576, 29 O.R. (3d) 144 at p. 155:
(&quot;As pointed out by the trial judge, counsel were unable to provide him, nor were counsel able to provide this court with any Canadian authority wherein a stay was granted for the failure of investigating police officers to record conversations with important witnesses.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the handwritten notes of an officer are illegible, then the obligation of disclosure can require the crown to transcribe the notes or otherwise provide them in legible form.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bidyk, [http://canlii.ca/t/560b 2003 SKPC 124]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Abrey, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s2zz 2007 SKQB 213] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The police do not have a general obligation under collect evidence in a certain manner or create specific material disclosure and so a failure to do so would not amount to a failure to provide disclosure or impact the right to make full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s8h7 2007 MBQB 185] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Darwish&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Barnes, [http://canlii.ca/t/23mm0 2009 ONCA 432]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Incomplete notes do not breach the right to full answer and defence. As long as the majority of the officer's evidence is recorded in some fashion there will be no violation.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bailey, 2005 ABPC 61 at para. 38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The court have no authority to direct officers on how they should keep their notes.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d7cm 2007 BCSC 2029], [2007] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.) at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They should not be micromanaging the police's handling of a case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bailey, 2005 ABPC 61 at para. 38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The police have no obligation &quot;to conduct their investigation in any particular way, to record every word spoken in an interview or to take a written statement from every potential witness who is interviewed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s8h7 2007 MBQB 185] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Police are not obliged &quot;to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lees, 2011 SKPC 98, [2011] S.J. No. 507 (SKPC)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative police strategies and &quot;tactical information are presumptively not disclosable absent a particularized claim to relevance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, 2005 BCSC 1240 at para. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Lost or Destroyed Evidence==
Not every instance of negligence that results in the loss of evidence such as a video tape result in a Charter breach.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lipovetsky, 2007 ONCJ 484, [2007] O.J. No. 4135 at para. 19 (&quot;Even where there is negligence on the part of the Crown, the loss of a videotape does not automatically violate the Charter. A Charter breach is established only where the lost evidence is shown by the applicant to be relevant to the issues at trial.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Dulude [2004] O.J. No. 3576 (C.A.) at para. 30.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of evidence will not result in the a breach of duty to disclose so long as the conduct of police was reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. La [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680 at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt;

Notifying the accused ahead of destruction of property inviting inspection may cure the prejudice cause by the loss of evidence from the destruction of property.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Berner, [http://canlii.ca/t/fttg9 2012 BCCA 466] - car in collision destroyed by police prior to trial. Officer sent registered mail letter to accused prior to releasing vehicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Consequences of Breaching the Obligation==
Where relevancy is in dispute, the burden rests on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that breach of the Charter right to disclosure has been violated.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R .411 (S.C.C)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R 651 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a breach of the right to full disclosure is found it does not necessarily follow that the right to make full answer and defence was violated.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Dixon, at 23 and 24&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the right to make full answer and defence is not implicated, the usual remedy is either an adjournment or order of production.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Dixon, para. 31 and 33&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in general, where disclosure has not been given or is given late, the usual remedy is an adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Trial===
Where late disclosure results in an unfair trial, even after the trial, an new trial may be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. C(MH) 1991 1 SCR 763&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc38/2009scc38.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may not constitute a distinct Charter breach.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v. Douglas (1991) 5 OR 29 &lt;/ref&gt;

Late disclosure does not necessarily result in an unfair trial.&lt;ref&gt; R v Rejzek, [http://canlii.ca/t/26shr 2009 ABCA 393] at para 26&lt;/ref&gt; 
A number of factors should be considered.&lt;Ref&gt; See R v McQuaid, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805], [1998] 1 SCR 244 at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Exclusion of Evidence===
Where late disclosure warrants the exclusion of evidence follow the following principles from R v Bjelland:
:(a)   Remedies under s. 24(1) of the Charter are flexible and contextual.  The exclusion of evidence cannot be ruled out under s. 24(1).  However, such a remedy will only be available where a less intrusive remedy cannot be fashioned to safeguard the fairness of the trial process and the integrity of the justice system.
:(b)   The Crown’s failure to disclose evidence does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of s. 7.  Rather, an accused must generally show “actual prejudice” to his ability to make full to answer and defence.
:(c)   An accused must receive a fair trial, however, the trial must be fair from both the perspective of the accused and of society more broadly.  A fair trial is one which satisfies the public interest in getting at the truth, while preserving basic procedural fairness for the accused.
:(d)   A trial judge should only exclude evidence for late disclosure in “exceptional” cases:
::(e)   where late disclosure renders the trial process unfair, and the unfairness cannot be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order, or
::(f)     where exclusion in necessary to maintain the integrity of the justice system.

{{reflist|2}}
===Stay of Proceedings===
Within the rights under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms include the &quot;right to full answer and defence&quot;. This right requires the Crown to provide all relevant evidence. A failure to do so may violate this right, and a breach of that right may entitle the accused to a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter. 

Where a section 7 Charter breach is alleged on the basis of violating the right to make full answer and defence due to failure to make disclosure, the issue will usually be left for the conclusion of trial. Not only to first determine whether there is insufficient evidence for gulit but also that the judge can properly assess whether the right to full answer and defence was violated in context of the case in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. F.C.B. 2000 NSCA 35 (CanLII), 2000 NSCA 35 (N.S.C.A.) &lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Banford 2010 SKPC 110 (CanLII), 2010 SKPC 110 (Sask. Prov. Ct.) at paragraph 10 (overturned at 2011 SKQB 418 (Sask. Q.B.) on other grounds). &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Salisbury, [2011] S.J. No. 259 (Sask.Q.B.)&lt;br&gt;
R v Burwell, 2011 SKPC 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Delayed disclosure can be a factor but not a sole basis of seeking a stay.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dias, 2010 ABCA 382 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Costs===
Where failure to disclose is flagrant and unjustified, the court may order costs.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Guilty Plea]]

==Plea of Not Guilty==
Where an accused refuses to make a plea or otherwise does not answer the question of plea, the presumption is that a plea of not guilty will be entered into the record (s. 606(2)).

==Special Pleas==

===Autrefois Acquit and Autrefois Convict===

{{quotation|
607(1) An accused may plead the special pleas of
:(a)      autrefois acquit;
:(b)      autrefois convict; and
:(c)      pardon.
&lt;br&gt;
...
&lt;br&gt;
607(5) Where an accused pleads autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, it is sufficient if he
:(a)      states that he has been lawfully acquitted, convicted or discharged under subsection 730(1), as the case may be, of the offence charged in the count to which the plea relates; and
:(b)      indicates the time and place of the acquittal, conviction or discharge under subsection 730(1).
&lt;br&gt;
608     Where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is tried, the evidence and adjudication and the notes of the judge and official stenographer on the former trial and the record transmitted to the court pursuant to section 551 on the charge that is pending before that court are admissible in evidence to prove or to disprove the identity of the charges.
&lt;P&gt; 
609(1) Where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to a count is tried and it appears
:(a)      that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and
:(b)      that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is pleaded,
&lt;br&gt;
the judge shall give judgment discharging the accused in respect of that count.
&lt;br&gt; 
610(1) Where an indictment charges substantially the same offence as that charged in an indictment on which an accused was previously convicted or acquitted, but adds a statement of intention or circumstances of aggravation tending, if proved, to increase the punishment, the previous conviction or acquittal bars the subsequent indictment.

An accused is not acquitted until all available appeals have been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;
Corp. professionelle des médecins v. Thibault, 1988 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1033, at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt;

An accused cannot plead to autrefoit acquit where the victim in the first trial is different from the victim in the second trial.&lt;Ref&gt;
Rex v. Sweetman, [1939] 2 D.L.R. 70, [1939] O.J. No. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the facts and offence are substantially the same, the accused can rely on autrefois acquit or autrefois convict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tyhy, [http://canlii.ca/t/1wxpr 2008 MBQB 126] -- autrefois acquit accepted
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the crown abandons a prosecution after an adverse evidentiary decision, the defence cannot plead autrefois acquit at a later new trial on the same offence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Button [http://canlii.ca/t/2d5kx 2010 NLCA 66] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Res Judicata===
The defence of res judicata prevent any convictions being entered for the same factual transactions as a previous conviction.

Res Judicata is &quot;an act which underlies an offence or an act which forms part of a series of connected acts which make up the factual basis of an offence resulting in a conviction cannot be used to constitute the factual basis of a conviction for a conviction for another offence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
R v. Allison and Direl (1983) 38 C.R. (3d) 333 per Martin J.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was codified under s. 12 of the Code:
{{quotation|
'''Offence punishable under more than one Act'''&lt;br&gt;
12. Where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of Parliament, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears, subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 11.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec12 CCC]
}}

===Double Jeopardy===
Section 11(h) of the Charter states that &quot;Any person charged with an offence has the right ...if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again&quot;

The rule against double jeopardy means that a person cannot be convicted of a single criminal offence twice.&lt;ReF&gt;comes from latin “nemo debet bis vexaris pro una et eadem causa”&lt;br&gt;
Cullen 1949 SCR 658
Riddle 1980 1 SCR 380
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the right under s.11(h) to apply the court must determine 1) whether the matter is of a &quot;public nature, intended to promote public order and welfare within a public sphere of activity&quot; and 2) whether the matter involves &quot;the imposition of true penal consequences&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Wigglesworth [1987] _ SCR _&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{CdnCrimOffencesBox/Break and Enter}}
==Overview==
The offence of break and enter encompasses situations where the accused was or attempted to trespass on private property with an intent to commit an indictable offence (i.e. a non-summary criminal offence). The most typical form of break and enter is a break into a commercial or private residence in order to steal property. The most serious form of break and enter is where the accused did the act knowing that there were people present and was prepared to use force against them in a robbery-like fashion. This is known as a &quot;home invasion&quot;.  

A less frequent form of break and enter is the entry into private property in order to confront a person found within intending to assault or threaten with violence. The parties normally know each other and arises from a dispute between them, sometimes domestic. 

The evidence in most of these cases is circumstantial, and so [[Canadian Criminal Law/Identity|identity]] is often a key point of litigation. In many cases the accused was found at some time later with stolen items in their possession for which the Crown can use to establish guilt by way of the doctrine of ''[[Canadian Criminal Law/Recent Possession|recent possession]]''.

==Proof of Offence==
The Crown prosecutor should prove the following elements: 

===s. 348(1)(a) - breaks with intent ===
# identity of the accused as the culprit
# the time and date of the incident 
# the jurisdiction of the incident
# the accused entered into the premises 
# the accused had no justification for entering the premises or permission to enter
# the accused intended to commit an indictable offence (presumed under s. 348(2)(a))
# location of place broken into (evidence of access method)
# whether the place was a dwelling-house
# ownership of the place
# condition of place just prior to the break-in
# condition of place after the break-in
# amount of damage done

===s. 348(1)(b) - breaks and commits ===
# identity of the accused as the culprit
# the time and date of the incident 
# the jurisdiction of the incident
# the accused entered into the premises 
# the accused had no justification for entering the premises or permission to enter
# the accused committed an indictable offence (theft, mischief, etc.)
# location of place broken into (evidence of access method)
# location of place of exit (optional)
# whether the place was a dwelling-house
# ownership of the place
# condition of place just prior to the break-in
# condition of place after the break-in
# amount of damage done
# ownership of goods taken
# continuity of goods

# the accused intended to commit an indictable offence OR accused committed an indictable offence (theft, mischief, etc.) (presumed under s. 348(2)(a))
# location of place broken out of (evidence of access method)
# whether the place was a dwelling-house
# ownership of the place
# condition of place just prior to the break-out
# condition of place after the break-out
# amount of damage done
# ownership of goods taken
# continuity of goods

==Interpretation==

===Breaking===
Section 321 defines &quot;break&quot;:
{{Quotation|
321. In this Part,
&lt;br&gt;
:“break” means
::(a) to break any part, internal or external, or
::(b) to open any thing that is used or intended to be used to close or to cover an internal or external opening;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec321 CCC]
}}

&quot;Breaking&quot; can include an actual break as defined in s. 321 or it can be &quot;constructive&quot; breaking. &quot;Constructive&quot; breaking can be established by the accused simply walking through a doorway.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Johnson, [1977] 2 SCR 646 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1977/1977canlii229/1977canlii229.html 1977 CanLII 229]&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply entering into a structure through an open door does not on its own amount to &quot;breaking&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Jewell (1974), OJ No 931 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes staying in a store until after closing time.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fairbridge, 1984 AJ. NO 828 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, entering through an unlocked but closed door after knocking does not amount to breaking.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. House, [http://canlii.ca/t/frwt3 2012 NLCA 41] at 13-17&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Entering===
An entrance is defined in s.350: &lt;ref&gt;found to constitutional in R. v. T.B.K., [1998] CRR 328 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation|
'''Entrance'''&lt;br&gt;
350. For the purposes of sections 348 and 349,
:(a) a person enters as soon as any part of his body or any part of an instrument that he uses is within any thing that is being entered; and
:(b) a person shall be deemed to have broken and entered if
::(i) he obtained entrance by a threat or an artifice or by collusion with a person within, or
::(ii) he entered without lawful justification or excuse, the proof of which lies on him, by a permanent or temporary opening.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec350 CCC]
}}

There is a statutory presumption under s.350(b)(ii) to require the accused to prove lawfulness of entry. However, this has been established as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Singh (1987), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 278 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
see also R. v. K., [http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii925/1998canlii925.html 1998 CanLII 925 (ON C.A.) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The time of the break is relevant to determine whether such a &quot;lawful justification or excuse&quot; exists. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Farbridge (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 521 -- Accused hid in store lawfully until closing in order to steal. This was not considered breaking&lt;/ref&gt;

When concerning break and enter under s. 98, entrance was defined as follows:
{{quotation|
s. 98&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''Entrance'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section,
:(a) a person enters as soon as any part of his or her body or any part of an instrument that he or she uses is within any thing that is being entered; and
:(b) a person is deemed to have broken and entered if he or she
::(i) obtained entrance by a threat or an artifice or by collusion with a person within, or
::(ii) entered without lawful justification or excuse by a permanent or temporary opening.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec98 CCC]
}}

{{Reflist|2}}
===Place===
Section 348(3) defines place as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition of “place”'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section and section 351, “place” means
:(a) a dwelling-house;
:(b) a building or structure or any part thereof, other than a dwelling-house;
:(c) a railway vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or a trailer; or
:(d) a pen or an enclosure in which fur-bearing animals are kept in captivity for breeding or commercial purposes.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec348 CCC]
}}

A place has been found, in certain circumstances, to include a fenced off area surrounding a structure.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R.J.F.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/1994/1994canlii7611/1994canlii7611.html 1994 CanLII 7611 (NS C.A.)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The concierge area behind a locked gate as well as the desk and drawer within fall in the definition of a &quot;place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Charron, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m6jl 2005 BCCA 607] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

When concerning a charge under s. 98,  &quot;place&quot; refers to &quot;any building or structure — or part of one — and any motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, railway vehicle, container or trailer.&quot;(98(2))

{{Reflist|2}}

===Dwelling House===
&quot;Dwelling house&quot; is defined in section 2:
{{quotation|
s. 2&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
“dwelling-house” means the whole or any part of a building or structure that is kept or occupied as a permanent or temporary residence, and includes
:(a) a building within the curtilage of a dwelling-house that is connected to it by a doorway or by a covered and enclosed passage-way, and
:(b) a unit that is designed to be mobile and to be used as a permanent or temporary residence and that is being used as such a residence;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec2 CCC]
}}
Detached building on private property does not usually amount to dwelling. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. N.M.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2007/2007canlii31570/2007canlii31570.html 2007 CanLII 31570 (ON S.C.)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An incomplete building does not constitute a dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sappier,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbpc/doc/2005/2005nbpc37/2005nbpc37.html 2005 NBPC 37]&lt;/ref&gt; However, an abandoned building however is one.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. DeWolfe (1988), 82 N.S.R.(2d) 175 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A driveway is not a dwelling house; it is a place where people drive and park their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Evans , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8 at para. 32
&lt;/ref&gt;

A motel room,&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Henderson, [1975] 1 WWR 360 (BCPC)&lt;/ref&gt; camp,&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nowlan,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbqb/doc/2009/2009nbqb117/2009nbqb117.html 2009 NBQB 117]&lt;/ref&gt; can be a dwelling.

{{Reflist|2}}

===Intent to Commit===
To make out the charge under 348(1)(a), there must be an &quot;intent&quot; to commit an indictable offence and the intent must be present at the time of the entering. Breaking and entering into a place is not a criminal offence without a sign of an offence while inside. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Taylor, [1984] ___ (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt; A person being chased into a house and damages the door is not enough to form intent to commit an indictable offence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schizgal, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fn46 2001 BCCA 238] &lt;/ref&gt;

Section 348(2) provides that where there is certain evidence of the accused breaking in or out of a place, there is a rebuttable presumption of an intent to commit an indictable offence.

{{quotation|
'''Presumptions'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused
:(a) broke and entered a place or attempted to break and enter a place is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered the place or attempted to do so, as the case may be, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein; or
:(b) broke out of a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke out after
::(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or
::(ii) entering with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About This Book==
This Wikibook deals with the production of pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets are very well-defined concepts.  The most natural way of colouring is by using the potential function, though it is not actually the method most usually used.  The book explains how to make pictures that are completely faultless in this regard. All the necessary theory is explained, all the formulas are stated and some words are said about how to put the things into a computer program.

The subject is primary pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets in their &quot;pure&quot; form, that is, without artificial intervention in the formula or in the colouring. Exceptions to this rule are techniques such as field lines, landscapes and critical systems for non-complex functions, that appeal to artistic utilization.

The book should not contain theory that has nothing to do with the pictures. Nor should it contain mathematical proofs.  For our purposes faultless pictures are enough evidence of correct formulas, because the slightest error in a formula generally leads to serious errors in the picture.

If you find that something in this book ought to be explained in more details, you can either develop it further yourselves or advertise for that on the discussion page.

If you add a new picture or replace an illustration by a new one, it should be of best possible quality and have a size of about 800 pixels. Draw it twice or four times as large and diminish it.

==Julia and Mandelbrot sets==

===Julia sets depend on a Rational Function===
If a complex rational function is entered in the computer program and submitted to a certain iterative procedure, you get a colouring of the plane called a Julia set (although it is the domain outside the Julia set that is coloured). However, in order to get a picture that has aesthetic value the function must have a certain nature. It must either be constructed in a specific way to ensure that the picture is interesting, or it must contain a parameter, a complex number, that can vary.  Being able to vary a parameter increases our chances of finding an interesting Julia sets for some value of the parameter.  

What do we mean by 'interesting'?  Essentially that the iterative procedure behaves in a somewhat chaotic way.  If the iterative procedure's behaviour at each point is easily predicted for a particular function by behaviour of nearby points, then the Julia set for that function is not very crinkly, and rather uninteresting.


===A Mandelbrot set is an Atlas to the Related Julia sets===

If we vary the parameter in our rational function we can produce a kind of 'map' of values that lead to interesting Julia sets.  Values of the complex parameter correspond to points in the plane.  The set of points that lead to interesting Julia sets gives us some information about the structure of the Julia sets for the parameter value at each point. Such a set is called a Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set can be regarded as an atlas of the Julia sets.

The difference between the Mandelbrot set for the family and &quot;its&quot; Julia sets, is that the structure of the Mandelbrot set varies from locality to locality, while a Julia set is self-similar: the different localities are transformations of each other.

Sometimes you will prefer the more complex picture of the varying structure of the Mandelbrot set.  Sometimes you will prefer the pure structure of the Julia set.  Sometimes you will draw the Julia set because the drawing of the Mandelbrot set is slow for certain functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The police powers of detention and arrest are some of the most important powers available to a peace officer in their investigation of criminal activity. It is also some of the most invasive powers upon a person's liberty. This is a classic issue of procedural law that circumscribes the peace officers authority in these matters.

These chapters cover not only the powers of police to detain or arrest, but also the right a person has when the police engage in such conduct and remedies for breaches of those rights.

==[[Canadian Criminal Law]]==

Hi, when you changed the sub page &quot;Sentencing by offence&quot; to be a redirect to the main page (i.e., to redirect to Canadian Criminal Law itself) I assumed you were trying to in effect move all the pages that sat below &quot;Sentencing by offence&quot; to sit directly below the main page in the hierarchy. For example, what was &quot;Canadian Criminal Law/Sentencing by offence/Theft-related offences&quot; should move to &quot;Canadian Criminal Law/Theft-related offences&quot;. As a consequence I started to move the sub-pages down a level and tidy up all the redirects. I guess I started this as the structure was awkward having sub pages to a redirect page. Now looking at the book again I'm not sure if this is what you were trying to achieve! So, I've stopped for now. If you let me know what structure you'd like I can restore / delete the various pages and redirects to get it right. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:49, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

== Question ==
Feel free to disregard but since you are editing a book on the issue of the law, even if not a lawyer or having other knowledge beyond an insight on what you are contributing (that is all we can hope). Can you spare some time and look into the discussion on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals#Request feature: Author namespace]] and express there your opinion on the validity of the copyright statements and disclaimers and your view if they should be given some extra protection from edit corruption and even well intentioned but wrongly placed information. Thanks any insight will be appreciated.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:25, 22 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Amphetamines are artificially made stimulants and prescription drugs like concerta. Amphetamines were first made in Germany as treatment for asthma (20th century). Some &quot;street&quot; names for ampetamines are uppers, ups, speed, black beauties, and wake ups. Amphetamines can be inhaled, injected, or most comonly swallowed. Effects on the body are high energy and feelings of well being.

      <comment>/* What is the HLA assembler? */ Changes, including formatting, to make to easier to read.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the HLA assembler? ==

In the current version of this Wikibook the ''HLA assembler'' has not been introduced before its use on this page:

: ''HLA Comments. The HLA assembler also has the ability ...''

It is defined later in the book, in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/HLA_Syntax X86_Assembly/HLA Syntax]:

: &quot;HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and 
converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, 
usually). Another assembler (MASM or GAS) will then assemble 
the instructions into machine code.&quot;

Wikipedia page for HLA: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Assembly High Level Assembler]. 
Note, however, there is some confusion about whether that page is about the language or the tool.

What would be the appropriate action? Adding a forward reference?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chemical equilibrium''' is when the concentrations of the products and the reactants in a reaction are in balance; there is no net exchange as the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the backward reaction. A [[w:Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]] is achieved when there is a lack of change in a system as inputs and outputs remain in balance. In a dynamic equilibrium, chemicals are reacting rapidly at the molecular scale, while their concentrations remain constant on the macroscopic scale. Compounds which are in a dynamic chemical equilibrium are studied and described using the concepts of chemical equilibrium.

==Equilibrium Law==
The equilibrium law states that the concentrations of the products multiplied together, divided by the concentration of the reactants multiplied together, equal an equilibrium constant (''K''). The equilibrium constant is a number which depends on the reaction and the temperature of the reaction mixture when equilibrium is attained.

The letter ''K'' is reserved as the symbol for the equilibrium constant. A specific type of the equilibrium constant can be notated with a subscript:
*&lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; = concentration is in molarities
*&lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; = partial pressures of gases represent reactant and product amounts
*&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; = solubility product
*&lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; = acid ionization constant
*&lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt; = base ionization constant
*&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt; = formation constant

The specific equilibrium law depends on the equilibrium reaction under study. A general equilibrium reaction can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha A + \beta B \rightleftharpoons \sigma S + \tau T&lt;/math&gt; 

The general equilibrium law for the above reaction is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{\{S\}^\sigma \{T\}^\tau } {\{A\}^\alpha \{B\}^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Compounds in a liquid or solid state ''should not'' be included in the equilibrium law because they have a constant concentration during a reaction. For example for the reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{CO_2\} } {\{CH_4\} \{O_2\}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

Aqueous solutions and gases are included in the equilibrium law. For the below reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; NH_3(g) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{NH_4^+\} \{OH^-\} } {\{NH_3\} }&lt;/math&gt;

==Finding the Value of the Equilibrium Constant==
In the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; H_2(g) + Cl_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HCl(g)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{HCl\}^2} {\{H_2\} \{Cl_2\} }&lt;/math&gt;

The most direct method for finding the value of the equilibrium constant &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; is by measuring the concentration of each of the reactants and products, and plugging in their values in the equilibrium law. For example, if the concentration at equilibrium for the above reaction are determined as &lt;math&gt;\{H_2\} = 1.0*10^{-8}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\{Cl_2\} = 3.4*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;\{HCl\} = 0.802&lt;/math&gt;, they can be plugged into the equilibrium law to solve for &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{HCl\}^2 } {\{H_2\} \{Cl_2\} }&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{0.802\}^2 } {\{1.0*10^{-8}\} \{3.4*10^{-6}\} }&lt;/math&gt;

After plugging in the concentrations, do the appropriate arithmetic to find the value of &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;K_c = 1.89*10^{13}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uses of the Equilibrium Law==
The value of the equilibrium constant connotes the extent to which, in a chemical reaction, reactants are converted into products. Thus, from the equilibrium constant ''K'', one can infer the composition of an equilibrium mixture. If the equilibrium constant is very large (i.e. above &lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;), the amount of products present at equilibrium is greater than the amount of reactants, which means that the reaction goes to completion. If ''K'' equals 1, the amount of products present at equilibrium is the same as the amount of reactants. When ''K'' is very small (i.e. below &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;), the amount of products formed is extremely small; no visible reaction takes place.

===Spontaneous Reactions===
A '''spontaneous reaction''' is a reaction that will proceed without any outside energy or driving force. A spontaneous reaction has an equilibrium constant greater than 1. A reaction will be '''nonspontaneous''' if the equilibrium constant is less than 1. 

===The Reaction Quotient===
The '''reaction quotient''' (''Q'') is a value that can be obtained by plugging in the values of the required concentrations
into the equilibrium law. The equilibrium constant is the value &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; when the reaction is at equilibrium.
If the chemicals in the reaction are not at equilibrium, then the value obtained by the equilibrium law is called the
reaction quotient. ''Q'' has the same form as the equilibrium law, except &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by ''Q''. 
Four properties may be derived from this definition of the reaction quotient, ''Q'':
*If ''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction is at equilibrium.
*If ''Q'' does not change with respect to time, the reaction is at equilibrium and thus, ''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;.
*If ''Q'' &lt; &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction will move to the right (the forward direction) in order to reach equilibrium.
*If ''Q'' &gt; &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction will move to the left (the reverse direction) in order to reach equilibrium.

1. Which conic section forms the basis of vertical curves?

2. A section of a roadway goes up a 6% incline and includes no horizontal curves. Point A, which lies along this incline, has a station marker. Using a wheel measure, you measure the distance along the centerline from point A to the next PVC and find it is 880 meters. If point A is at Station 0+700, what is the station of the PVC?

3. Identify 4 criteria used to set the minimum length of a sag vertical curve (4 points), place them in order from most to least important (1 point):

4. An equal tangent sag vertical curve joins a –0.5 % grade with a +3.0% grade. Assume H=0.6, headlights are aimed upward at an angle of 1 degree

If the PVI of the grades is at metric station 10+100 and has an elevation of 300 meters, using the headlight criterion determine the station elevation of the PVC and PVT for a design speed of 100 km/hr and a coefficient of friction of 0.30. Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

5. A crest vertical curve on a 2-way, 2-lane road is designed for 100 km/hr. The grades are 1.6% and – 1.4%. If the tangents intersect at metric station 2 + 000.00 (where 2 represents 2 km and 000.00 is 0 meters) and at an elevation of 100 meters above sea level, determine the stopping sight distance, the length of the curve, and the stations and elevations for the Beginning and End of the Vertical Curve. Assume h1 = 1.1 m and h2 = 0.15 m, perception reaction time is 2.5 seconds, f=0.30.

Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

6. An equal tangent sag vertical curve joins a -2.5% grade with a +3.0% grade. Assume H=0.67, headlights are aimed upward at an angle of 1 degree. If the PVI of the grades is at metric station 5+750 and has an elevation of 0 meters, using the headlight criterion determine the station elevation of the PVC and PVT for a design speed of 120 km/hr and a coefficient of friction of 0.31. Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

7. You have been asked to design an equal-tangent vertical curve to connect grades of the +1.0% and -2.0%. The design speed is 113km/h. Assume a value of 3.4 m*s-2 for deceleration rate, a value of 2.5s for reaction time, and a value of 9.807m*s for gravitational constant.

A. Calculate the Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) if we assume vehicles travel at the design speed.

B. If we take this SSD as the required minimum Sight Distance, determine the minimum length of curve. (According to AASHTO, we assume a driver eye height, H1, of 1.08m and a roadway object height, H2, of 0.6m).

1. Why might maximum superelevation be higher in South Texas than in Northern Minnesota?

2. Which conic section forms the basis of horizontal curves?

3. When a vehicle is traveling around a horizontal curve, it is subject to two forces. What are these forces, and how do they operate on the vehicle (draw a clear diagram illustrating the forces).

4. An existing horizontal curve has a radius of 100 meters, which restricts the maximum speed on this section of road. Highway officials want a maximum design speed of 150 km/hr.

Assume the coefficient of side friction is 0.15 and rate of superelevation on both the original and rebuilt sections is 0.06.

Compute the existing speed and find the new radius of curvature.

5. A flat horizontal curve on a 2-lane highway is designed with a 609.600 m radius, the curve has a tangent length of 121.920 m and the PI is at station 3+139.440

1. Determine the maximum grade an empty tractor-trailer with a mass of 10000 kg can climb at a sustained speed of 75 km/h.

The frontal area (A) of the truck is 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the drag coefficient = 1.00 and the available power is 280 kW, ρ=1.2 kg*m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, g = 9.81 m*sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;


2. What is the maximum grade a bicycle can climb at a sustained speed of 12 km/h assuming the following:

* Rho = density of air (1.20 kg*m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* g = 9.81 m*sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Mass (with bicyclist) = 100 kg
* Nominal Power = 1 kW
* Frontal Area (A) = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Drag Coefficient = 0.5
* Available power = 100 percent of nominal power

* Fr = 0.020 W


3. Bicyclists get tired. Assume the bicyclist slowly loses power (and thus velocity) going up the hill of the grade you just determined in question 2 above. If available power drops continuously from 100% to 0% over the course of the hour, to the nearest kilometer, how far does the bicyclist travel? (Use appropriate approximations.)

1. Name five principal characteristics of visual reception important in driving. 

2. You are shown an accident scene with a vehicle and a tree on uphill grade of 3%. The vehicle was estimated to hit the tree at 120 km*h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; . The average length of skid marks was 20 meters. You have found that a car traveling that section under similar weather conditions at 60 km*h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; can stop in 60 m. What was its initial speed?

3. Draw a road's cross-section and label the elements.

4. How do the calculations of stopping sight distance and passing sight distance differ?

5. What is the recommended value used for perception reaction time according to AASHTO?

6. What is a standard lane width used in new highway designs (to nearest foot or centimeter)?

1. What is a Mass Diagram and why is it important? What are the units on the vertical axis of a Mass Diagram (Metric)?

2. Looking at a mass diagram, suppose you see that at Station 1+750 the ordinate equals -1000, at Station 1+780 the ordinate is -2750, and at Station 1+900 the ordinate is zero.
A) Describe what happens between stations 1+750 and 1+780.
B) If the project ends at Station 1+900, what can you conclude about the earthwork required for this project?

1. Define the following terms

A. Signal phase 
Answers: A signal phase is the signal combinations in a signal controller that controls a group of traffic movement off and on.
B. Signal cycle
Answers: The loop time for a specific traffic phase. The time length between the starting of the phase to it apears again.
C. Max-out
Answers: the maximum flow of the approach
D. Gap-out 
Answers: the flow of approach accounting for the time of green light period
E. Lost time 
Answers:
sources of &quot;lost time&quot; at a signalized intersection are: Start-up lost time, clearance lost time and the yield the pedestrians.



2. A pretimed signal controls a four-way intersection with no turning permitted and zero lost time. The EB and WB traffic volumes are 900 and 800veh/h, and the two movements share the same effective green and effective red portions of cycles. The NB and SB directions also share cycle times, with volumes of 300 and 250 veh/h, respectively. If the saturation flow of all approaches is 1800veh/h, the cycle length is 75 seconds, and D/D/1 queuing applies, determine the effective red and green times that must be allocated to each directions combination (N-S, E-W) to minimize the total vehicle delay and compute the total delay per cycle.

3 AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic) data on a single intersection between an arterial street (East-West) and a minor street (North-South) has been collected for the current year. Approximate saturation flow rates and collected traffic volumes are given in the table below.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Approach !! Volume (veh/hr) !! Saturation Flow (veh/hr)
|-
| North Bound (NB) || 380 || 1200
|-
| South Bound (SB) || 295 || 1200
|-
| East Bound Left Turn (EBLT) || 260 || 1800
|-
| East Bound (EB) || 1160 || 3000
|-
| West Bound Left Turn (WBLT) || 250 || 1800
|-
| West Bound (WB) || 1050 || 3000
|}

Based on the traffic demand forecast, it is expected demand for the EB and WB directions (including left turn traffic) will increase by 10% each in the next year, and that for the NB and SB directions by 5% each, while the saturated flow rates remain unchanged. The traffic demand has changed so significantly that, as a city traffic engineer, you are asked to develop a new signal design at this intersection for the NEXT YEAR. 

A. The design is required by the city to be a three-phase cycle with leading left turn and no overlap. Draw a sketch of the intersection with arrows indicating the directions of traffic to illustrate your design.

B. The signal at this intersection is traffic-actuated, but you are going to work out a pre-timed signal design in your proposal. Describe the differences between a pre-time signal and a traffic-actuated signal. Under which circumstance a pre-timed signal design can be used for a traffic-actuated signal?

C. You are also asked to develop an alternative design for this intersection because the city received complaints of too much travel delay at this intersection. Based on the calculated cycle length, how are you going to develop this plan?

1. The upstream traffic flow on a road with two lanes in the relevant direction is q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 1800 veh/hr with freeflow speed of v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=90 km/hr. As the result of a crash, one lane is blocked and flow is reduced to q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 900 veh/hr. The density in the queue is k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 70 veh/km. The value of time is $10/hour/vehicle

A. What is the shockwave speed (v&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;)?

B. If this continues for 1 hour, before the lane is cleared, how many vehicles long will the queue be?

C. How much did this crash cost society in terms of delay (travel time in excess of freeflow travel time)?

D. If a freeway service patrol (tow truck service) could clear the crash in 30 minutes instead of an hour, how much should society be willing to pay for that service?

E. If a variable message sign placed 2 km upstream of the crash site instantly (at the moment of the crash) advises travelers about a diversion to a frontage road 1 km upstream of the crash site, how valuable is the freeway service patrol (how much should society be willing to pay under these circumstances)? 

2. A fixed-time ramp meter with unlimited storage space can serve 1 vehicle every 5 seconds. Vehicles approach the back of the ramp queue at 80 km/hr at a rate of 1 vehicle every 4 seconds. The density in the queue is 275 veh/km.

A. What is the wave speed?

B. What is the rate at which the queue grows, in units of vehicles per hour (q)?

1. Deterministic Queueing

A. Draw a typical queuing input-output diagram (Newell Curve) (for one lane) consistent with observed data on a freeway bottleneck with an uncongested capacity of 1800 vehicles per hour per lane and an arrival rate that starts at 1600 vehicles per hour for 15 minutes, rises to 2000 vehicles per hour for 30 minutes, and drops back to 1600 vehicles per hour for the final 15 minutes.

B. Show how to compute delay on the graph. 

C. Show the delay for the 500th vehicle

D. How many vehicles are in the congested region at time the 500th vehicle enters the congested region.

E. How many vehicles are in the congested region at the time the 500th vehicle leaves the front of the queue.


2. You are asked to model a freeway ramp meter with one lane of SOV traffic, which waits at the meter, and an HOV bypass lane that has no delay. Assume vehicles arrive with a random Poisson distribution, and the service rate (the rate at which the light turns green) is stochastic (it is determined by freeway conditions, which from the point of view of travelers on the ramp is random, with a negative exponential distribution). In the peak hour, 800 vehicles arrive at the ramp, of which 100 are high occupancy vehicles with 2 passengers each. The traffic light is timed to turn green on average once every 4 seconds, and is only green long enough to let one vehicle through. Assume the ramp can hold as many vehicles as want to use it.

A. Determine the percent of time the ramp is empty, not empty

B. How much time will each HOV user save?

C. How much time does each SOV user save because the HOV users don’t wait in the queue?

D. Determine the average queue length

E. How often does the queue exceed 15 cars?


3. For the M\/D\/1 queuing model, 

A. What is the arrival distribution?

B. What is the departure distribution?

C. How many servers are there?

D. Provide two examples where the model might apply (one transportation and one non-transportation). 


4. Under what conditions are ramp meters beneficial, detrimental?

5. Who wins and who loses when ramp meters are installed, illustrate your argument with an example.

6. How might ramp meters be made more popular without reducing their effectiveness?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The process of determining the appropriate sentence includes the enumerating of aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence and offender. The three broad categories of factors to consider consist of personal circumstances, circumstances of the offence, and circumstances of the proceedings.

As discussed in the Chapter on [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Purpose and Principles of Sentencing|Purpose and Principles of Sentencing]], section 718.2(a) provides that &quot;a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender&quot;.

==Personal circumstances==
===Criminal Record===
A criminal record will be an aggravating factor.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Squires, 2012 NLCA 20, (a criminal record &quot;will be viewed as an aggravating factor leading to a more serious punishment rather than as a factor that tends to limit or lessen punishment.&quot;) &lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal record can show that the offender is a &quot;scofflaw&quot; or is not rehabilitated or &quot;learned from past mistakes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Barrett, 2012 NLCA 46, at para 35 (a “criminal record is often quite relevant on sentencing in that it may show the offender to be a scofflaw, or lead to an inference that he or she has not been rehabilitated or otherwise learned from past mistakes.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal record can only be considered where the offender had one ''at the time of'' the index offence (this is known as the Coke Rule).&lt;ref&gt;
R v Andrade,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbca/doc/2010/2010nbca62/2010nbca62.html 2010 NBCA 62]&lt;br&gt;
see also R. v. Garcia and Silva, [1970] 1 O.R. 821 at 823, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124 (C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when a judge sentences for a convicted offence, the judge may take into consideration other criminal acts, and in a limited fashion, such as offences admitted in an agreed statement facts or pending charges.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garcia and Silva, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. Edwards [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA), (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is largely codified in s. 725:
{{quotation|
'''Other offences'''&lt;br&gt;
725. (1) In determining the sentence, a court
:(a) shall consider, if it is possible and appropriate to do so, any other offences of which the offender was found guilty by the same court, and shall determine the sentence to be imposed for each of those offences;
:(b) shall consider, if the Attorney General and the offender consent, any outstanding charges against the offender to which the offender consents to plead guilty and pleads guilty, if the court has jurisdiction to try those charges, and shall determine the sentence to be imposed for each charge unless the court is of the opinion that a separate prosecution for the other offence is necessary in the public interest;
:(b.1) shall consider any outstanding charges against the offender, unless the court is of the opinion that a separate prosecution for one or more of the other offences is necessary in the public interest, subject to the following conditions:
::(i) the Attorney General and the offender consent,
::(ii) the court has jurisdiction to try each charge,
::(iii) each charge has been described in open court,
::(iv) the offender has agreed with the facts asserted in the description of each charge, and
::(v) the offender has acknowledged having committed the offence described in each charge; and
:(c) may consider any facts forming part of the circumstances of the offence that could constitute the basis for a separate charge.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Attorney General’s consent'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) For the purpose of paragraphs (1)(b) and (b.1), the Attorney General shall take the public interest into account before consenting.
&lt;P&gt;
'''No further proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The court shall, on the information or indictment, note
:(a) any outstanding charges considered in determining the sentence under paragraph (1)(b.1), and
:(b) any facts considered in determining the sentence under paragraph (1)(c),&lt;br&gt;
and no further proceedings may be taken with respect to any offence described in those charges or disclosed by those facts unless the conviction for the offence of which the offender has been found guilty is set aside or quashed on appeal.

R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 725; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 158, c. 1 (4th Supp.), s. 18(F); 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 31. | [http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec725 CCC]}}

An offence committed while on parole is an aggravating factor. By contrast the added consequences of parole revocation should not be mitigating.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lavallee, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pz1b 2006 ABCA 324] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Age ===
Age is relevant to sentencing as a mitigating factor. A youthful person is seen as having a greater chance of reforming and maturing over time. The courts in certain cases recognize young adults as sometimes foolish, inexperienced, and immature. This diminishes their level of responsibility and moral blameworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;eg see R. v. Kunzig, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpg46 2011 MBPC 81] at 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the principle of restraint is a prominent factor for young offenders.&lt;ref&gt; See: R. v. Demeter and Whitmore (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 379 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Employment===
In general, a good work history is mitigating as it indicates a prior good character.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Johnston,   [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2011/2011nlca56/2011nlca56.html 2011 NLCA 56] at para 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The offender's &quot;opportunity for employment&quot; is an important factor to determine if there is a &quot;reasonable prospect for rehabilitation&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hunt, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpvck#par19 2012 NLCA 5 at 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Effect on Employment and Status===
Loss of professional or social status is not generally a mitigating factor nor is the ability to do a particular job well a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Ambrose, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rqs 2000 ABCA 264] at para. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been said that the &quot;ruin and humiliation&quot; brought upon the accused and his family as well as the loss of professional status can provide denunciation and deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bunn, [http://canlii.ca/t/527l 2000 SCC 9] (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 183 at para. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Degree of remorse and attitude===
Remorse is a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Anderson [http://canlii.ca/t/2327s 1992 CanLII 6002] (BC C.A.), (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 523, at p. 535-536, 16 B.C.A.C. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Remorse is demonstrated by the acceptance of responsibility through word or action as well as demonstrated insight into the offender's actions. A lack of remorse, however, does not make for an aggravating factor, but simply does not allow for the mitigating effect of remorse.&lt;ref&gt; See LaForme J.A. in R. v. Kakekagamick, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p52k 2006 CanLII 28549] (ON C.A.), [2006] 81 O.R. (3d) 664, 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), at para. 73, &quot;[his] failure to accept responsibility for his actions weighs against affording him significant consideration by way of mitigation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts should have &quot;restraint...for persons who spontaneously acknowledge their culpability, have genuine remorse and seek voluntarily to make reparations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Arcand (2011), 499 A.R. 1 (Alta. C.A.) at para 293&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility generally cannot be taken as an aggravating factor, but rather can only be taken as an absence of mitigating factors.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Proulx, [http://canlii.ca/t/527b 2000 SCC 5], [2000] 1 SCR 61 &lt;br&gt;
R v Williams, [2007] OJ No. 1604, [http://canlii.ca/t/1r934 2007 CanLII 13949] (ON SC) at para 32&lt;br&gt;

see also: R v Henry 2002 NSCA 33 at para. 21&lt;br&gt; R v Zeek, 2004 BCCA 42&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Only in exceptional circumstances can the lack of remorse be taken as aggravating.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hawkins, 2011 NSCA 7 at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addiction and Substance Abuse===
Substance abuse, by itself, is not ordinarily a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ayorech, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82] at 10&lt;/ref&gt;
Nor is a history of addiction a mitigating factor to sentence. However, it can suggest a lower level of moral culpability and otherwise good character but for the addiction. It is also helpful for the court to know about to determine whether rehabilitation is a possibility when crafting an appropriate sentence.

Gambling addiction is not generally a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Holmes [http://canlii.ca/t/5s4c 1999 ABCA 228]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Mental Health===
Mental health can be a mitigating factor to sentence even where it is not so severe to remove criminal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Peters [http://canlii.ca/t/1nc5q 2000 NFCA 55], (2000), 194 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 184 (NLCA), (“the mental illness of an offender will often be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing even though it is not of the sort that would establish a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, can be a mitigating factor even when there is no a direct causal connection between the offence and the illness. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ayorech, [2012] A.J. No. 236, at para. 10 (“mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia, can significantly mitigate a sentence, even if the evidence does not disclose that the mental illness was the direct cause of the offence or that it was carried out during a period of delusions, hallucinations, or such.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is also true where the offender was not suffering from delusions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;R v Resler, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167]&lt;br&gt;R v Ayorech, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sufficient that the illness contributed in some way to the offence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Belcourt, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d2hg 2010 ABCA 319] &lt;/ref&gt; However, the offender's mental health condition is not a factor in sentencing where there is no connection at all between the offence and the condition.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shahnawaz, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbgv 2000 CanLII 16973], (2000), 149 CCC 97 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the community is generally preferred over incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Lundrigan, [2012] NJ No 231 (NLCA) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is less so for serious offences.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. J.M., [2008] N.J. No. 262 (P.C.) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor, [2012] N.J. No. 251 (P.C.))&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at times mental illness will be considered an aggravating factor that will increase sentence where it is necessary to protect the public from a dangerous persons who has committed a dangerous offence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Lockyer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nc5p 2000 NLCA 59] [2000] NJ No 306 NLCA&lt;/ref&gt;
Mental illness reduces the importance of denunciation and deterrence and increases the importance of treatment. This includes situations where rehabilitation or cure is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;R v Hiltermann, [1993] AJ No 609 (CA) at paras 4-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental illness is often considered a basis to order treatment and supervision over punishment.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Valiquette 1990 CanLII 3048 (QC CA), (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (QCCA) at 331 (“most people understand that the mentally ill require treatment and supervision, not punishment”)&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental illness diminishes the offender’s degree of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;
Ayorech [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82] at 12&lt;br&gt;
Resler [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167] at 9-10, 16&lt;br&gt; 
Belcourt [http://canlii.ca/t/2d2hg 2010 ABCA 319]  at 7-8&lt;br&gt; 
R v Muldoon, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pzrv 2006 ABCA 321] at 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

It will also attenuate the relative importance of deterrence and denunication.&lt;REf&gt;
R v Tremblay, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p97b 2006 ABCA 252] at para 7 &lt;Br&gt;
R v Resler, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167] at para 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

An Offenders mental illness can make a jail sentence more severe.&lt;ref&gt;Ayorech at 13  (“Ayorech’s mental disorders have left him vulnerable, such that Dr. Santana opined that he ‘was ill equipped to survive in the prison system.’&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished intellectual capacity however is not a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v H.(M.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1jjnk 2004 SKCA 171]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive deficit from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) result in limited restraints as well as appreciation of the immorality of their actions. This reduces the impact on deterrence and denunciation and increases the mitigation on sentence.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Ramsay [http://canlii.ca/t/fsl7t 2012 ABCA 257] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Cultural background===
Cultural and customary differences cannot be considered mitigating where it involves offences of violence or offences of a sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tapia (1990) (Ont.CA)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Brown [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6kf 1992 CanLII 2829] (AB CA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sympathy and compassion===
The court may allow for a degree of leniency for sympathetic or compassionate offenders.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Voutsis (1989), 47 CCC 451 (Sask. CA)&lt;/ref&gt; This will occasionally be done where the accused can show that his &quot;health is so precarious&quot; that the offender may not survive if they are incarcerated. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Michel 1996, 133 WAC 237 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply poor health or age is not usually a reason on its own.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shah, [http://canlii.ca/t/1dcv9 1994 CanLII 1290] (1994), 94 CCC 45 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt;

R. v. FDM (1995), 29 WBC 148 (AltaCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not however a factor to consider the risk of harm to an individual while in custody.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Campbell (1978), NSCA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on Immigration===

Section 64 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states:
{{quotation|
64(1) '''No appeal for inadmissibility'''&lt;br&gt;
No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality.
&lt;P&gt;
64(2) '''Serious criminality'''&lt;br&gt;
For the purpose of subsection (1), serious criminality must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least two years.

The risk of deportation can be a factor to consider sentencing. &lt;ref&gt;
R v Hamilton [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA), (2004), 72 OR (3d) 1 at para 156, 186 CCC (3d) 129 (CA)[http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9#par156 para 159]&lt;br&gt;

It cannot by itself remove a sentence from what would otherwise be the appropriate range. At most it can serve to move the sentence a small amount, nothing more.&quot;) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact on the ability to get a VISA to places like the US may influence the court to consider an absolute discharge over a conditional discharge due to the treatment of probation to immigration.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Dzabic, [http://canlii.ca/t/218bd 2008 CanLII 53860] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aboriginal background===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Aboriginal Principles and Factors]]

{{reflist|2}}

==Circumstances of the Offence==

===Degree of Planning===
A greater degree of planning increases the moral culpability of the offender. Where the offence involved significant preparatory work it suggests that the offender is of bad character due to time on the commission of an offence. The court is more likely to conclude the person is a &quot;career criminal&quot;.

Closely related to this is the degree of sophistication of the offence. An offender with a great deal of intelligence and drive is more culpable due to the ability to have insight into their conduct including the harm that would result from it.

===Duration of the Offence===
The duration of the offence is a useful measure of the offender's culpability. An offence that is ongoing for a period of time requires that the accused continuously decided to continue in a criminal endeavour. As they continue to decided to commit the offence their responsibility for the outcome increases.

Related to this, it is a factor to consider whether the offender stopped the offence by their own accord due to a decision to cease criminal activity or whether they merely stopped because they have achieved their goal or were caught in the act.

===Age of the Offence===
Most often seen in the context of historical sexual assault offences, the “antiquity of the offence is not usually a mitigating feature”
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R. (A.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1npk9 1994 CanLII 4524] (MB CA), [1994] 4 W.W.R. 620 (Man. C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt; However, “the offender may be entitled to a somewhat reduced sentence if he has led an exemplary life during the intervening years and demonstrates genuine remorse.  Such circumstances would obviate the need for individual deterrence and time for rehabilitation.”&lt;ref&gt;R v RA [http://canlii.ca/t/1npk9 1994 CanLII 4524] at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Role in Offence===
The accused's role in the offence will influence the penalty. Typically the greater and more culpable a role the accused played, the greater the penalty. This is particularly the case where the party has less autonomy, control, or awareness of the circumstances. 

A &quot;look out&quot; or &quot;driver&quot; may be seen as less serious than those who participated in the offence itself.

===Breach of Trust===
Where an offender was able to commit an offence by taking advantage of their position of trust, this factor will be treated as aggravating.

Where there is a breach of the public's trust it will be treated as aggravating beyond private breach of trust.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gill, [http://canlii.ca/t/5bql 2003 BCCA 208]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Lecourt [http://canlii.ca/t/1lp59 2005 QCCA 845]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Harm or Risk of Harm on Victim===
Consideration of the harm or risk of harm to a victim includes consideration of the extent of violence used.

A vulnerable victim will typically be treated as an aggravating factor. A child victim or person with physical or mental disabilities will be considered particularly aggravating.

===Victim Under 18===
Section 718.01 requires that &quot;[w]hen a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.&quot;  

In relation to s.718.01, the Alberta Court of Appeal has stated that it &quot;has always been the position of this court in dealing with crimes against defenseless children that a strong response was warranted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v Nickle, 2012 ABCA 158 (CanLII) at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Public abhorrence of type of crime===
The public's abhorrence of the type of crime is a factor that enhances the penalties in sentence. Through the principle of denunciation, the courts have an obligation to express the abhorrence of the public of a particular offence such a offences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W.H.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1x3wq 1994 CanLII 7583] (NS SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevalence of this type of crime in the community ===

===Degree of cooperation with Police===

===State Misconduct===
A sentence may “be reduced in light of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the level of a Charter breach.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2010/2010scc6/2010scc6.html#par53]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

====Police Misconduct====
Police misconduct during an investigation can play a factor in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pigeon [http://canlii.ca/t/1d9hn 1992 CanLII 869] (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
This includes having a mitigating factor where an accused's Charter rights have been breached.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, conduct amounting to basic violation of a procedural right under the charter will not usually result in a reduction where the breach does not invoke s. 24(1) of the Charter. &lt;ref&gt;
eg. R. v. Charanek, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpcnj 2011 ABPC 374] &lt;/ref&gt;

In exceptional cases, the charges may be stayed.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2010/2010onca471/2010onca471.html 2010 ONCA 471]

'''Use of Force by Peace Officers'''&lt;br&gt;
{{Quotation|
Protection of persons acting under authority&lt;br&gt;
25. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in the administration or enforcement of the law
:(a) as a private person,
:(b) as a peace officer or public officer,
:(c) in aid of a peace officer or public officer, or
:(d) by virtue of his office,
&lt;P&gt;
is, if he acts on reasonable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.
&lt;P&gt;
Idem&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a person is required or authorized by law to execute a process or to carry out a sentence, that person or any person who assists him is, if that person acts in good faith, justified in executing the process or in carrying out the sentence notwithstanding that the process or sentence is defective or that it was issued or imposed without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.
&lt;P&gt;
When not protected&lt;BR&gt;
(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
&lt;P&gt;
When protected&lt;br&gt;
(4) A peace officer, and every person lawfully assisting the peace officer, is justified in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a person to be arrested, if
:(a) the peace officer is proceeding lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, the person to be arrested;
:(b) the offence for which the person is to be arrested is one for which that person may be arrested without warrant;
:(c) the person to be arrested takes flight to avoid arrest;
:(d) the peace officer or other person using the force believes on reasonable grounds that the force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the peace officer, the person lawfully assisting the peace officer or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm; and
:(e) the flight cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.

}}

Where a peace officer uses force that is not covered by s.25, a possible violation of the accused’s section 7 Charter rights arises.&lt;reF&gt;Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a violation of the “security of the person” in the context of a criminal prosecution where there is “state interference with bodily integrity and serious state-imposed psychological stress”&lt;ref&gt;R v Morgentaler, [1988] 1 SCR 30, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftjt 1988 CanLII 90] &lt;/ref&gt;

Peace officers are expected to use force to effect an arrest or prevent flight from custody. This power is constrained by proportionality, necessity, and reasonableness.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of force under s.25(3) is determined on a subjective and objective basis.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier v Greave, [2001] OJ No. 634 (ONSC) at 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Police should not be judged on a standard of perfection. It should be expected that they will be reacting quickly in emergency situations.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncharged Criminal Conduct===
Offenders are only sentenced “in respect of crimes for which they have been specifically charged and of which they have been validly convicted.”&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Larche, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xv 2006 SCC 56], [2006] 2 S.C.R. 762&lt;/ref&gt;


Prior uncharged conduct cannot be used as an aggravating factor, however, can be relevant to sentencing as it shows character and background.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. B.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/20swc 2008 ONCA 645] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, under section [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec725 725(1)(d)], &quot;In determining the sentence, a court ... (c) may consider any facts forming part of the circumstances of the offence that could constitute the basis for a separate charge.&quot;

An offender cannot be punished for unproven acts.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 368 SCR 2&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Lees, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tx81 1979 CanLII 43] (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 749 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Circumstances of the Proceedings==
=== Guilty Plea ===
A guilty plea is a mitigating factor in a number of respects. It is evidence of remorse &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cardiner (1982) 68 CCC 477 (SCC)&lt;br&gt; 
Wisniewski, (1975) 29 CRNS 342 (Ont.)&lt;/ref&gt;, it saves the justice system resources, and it excuses victims from the stress of having to testify. The offender is not entitled to a sentence reduction simply for pleading guilty but rather it is within the discretion of the judge to account for a guilty plea in sentencing.
 
A lack of guilty plea is not an aggravating factor. However, related to a lack of a guilty plea, if the accused was convicted after trial where testimony of the accused was determined to be false, the judge may consider that as aggravating.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vickers (1998), (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The amount of credit given for a guilty plea it not fixed as it can mitigate in several different ways. It has been suggested however that it can often lead to a reduction of sentence by one-third.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Conlon, 2011 ABPC 259
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Bail conditions===
Strict bail conditions are not treated as equivalent to pre-trial detention, and so remand credit is not applicable for strict bail conditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Panday, [http://canlii.ca/t/1svfg 2007 ONCA 598]&lt;/ref&gt; The court may consider the bail conditions that the offender up to the date of sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Downes, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2006/2006canlii3957/2006canlii3957.html 2006 CanLII 3957] (ON CA) at 23&lt;/ref&gt; If the individual was under house arrest conditions for bail, this may be accounted as a reason to reduce the sentence as the house arrest may have a punitive element to it.  This is a discretionary, however, and will usually needed to be justified by showing that the offender's circumstances were particularly tough beyond the average person.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Knockwood  [http://canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2009/2009nsca98/2009nsca98.html 2009 NSCA 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictive bail conditions should be treated flexibly. The amount of credit, if any, is in the discretion of the trial judge to determine.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Downes, [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.) at para. 36 (“a trial judge faced with an offender who has spent time on bail under house arrest should adopt a flexible approach, . . . the amount of credit and the manner in which it is to be taken into account as a mitigating factor is a matter for the trial judge.”) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, the following guidelines were suggested in R v Downes 2006 CanLII 3957 (ONCA)&lt;ref&gt;
R v Downes, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mkm6 2006 CanLII 3957] (ONCA) at para 37; R v Ijam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1svv8 2007 ONCA 597] at 63&lt;/ref&gt;:
::*Time spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions, especially house arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor.
::*As such, the trial judge must consider the time spent on bail under house arrest in determining the length of sentence.
::*The failure of the trial judge to explain why time spent on bail under house arrest has not been taken into account is an error in principle.
::*The amount of credit to be given for time spent on bail under house arrest is within the discretion of the trial judge and there is no formula that the judge is required to apply.
::*The amount of credit will depend upon a number of factors including, the length of time spent on bail under house arrest; the stringency of the conditions; the impact on the offender’s liberty; the ability of the offender to carry on normal relationships, employment and activity.
::*Where the offender asks the trial judge to take pre-sentence bail conditions into account, the offender should supply the judge with information as to the impact of the conditions.  If there is a dispute as to the impact of the conditions, the onus is on the offender to establish those facts on a balance of probabilities in accordance with s. 724(3) of the Criminal Code.

===Delay===
Delay between the date of the offence and sentence is not reason for mitigation. If the delay is due to flight of the accused from the jurisdiction he is not entitled to any benefit from the passage of time. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Jansons,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/yk/ykca/doc/2008/2008ykca15/2008ykca15.html 2008 YKCA 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dated offences, such as historical [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Sexual Assault|sexual assault]], do not warrant a significant reduction on penalty simply due to the time that has passed since the offence as the magnitude of the offence and degree of culpability remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Archibald [http://canlii.ca/t/frv7l 2012 ABCA 202] (CanLII) at para. 13
&lt;/ref&gt;

On serious offences, the passage of time between the offence and sentence does not reduce the need for denunciation or deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Partridge, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m6lq 2005 NSCA 159] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors in delay to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Critton, [2002] O.J. No. 2594 (ONSC) per Hill, J at para. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
# the effect of delay on sentencing is a case‑specific inquiry
# deliberate acts to evade detection by the authorities, whether flight or contribution to delayed complaint tend to weigh against assigning mitigating impact to the fact of delay
# reform and rehabilitation during the intervening period tend to eliminate the prospect of recidivism and to nullify the need for specific deterrence to be reflected in the court's disposition
# certain very serious crimes require sentences with measures of general deterrence and denunciation regardless of the offender's lengthy crime‑free existence subsequent to the crime(s)
# objectively speaking, taking into account delay, the court's disposition should not be seen as a reward or benefit eliminating or depreciating the concept of proportionate punishment.

===Pre-trial custody===

{{quotation|
719.&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Determination of sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
:(3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.
&lt;p&gt;
:(3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8).
&lt;p&gt;'''Reasons'''
:(3.2) The court shall give reasons for any credit granted and shall cause those reasons to be stated in the record.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec719 CCC]
}}

Section 719(3.1) consists of amendments from 2010 where the practice of giving 2:1 credits was significantly limited. Certain judges have given 1.5:1 credit where warranted for loss of remission.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnson,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2011/2011oncj77/2011oncj77.html 2011 ONCJ 77]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Dann,  [http://canlii.org/en/ns/nspc/doc/2011/2011nspc22/2011nspc22.html 2011 NSPC 22]
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The judge cannot deny pre-trial custody credit to a sentence simply because of the nature his record.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Crawford,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2010/2010abca290/2010abca290.html 2010 ABCA 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Civil Liability===

Where the offender is likely to face substantial civil liability and he is not otherwise impecunious, then this should be a factor in sentence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stone, [http://canlii.ca/t/4z2g 2001 BCCA 728] at 32-35&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sadler, [http://canlii.ca/t/25j6c 2009 BCCA 386] at 23-29&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Prohibited factors==
It is generally considered improper to consider factors such as:
* comments of the public or media
* past acquittal or pardons
* conduct of defence counsel
* character of the victim or other parties
* risk of harm while incarcerated

      <text xml:space="preserve">The case begins with the initial contact with the client. Either by phone or in person, the client will wish to have representation regarding an outstanding criminal matter.

The initial period is where the lawyer must attempt to gain as much information about the circumstances as possible. The lawyer will wish to first learn the name and location of the client, the charges laid, the name of the arresting officer, and the date and location that the charges will be heard.

== Establishing the solicitor-client relationship ==

During the initial meeting, the lawyer should explain the meaning of solicitor-client privilege, and how the contents of the meeting are private and cannot be revealed by the lawyer, even if he is brought before a judge to testify. The lawyer may only reveal contents of the meeting with the permission of the client.

=== Controlling Ground Rules ===
It must be made clear that the lawyer controls the proceedings and ''not'' the client. Many junior lawyers make the mistake of differing too many aspects of the case to the client. The lawyer is not a mouthpiece for the client. The lawyer has the exclusive choice of which witnesses to call except in the case of the Defendant testifying.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown (CA 2055, Vancouver Registry, October 18, 1984), Nemetz C.J.B.C. and Craig J.A. agreeing : &quot;An accused person does not have the right to dictate to his counsel as to how the case for the defence is to be presented.  The exception to this rule is that the accused has the right to testify and cannot be prevented from testifying by his counsel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The key decisions of the client are the choice of plea, the election of court, and the choice to testify in their own defence. The lawyer may only provide advice with respect to each decision, but cannot make the decision for the client.

=== General Advice and Instructions ===
The lawyer in most cases should advise the client the following:
* not to discuss the case with anyone as they may questioned and the information given could be used against them in trial
* not to attempt to contact potential crown witnesses as it may come out at trial and may result in further criminal charges for interfering with justice system participants
* obtain the names and contact information of potential witnesses that may be useful for the defence's case

== Summary of the case ==

=== Client's background ===

The lawyer should obtain basic background information, including:
# age
# marital status
# living arrangement
# education
# occupation
# work history
# physical and mental health history
# addiction and counselling history
# criminal record

=== Charges ===
It is important to identify the charges that have been laid against the client. Once known, the lawyer should determine the factual elements that need to be proven by the Crown attorney to make out the offence.

=== Disclosure ===
The lawyer should review the disclosure before meeting to discuss the client's case. The client may be provided with a copy for their review prior to obtaining an outline of events from them. 

It is particularly important to review any statement made by the client to the police.

=== Summary of events ===

From a defence lawyer's perspective, it is important to get the client's version of events as soon as possible. The client will be in the best position to provide a full summary earlier on in the proceedings than they will at a later point in the proceedings. This can be done by way of client interview in the office. The lawyer may generate a statement by taking notes or dictating summary of the interview or by recording the whole interview for transcription. 

Where the client is sophisticated enough and the resources of firm is limited, it may be beneficial to have the client write out the incident on their own. 

In all circumstances, the lawyer must be mindful that if the client or witness will be using the statement to refresh their memory in court, the document may need to be authenticated, and the other side will be entitled to review it and cross-examine on it. As such, it is often better to have a third party record the statement, and that the circumstances of the creation of the statement be carefully noted.

=== Possible penalties ===
At some early stage it is essential to be clear to the client what are the possible penalties for the charges. This would likely include notifying the client of the maximum penalties (including possible crown election), but most importantly the ''likley'' penalties involved. 

This can be a difficult issue to handle. Many clients want assurances on particular outcomes, especially if there is a prospect of the client going to jail. However, it is always hazardous to guarantee an outcome.

==Choice of Trial (Judge or Jury)==
The choice of mode of trial is critical for defence counsel and will have a significant effect on how the trial is performed. There is no hard and fast rules to when to chose a judge and jury trial. 

Factors that are often considered are as follows:
* the accused's presentation
* whether the accused will testify
* whether the trial relies on technical and legal arguments
* whether there is a strong emotional appeal for the defence
* whether the case is potentially inflammatory or distasteful
* whether the crown witnesses have a strong emotional appeal
* the strength and complexity of the defence's case
* the strength and complexity of the crown's case
* who the judge is
* who the opposing counsel is

{{comment}} I came across this page when I did my big sweep of all pages to find books that lacked alphabetical tags.  It is still on a list on my user page with some other pages that appear to be part of books, but the books do not exist.  The page still exists on wikipedia, the reason it was transwikied here all those years ago was to preserve the section on usage.  This section has never re-appeared on wikipedia.  In the current case this is really about a paragraph, and maybe doesn't represent a lot of work? I don't know.  I only mention it because this idea might apply to other transwikied pages.  They may contain sections/information that was later taken out of the wikipedia page, even though the corresponding wikipedia pages have sinced continued to develop to much better encyclopedia articles.

:I personally would not want Wikibooks to become a repository for content Wikipedia doesn't want, even if it's not textbook material. That's why I haven't been handling most of the &quot;copy to wikibooks&quot; tagged articles at Wikipedia, as they seem to be tagged in the sense of &quot;let's push this over to Wikibooks&quot;, similar to sweeping dirt under the rug. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
::To Duplode: Yes it violates [[:w:WP:INDISCRIMINATE]], as well as some others in [[:w:WP:NOT]]. However, does that mean it has to come to Wikibooks? Like Adrignola said, doing so is like (oh well, I'll use a Chinese phrase) sweeping your snow to your neighbour's house. That's not good at all; in fact, I doubt if those who tagged for Wikibooks transwiki articles know the project scope of WB.

::: I'd argue the violation at WP was more specific, namely [[w:WP:NOTMANUAL]]. It costs nothing to note that [[w:WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]] points to the same policy item, and that [[WB:WIW]] does include manuals in project scope. That observation being made, I must concede I did not consider the point that, ideally, editors should only request WP&gt;&gt;WB transferences if they have some plan on what to do with the imported pages. As the chances of a reasonable book/manual/guide on &quot;Medical Equipment&quot; blossoming out of this single section are indeed very small, ''maybe'' the dirt/rug and snow/frontyard considerations provide grounds for deletion in this case. Straying a bit away from the immediate subject, however, this line of reasoning leads me to another thought: should we apply the same principles next time any of us casually suggests a Transwiki to Wikiversity as a RfD outcome? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 02:07, 16 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: I don't mind starting automated RfD on pages that are moved from Wikipedia, that in themselves seem not to be  fit to be a stub for future evolution here (it would provide some more visibility to that content). Wikipedia should preserve valid content, as we do, when we move content that seems to be in line with the scope of other projects (like Wikiversity). It is up to the destination project to see if the content is usable or not at the destination.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:35, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

::Might make me sound stupid, but what do you mean by 'I would like a reference to the original source material at Wikisource to be added'?

{{del}} After some thought I have decided that the page that is written is not suitable as neither a book nor a manual.  The page was transwikied here in order to save the information about its useage, but the information given on this page is known to anyone familiar with the device, and can readily be found by a google search.  Given the existing page on wikipedia, it would be easier to write a better quality page from a fresh transwiki, plus a few sentences.  Provided of course at some point there is a book on medical equipment, and this device falls under its scope.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:57, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose and Objectives==

It is often said that the purpose of the direct examination is to hear from the witness, while the purpose of the cross examination is to hear from the lawyer. That is, a lawyer should never cross examine with a view to learning information, but rather have the witness confirm information that is already known by the lawyer. That is why the main cross-examiner's tool is the leading question. The open question seeks facts while the closed question provides facts.

To enumerate it briefly, the purpose of cross examine is to:
# attack the witnesses' credibility and reliability, 
# bring out evidence that is helpful to the case and 
# bring out evidence that is harmful to the opponent's case.

This is accomplished by canvasing issues such as:
# Capacity to observe, recollect and recall
# Reliability
# Character
# Bias

In Munkman, The Technique of Advocacy (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1986), three techniques of cross-examination are outlined:
# confrontation: confront the witness with facts that they cannot deny which assist your case, such as inconsistencies in the witnesses statements
# probing: carefully exploring the details of their story to find flaws;
# insinuation: bringing out a different version of the evidence-in-chief by bringing up facts and possibilities

The key to a good cross examination involves knowledge of your theory of the case and the evidence, control of the witnesses, and control of oneself.

==Preparation==
Every book discussing cross-examination focuses on the need for thorough preparation. 

First, the most essential step of preparation is knowing the case inside-and-out. This would mean knowing what each witness has said in the past, such as prior statements, and having a good understanding of what they may say in court.

Second, the advocate must have a mastery of the parties theory of the case. It is the touchstone that should guide all the questions and should be the reference anytime the proceedings go off track or something unexpected occurs.

===Review evidence===
Investigate the central witnesses for the following:

# criminal record
# report of prior immoral acts
# other signs of bad character or reputation
# is the testimony potentially inconsistent with prior statements
# are there reasons for bias or prejudice against the accused
# does the witness have a relationship with an adverse party?
# is there a motive to falsify their testimony?
# are there physical/mental disabilities that may affect their testimony?
# other documents or witnesses that may contradict their testimony?
# are any facts likely improbable due to other known facts?


===Cross examination outline===
As part of the preparation of a Trial Book, you should be preparing an outline of your cross-examination. An examiner should always have a written-out list of goals for the examination, and how those goals can be reached. But the advocate should ''never'' be reading the questions to the witness.



===During direct examination===
By the time the direct examination of the witness is occurring you should have already prepared your cross-examination. The frequent practice is to use the time to record direct the direct examination. This is useful in that you can cite directly from testimony during argument and can have a written record of the actual evidence.

There is some who view that writing out the direct evidence is counter-productive. Rather, you should only take notes on points for your cross-examination. It is suggested that you have it recorded by someone else. This, however, is not always practical to  counsel who are conducting the trial on their own. However, a well-prepared trial will unlikely lead to new information coming from the witness's direct evidence. 

This time, instead, should be used to assess the witness. The witness should be observed for how they react to pressure; verbal and physical cues suggesting the truth. Keep an eye on the judge's reaction to the witness as well. This should be used to determine the approach in cross-examination.

Consider any statements that deviate from prioer statements as well as any assumptions or misstatements.

==Tools of Examination==

===Looping===
A looping question is one where a useful fact is repeated within multiple questions. In each iteration, new information is sought. This technique is intended to create emphasis on particular facts through repetition.

===Impeachment===

==Types of Witnesses==

===Honest Witness===
Ironically, the honest witness can be the most undesirable witness for cross-examination. That is, because none of the regular methods of showing biases or cognitive errors will work. 

This type of witness is generally trying to be helpful. The simpler approach would be a constructive cross which is aimed at get out as many useful positive facts out from the witness as possible. 

A destructive cross is more difficult. The most effective approach is to attempt to have the witness honestly admit to deficits in their observations. An honest witness is readily prepared to admit to any risks of error or lack of knowledge they may have had.

===Forgetful Witness===

When a witness states that they &quot;don't recall&quot;, consider whether it was something that they should have been remembered and taken note of. In the cross, establish that the fact forgotten is one that was ''important'' to remember inferring that they are not reliable due to their failure to remember.

===Evasive Witness===

===Argumentative Witness===

===Ignorant or Stubborn Witness=== 
These witnesses are those who have come to their own conclusions with limited facts. They are highly confident in their position and will not budge from it. They are not necessarily lying or biased, but rather have strong personal animus against any challenges to their beliefs.

The approach to the cross of these witnesses is to attack the basis of their conclusions. By picking out the elements that make up their conclusion, eventually they will be put into a position of defending unsupported grounds. Often this involves simply going through all their observations that they had, as well as what they did not know at the time, that lead them to their conclusion.

===Biased Witnesses===
Biased witnesses are those who have some interest in the outcomes of the trial. They may be an accused, a victim, have a close connection to one of them, or they may have some external interests that are met by not giving a fair and careful recitation of their recollection.

The most obvious approach is to bring out these biases to show the trier of fact the motive the witness has to not give full and frank evidence.

===Lying Witness===
A destructive cross can be highly effective against a lying witness. 

These witnesses will invent a story that best supports their desired outcome. They will attempt to craft a story that matches as much of the evidence beyond dispute as possible. Invariably they cannot craft a story to cover all this evidence and consequently there will be basis of impeachment within the evidence. Where they are successful in covering all undisputable evidence they are often left in a position where their story has been stretched to fit the other facts to a point of losing much of the logic and reasonableness of their story.

===Child Witness===

===Police Officers===
Police officers are professional testifiers and so their evidence will almost always be well organized. They will usually give a lot of information without much prompting from the prosecution and are not shaken or confused easily. 

Due to their skill in giving evidence to enhance the prosecutions' case, it is often best to focus on what they did not observe or what they observed but did not take notes on.

'''Adding new facts to the case'''&lt;br&gt;
Officer's will often give testimony to essential facts that was not in any of the disclosure notes or reports.  Counsel should attempt to restrict the testimony back to what was written out. When questioning on this, the officer will often dismiss this omission by saying that the notes were not intended to include everything but were only a &quot;summary&quot;. 

The problem with this is that it could permit officers add additional evidence whenever they want including on redirect where cross-examination may not be possible.

Respond to this by questioning the officer on the importance of having the questions as complete and accurate as possible.

'''Changing facts of the case'''&lt;br&gt;
When the officer changes or deviates from the story, this change must be attacked for backpedaling. The inference to be drawn it that the officer realized that there was damaging information in the report and so was attempting to undo it. An ethical prosecutor should be equally disapproving of this change but this is not always the case.

'''Dodging questions'''&lt;br&gt;
If the officer answers that they &quot;can't speculate&quot; to a question of what they would have done if &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; happened, you must correct him. He is not speculating if he is talking about what he would have done. It is only speculation if it concerns what someone ''else'' would have done in the circumstances. Instead, ask him what he has done on prior occasions that were similar to the circumstances proposed.

===Mentally Ill===


===Informers and Accomplices===

==General Techniques==
A key skill in cross-examination is listening. There are frequently used statements made by witnesses that can often be used to the examiner's advantage and should be attacked when heard.

'''Attack speculation'''&lt;br&gt;
A witness may hedge their statements by stating &quot;it seems&quot;, &quot;I think&quot;, &quot;I suppose&quot;, &quot;I guess&quot;. This can be brought out as speculation which is reduces the weight of the evidence or renders it inadmissible.

'''Attack probabilities'''&lt;br&gt;
A witness will often state that something is &quot;possible&quot; rather than probable to any specific degree. This can be favourable or undesirable depending on the matter referred to. Lock them into greater certainty if you want more of a commitment or else leave it if you intend to argue that the statement should be given little weight.

'''Attack Use of absolutism'''&lt;br&gt;
When a witness says &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; consider whether they are overselling their position. When a biased witness or expert witness uses this language they can be made to show the witness is an advocate for the other side. 

'''Evading the Question'''&lt;br&gt;
Often the witness will not answer the question and argue with the question or discuss something else. Do not argue with them or else you will lose control of the witness. Re-direct the witness to the question by stating &quot;That means yes?&quot; or &quot;That means no?&quot;

'''Empty Cross-examinations'''&lt;br&gt;
There is the rare time where there is nothing to ask of a particular witness and for optics to the client or the jury it would be harmful to the case to not ask the witness anything. In such situations, questions can cover a number of issues

# who approached them to be a witness 
# who did he talk to about their evidence (when, where, with who)
# made any prior statements (notes, written statments, etc)
# preparation for testifying (read over documents, prior statements, transcripts)
# being paid to attend
# is familiar with any of the parties or witnesses
# any benefit in the outcome of the case
# subpoenaed or came on their own

==Do's and Don't of Cross Examination==

'''Do'''&lt;br&gt;
# phrase the question to elicit one piece of information at a time 
# Do phrase your questions as short as possible
# Do keep your language simple

'''Don't'''&lt;br&gt;
# Don't ask questions you don't know the answer to
# Don't cross on trivial matters that the judge likely is not interested in
# Don't ask questions that covers the direct evidence
# don't argue with the witness
# don't allow the witness to explain themselves
# ask a witness why another witness is lying (R. v. Ellard (2003), 173 CCC 28 (BCCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2003/2003bcca68/2003bcca68.html])

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, before we start this book, let's give you a taste of how cool and weird bugs are. Let's start with these...

* Exploding termites are appropriately named &amp;mdash; when they sense attackers, they guard their territory and splatter them with their insides.
* Fairyflies are the smallest insects in the world &amp;mdash; just 0.02 centimetres &amp;mdash; that's as small as the tip of a needle!  And besides being so tiny, they insert their eggs into eggs of other insects, by using their sting.  So they're not even flies, but a kind of wasp.
* When it feels attacked, one kind of South African cockroach stands on its head and hisses.
* One kind of caterpillar, the Polyphemus moth caterpillar, can eat over 86,000 times its weight before turning into a moth.
* Scuttle flies can eat shoe polish and paint.
* If you weighed all the insects in the world, they'd be heavier than all other animals put together.

Now it's time to delve deeper into the weird world of barmy bugs and other irksome insects. Have fun!

==Reply to email==
Thanks for the welcome !   Hey I am having a problem with the correct tagging of images for my wikibook.  There were flagged as &quot;You've uploaded a derivative work&quot; message. The image was showing how-to installation of an Open Source Application (we developed) using Open Source Software called Palo by Jedox (downloadable for free).   Image was screen shot showing steps how to download and correctly install on user's computer.  Can You Help ??

:I will do my best.  The feeling is (I think) that since you were not the one to design the interface, buttons, etc then images of the software are actually derived from the the work of the programmers.  Though screen shots of free software are allowed.  When uploading a file at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Upload commons]  choose the sixth bullet &quot;It is a free software screenshot&quot;.  On the next page choose &quot;GNU General Public License (GPL)&quot;, I am trusting wikipedia to get the license correct on this.  This should get the correct tag put on the image.  Once you upload one file and see what the correct tag looks like you can copy it to the &quot;edit this page&quot; just as you can here and copy the code and copy it to the other images you've uploaded.  Updating appropriately of course.  But the people at commons might be more helpful than I. You can try asking at their [[Commons:Village pump|Village pump]].

|website=http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2
|long description=EMAN2 is a software suite for scientific image processing, with a particular focus on TEM and single particle analysis. New tools are being added to support other specialties such as IHRSR (helical processing in real-space), RCT (random conical tilt) and single particle cryoET. It is a complete refactoring of the original EMAN suite. EMAN2 has a tiered strucutre with an easy to use workflow interface at the top, followed by high-level command line programs, low level command line programs, Python scripting support and core C++ libraries. All user programs including the GUIs are written in Python, so they may be customized or modified without even downloading the (freely available) source. The GUI includes widgets for 3-D display (isosurface, volume rendering and slices), single 2-D images, multiple 2-D images, 2-D plots and 3-D plots. The core library consists of several hundred image processing routines, as well as objects for conversion between orientation conventions and various data formats. It is a fully modular system, meaning newly added algorithms (for example a new filter, or a new 3-D reconstruction routine) automatically and immediately appear in all GUI's and command-line programs.

{{EM software tool
|name=EMAN
|website=http://blake.bcm.edu/eman
|long description=A suite of scientific image processing tools aimed primarily at single particle reconstruction. This is a technique for determining the 3-D structure of a molecule or macromolecular assembly from thousands to hundreds of thousands of noisy images of individual molecules, generally collected on a transmission electron microscope. EMAN's focus is on providing state of the art single particle reconstruction methods automated to the greatest extent possible. The goal is to permit even novice users to be able to reconstruct macromolecular structures with high veracity and at high resolution. It also has a variety of tools for more generic image processing, useful for electron tomography, 2-D crystallography and helical reconstructions. EMAN consists of a ~100,000 line C++ library with bindings to the popular Python programming language. It offers literally hundreds of different scientific image processing algorithms including Fourier processing, real-space filters, 3-D reconstruction, projection, etc. In EMAN2, all user-level programs, including GUI programs, are written in Python, permitting the advanced user to easily customize aspects of the package. EMAN is funded by the [http://www.nigms.nih.gov/ NIGMS] through grant R01GM080139.

|long description=At the heart of RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN, pronounce rely-on) lies a refinement program that employs an empirical Bayesian approach to refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). It is developed in the group of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Briefly, the ill-posed problem of 3D-reconstruction is regularised by incorporating prior knowledge: the fact that macromolecular structures are smooth, i.e. they have limited power in the Fourier domain. In the corresponding Bayesian framework, many parameters of a statistical model are learned from the data, which leads to objective and high-quality results without the need for user expertise. Recent developments around this program have turned RELION into a general package, in which most of the single-particle analysis tasks may be performed.

|name=BBHP - Burnham-Brandeis Helical Package

|long description=The Brandeis Helical Package has been in use in one form or another for quite some time.  Originally developed for VAX/VMS it has been modified, expanded, and ported several times.   We first ported the package to Linux in 2006, using the Portland Group compilers.  Subsequently we rewrote portions of the fortran code which were not supported by GNU fortran (g77) and now the package compiles and runs with gcc/g77. This has allowed us to support extra modern platforms.  The re-christened Burnham-Brandeis Helical Package will now run on 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X (Intel) and even Windows running Cygwin. At the same time, when porting to Linux, we took the opportunity to replace the main GUI  portions of the package with updated programs.  We had spent some time modifying the Tcl/Tk-based GUI programs Tkir (image viewer) and Tkll (layerline viewer) from SUPRIM to support a plugin architecture, where we could write new plugins to add functionality without further modifications to the core code-base.   The first, tkinterp, provides an interface in Tkir for selecting layerlines, replacing the old interp program.  The second, brandeisll, is a Tkll plugin to provide support for displaying the Burnham-Brandeis Helical Package &quot;interp&quot; layerline and bessel-function format. We've also included as part of the package, the AVID software for analyzing the variance within the helix.

|long description=PFT3DR is package for determining orientations and origins of imaged particles and computing a three-dimensional reconstruction from the images and their assigned orientations and origins.  The programs are enhanced versions of the PFT algorithm developed by Baker and Cheng (2000) and the Fourier Bessel reconstruction algorithm of Crowther et al. (1970).  The original adaptations of the PFT3DR programs were specific to icosahedral viruses, but were enhanced to support nearly all symmetries found in biological particles.  Other enhancements are described on the PFT3DR web site.

|website=http://em3d.stanford.edu/index.html
|long description=EM3D is a software application designed to analyze and visualize electron microscope (EM) tomography data.  It is especially for cellular and molecular biologists. From a tilt series of 2D electron micrographs taken at many tilt angles with respect to the electron beam, this program can then perform auto-align and quickly render those data into a lucid 3D model, which allows you to perform object rotating for viewing. In addition, EM3D also provides analysis tools for quantify structural information from the models, including their moments, proximity relationships, and spatial reliability.  And all of these functions can be executed with a very intuited graphic user interface. EM3D is available free-of-charge Mac OS X for PowerPC or Intel, and Windows. EM3D was developed in the laboratory of Dr. U. J. McMahan, Professor of Neurobiology and of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine and continues to be developed at the Dept. of Biology, Texas A&amp;M University.

In particular, electrons travel in curvilinear paths through the sample, and defocus and other aberrations can have significant effects.

In addition, TxBR makes provision for marker-free alignment and specialized montaging for tomography of serial sections.

{{EM software tool
|name=UCSF Tomography
|website=http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/em/EMNEW2/tomography_page.html
|long description=UCSF Tomography is an integrated software suite that provides full automation from target finding, sequential tomographic data collection, to real-time reconstruction for both single and dual axes as well as automated acquisition of random conical data sets. This software was implemented based upon a novel approach in which the compustage tilting is modeled as geometric rotation. The spatial movement of the sample as a result of stage tilting can be predicted based upon previously collected tomographic images. Therefore, there is no need to collect tracking and focusing images during the entire tomographic data collection. A significant dose saving can thus be achieved and is critical in collecting cryo tilt series. Real-time reconstruction is achieved by calculating a weighted back-projection on a small Linux cluster (five dual-processor computer nodes) concurrently with the UCSF tomography data collection running on the microscope’s computer, and using the fiducial-marker free alignment data generated during the data collection process. The real-time reconstructed 3D volume provides users with immediate feedback to fully asses all aspects of the experiment ranging from sample choice, ice thickness, experimental parameters to the quality of specimen preparation. To facilitate dual-axis tomographic data collection, a hierarchical scheme for target finding and relocation after specimen rotation was developed and integrated with the predictive data collection and real-time reconstruction, allowing full automation from target finding to data collection and to reconstruction  of 3D volumes with little user intervention. An on-site scheme was developed for random conical data collection where tracking and focusing are performed at the same location as the final conical tilt images. Lower magnifications combined with short exposure are used to substantially reduce dose and to allow larger tilt steps. The system also includes a feature for montaging untilted images to ensure that all of the particles in the tilted image may be used in the reconstruction.

== Mass measurements ==

{{EM software tool
|name=MASDET
|website=http://campus.uni-muenster.de/masdet.html
|long description=A fast and user-friendly multiplatform software for mass determination by dark-field electron microscopy. MASDET offers several subroutines for the main mass analysis steps, namely image display and selection of regions of interest (ROI), mass evaluation and data analysis. Two program-modes constitute the core procedures for mass determination: (i) the program-mode AREA determines the mass-per-area of sheet-like structures (e.g., protein S-layers, thin organic and inorganic films) and the mass-per-box for globular structures (e.g., single macromolecules, globular assemblies, organic/inorganic nanoparticles), and (ii) the program-mode FILAMENT determines the mass-per-length for filamentous structures (e.g., intermediate filaments, DNA-protein complexes, tobacco mosaic virus, nanowires) in individual ROIs. The statistical analysis of the mass data in individual ROIs contains graphical data display (histograms and XY-plots) and allows up to 10 Gaussian curves to be fitted. The dark-field micrographs can also be recalculated to a mass-thickness profile and/or mass-thickness map using data from Monte Carlo simulations.

== Resolution Estimation ==

{{EM software tool
|name=FSC
|website=http://imagescience.de/fsc/
|long description=Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation of two 3D volumes. The three-dimensional Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) measures the normalised cross correlation coefficient between two 3D volumes over corresponding shells in Fourier space, i.e., as a function of spatial frequency. The (modified) 3-sigma criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise. The 1/2-bit information threshold criteria express where we have already collected a sufficient amount of data in the final 3D reconstruction to allow a direct structural interpretation at that resolution level. The 1/2-bit curve is calibrated to approximately yield resolution values comparable to resolution values in use in X-ray crystallography (FOM).

|long description=A computational method that allows the measurement of the signal-to-noise ratio and resolution of a three-dimensional structure obtained by single particle electron microscopy and reconstruction. The method does not rely on the availability of the original image data or the calculation of several structures from different parts of the data that are needed for the commonly used Fourier Shell Correlation criterion. Instead, the correlation between neighboring Fourier pixels is calculated and used to distinguish signal from noise.

|long description=The purpose of coloRNA is the following: if we have two versions of an RNA structure (given as pdb files), differing as a consequence of conformational changes, and given the secondary structure, then the program is able to determine the distances between corresponding residues and heat-map them onto the secondary structure.  That is, very mobile/flexible residues show up in red, moderate ones in yellow and green, very stable ones in blue. So it is possible, with the aid of the program, to determine which parts of the secondary structure are responsible for the mobility of the 3D structure.

|long description=EMDataBank.org, a resource for deposition and retrieval of 3DEM map, model and associated metadata, unifies public access to the two major EM Structural Data archives: EM Data Bank (EMDB) and Protein Data Bank (PDB), and facilitates use of EM structural data by the wider scientific community.  The resource offers Java-based 3D viewers which can be accessed from EMDataBank atlas pages.   Atlas pages of interest can be found using EMSEARCH  (http://www.emdatabank.org/search.html).

AstexViewer, a molecular graphics program originally developed to display crystallographic data was recently re-released under an open source license and has been adapted  for display of EM maps and associated PDB coordinate models.  A compact map format is used to improve web download speed and minimize memory requirements (very large maps are down-sampled).  Current capabilities include ability to control map contour level, opacity, color, solid vs. mesh surface rendering, and concurrent display of one or more PDB coordinate entries.

The long term goal of the gorgon project is to be able to address to every part of the molecular modeling pipeline starting from the initial volumetric reconstruction of the complex all the way to the final placement of each individual atom. Gorgon is being developed as a collaboration between Washington University in St. Louis and Baylor College of Medicine. Gorgon currently provides the following feature categories:
**'''Visualization:''' A comprehensive visualization framework for volumetric data (iso-contours, cross-sections and solid rendering), geometric skeletons, secondary structure elements and atomic models (PDB).
**'''Geometric operations:''' Many geometric operations such as skeletonization (binary / grayscale and interactive), smoothing, resampling, cropping, etc. are provided.
**'''Protein structure prediction:''' We provide tools which allow users to find the correspondence between predicted secondary structure elements in the sequence and the observed secondary structure elements in the volume
**'''Protein backbone tracing:''' The c-alpha backbone of a protein can be easily traced manually or semi-automatically using the many supporting elements offered by Gorgon.

|long description=OpenStructure is a software development platform tailored to the implementation of novel computational structural biology and molecular modeling methods. OpenStructure has been designed to handle and manipulate a wide range of data types as required in the field of integrative modeling, where data originating from a variety of experimental techniques are used to guide the model building process. The toolkit allows the development of sophisticated stand-alone applications, but also offers interfaces to flexibly incorporate external software, where appropriate, without the need to re-implement existing functionalities. At the top level, OpenStructure features a graphical user interface with components for rendering of biological macromolecules, density maps, image stacks, widgets for sequence analysis and graphical scene setup, and an integrated Python shell. While the graphical interface is conveniently used without prior knowledge of the underlying layers, the GUI maintains a tight integration with the scripting functionality. Any object that is visualized on the screen can be accessed at the Python level. Likewise, it is possible to create and manipulate graphical objects from within a script. This setup allows the combination of human-based and automatic data analysis, and freely customizing the graphical interface itself.

== [[Adventist Adventurer Awards]] ==

Hello:
I'm new to wikibooks and lost.... I just start a new book for Adventurer Program which is for children 4-9 years old. This is a family oriented program provide it for the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
I may need a lot of help so, you will see me around here a lot.
Thanks &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Adalvis|Adalvis]] ([[User talk:Adalvis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adalvis|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:You may be interested in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] as well.  [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] is a large contributor to that book. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:33, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== Links to external sites - a guideline suggestion ==

As a new wikibookian, I surveyed the general recommendations for editors before trying my hand at contributing to the book I'm currently studying with (namely, [[Haskell]]). While doing so I saw the recommendation that, since books should be as useful in printed form as they are online, links to external sites should be used with discretion. While that guideline surely makes a lot of sense, external links are often used exactly in the same way as references to printed material are in conventional books - and for printed books no one questions the value of having such references as long as title, author and other relevant data are clearly stated so that readers can actually find said material. So, instead of just clamping down on external links, wouldn't it be better to have a guideline encouraging editors to make better use of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags? That is, instead of doing

: Check the [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html Standard Prelude specification] for reference on these default Haskell functions.

we might instead use

: Check the Standard Prelude specification &lt;ref&gt;Available at http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html&lt;/ref&gt; for reference on these default Haskell functions.

: &lt;references/&gt;

And now readers with a printed copy can just enter the web address in a browser and find the Prelude specification, just as they would do in a library with a conventional book reference. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:08, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

PS.: Of course that shouldn't be an excuse for not making books as self-contained as possible, and so references should ideally be restricted to topics that are either out of the book scope or can't be easily integrated to the book for one reason or another. Thus, the &quot;discretion&quot; part still applies, except that now in a better defined sense. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:17, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

: My impression is that this project has historically been tried to keep it light on guidelines and policies. I personally would think it was even better would be if the module referred to the  [http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-98-Language-Libraries-Revised/dp/0521826144 hard copy], on the off chance the website ceased existing.  (Which in the case of haskell.org is not very likely).  In general as long as people &quot;think before they link&quot;, I don't think we need a separate guideline about linking pages.

:: I understand the concerns about instruction creep (and why you wouldn't want thousands of WB: pages like in Wikipedia). I didn't think about a separate, brand new guideline, but rather an extra sentence in the existing guideline (such as &quot;If you really must add a link to an external site, consider doing so in a way that would be useful to people reading a printed version of the book, such as in a footnote&quot;). By the way, in the Haskell example I feel the web reference is at least as important as the book one - while the site arguably has the disadvantage of being a more &quot;volatile&quot; reference, finding or buying the book could be orders of magnitude more difficult - particularly if we are aiming at a wide international audience. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:27, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

== Good practices on module merging and book restructuring ==

Hi all,

A project to reorganize and cleanup the beginner modules of the Haskell Wikibook is being kickstarted. The current proposal for doing that would call for a major restructuring operation, with many modules being spliced beyond recognition and then having their sections shuffled and reassembled in wildly different orders (you can get an idea of the scale of the changes looking at the crude brainstorming we're doing at [[Haskell/List of topics]]). I would like to start experimental work on the reorganization ASAP, but after reading the recommendations in [[Help:Pages#Merging|Help:Merging_pages]] I got a bit confused on how to proceed. My key concerns are: 

* Exactly how much do I need to worry with things like history merges and such? 
* What would be the cleanest way to build a wholly new module from fragments extracted from, say, three different existing modules?

Thanks, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 01:21, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
:If you take pages and fully merge them into a new one, add {{tl|now merged}} to the former with the latter as a parameter to that template.  That's only if the source pages will be merged under the destination with the old location no longer used.  If the sources will remain, then linking the pages in the edit summary will suffice for attribution.  If you are breaking up a page, do it so at least some portion of the original page remains as part of the final state of the book, so the edit summaries for the new pages you make can link to a page that will continue to exist with its edit history, for attribution.  That last situation is often used when breaking a single-page 'book' into an actual book with multiple pages.  If your merging/splitting gets really complex you may wish to use permanent links in the summaries rather than wikilinks, to be very specific about which revision was pulled from. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:26, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

== Broken boxes ==

Back from a short while away, I noticed that a number of {{tl|mbox}}es are broken, seemingly after an import of a bunch of WP style boxes. I neither know the rationale for this move or how urgent it was, nor am I interested in questioning how other contributors choose to spend their time. I am, however, a bit surprised that the move didn't go smoothly. Could whoever started this please clean up after themselves? It also seems as though the new template doesn't have as many options (e.g. the &lt;code&gt;type=growth&lt;/code&gt;). Making the new ones backwards compatible should solve this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:28, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[Template:Mbox]] does have backwards compatibility added to it.  Both the older &quot;msg&quot; paramater and the newer &quot;text&quot; parameter both work.  User warnings on talk pages using &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;warning&quot; work just fine alongside the &quot;delete&quot; option (see [[Template:Tmbox/core]]).  I am sorry the box on [[Japanese]] was not corrected. I went through and corrected every template using Mbox; calling Mbox directly it blended in with [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Mbox|the other pages]] that showed up solely because they had a template using Mbox which I had already gone through to ensure that nothing was broken. With the above backwards compatibility added, the only cases I can think of where something would have been broken would be where a custom image was specified; and as I mentioned I went through all the templates using Mbox to correct for the difference in the syntax for specifying that image.  I tried hard to make sure things went smooothly to allow for {{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, {{tl|imbox}}, {{tl|cmbox}}, {{tl|ombox}}, or {{tl|fmbox}} to be called based on a multipurpose-template-using-Mbox's namespace location.  Again, I am sorry the direct call to Mbox on [[Japanese]] was missed, but I feel it's the exception. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:22, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

== Wikibooks and the British Museum? ==

Hi all, &lt;br&gt;
As some of you may be aware, next month I'll be going &quot;in-house&quot; at the British Museum in London as their volunteer &quot;Wikipedian in residence&quot; (more info [http://www.wittylama.com/2010/03/the-british-museum-and-me/ here]). Simply put, the idea is for me to spend a month there trying to work out ways that the two communities can build a productive and mutually beneficial/trusting relationship. Although I know the title is &quot;wikipedian&quot; I wanted to make sure that Wikibookians knew I didn't want to limit the scope of the activities to just that project. In fact, I think Wikibooks is possibly the single most important project for long-term [[m:GLAM|GLAM]]-Wikimedia relations. To that end, I wanted to ask if anyone here had any current projects that they think my internal access to the British Museum might be of help with - please contact me (en.wp is easiest). Equally, if anyone wanted to investigate creating a British Museum-specific wikibook (e.g. a guided tour for kids in the WikiJuniour collections?) I'm sure we can get something going there too. Let me know if you've got any ideas! All the best, &lt;br&gt; 
[[User:Witty lama|Witty lama]] ([[User talk:Witty lama|talk]]) 23:27, 9 May 2010 (UTC)
:I've read about this British Museum thingy on the Wikipedia signpost. I know nothing about the British Museum, but in my opinion it might be rather difficult to make a Wikijunior book about the British Museum, since Wikibooks is mostly about textbooks, not guidebooks. So very few editors will be able to help out. By the way, Wikijunior is somewhat inactive nowadays.

::(Re WJ:  Progress on Wikijunior these days is mostly at a slow pace, though if that's what you meant I don't see why you'd bother to remark on it.

:::Activity has been slow in many places, I don't think wikijunior is unique in this respect.  I think the british museum collaboration could very useful for the [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations]] book.  Or maybe even some of the non wikijunior books.  I think perhaps Witty lama's idea could be used to create a book on &quot;History as seen through the British Museum&quot;.  It is possible to imagine such a book would teach some real history and not be just a guide. 
::: If some editor is interested in some topic that the british museum might have some specialized knowledge about... (e.g. &quot;Cookie Recipies from Ancient Greece&quot;, I managed to find one as a kid for a school project, and they were delicious. Who know you could use cloves in cookies?) I strongly encourage that editor to get in touch Witty lama, and find out what resources this partnership brings.  It might just lead to a nice chat with some expert about some module, but already that is quite useful. Sadly I am not sure how to make use of it in my work.

== Book review? ==

As I haven't seen any such process on WB before, I would like to propose a process (possibly a new reading room) similar to a Wikiepdia peer review (not to be confused with a Wikinews one) so that people can put their books to that page and let the community comment on it. Then, if the comments are positive, or if there are only a few things left to be desired and someone (usu. a regular of that book) does it, then put it up to the featured book nominations page. It doesn't have to be compulsory, though. Currently the only place to do this is on this page, though it would probably be a little annoying to clog this place up with books that need comments on no particular aspect, just general comments.

== Trans-wiki collaboration ==

I started [[w:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Trans-wiki_collaboration|a discussion at en.wikpedia]] about how cross-pollination between projects could be beneficial to Wikibooks and the other Wikimedia projects, and it seems to be gaining momentum. The basic idea is that if we often need volunteers for maintenance and improvement of our book collection and there are many talented editors next door we should have better mechanisms for inviting them to contribute. Please share your thoughts on the ideas being discussed - in both threads if possible. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:54, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

:Interesting.  We have had WikiProjects here for getting like-minded people together on a topic.  It shouldn't be surprising that I haven't seen any activity on them for as long as I can remember and would personally consider them all defunct at this point.  [[Chess]] and [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Chess|WikiProject Chess]] and [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Chess]] may have collaborated in the past or at least would be a good example of a potential partnership.  Those concerned about flooding the project with Wikipedians will have to get past that as it's mostly individuals working on their particular books of choice right now; any coordinated effort will look like a &quot;flood&quot;.  I don't buy the cross-wiki watchlists excuse and feel it's just a case of being spoiled with everything happening at Wikipedia.  I have long been used to having to visit Meta, Commons, and Wikiversity to check my watchlists.  I'm glad you've proposed this, regardless of the outcome.  It's always seemed to me that Wikipedia and Wikibooks are closest to each other content-wise.  I think editors at Wikipedia would also find the more relaxed atmosphere of Wikibooks and the ability to write rather than debate over a couple sentences refreshing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:50, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

With this kind of collaboration, this sort of cross-linking you suggest could certainly be part of the process, although it seems to me that (in ideal circumstances) the more natural way of cross-linking would be in the opposite direction (Wikipedia &gt;&gt; Wikibooks), since in theory Wikibooks would be (among other things) a place for exploring subjects in more depth than what is possible in Wikipedia. By the way, since you mentioned Linear Algebra, Thenub314 has just started an interesting [[w:Wikipedia_talk:WPM#Call_to_Arms_for_Wikipedia.27s_sister_projects|discussion at WikiProject Mathematics]] involving collaboration in this very same subject.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 19:36, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

:The simpler solution would be to make your comment objecting to it, wait 7 days for opposition and if none materializes remove the tags. This will avoid rehashing the issue and provide a basis to start the process over in a more productive way even in stalled projects, with luck it may also attract interested people to the projects.
:It may also depend on the level of activity of the works and the user performing the tags, in the cases activity has ceases for a while (~6 months) a simple removal would be within a BeBold edit, IMHO.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:20, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Perhaps we could open something similar to Wikijunior, say, WikiSimple? Then we can house all the simple english books here.

== DDC/LOC Classifications ==

It was mentioned in an IRC chat a while ago and I thought I'd put it out there: are the [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal]] and [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification|Library of Congress]] classification systems necessary?  Are they a relic of the time when bookshelves were all there was and a dynamic listing of books by subject had not yet been accomplished through the subject pages?  It would seem as though that is the case, with the DDC root page created in December 2004 and the LOC created in February 2006, predating the creation of [[Subject:Books by subject]] in September 2007.  Do readers actually use these systems for finding books?  Dewey Decimal is a system to arrange &quot;books on library shelves in a specific and repeatable order that makes it easy to find any book and return it to its proper place&quot;, and is used in most public libraries, with the LOC system in use at research and academic libraries (in the US). They don't seem like they have a practical purpose in an electronic medium.  

[[:Category:Dewey/300|DDC 300 - Social Sciences/Education]] and [[:Category:Library of Congress/H|LOC H - Social Sciences]] would seem to be covered by [[Subject:Social sciences]] and its sub-subjects, for instance.  DDC has a mere ten categories to house all the books; LOC has four categories for history but lumps philosophy, psychology, and religion together.

== List of prerequisites - how to implement? ==

Hello!

I have a question about templates / categories / backlinks.

Namely, for the Haskell wikibook, I would like to add a list of &quot;prerequisites&quot; to each chapter, something like this: &quot;To understand this chapter, you need to know: Basic Haskell, Lazy evaluation&quot;. This short message should be created by a template, for example

&lt;pre&gt;{{prerequisites| Basic Haskell | Lazy evaluation}}&lt;/pre&gt;

So, the template arguments should be turned into links to a page that lists all topics in the Haskell wikibook that may appear as prerequisites.

Dually, each chapter covers one or more topics: &quot;This chapter explains: Lazy evaluation&quot;. By doing so, the chapter is automatically included on the list of pages also covering this topic.

How can I do this? Each prerequisite could be a category, but I want to list both the topics and the pages that cover them on a single page. Are there any other mechanisms for collecting backlinks?

-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 08:35, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

: Check out {{tlx|prerequisite}}. It only allows for a single link, but if you want to create a template that allows for more, I suggest you don't pass them as separate arguments, but rather all together like so:
&lt;pre&gt;{{prerequisites|
* [[link one]]
* [[link two]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;
: for simplicity.
: The way I understand you and as far as I know, categories are the only way for you to collect those pages. In fact, they sound precisely like what you're looking for. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:30, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks for your help, the template is indeed what I'm looking for; [[:Category:Calculus/Prerequisite]] is a compelling example. In my case, the prerequisites won't be whole books, just subsets of the Haskell wikibook, of course.
::What I also want to do, however, is to present multiple of these categories on one and the same page with custom formatting, like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
    Topic &quot;Lazy Evaluation&quot; is prerequisite to
        * [[Haskell/Infinite Lists]]
    Topic &quot;Basic Haskell&quot; is prerequisite to
        * [[Haskell/More about lists]]
        * [[Haskell/Understanding Monads]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
::Is there a way to transclude multiple category pages and apply custom formatting to the page listings? I.e. I don't want the default alphabetical listing of the pages in a category, and I want to show multiple categories on a single page. Of course, I could list the corresponding pages by hand, but this would kinda defeat the purpose.

== PDF version on Commons... HELP! ==

I've been working on the [[Bourne Shell Scripting]] book recently and today I uploaded a PDF version to commons (File:WikiBooks en Bourne Shell Scripting 20100509.pdf). Put the same categories on there as on the main page of the book (UNIX and Scripting languages). And placed the book in the PDF Wikibooks category on Commons.

In addition I put the PDF version template in the table of contents on the book's main page (locally on wikibooks, obviously). Then I put the name of the PDF file from Commons in the template as a link. Plus some file size info.

But the only result is that I get the &quot;vaporware&quot; text in the template on the book page. Can somebody please take a look and tell me where I went off the track?

Thanks! -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 14:25, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:From the information in the PDF version template, it looks like you can specify the file name and the file you made seems to be where it should be [[:File:WikiBooks en Bourne Shell Scripting 20100509.pdf]]. Perhaps the PDF version template is not working as expected! All the other books I have seen with PDF versions actually use the same file name and book name, so you could try uploading with file name &quot;Bourne Shell Scripting.pdf&quot;. There is a category [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PDF_Wikibooks PDF Wikibooks] on Commons to group the books together.

:::Alright, I'll recreate the file on Commons with a new name. But I agree with the Lecturer in Recent Runes (;-)): this feels very much like a bug in the templating system. Or at least between the templating system and the cross-domain linking setup. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, simply put, should support linking to Commons resources just like the rest of MediaWiki does.

::Wouldn't see why -- it's a PDF version of the book, not the other way around. Plus it's both on WikiMedia systems.

::Either way, the template is still not working, even when falling back to the default of having the file have the same name as the page.

After more digging into the issue above, I think I've found the problem: the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template includes an ifexist that looks for the existence of a File:XXX.pdf resource. This doesn't work across sites. To check for resources on commons, it is necessary to use the Media namespace as in Media:XXX.pdf .

I've created a copy of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[Template:PDF version Temp]]. As far as I can tell, this works well for both local and remote resources (see my user page, [[User:BenTels]]). If there are no objections, I would like to propose making the change in the original template.

== Enclosing Programming Code in Box ==

Earlier Python code used to be boxed but now it isn't see for example how the Code looks here: [[How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist:_Learning_with_Python_2nd_Edition/Solutions]]

Now if you add the following in your user space [[User:33rogers/monobook.css]] like how I have done, the page mentioned above (after deleting cookies etc.) looks much better.

Therefore I suggest the following changes be made global in Wikibooks:

From http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi#Method_1.2C_CSS_file 

Method 1, CSS file
:''This method requires [[rev:52346|r52346]] or higher of this extension.''

Add to [[MediaWiki:Geshi.css]], [[MediaWiki:Monobook.css]] or [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
div.mw-geshi {
  padding: 1em; 
  margin: 1em 0; 
  border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

This will give all GeSHi output (except for &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) a dashed border almost identical to &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; in monobook/main.css

: I do prefer the code to be placed in a box or otherwise separated from the text.  In a textbook setting, it's very nice to be able to separate the code from the text and make it stand out.  Different textbooks do that in different ways, but they all do seem to do it.  Having the code flow straight into the text is confusing, especially if the text is quoting part of the code (which is a nice thing to do).  I just did a quick thumb through of several programming textbooks in my office - some set the code off with horizontal lines, others in shaded boxes, and others still try to stuff the code into the margines (yuck!)

::::: Excellent point.  I suppose I am advocating a path of least resistance type of philosophy, we can add boxes where we like them now.  Is it really necessary to change some default setting which ''may'' affect books in a negative ways. My example would be a pages that have lots of single line source tags.  For example, [[LaTeX/Document_Structure#Sectioning_Commands]] would not look as nice.  Even worse the book consistently uses boxes for for terminal output.  For readers it is clear that information in boxes means terminal output, colored type writer face font means LaTeX code.  If we make this change, everything would be in boxes.  Maybe that is ok, maybe it is not.  I don't mean to pass judgment, just pointing out that we may be undoing lots of work (and creating some new work) for editors that we don't realize.

Of course that's not a good example (because all it would take to disable the boxes would be adding &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; to a single template), but there may be books &lt;s&gt;using inline &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags&lt;/s&gt; that would demand some effort to have the boxes disabled. I am tempted to support the change, but I don't like the thought of unwittingly breaking formatting of several books (on the other hand, if the bug Rogers mentioned gets fixed someday we will have to deal with such problems anyway, so...) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 21:28, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

== ePub format printable books? ==

Today I tried to add an ePub version of [[Bourne Shell Scripting]], with a template and so on (analogy to PDF version). This attempt hit the wall when I realized that you cannot upload epub files to Commons. This is a shame since ePub seems to be the most popular format for e-readers. Is there any chance that it will be possible to add ePub versions in the future? -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 16:54, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

I've posed a policy question on this subject on [[commons:Commons talk:Project_scope#Allowing_ePub_files_on_commons]]. -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 12:03, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: You should probably try to make a policy change on commons. As an alternative you can request to upload the content here but I should point you some facts and why I wouldn't support the request (I wouldn't oppose it also).
: Most people aren't aware of the format ([[w:EPUB|ePub]], I wasn't and the rational is similar). I support open formats and specifications, but for them to be of any usefulness people must not fragment the &quot;market&quot;, there are already other supported free and open formats (PDF), that have a higher level of implementation, supporting only one format has also maintainability advantages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:25, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::I agree that Commons is the place to put ePubs, especially since that's also where the PDFs are supposed to go.

::: As I said above I don't object nor do I see it as beneficial to support more formats. Being free and open-source conversion tools should exist. Consider the work and resources required to host duplicated content, on the other hand the need to host PDFs is also diminished today.

== Adding &quot;For Further Reading&quot; bibliographies ==

This is related to the discussion regarding whether and how to use external links in Wikibooks. I would like to see &quot;For Further Reading&quot; bibliographies, including both primary and secondary sources, added to the end of each Wikibook.  Authors of traditional textbooks almost always include such information and I find it extremely valuable, particularly when doing independent study without the guidance of a professor.  While a student might be able to find additional information by using an Internet search engine or looking through an on-line book selling site, it would be helpful to have some guidance regarding what materials are reliable and useful, according to the judgment of the Wiki community. Is bibliographic information available somewhere else on WikiMedia and I am missing it?  Any reason not to include it in the Wikibooks?
ederieux[[User:Ederieux|Ederieux]] ([[User talk:Ederieux|talk]]) 22:34, 20 May 2010 (UTC)5/20/2010
: A list of books for further reading would be a fine addition.  I am sure some books here already have this in some form. I think the best materials to include in the &quot;For Further Reading&quot; sections would be more advanced textbooks assuming such exist.  I am not sure what you mean by asking if bibliographic information is available on wikimedia.  There is not any central repository of possible references, but I am not sure if this is what you were asking. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:47, 20 May 2010 (UTC)
:: There is no rule against adding such bibliographies. Books may or may not add them. (Wikijunior Small Numbers probably won't include them, for instance.) It's up to book contributors to decide.

: It should be up to the book community to decide what to add/keep. As a user and contributor I don't particular like to have lists added at the end of every page of a book in a separated section. I rather prefer the direct insertion of relevant links in the text itself (easier to maintain and promotes relevance), this is a bit different from an wikipedian article. Another optimization would be moving the list of references to Wikipedia, failing to have very specific need, then reference other Wikibooks (specific to that topic) or a Wikipedia article. It all depends of what and why the reference is being added. This of course doesn't remove the ability of adding such references to a distinct section of the book, provide the info to the book editors and even rewrite the needed information so the reference is no longer needed... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:21, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

== Understanding FlaggedRevs... ==

I'm just looking for confirmation that I understood FlaggedRevs properly. The key point about the stable version system is that it is optional and only activated when some editor explicitly reviews it for the first time. For that reason, the only pages we should worry about their most recent edit not being shown to anonymous users are the ones listed in [[Special:OldReviewedPages]], which does ''not'' include any unreviewed pages. Correct? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 23:57, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Information ==

In Wikibooks such as [[General Chemistry]], is it allowed, or even preferred that exercises are available? It would feel much more like a textbook and would prove more useful than just a load of information. Also, when creating a Wikibook, can we treat it like a course (e.g. can I make an AP Physics book, which if one reads it and does the practice problems, one will be fit to take the AP exam)?--[[User:Charcoal|Charcoal]] ([[User talk:Charcoal|talk]]) 04:37, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:Exercises would certainly be welcome, and we do have quite a few books aimed at specific exams. As for the point Kayau raised, the main difference between a &quot;textbook wiki&quot; and a &quot;course wiki&quot; (and thus between Wikibooks and Wikiversity) is the extent of real-time interaction of the readers/students, with both other readers/students and authors/educators. I am quite certain that both of your ideas do not cross the line of project scope.
:P.S.: Nice to see people interested in General Chemistry. That book definitely needs more love and attention (and hard work in reorganization, which is why I haven't found courage to touch it yet...). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:26, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

Partly motivated by Kayau's post above :-)

:Documentation is always nice to have, at least if you'd like it to be used.  I've never really liked the term &quot;module&quot; and prefer the term &quot;page&quot; myself.  I always think of some assembly kit when I hear &quot;module&quot;.

== Featured Book removals ==

{{Resolved}}
I would like to suggest that nominators of Featured Book Removal (delisting) must notify Original Contributors in their talk pages, that the book is being considered as such.

I would make it easier if WikiBooks has a generic template for this purpose (to be placed in User Talk space).

When you place a notice on their talk pages, they will be emailed (I think it is default in preferences).

This will have a 2 fold effect:

1. Users who may have abandoned contributing to WikiBooks may return, which will increase the number of overall contributors on WikiBooks.

2. There will be proper notification in place, in case they would like to fix the issues brought in Featured Book Delisting nomination.

:&lt;s&gt;'''Oppose'''&lt;/s&gt; - you see 33rogers Wikibooks is not Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a very large community and has lots of action every day. That's why we need lots of templates there. However, in Wikibooks, the community is very small - just look at [[Special:ActiveUsers]] - and there is no point in having a template for such a trivial thing. A friendly message would be appropriate. Besides, in Wikipedia, even a CSD doesn't necessarily require a message on the talk page.

::::But the same &quot;what if&quot; scenarios apply to an RfD, and yet we still care about reaching the main contributors anyway... a de-featuring is something far less drastic than deletion of course, and making such warnings formal policy (and thus making &quot;you didn't warn the contributors!&quot; a reason for invalidating de-featuring requests) would be going too far.

:Nobody is going to make this a formal policy, so really it is down to custom and practice. If you want to create a template, and use it, go ahead. You don't need agreement here or from anyone.

::Why should I bother to tell him on his talk if he absolutely hadn't made an edit in five years? I've posted the notice on de-featuring to the books' main pages I've nominated.

I don't nominate something on a whim and if analysis shows that a book is incomplete/lacking and the people who started the book have abandoned it for years, I for one am not holding my breath that they'll come back and fix the issues that prompted the nomination in the first place.

:The former is used on pages that begin with &quot;Wikibooks:Reading room&quot; and includes a link to the combined archives for the reading rooms.  The latter is used on the others and does not linked to the combined reading room archives because those other pages have their own archives.

== Source code error using ''text'' as the language ==

Hi, 

Previously when using the source tags, the result was free from the preformatting tags broken blue border;  now it appears for that setting.   See the examples on the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text Preformatted Text].

Would it be possible for an admin to relay the matter to a responsible person for its correction at source; (no pun intended).?

Thanks in advance for any assistance to the matter,  Armchair; 14:06 GMT
:You can add &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; within the source tags to remove the pre formatting.  This is occurring due to a recent change; see the discussion [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1800275#Enclosing_Programming_Code_in_Box in the reading room].

== Main Page ==

I am looking for feedback and opinions as to whether [[Main Page/Draft]] would be a suitable replacement for the current main page.  It retains roughly the same layout, but uses {{tl|Robox}} for appearance.  The preset theme options for that template were chosen to approximate the same colors that are present on the current main page.  The exception is the welcome box, which uses a custom theme I created to match the Wikibooks logo.  The other boxes are open to suggestions as to what theme they should use.  Additionally, the icons in the upper-right are also optional.

A change has been made to the way the subjects are shown, with the top-level subjects listed dynamically.  An new addition, the display of a featured recipe, has been added.  This randomly displays subpages of [[Main Page/Recipe]].  Five have been done so far for the purposes of this request for comments.  

The underlying code of the display of the featured books has been changed.  Before, new goodbook templates had to be added in a balanced fashion to one of eighteen sections, and those sections were getting filled up to as much as six books each.  When they get too large it would require modifying the code at {{tl|Main Page featured books}}, which is not easy for everyone to do.  Apparently books were also listed twice, which is something that wasn't obvious to me when I added two newly-featured books.  And each section had a specific set of 5-6 books that would always show up together.  This new version at [[Main Page/Featured]] has a fully randomized selection of five books for the box, so the same set of books will not show up twice.  Additionally, adding a new featured book is as simple as adding it to a list and updating the total number.  And the code is far easier should a layout change need to be made to shorten the right-hand column.

Overall I don't think it's too drastically different, but I want to put it out there before doing all the featured recipes and especially before actually making changes to the main page.  So, thoughts? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:24, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

: Could the blue of the welcome box's heading cause some problems for the color blind and the elderly? The blue of the heading and the blue of the link seem to clash. I figured at some point if we were going to redesign the main page might as well simplify the layout a bit and take advantage of [[Using Wikibooks]]. [{{fullurl:Main Page/test|oldid=1561346}} Main Page/test] is something I did awhile back with simple in mind. The featured list could be reduced to one row with a randomly selected book, recipe, and children's book respectively using the same basic trick you are using. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:54, 20 April 2010 (UTC)
:{{support}} I like this.  I also like dl's suggestions, and do note that there are a few bugs to work out.  The image of the recipe is covering the text in my browser (firefox) with its current settings anyhow (not full screen, but prolly 900 pixels wide). I don't think the headings would present a problem to the color-blind, as they mostly have trouble distinguishing between red and green, not between shades of blue.  I have no idea how it might affect the elderly though.  I don't object to this or some other color scheme.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:50, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

:I agree with Darklama that the headings of the boxes should have a stronger contrast. I just saw the same featured book (Lucid Dreaming) twice on the draft of the main page. I think this is worse than having the sets of featured books. (I never noticed that there are sets; but everyone immediately notices when a book appears twice.) For the recipe [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:B%C3%A1nh_M%C3%AC Bánh mì] the image covers some of the text with Firefox on MacOS X. I would argue that the cookbook is not important enough to justify this box.

:: Everything above is linked from the sidebar as well, with the cookbook, Wikijunior, other languages, and the help page all linked from the welcome box.  As the cookbook has 3,600 pages to Wikijunior's 1,000 ([[Special:ValidationStatistics|citation]]), I'd say the cookbook is arguably more significant in terms of content.  Additionally, Wikijunior books that are featured are already represented in the featured books box.  The cookbook has featured recipes that make it easy to populate the box with content seen by the community to be of quality. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:33, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

:::The help portal and community portal need to be refreshed in my opinion; I leave it up to the community to decide (if possible) what should go in that box.  I tweaked the size of the icon in that cookbook box to make it smaller; the text shouldn't sneak in behind the image any longer.  I also adjusted the color of the welcome box heading.  As for the duplicate randoms, well, I tried using different seeds and salts in {{tl|Rand}}.  You roll a pair of dice often enough and you'll get doubles.  To get them to change, you may have to purge the page (tab addition available in the gadgets page of your preferences).

:::::: The 18 sets are probably an attempt to emulate the 5-6 featured books shuffled in every possible combination.

----
Following Darklama's suggestions, the featured content from the main space, the Cookbook, and Wikijunior have been put into one row at the bottom of [[Main Page/Draft]].  Currently the only featured book you'll see is [[Chess]] as sample content, as the layout will require a minor tweak to [[Template:Goodbook]] if/when it goes live (code is commented out but present already in that template).  There are five featured recipes in rotation at this time there and I'd add more if this layout is adopted.  All the Wikijunior featured books are represented.  The layout has been simplified as well and Darklama was helpful in steering me in the direction he had in mind with earlier comments.  This should address all the concerns above.  Some formatting may be warranted to the current draft, however, and I welcome comments and/or tweaks so that this can be decided upon one way or another and not left in the air. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:43, 29 April 2010 (UTC)
: My thoughts in random order because I am short on time... On the first line I think Categories should be part of the &quot;Contents&quot;, and it would be nice to let people know that the book the book being displayed is a featured book, a featured Wikijunior book, and a featured recipe form the cookbook.  Sometimes the alignment of the pictures/text feels a little sloppy, since the pictures are of different sizes.  Just gives a very jagged feel. And while I don't mind simplicity, our logo next to welcome to Wikibooks would be nice. Over all I liked the previous version better, this is just a bit too minimalistic for me.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:58, 29 April 2010 (UTC)

:The navigation at the top does have a link titled &quot;Questions&quot; and points to the [[Wikibooks:Reading room]].  Potentially a link to the portal could be added with a different link title to the top bar, but it seems as though much of what's covered on the community portal can be discovered through the other links in the bar.

== Q&amp;A pages and the role of namespaces ==

This topic is a fork of the discussions at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Talk:The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_.28P2P.29.2FQ.26A|the RfD of Talk:The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_(P2P)/Q&amp;A]]. I will start by presenting my current opinion on the issues, also building on the pertinent comments by Pi zero, Swift, Panic and others in the RfD.

The first issue to be addressed is whether general-purpose helpdesks are a good idea for Wikibooks. My answer for that would be no - even if there is no need to take draconian measures against books with general Q&amp;A sections I believe the practice should not be encouraged. Problems with such kinds of helpdesks include, in order of relevance:
* Distracting readers and editors from the main goal of the project (writing internally-coherent textbooks). If people see Wikibooks as a place to get answers for random questions it becomes all too easy for them, for instance, to feel like adding extra information or modules to cover an specific question without caring about the overall structure of the book.
* Dedicating efforts to tasks that would be better performed in a sister project with more adequate infrastructure (Wikipedia reference desk, Wikiversity...)
* The tendency of many books to be abandoned, leaving their Q&amp;A pages unwatched and therefore pointless (note that I'm not stating that ''every'' book/Q&amp;A page has such a fate, but just pointing out a common situation).

Even if an &quot;anything goes&quot; Q&amp;A page is not really a good idea, though, a more restricted type of Q&amp;A can indeed prove useful to book writers. It seems safe to say that a &quot;suggestion box&quot; page is not objectionable. A Q&amp;A page could be made to work pretty much like a suggestion box, only that the suggestions are not made explicitly but implied in the readers' questions. All that it takes for making such a Q&amp;A is restricting the scope of the page, by telling readers something like &quot;If, during your study, you have doubts that the book couldn't answer please post your question at the Q&amp;A page&quot;. By such a token, questions like &quot;Who was the creator of Python?&quot; (a real example from the Python Q&amp;A) would not be acceptable, while &quot;I analysed that example on module xxx a thousand times but I still can't understand how do you...&quot; would certainly be appropriate. Naturally, the difference is way too subtle to become something that could be enforced by policy, so the best we would be able to do in that respect is to provide some lightweight guidelines to contributors and then, if necessary, discuss specific situations case-by-case and with no hurry.

The first obvious objection to the sort of Q&amp;A pages described above was raised by Sigma 7 in the original Python Q&amp;A RfD - namely, that we already have the Talk: pages of each module that purpose. There are quite a few reasons why contributors would favour a centralized Q&amp;A page, or at least having them within a separate hierarchy of pages:

* Centralizing questions, so that it becomes easier for the main contributors to monitor and to other readers to provide feedback.
* Encouraging readers to ask. I think most people, and newbies in particular, would instinctively believe the likelihood of getting an answer after adding a question to the talk page of a deeply-nested module to be quite low.
* Providing a place for questions that span through several modules, or refer to some omission in the book.
* Separating reader doubts about content from editorial discussions about the book (which is the natural role of Talk: pages).

All these reasons make it worthy to give freedom to book writers on how to organize their Q&amp;A/reader feedback pages, which is pretty much the point Swift is insisting on all along.

Finally, there is the more practical issue of whether suggestion boxes, Q&amp;As and such resources belong to Talk: or to the main namespace. Panic believes such pages are more like Talk: pages, as they are meant to be a space for discussing the book. From a book structure point of view that position certainly makes sense, and matches quite well the considerations about not distracting readers from the main goal of Wikibooks. On the other hand, Pi zero and Swift raised the objection that Q&amp;A pages would need their own discussion pages, which also makes sense. 

The fact that seemingly conflicting objections are valid indicates that there ''should'' be a better third way. Quoting Panic, &quot;The way we still use talkpages as if we are in Wikipedia is a software limitation and often a habit&quot;. One way of describing this &quot;software limitation&quot; would be as the absence of an alternative namespace, which is neither part of the main namespace nor just a discussion page. From that point comes the following wild suggestion: maybe we could have a new [[mw:Manual:Using_custom_namespaces|custom namespace]] called &quot;Questions&quot; (or some better name) for acceptable Q&amp;A-like pages. That would make us able to:
* Clearly separate Q&amp;As from the main course of the book;
* Provide clear recommendations (not black-or-white policy, though) on usage of the new namespace;
* Create, if need be, independent hierarchies of sub pages for Q&amp;As with minimal hassle;
* Having talk pages for Q&amp;As;
Maybe that would be a over-complicated solution for a problem which, frankly, isn't even that big, or there would be technical difficulties. Still, I believe such possibilities are at least worthy considering - lest we accommodate ourselves and act as if we were in a mere extension of Wikipedia...

: My opinion on the subject is based on active observation and participation on some Q&amp;A pages. This can sometimes prove erroneous like on the C Programming Q&amp;A page that I thought was being well maintained but the person working to provide help there, on the recent RfD stated that he felt that the page wasn't of value. This puts the discussion of the value of having Q&amp;A pages in a 2 distinct POVs.
: Some fell that a Q&amp;A pages shouldn't exist at all (globally on the project), disregarding the pros and cons argumentation, I don't think that banning the pages in a policy would gather consensus and therefore it seems a futile discussion, on the other hand a guideline establishing some requirements and obligations for maintain such pages would clarify and reduce the need for wasting time discussing the deletion of such pages in RfDs. Just to be clear. Polices are enforcible and guidelines can have justified exceptions. My position on the subject is simpler, and avoid the need for writing rules down. I will not object the deletion of such pages if they aren't wanted/defended and have posts replied to by the active book community (people working consistently on that project) nor will I bring up for RfD those pages as I see them even if out of the talk namespace as simple talk pages, unless I'm working on that project I consider it outside of my right to reformat.
: As for the purpose of Q&amp;A pages I think Duplode above covers most of the rationals but I certain there are other advantages on having that centralization. The validity of that structure is similar to the reason why we have several Reading room subsections...
: The other divergent position and one that I have discussed many time before, relates to my quotation above is that the Wikimedia software has greater limitations in handling our type of project. The subject that if we keep them where do we put them. This in part relates to a political/legal position, on regarding all pages as interchanging modules, to what I don't agree in general terms (but see as a valid POV laking a clear statement from the governing body), the closest Wikimedia project to us is Wikisource not Wikipedia, talk pages shouldn't be spread across individual book pages but centralized for easy participation. Creating a new namespace in this situation would aggregate this type of talk page together but would remove the connection they should maintain to each book, so I wouldn't see it as an improvement. The same goes to supporting having them on the book's namespace, it will not only dilute the usefulness of the talk namespace but also the book's namespace, polluting the categorization of the pages. Q&amp;A pages should never be considered part of a book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:59, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Having the talk page annexed to the Q&amp;A doesn't seem beneficial at all, the main purpose is to discuss the book not the Q&amp;A section, people should move any discussions outside of the book scope into the user space, it is even evident by the level of activity of most Q&amp;A pages that the necessity isn't pressing (most posts that need the talk pages are in general of topic and should be in the main book's talk (if no other are indicated). Swift comments could well be made to me directly. I don't know but I presume that he knows I am mostly working there alone and that I was the creator of the project and that page. In any case a specific direction is given on that page (regrading the posts) and in the main talk page of that book asking people to use another forum.
:: I also disagree with you on the second point, but it may depend on the quality on the content provided, but in general I don't think FAQ's should be what we aim for in a wikibook (they can be a good starting point)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:56, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

:::I particularly don't like having [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FGeneral&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1800045&amp;oldid=1800043 my comments deleted]! Especially when I return to modify them and find they are gone.  (I even get mildly cross at having my spelling corrected outside of an actual book module.)  I was about to say that I felt I should quickly make a comment to add some context to what Panic had said.  Let me add some slightly different context to what Panic is replying to: My comments at the RfD are about a specific module, and not so appropriate for this discussion.  At least I am very clear about the fact those comments are not the ones ''I'' find relevant to this conversation.
:::That being said, let me make a general comment, because just leaving a complaint may get it deleted.  Be warned I haven't read the thread fully or taken time to digest it.  About Q&amp;A pages: I think it should be left up to the book contributors to decide if they are appropriate or not.  As far as general help pages go, I do feel the reference desk is out of place at wikipedia, but now more or less belongs there.  See my recent comments at wikipedia for a more accurate description.  The only very mild reservation about Q&amp;A pages is having the editorial staff to support them.  The same comment goes for discussion pages in general, even if all the comments are concentrated on the main page it would not help.  Zero people watching the pages of a book at the time a comment is made means no one will answer, and many books are not tended too.  This doesn't mean I think we should get rid of discussion pages or Q&amp;A pages, it is a wiki, and this is part of life on a wiki.  It is just something to think about when adding them to a book.  I certainly don't mind some unofficial guidance for editors to remind them that someone may not always be around to support such a page.  Any official policy would go ''much'' to far. Basically I feel that similar structures (Q&amp;A's, FAQ's etc.) exist in &quot;dead tree books&quot;, and I don't see why they couldn't be part of this project.  I don't think that any book that were strictly a FAQ would be useful as a textbook, but a good text book could include such a page as an appendix.  
::: Depending on the implementation of a Q&amp;A page, I would or wouldn't consider it part of the text.  If it is linked to from one of the main space pages of the book I think that there is a very serious possibility that readers will treat it as a part of the book.  It is my experience that when I give informal Q&amp;A sessions for the courses I teach most students don't turn up with questions, but rather hope to listen to the questions other people have and the answers I give.  My evaluations reflect that this is seen as part of the course and not as something informal to help them out, regardless of how I advertise it.  I see little harm putting it in the main space, and it benefits the page by giving the page its own place for discussion.
::: I think that creating a separate namespace for Q&amp;A pages is not worth the effort. Centralized discussions have their ups and downs.  An example of one problem is point of entry.  When I was adding some images to [[Calculus/Volume]] book, I remember discovering it has a ridiculously high rank on google.  It was probably number 5 on a search for &quot;Volume&quot; (thankfully this is no longer true).  Presumably the first entry point of some person may not be the main page of the book where one could see an explanation of where to leave comments. So what to do?  Well one could certainly redirect all discussion pages to a central Q&amp;A page, then when ever someone left a comment it would end up in one centralized place.  Unfortunately, if the last comment at [[Talk:Calculus/Volume]] I wouldn't know what to do with it.  It correctly pointed out an error in one equation, but wasn't overly clear about which equation it was referring too.  I myself am not entirely sure if I would categorize that comment as editorial or as content related.  If this comment were left in a centralized page it would not be so useful because I wouldn't be able to tell which equations the user was talking about. A second idea would be to add another tab to every page for Q&amp;A... not a good idea.  Or we could include a description on every talk page about how to leave a good comment, and the right place to leave it.  But I suspect we will find ourselves in an RTFM situation. I do see some benefit between separating discussions like &quot;this is how we should plan to organize the book&quot; and &quot;there is mistake in this content&quot; but I am not sure Q&amp;A pages would do this so well.

:::: Sorry about the comment removal but since it concerned the objected copy, consisted on a phrase and was unsigned I thought that complying to the first objection and fixing it would satisfy you. I wouldn't remove a signed post and a post that didn't addressed a simple misunderstanding, feel free to revert the change I made.

: This has to be one of the longest posts I've seen in a long time! Despite that, it's a fairly concise, balanced view of the arguments surrounding these pages. I'm not sure if it's useful or just instruction creep, but if anyone wants to mold it into a page in project space and link to it from the [[WB:MOS]] that should be fine. I don't agree with adding a new namespace, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 20:56, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

Textbooks can take on a FAQs form or have a FAQs Appendix. I think clarity on the intent is a good idea. I think whether or not people want to answer questions should be up to them. Wikipedia uses the talk pages of articles for maintenance and organizational purposes as well as for discussions. I think Wikibooks would do well to follow by example by using the talk namespace of books for maintenance and organizational purposes. I think pages of a book should consist of only what the target audience is expected to learn or know. A person interested in only reading a book probably doesn't care about any reorganization efforts, but probably does care about how this might effect the current stability and reliability of what they are reading. If a Q&amp;A page is intended to be used as some form of writer/reader interaction than I think it should be in the talk namespace. If a Q&amp;A is intended to be useful part of the book's content than of course it should be in the content namespace. I don't understand why there is such a big deal over this. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:12, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

:I am against any custom namespace created for the sole purpose of asking questions. They will simply produce tons of extra pages that we don't really need. As for whether to put Q&amp;As into talk pages or modules, I would prefer the former but I think it is up to the book contributors to decide. RfDing Q&amp;As would also be made easier without a custom namespace.

*My view is this: that [[w:Wikipedia:Reference desk]] is the proper place for asking questions not related to a particular chapter of the book. For one, you have volunteers willing to answer questions at [[w:Wikipedia:Reference desk]]. If the question is regarding some sections of the book, it would be more appropriate for the reader to bring that up in the talk space, of the chapter (modules as they are called). This will allow for improvement, in the modules, by the original contributors. Now take for example, at [[Python Programming/Q&amp;A]], undeleted by Swift, is it appropriate for questions like such? 
*Therefore Q&amp;A pages should be deleted. And creation of FAQ pages should be only be created when there is an answer for a particular question. Otherwise pages like [[Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] are created in process. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 04:58, 24 May 2010 (UTC)

:Phew, all this fuss over such a trivial matter. :) What about that. For those books with Q&amp;As, we turn them into FAQs and any new questions should be posted on the ''talk'' page.

::A specific remedy like this can't possibly to appropriate to the circumstances of every book that has a Q&amp;A.  General discussion can work out general principles, and perhaps some techniques that ''might'' work in various situations; but deciding exactly what should be done in each particular book needs to be worked out with careful consideration of each individual book.  The implementation phase of such a program should not be expected to go quickly, as any such thing done quickly will mess up individual books.  If a general discussion produces anything, the most useful form for such a product would be a ''guideline'', which individual books would then act on in their own time.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:39, 27 May 2010 (UTC)
== Suggestions for [[Na'vi]] ==

[moving from featured book nominations]

the WP article on [[Na'vi]] has been moved here as a book. I've done some work to make it self contained, and it is stable for the moment. Would any of you who are interested mind looking it over, with an eye to what work it would need to be featured? Currently we're missing some grammatical data, simply because no-one but the author of the language knows what it is. I anticipate that the missing info will be forthcoming over the next couple months, and when it is, I'd like to be able to nominate for featured status. 

thanks, [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 11:09, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

:I have read over some of the books pages randomly.  My only comment is that it is occasionally still very much like reading a (extremely well written) wikipedia article. To me it seems to be more recording the facts about the language, then trying to teach the reader to learn it.  No simple examples, no translate this simple sentence.  It does explain itself fairly well, describing what different concepts are before illustrating them in this language.  I have very little experience with language texts, so I am not sure I can offer much in the way of constructive criticism.  It seems well structured, well referenced, fairly complete.  I can't think of any criteria for a featured book that it is lacking.  But I personally might have trouble learning from it.

::Thanks for the feedback. I don't want to make up examples, because I'm afraid I'll get s.t. wrong. We don't know enough about it yet to be sure about very much, so it's mostly an analysis of the texts we do have from the author. I've also spent about as much time as I can afford creating the glossary, so I doubt I'll be rewriting the text. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 22:35, 6 May 2010 (UTC)

== Quantum physics ==

The answer and solution to the question about finding the frequency of an electron with a velocity of 30000m/s is wrong.

The solution states that the frequency of the de Broglie wave for the electron is given by the kinetic energy of the elecron divided by the Planck constant. This is wrong! It is the total energy of the electron (given by E=mc2) divided by the h. Also, v=freq x wavelength refers to the phase velocity of the wave .

this is given by (mc2/h)(h/mv), where v is the group velocity of the electron = 30000m/s.
So, phase velocity - 3 x 10(12) m/s.

using f= phase velocity/wavelength = 3 x 10(12)/2.4 x 10(-8) = 1.25 x 10(20) Hz.

This agrees with f=E/h = mc2/h = 1.25 x 10(20)Hz

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;font color=BLUE&gt;Global Issues in TV Movie: ''I Spy Returns'' (1994)&lt;/font&gt;'''


''I Spy Returns'' originally aired as a television reunion movie in 1994. It takes place 25 years after the original ''I Spy'' weekly TV series featuring Bill Cosby as Alexander Scott and Robert Culp as Kelly Robinson. In the original series, Scott and Robinson were the secret agents, but in this one, Scott’s daughter Nicole and Robinson’s son Ben are the agents. The young agents are sent to Vienna to protect a defecting Russian scientist and his wife, but their fathers follow them there to make sure they don’t get hurt. 

Even though this is a post-cold war movie, the main globalization theme is the cold war spy business. It is about the battle to control access to sensitive information and technology which supposedly threatens national security. So it involves the CIA, the KGB, China, and some Russians. 

The Russian couple come to Vienna from Hungary in a Russian-made hydrofoil that is owned by a Slovakian shipping company. Even today, a Slovak company runs a hydrofoil shuttle service up and down the Danube between Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest, Hungary. 

Other locations that the movie uses to suggest the multinational or international, if not global involvement of Vienna include places like: the Vienna International Airport (VIE), and the UNO City / Vienna International Center which is shown in the background as the young agents drive into town.  

The original ''I Spy'' series which ran from 1965 to 1968 was a tongue-in-cheek adventure comedy. It was the first ever TV drama series with an African-American in a leading role. It was the first television series to be filmed mainly at international locations such as Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Greece and Morocco. It was the first to use the buddy genre in which both men were equal, not one superior to the other. This reunion movie tries to capture the same playful banter between the Cosby and Culp characters. 

The movie depicts Vienna as an historic place, a romantic and cosmopolitan place attracting tourists from around the world. There are several extended travelogue-like sequences: one through central Vienna, several chase scenes, that go through the Hofburg / the Imperial Hapsburg Palace which was capital of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries, and Franziskanerkirche (the Franciscan Church dating from the 1600s). 

The U.S. producers of ''I Spy Returns'' secured the cooperation of the City of Vienna, and financial support from the Vienna Film Financing Fund. They worked with two German- Austrian production companies, FILM-LINE GmbH and Neue Studio Film GmbH so most of the technical and production crew were local to Vienna.  

What is the global significance or impact of this movie today?

The movie shows international tensions, conflicts and distrust continuing even after the end of the Cold War. We can ask whether these post-cold war conflicts truly continue, or are depictions that perpetuate an obsolete stereotype or fear of the Russians or the Chinese?

There is reference to Saddam Hussein in this movie, long before the U.S. made its case to invade Iraq in 2003. 

With screening and security checks at all airports today, it is anachronistic to see someone pull out a pistol inside a gate area at the Vienna airport or any airport for that matter. 

As a light comedy from the mid-90s, the depiction of global issues in this movie is probably not historically or factually based, but rather a literary device based on the stereotypes of Vienna’s image and unexamined beliefs about the post-cold-war international spy business.

== Merge proposal ==

At least in its current form this chapter should be merged to the previous one, as there is very little non-redundant contents. Another option would be expanding it with more examples, but in that case it would probably be more useful to shift its focus to Law of Cosines and Law of Sines instead of just right triangles. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:03, 27 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]].

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hi, I have rejected your recent edit to the above page because I didn't know why you removed the references and links from that page.  Please try to include an ''edit summary'' in future,especially if you are removing text or references from a page.

If you haven't read it already, please see our [[WB:DP|deletion policy]]. [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:34, 1 June 2010 (UTC)}}

== About your book ==

As you are the author, you may not feel that the book should be deleted, but consider looking at the introduction alone.

===Your introduction===
'''I have been watching people spend hours and hours of their life, waisted on countless &quot;self-help&quot; books. They think that to better themselves they can read what another person thinks they should do with their life and all their issues will be solved.''' - obvious original research, and bad spelling. '''This person is probably you, and thats alright, you are at least taking the first step to solving the problem by reading my book.''' - missing apostrophe, and down there you said you aren't the only author (which is always true), and you're speaking of these in first person?

Who Are These People?
and why is he qualified to tell me who I am, or what I should do?!

The beauty of this book being moved to a wiki format writing, it will allow many people just like you to take part and be significant parts of the writing process. This means that someone who is like you, can share how they help themselves. Below is a list of current authors of this book.

Travis &quot;TeamColtra&quot; McCrea
'''My name is Travis McCrea, I am not typically a writer, and do not enjoy writing like other writers do. I am a college student enrolled to become a Public Administrator and Political Scientist. I like to write in a way that makes people think, and admittedly laugh. I will never tell you what you should do, or who you are, however, I am going to simply suggest ways as so you do not have to buy a self help book again.

I do not have a psychology degree, but I always seem to understand the emotions and feelings of others, and I can describe the way they feel back to them in a way they better understand. This will be the main effect of this book. Its not about what we can do to change who you are, its about opening up who you are so you can become more successful in your day to day life.'''

While I am not opposed to writing self-introduction of authors on Wikibooks, reading this passage alone reveals a lot.
*  'I like to write in a way that makes people think, and admittedly laugh.' Wikibooks does not accept inappropriate humour.
* 'I do not have a psychology degree, but I always seem to understand the emotions and feelings of others, and I can describe the way they feel back to them in a way they better understand. This will be the main effect of this book. Its not about what we can do to change who you are, its about opening up who you are so you can become more successful in your day to day life.' Wikbooks does not accept original research. This suggests that this book will contain loads of it.
* There was a run-on sentence.

What Can They Possibly Do For Me?
Why does they care what I do?

'''Unlike the writers of these preachy self-help books that you typically read, we don't really care for the profit, and am writing this 100% selfishly. When we walk though book stores, we get annoyed at all the books telling people how to live their lives, what they need to do to become better people, how they can win an argument whenever they want. They are often deceitful (I promise you that you will not win an argument EVERY TIME you try), they are silly, and they pray on peoples fears of being socially awkward, or their hungers to be the best.

Here is the secret to this entire book we will say it now, and put it in a bold faced type font so that if you are just thumbing through the book you start out knowing the secret: You already know what it takes to be the best you can be. Now there are guides and books to help you enhance these strengths, and marginalize the weaknesses, so we will give you a hand in that department if you still feel like you need a boost of confidence every now and then.''' - Wikibooks does not accept biased things, and this does not sound very neutral to me.

===A final bit of advice===
Have you heard of the website, [wikia.com Wikia]? If I were you, I would start my own wiki, called, say, anti-self-help-books wiki (though that might be a teensy weensy bit too long), and copy everything here to there. The policy of Wikia is not as strict, as Wikia, unlike Wikibooks, is commercial. That's why I think you're much better off at Wikia than at Wikibooks. To tell you the truth, the book has little chance of remaining in Wikibooks.

** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

== 'e' and net ==

The word ''that'' in ''He hopes that his team will win'' is not a pronoun. It's a complementiser, a connecting word that heads an embedded clause and indicates its relation to the main clause. (It's in the same class as ''if'' and ''whether''.)

''That'' is a pronoun only if you use it along the lines of ''I can see that'', as a stand-alone object. Unless it's the same for Klingon, the way it's presented here is a bit confusing. (And wrong.)</text>

The '''''tortilla canaria''''' (Spanish for Canary Islands omelet) originated in Spain's Canary Islands, an island chain to the southwest of Spain and off the western coast of Africa. 

Canary Islands cuisine fuses Spanish cooking traditions with those of Africa, Latin America and the Guanche people who were original inhabitants of the Canaries. Also, it utilizes local fish, fruits and vegetables. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.red2000.com/spain/canarias/gastro.html Info on the cuisine of the Canary Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional recipe, shown below, calls for an omelet filled with sauted tomatoes, onions and garlic, seasoned with tarragon, parsley, salt and sometimes [[cookbook:basil|basil]].&lt;ref&gt;José María Campos and Joan Masats, ''La Cocina Española: Entrantes y Primeros Platos.'' Printer Industria Trafica S.A., page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocinaisabel.com/tag/huevos/page/2/ Recipe for the ''tortilla canaria'']&lt;/ref&gt; Variations can include [[cookbook:rice|rice]] and a wide variety of vegetables.

==Ingredients==

* 1.5lb sausagemeat
* 8oz plain flour
* 4oz grated suet
* 1 large onion
* Butter
* Thyme
* Black pepper
* Salt
* Mustard powder
* Water

==Procedure==

# Add one pinch of salt and one pinch of mustard powder to the flour
# Mix together the suet and flour with enough water to make a doughy consistency
# Cut the pastry into two portions one slightly larger than the other
# Roll out the larger portion and use it to line a small buttered pie dish
# Finely dice the onion
# Mix together the sausagemeat, diced onion, a pinch of thyme, and plenty of black pepper
# Mash the mixture into the pie dish making sure there are no voids
# Wet the edge of the pastry where it covers the lip of the pie dish
# Roll out the remaining pastry and cover the pie
# Lightly crimp the edge with your thumb and trim
# Cut a hole in the top centre of the pie to allow steam to escape

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vitamin A==

Fat-soluble vitamin originally isolated from fish-liver oils. It was first synthesized in 1947 as a complex molecule made of 20 carbon atoms and containing an alcohol group. The chemical was named retinol. 

====Sources====
Vitamin A is found in two sources: plants and animals.  Vitamin A that comes from animals is called preformed vitamin A.  It is absorbed in the body in the form of retinol.  Sources include liver, whole milk, and fortified foods.  Vitamin A from plants is called provitamin A carotenoid, that also can be made into retinol in the body.  The most common provitamin A cartenoids found in foods is beta-carotene, found in carrots.  The Recommended Dietary Allowance for males older than 19 is 900 mcg/day.  Females of the same age should consume higher than 700 mcg/day.  

===Dietary sources===
Retinol, together with some of its derivatives, is naturally provided by foods of animal origin, is readymade and ready for use as an active vitamin by the body. 

Natural sources : a) Retinol is found in liver, fish liver oils (cod, flounder, halibut), egg yolk, fat from dairy products ; b) b-carotene and other carotenoids with pro-vitamin A function (only a few carotenoids have such property) are present in: tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, green vegetables (spinach, broccoli, lettuce and other leafy vegetables for salads) ; apricots, mangoes, melons, pumpkins. - Toxicity : No toxicity is known for b-carotene (it can occasionally give a yellowish colour to the skin).

===Metabolism===
On the other hand, vegetable sources including fruits and proper vegetables, can provide precursors of vitamin A in the form of longer molecular chains of potential pro-vitamins belonging to the  carotenoid pigments, that can be enzymatically split and converted into active vitamin A in the linings of the small intestine. The best known form of pro-vitamin A is β-carotene, a deep-coloured pigment present in yellow, orange or red fruits and other vegetable structures. Each molecule of β-carotene can be converted into two molecules of active vitamin.  Any excess of vitamin A obtained from food is stored in the liver.  Vitamin A  used for therapeutic purposes is usually made up of 14 different isomers all of which should be present in the preparation. 
===Functions===
Vitamin  A is necessary for vision, in particular vision in dim light and night vision, where isomers of retinol are directly involved. Moreover, it protects the cells from  free-radical damage ; helps bone and teeth formation (the making of dentin requires vitamin A) ; promotes the health of skin, gums, all body linings and mucosae and stimulates them to fight infections. This vitamin is also necessary to reproduction, in particular to the production of sperm and to the development of the foetus. A considerable body of research has stressed the importance of vitamin A as modulator of the  immune function, where an important acid from retinol (retinoic acid) is specially involved. Actually, a correlation has been found in humans between the level of this vitamin and the immune response at a cellular level. Serious vitamin A deficiency is still the main cause of children death in the developing countries. 

===Recommended amounts=== 
(adults) : 900 to 1400 μg (micrograms) per day. Modern scientific unit is RE - Retinol Equivalent : 1 RE = 1μg of retinol = 6 μg of b-carotene. As to the still widely used International Unit (IU), stands the following equivalence: 1 RE = 3.3 IU  As to retinol, it is recommended  not to exceed 25.000 RE per day over prolonged periods  (3.000 RE in children). Never exceed 500.000 RE in a single dose (20.000 RE in children). In pregnancy : do not exceed 3.000 RE per day.

=====Vitamin A Deficiency=====
Vitamin A deficiency is a common problem around the world but not very problematic here in the US.  This deficiency is a result of a deficiency of zinc in the body because zinc is what makes the body have the ability to move its Vitamin A stores from the liver to the body tissues.  Blindness is the result of a severe lack of Vitamin A in one’s diet.  Vitamin A deficiency also diminishes the body’s ability to fight infections.

'''Vitamin D''' is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids, the two major physiologically relevant forms of which are vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or both. Vitamin D is produced in the skin of vertebrates after exposure to ultraviolet B light, and occurs naturally in a small range of foods. In some countries staples such as milk, flour and margarine are artificially fortified with vitamin D, and it is also available as a supplement in pill form.&lt;ref name=&quot;IoM250&quot;&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride (1997) Access date: 2010-04-14
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309063507&amp;page=250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, defending the body against microbial invaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&amp;Hewison2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Adams |first1= JS|last2= Hewison|first2= M|last3= |first3= |title= Update in vitamin D|journal= J Clin Endocrinol Metab|year= 2010|month= Feb|volume= 95|issue= 2|pages= 471–8|pmid= 20133466|doi= 10.1210/jc.2009-1773 |pmc= 2840860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When synthesized in the kidneys, calcitriol circulates as a hormone, regulating, among other things, the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, promoting the healthy mineralization, growth and remodeling of bone, and the prevention of hypocalcemic tetany. Vitamin D insufficiency can result in thin, brittle, or misshapen bones, while sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, and, together with calcium, helps to protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D also modulates neuromuscular function, reduces inflammation, and influences the action of many genes that regulate the cell proliferation|proliferation, cell differentiation|differentiation and apoptosis of cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin D|publisher=National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Spplements|accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several forms (vitamers) of vitamin D have been discovered (see table). The two major forms are vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or cholecalciferol. These are known collectively as '''calciferol'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary'', under Vitamin (Table of Vitamins)&lt;/ref&gt; Ergocalciferol|Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was chemically characterized in 1932. In 1936 the chemical structure of Cholecalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was established and resulted from the ultraviolet|ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitamind.ucr.edu/history.html History of Vitamin D] University of California, Riverside, Vitamin D Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, the various forms of vitamin D are secosteroids; i.e., steroids in which one of the bonds in the steroid rings is broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot;&gt;[http://vitamind.ucr.edu/about.html About Vitamin D] Including Sections: History, Nutrition, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Diseases. University of California Riverside&lt;/ref&gt; The structural difference between vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is in their side chains. The side chain of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains a double bond between carbons 22 and 23, and a methyl group on carbon 24.

Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (made from ergosterol) is produced by invertebrates, fungus and plants in response to UV irradiation; it is not produced by vertebrates. Little is known about the biologic function of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in nonvertebrate species. Because ergosterol can more efficiently absorb the ultraviolet radiation that can damage DNA, RNA and protein it has been suggested that ergosterol serves as a sunscreening system that protects organisms from damaging high energy ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holick_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14985208 |year=2004 |last1=Holick |first1=MF |title=Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=362–71 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol reacts with UVB ultraviolet light at wavelengths between 270–300&amp;nbsp;nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295-297&amp;nbsp;nm.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These wavelengths are present in sunlight when the UV index is greater than 3. At this solar elevation, which occurs daily within the tropics, daily during the spring and summer seasons in temperate regions, and almost never within the arctic circles, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be made in the skin.  Depending on the concentration of UVB rays and the minutes of exposure, an equilibrium can develop in the skin, and vitamin D degrades as fast as it is generated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
=== Production in the skin ===
[[File:Skinlayers.png|thumb|The epidermal strata of the skin. Production is greatest in the stratum basale (colored red in the illustration) and stratum spinosum (colored orange).]]

The skin consists of two primary layers: the inner layer called the dermis, composed largely of connective tissue, and the outer, thinner epidermis (skin)|epidermis. The epidermis consists of five ''strata''; from outer to inner they are: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

Cholecalciferol is produced photochemically in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol; 7-dehydrocholesterol is produced in relatively large quantities in the skin of most vertebrate animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12514284 |year=2003 |last1=Crissey |first1=SD |last2=Ange |first2=KD |last3=Jacobsen |first3=KL |last4=Slifka |first4=KA |last5=Bowen |first5=PE |last6=Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis |first6=M |last7=Langman |first7=CB |last8=Sadler |first8=W |last9=Kahn |first9=S |title=Serum concentrations of lipids, vitamin d metabolites, retinol, retinyl esters, tocopherols and selected carotenoids in twelve captive wild felid species at four zoos |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=160–6 |journal=The Journal of nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naked mole rat appears to be naturally cholecalciferol deficient as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels are undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8384476 |year=1993 |last1=Yahav |first1=S |last2=Buffenstein |first2=R |title=Cholecalciferol supplementation alters gut function and improves digestibility in an underground inhabitant, the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), when fed on a carrot diet |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=233–41 |journal=The British journal of nutrition |doi=10.1079/BJN19930025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, the naked mole rat is resistant to aging, maintains healthy vascular function&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17468332 |year=2007 |last1=Csiszar |first1=A |last2=Labinskyy |first2=N |last3=Orosz |first3=Z |last4=Xiangmin |first4=Z |last5=Buffenstein |first5=R |last6=Ungvari |first6=Z |title=Vascular aging in the longest-living rodent, the naked mole rat |volume=293 |issue=2 |pages=H919–27 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.01287.2006 |journal=American journal of physiology.

B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some animals, the presence of fur or feathers blocks the UV rays from reaching the skin. In birds and fur-bearing mammals, vitamin D is generated from the oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the fur and obtained orally during grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam D. |last1=Stout |first2=Sabrina C. |last2=Agarwal |last3=Stout |first3=Samuel D. |title=Bone loss and osteoporosis: an anthropological perspective |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-306-47767-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, it was established that when 7-Dehydrocholesterol|7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, a form of a fat-soluble vitamin is produced. Alfred Fabian Hess showed that &quot;light equals vitamin D&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 UNRAVELING THE ENIGMA OF VITAMIN D] U.S. National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus|Adolf Windaus, at the University of Göttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928, for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/windaus-bio.html |title=Windaus biography at |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1959-06-09 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s he clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D.

Human cultures can play a big role in determining sun exposure in their Vitamin D level. For example, Women and children living in Kabul, Afghanistan as well as immigrants in the Netherlands have been limited outdoor time and wear clothing that cover their hands, face, and legs. &lt;ref&gt; Manaseki-Holland, S. et al., 2008.

| Whether it is made in the skin or ingested, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (cholecalciferol) is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or calcidiol) by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase produced by hepatocytes. This hydroxylation reaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires NADPH, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; yet it is not a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Once made the product is stored in the hepatocytes until it is needed and then can be released into the plasma where it will be bound to an α-globulin.
25-hydroxycholecalciferol is then transported to the proximal tubules of the kidneys where it can be hydroxylated by one of two enzymes to different forms of vitamin D, one of which is active vitamin D (1,25-OH D) and another which is inactive vitamin D (24,25-OH D). The enzyme 1α-hydroxylase which is activated by parathyroid hormone (and additionally by low calcium or phosphate) forms the main biologically active vitamin D hormone with a C1 hydroxylation forming 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as calcitriol). A separate enzyme hydroxylates the C24 atom forming 24R,25(OH)2D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; when 1α-hydroxylase is not active, this inactivates the molecule from any biological activity.
Calcitriol is represented below right (hydroxylated Carbon 1 is on the lower ring at right, hydroxylated Carbon 25 is at the upper right end).

=== Mechanism of action ===

Following the final converting step in the kidney, calcitriol (the physiologically active form of vitamin D) is released into the circulation. By binding to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), a carrier protein in the blood plasma|plasma, calcitriol is transported to various target organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot; /&gt;

Calcitriol mediates its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is principally located in the Cell nucleus|nuclei of target cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot; /&gt; The binding of calcitriol to the VDR allows the VDR to act as a transcription factor that modulates the gene expression of transport proteins (such as TRPV6 and calbindin), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine.

The vitamin D receptor belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid hormone receptor|steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and VDRs are expressed by cells in most organ (biology)|organs, including the brain, heart, skin, gonads, prostate, and breast. VDR activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells leads to the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and to the maintenance of bone content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15585788 |year=2004 |last1=Holick |first1=MF |title=Sunlight and vitamin D for bone health and prevention of autoimmune diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disease |volume=80 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1678S–88S |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VDR is known to be involved in cell proliferation and cellular differentiation|differentiation. Vitamin D also #Role in immunomodulation|affects the immune system, and VDRs are expressed in several white blood cells, including monocytes and activated T cell|T and B cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDR&quot;&gt;[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/vit_0265.shtml Vitamin D] The Physicians Desk Reference. 2006 Thompson Healthcare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from VDR activation, various alternative mechanisms of action are known. An important one of these is its role as a natural inhibitor of signal transduction by hedgehog signaling pathway|hedgehog (a hormone involved in morphogenesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16895439 |year=2006 |last1=Bijlsma |first1=MF |last2=Spek |first2=CA |last3=Zivkovic |first3=D |last4=Van De Water |first4=S |last5=Rezaee |first5=F |last6=Peppelenbosch |first6=MP |title=Repression of smoothened by patched-dependent (pro-)vitamin D3 secretion |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e232 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040232 |pmc=1502141 |journal=PLoS biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713649_3 |title=Hedgehog signaling and Vitamin D |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition ==

Vitamin D is naturally produced by the human body when exposed to direct sunlight. In many countries, such foods as milk, yogurt, margarine, Cooking oil|oil spreads, breakfast cereal, pastries, and bread are food fortification|fortified with vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nowson&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12149085 |year=2002 |last1=Nowson |first1=CA |last2=Margerison |first2=C |title=Vitamin D intake and vitamin D status of Australians |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=149–52 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, for example, fortified milk typically provides 100&amp;nbsp;IU per cup (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg), or a quarter of the estimated adequate intake for adults over age 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holick2&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.uvadvantage.org/portals/0/pres/ |title=The Vitamin D Pandemic and its Health Consequences |last1=Holick |first1=Michael |month=May |year=2007 |conference=34th European Symposium on Calcified Tissues |location=Copenhagen |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States (U.S.), typical diets provide about 100 IU/day.

A study by Semira Manaseki-Holland, M. Zulf Mughal, Zulfiqar Bhutta and
M. Qasem Shams showed that in developing countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, 
China, And Syria children are low on Vitamin D. This is due to lack of fish, eggs , and liver in their diet and a general lack of access to diverse foods.  &lt;ref&gt;Manaseki-Holland, S. et al., 2008.

For infants (birth to 12 months) the tolerable Upper Limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25 micrograms/day (1000 IU). 1000 micrograms/day (40,000 IU) in infants has produced toxicity within 1 month.&lt;ref&gt;{{MerckManual|01|004|k|BABBBEAE|Vitamin D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Dietary Reference Intake Tolerable Upper Intake Level (upper limit) of vitamin D for children and adults is set at 50&amp;nbsp;micrograms/day (2,000&amp;nbsp;IU). Vitamin D overdose causes hypercalcemia and the main symptoms of vitamin D overdose are those of hypercalcemia:  anorexia, nausea, and vomiting can occur, frequently followed by polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, nervousness, pruritus, and ultimately, renal failure. Proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec01/ch004/ch004k.html#sec01-ch004-ch004l-462 ''Vitamin D - Toxicity''] at Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy Professional Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin D toxicity is treated by discontinuing vitamin D supplementation and restricting calcium intake.

=== Mortality ===

Using information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey a group of researchers concluded that having low levels of vitamin D (&lt;17.8&amp;nbsp;ng/ml) was independently associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Melamed ML, Michos ED, Post W, Astor B |title=25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of mortality in the general population |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=168 |issue=15 |pages=1629–37 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18695076 |pmc=2677029 |doi=10.1001/archinte.168.15.1629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study evaluated whether low serum vitamin D levels were associated with all-cause mortality, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among 13,331 diverse American adults who were 20 years or older. Vitamin D levels of these participants were collected over a 6-year period (from 1988 through 1994), and individuals were passively followed for mortality through the year 2000. Shortening of leukocyte telomeres is a marker of aging. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) predicts the development of aging-related disease, and length of these telomeres decreases with each cell division and with increased inflammation (more common in the elderly). Vitamin D can inhibit proinflammatory overeaction and slow the turnover of leukocytes, longer leukocyte telomere length is achieved by the body maintaining the optimal vitamin D concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richards JB, Valdes AM, Gardner JP, ''et al.'' |title=Higher serum vitamin D concentrations are associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in women |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1420–5 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17991655 |pmc=2196219 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/86/5/1420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equality and other comparisons ==

In the last chapter, we saw how to use the equals sign to define variables and functions in Haskell. The following code

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = 5
&lt;/source&gt;

causes occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; to be replaced by &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; in all places where it makes sense to do so according to the scope of the definition. Similarly,

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = x + 3
&lt;/source&gt;

causes occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; followed by a number (which is taken as &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;'s argument) to be replaced by that number plus three.

In mathematics, however, the equals sign is also used in a subtly different and equally important way. For instance, consider this simple problem:

{{HaskellExample|Solve the following equation:|&lt;math&gt;x+3=5&lt;/math&gt;}}

When we look at a problem like this one, our immediate concern is not the ability to represent the value &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt;, or vice-versa. Instead, we read the &lt;math&gt;x+3=5&lt;/math&gt; equation as a ''proposition'', which says that some number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gives 5 as result when added to 3. Solving the equation means finding which, if any, values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; make that proposition true. In this example, we can use elementary algebra to determine that &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. 2 is the number we need to substitute to make the equation true, giving &lt;math&gt;2+3=5&lt;/math&gt;.

Comparing values to see if they are equal is also useful in programming. Haskell allows us to write such tests in a natural way that looks just like an equation. Since the equals sign is already used for defining things, we use a ''double'' equals sign, &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; instead. To see that at work, you can start GHCi and enter the proposition we wrote above like this:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 + 3 == 5
True
}}

GHCi returns &quot;True&quot; because &lt;math&gt;2 + 3&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 5. What if we use an equation that is not true?

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 7 + 3 == 5
False
}}

Nice and coherent. The next step is to use our own functions in these tests. Let us try it with the function &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; we mentioned at the start of the module:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; let f x = x + 3
Prelude&gt; f 2 == 5
True
}}

Just as expected, since &lt;tt&gt;f 2&lt;/tt&gt; is just &lt;tt&gt;2 + 3&lt;/tt&gt;.

In addition to tests for equality, we can just as easily compare two numerical values to see which one is larger. Haskell provides a number of tests including: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; (less than), &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (greater than), &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (less than or equal to) and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;  (greater than or equal to), which work just like &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; (equal to). For a simple application, we could use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; alongside the &lt;tt&gt;area&lt;/tt&gt; function from the previous module to see whether a circle of a certain radius would have an area smaller than some value.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r^2
Prelude&gt; area 5 &lt; 50
False
}}

== Boolean values ==

Now we know that GHCi can tell us whether some arithmetical propositions are true or false. That's all fine and dandy, but how could that help us to write programs? And what is actually going on when GHCi &quot;answers&quot; such &quot;questions&quot;?

To understand what is happening, consider a different but related issue. If we enter an arithmetical expression in GHCi the expression gets ''evaluated'', and the resulting numerical value is displayed on the screen:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 + 2
4
}}

If we replace the arithmetical expression with an equality comparison, something similar seems to happen:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 == 2
True
}}

But ''what'' is that &quot;True&quot; that gets displayed? It certainly does not look like a number. We can think of it as something that tells us about the veracity of the proposition &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt;. From that point of view, it makes sense to regard it as a ''value'' – except that instead of representing some kind of count, quantity, etc. it stands for the truth of a proposition. Such values are called '''truth values''', or '''boolean values'''&lt;ref&gt;The term is a tribute to the mathematician and philosopher [[w:George Boole|George Boole]].&lt;/ref&gt;. Naturally, there are only two possible boolean values – &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== An introduction to types ===

When we say &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; are values, we are not just making an analogy. Boolean values have the same status as numerical values in Haskell, and indeed you can manipulate them just as well. One trivial example would be equality tests on truth values:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; True == True
True
Prelude&gt; True == False
False
}}

&lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is indeed equal to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is not equal to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;. Now, quickly: can you answer whether &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; is equal to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;?

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 == True

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Num Bool)
      arising from the literal `2' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the first argument of `(==)', namely `2'
    In the expression: 2 == True
    In the definition of `it': it = 2 == True
}}

The correct answer is you ''can't'', because the question just does not make sense. It is impossible to compare a number with something that is not a number, or a boolean with something that is not a boolean. Haskell incorporates that notion, and the ugly error message we got is, in essence, stating exactly that. Ignoring all of the obfuscating clutter (which we will get to understand eventually), that message says that there was a number (&lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;) on the left side of the &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;, and so some kind of number was expected on the right side; however, a boolean value (&lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;) is not a number, and so the equality test exploded into flames.

Thus, the general concept is that values have '''types''', and these types define what we can or cannot do with the values. In this case, for instance, &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is a value of type &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, as is &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; (as for the &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, while there is a well-defined concept of number in Haskell the situation is slightly more complicated, so we will defer the explanation for a little while). Types are a very powerful tool because they provide a way to regulate the behaviour of values with rules which ''make sense'', making it easier to write programs that work correctly. We will come back to the topic of types many times as they are very important to Haskell.

== Infix operators ==

What we have seen so far leads us to the conclusion that an equality test like &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt; is an expression just like &lt;tt&gt;2 + 2&lt;/tt&gt;, and that it also evaluates to a value in pretty much the same way. That fact is actually given a passing mention on the ugly error message we got on the previous example:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
    In the expression: 2 == True
}}

Therefore, when we type &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt; in the prompt and GHCi &quot;answers&quot; &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; it is just evaluating an expression. But there is a deeper truth involved in this process. A hint is provided by the very same error message: 

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
     In the first argument of `(==)', namely `2'
}}

GHCi called &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; the first ''argument'' of &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt;. In the previous module, we used ''argument'' to describe the values we feed a function with so that it evaluates to a result. It turns out that &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; is just a function, which takes two arguments, namely the left side and the right side of the equality test. The only special thing about it is the syntax: Haskell allows two-argument functions with names composed only of non-alphanumeric characters to be used as ''infix operators'', that is, placed between their arguments. The only caveat is that if you wish to use such a function in the &quot;standard&quot; way (writing the function name before the arguments, as a ''prefix operator'') the function name must be enclosed in parentheses. So the following expressions are completely equivalent:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 + 9 == 13
True
Prelude&gt; (==) (4 + 9) 13
True
}}

This makes it clear how &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is a function with two arguments just like &lt;tt&gt;areaRect&lt;/tt&gt; from the previous module. What's more, the same considerations apply to the other ''relational operators'' we mentioned (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;) and to the arithmetical operators (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) – all of them are just functions. This generality is an illustration of one of the strengths of Haskell: it is a language with very few &quot;special cases&quot;, which helps to keep things simple. In general, we can say that all tangible things in Haskell are either values or functions.&lt;ref&gt;In case you found this statement bold, know that we will go even further in due course.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boolean operations ==

To see both truth values and infix operators in action, let's consider the boolean operations which manipulate truth values as in logic propositions. Haskell provides us three basic functions for that purpose:

* &lt;tt&gt;(&amp;&amp;)&lt;/tt&gt; performs the ''and'' operation. Given two boolean values, it evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; if both the first and the second are &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;, and to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (3 &lt; 8) &amp;&amp; (False == False)
True
Prelude&gt; (&amp;&amp;) (6 &lt;= 5) (1 == 1) 
False
}}

* &lt;tt&gt;(||)&lt;/tt&gt; performs the ''or'' operation. Given two boolean values, it evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; if either the first or the second are &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; (or if both are true), and to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (2 + 2 == 5) {{!!}} (2 &gt; 0)
True
Prelude&gt; ({{!!}}) (18 == 17) (9 &gt;= 11)
False
}}

* &lt;tt&gt;not&lt;/tt&gt; performs the negation of a boolean value; that is, it converts &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; and vice-versa.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; not (5 * 2 == 10)
False
}}

Another relational operator is ''not equal to''. It is already provided by Haskell as the &lt;tt&gt;(/=)&lt;/tt&gt; function, but if we were to implement it ourselves, a natural way would be:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x /= y = not (x == y)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that it is perfectly legal syntax to write operators infix, even when defining them. Completely new operators can also be created out of ASCII symbols (which means mostly the common symbols used on a keyboard).

== Guards ==

Now we have explored what is really happening with boolean operators, but we've done little more than testing one-line expressions here. We still don't know how this can be used to make real programs. We will tackle this issue by introducing ''guards'', a feature that relies on boolean values and allows us to write more interesting functions.

Let us implement the absolute value function. The absolute value of a number is the number with its sign discarded&lt;ref&gt;Technically, that just covers how to get the absolute value of a ''real'' number, but let's ignore this detail for now.&lt;/ref&gt;; so if the number is negative (that is, smaller than zero) the sign is inverted; otherwise it remains unchanged. We could write the definition as:

&lt;math&gt;|x| = \begin{cases} x, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ge 0  \\ -x,  &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; 

Here, the actual expression to be used for calculating &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; depends on a set of propositions made about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is true, then we use the first expression, but if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is the case, then we use the second expression instead. We need a way to express this decision process in Haskell. Using guards, the implementation could look like this:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;tt&gt;abs&lt;/tt&gt; is also provided by Haskell, so in a real-world situation you don't need to worry about providing an implementation yourself.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{HaskellExample|1=The abs function.|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
abs x
    | x &lt; 0     = 0 - x
    | otherwise = x
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Remarkably, the above code is about as readable as the corresponding mathematical definition. Let us dissect the components of the definition:

* We start just like a normal function definition, providing a name for the function, &lt;tt&gt;abs&lt;/tt&gt;, and saying it will take a single parameter, which we will name &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

* Instead of just following with the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; and the right-hand side of the definition, we entered a line break, and, following it, the two alternatives, placed in separate lines.&lt;ref&gt;We ''could'' have joined the lines and written everything in a single line, but in this case it would be a lot less readable.&lt;/ref&gt; These alternatives are the ''guards'' proper. Note that the whitespace is not just for aesthetic reasons; it is necessary for the code to be parsed correctly.

* Each of the guards begins with a pipe character, &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;. After the pipe, we put an expression which evaluates to a boolean (also called a boolean condition or a ''predicate''), which is followed by the rest of the definition – the equals sign and the right-hand side which should be used if the predicate evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;.

* The &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; case is used when none of the preceding predicates evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;. In this case, if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is not smaller than zero, it must be greater than or equal to zero, so the final predicate could have just as easily been &lt;tt&gt;x &gt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;; but &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; works just as well.

{{body note |There is no syntactical magic behind &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt;. It is defined alongside the default variables and functions of Haskell as simply

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;otherwise = True&lt;/source&gt;

This definition makes ''otherwise'' a catch-all guard. As evaluation of the guard predicates is sequential, the &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; predicate will only be reached if none of the other ones evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; (so make sure you always place ''otherwise'' as the last guard!). In general, it is a good idea to always provide an &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; guard, because a rather ugly runtime error will be produced if none of the predicates is true for some input. 
}}

{{body note |You might be wondering why we wrote &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt; and not simply &lt;tt&gt;-x&lt;/tt&gt; to denote the sign inversion. Truth is, we could have written the first guard as

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;    | x &lt; 0    = -x &lt;/source&gt;

and it would have worked just as well. The only issue is that this way of expressing sign inversion is actually one of the few &quot;special cases&quot; in Haskell, in that in this case the &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; is ''not'' a function that takes one argument and evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt;, but just a syntactical abbreviation. While very handy, this shortcut occasionally conflicts with the usage of &lt;tt&gt;(-)&lt;/tt&gt; as an actual function (the subtraction operator), which is a potential source of annoyance (for example, try writing three minus negative-four without using any parentheses for grouping). Here, we wrote &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt; explicitly so that we could take the opportunity to point out this issue.
}}

=== &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; and Guards ===

&lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses are particularly handy when used with guards. For instance, consider a function which computes the number of (real) solutions for a [[w:Quadratic equation|quadratic equation]], &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;!-- I don't like this example, but still couldn't think of anything more meaningful with only bare numbers. Suggestions are welcome... --&gt;

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
numOfSolutions a b c
    | disc &gt; 0  = 2
    | disc == 0 = 1
    | otherwise = 0
        where
        disc = b^2 - 4*a*c
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;where&lt;/tt&gt; definition is within the scope of all of the guards, sparing us from repeating the expression for &lt;tt&gt;disc&lt;/tt&gt;.

Adding folic acid and micronutrients to the food supply of developing countries would have a greater impact than any other single action in improving world health.

==Dietary reference intake==
Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. 1 DFE is defined as 1 μg (microgram) of dietary folate, or 0.6 μg of folic acid supplement.

J Am Coll Nutr 24, 266-274.&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. 1 DFE is defined as 1 μg of dietary folate, or 0.6 μg of folic acid supplement. This is reduced to 0.5 μg of folic acid if the supplement is taken on an empty stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Suitor CW &amp; Bailey LB (2000) Dietary folate equivalents: interpretation and application.

==Conversion to biologically active derivatives==

All the biological functions of folic acid are performed by tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives. Their biological availability to the body depends upon dihydrofolate reductase action in the liver. This action is unusually slow in humans being less than 2% of that in rats. Moreover, in contrast to rats, an almost 5-fold variation in the activity of this enzyme exists between humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt; Due to this low activity it has been suggested that this limits the conversion of folic acid into its biologically active forms &quot;when folic acid is consumed at levels higher than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (1 mg/d for adults).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt;

==History==
In the 1920s scientists believed that folate deficiency and anemia were the same condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;&gt;Lanska DJ. Handb Clin Neurol. 2009;95:445-76. Chapter 30 Historical aspects of the major neurological vitamin deficiency disorders: the water-soluble B vitamins.&lt;/ref&gt; A key observation by researcher Lucy Wills in 1931 led to the identification of folate as the nutrient needed to prevent anemia during pregnancy. Dr. Wills demonstrated that anemia could be reversed with brewer's yeast. Folate was identified as the corrective substance in brewer's yeast in the late 1930s and was first isolated in and extracted from spinach leaves by Mitchell and others in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mitchell HK, Snell EE, Williams RJ |title=The concentration of &quot;folic acid&quot; |journal=J Am Chem Soc. |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=2284 |year=1941 |doi=10.1021/ja01853a512 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01853a512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Stokstad isolated the pure crystalline form in 1943, and was able to determine its chemical structure while working at the Lederle Laboratories of the American Cyanamid Company&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffbrand AV 2001&quot;&gt;Hoffbrand AV &amp; Weir DG (2001) The history of folic acid. Br J Haematol 113, 579-589.&lt;/ref&gt;. This historical research project, of obtaining folic acid in a pure crystalline form in 1945, was done by the team called the &quot;folic acid boys,&quot; under the supervision and guidance of Director of Research Dr. Yellapragada Subbarao, at the Lederley Lab, Pearl River, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Angier RB, Boothe JH, Hutchings BL, Mowat JH, Semb J, Stokstad EL, Subbarow Y, Waller CW, Cosulich DB, Fahrenbach MJ, Hultquist ME, Kuh E, Northey EH, Seeger DR, Sickels JP &amp; Smith JM, Jr.helped the process of research(1945) Synthesis of a Compound Identical with the L. Casei Factor Isolated from Liver. Science 102, 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; This research subsequently led to the synthesis of the antifolate Aminopterin, the first ever anti-cancer drug, the clinical proof of its efficacy was proven by Dr. S. Farber in 1948. In the 1950s and 1960s scientists began to discover the biochemical mechanisms of action for folate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt; In 1960 experts first linked folate deficiency to neural tube defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt; In the late 1990s US scientists realized that despite folate being available in foods and in supplements, there was still a challenge for people to meet their daily folate requirements, and that is when the US implemented the folate fortification program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt;

==Biological roles==
Image:Folat.svg|thumb|A diagram of the chemical structure of folate.
=== DNA and cell division ===
Folate is necessary for the production and maintenance of new cell (biology)|cells, for DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, and for preventing changes to DNA and thus preventing cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kamen B | title=Folate and antifolate pharmacology | journal=Seminars in oncology | volume=24 | issue=5 Suppl 18 | year=1997 | pages=S18–30–9 | pmid=9420019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to carry one carbon groups for methylation reactions and nucleic acid synthesis (most notably thymine, but also purine bases).&lt;ref&gt;figueiredo et al 2009 Folic Acid and Risk or Prostate Cancer: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting hematopoietic cells and neoplasms the most because of rapid cell division. RNA transcription, and subsequent protein synthesis, are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis where a new genomic copy must be created). Since folate deficiency limits cell division, erythropoiesis, production of red blood cells is hindered and leads to megaloblastic anemia which is characterized by large immature red blood cells. This pathology results from persistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division, and produces abnormally large red cells called megaloblasts (and hypersegmented neutrophils) with abundant cytoplasm capable of RNA and protein synthesis, but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Some of these large cells, although immature (reticulocytes), are released early from the marrow in an attempt to compensate for the anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith C, Lieberman M, Marks DB, Marks AD |title=Marks' essential medical biochemistry |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9340-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both adults and children need folate to make normal red and white blood cells and prevent anemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Zittoun J | title=Anemias due to disorder of folate, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;12&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and transcobalamin metabolism | journal=La Revue du praticien | volume=43 | issue=11 | year=1993 | pages=1358–63 | pmid=8235383}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency of folate in pregnant women has been implicated in neural tube defects (NTD); therefore, many developed countries have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification in cereals, etc. It must be noted that NTD's occur early in pregnancy (first month) therefore women must have abundant folate upon conception. Folate is required to make red blood cells and white blood cells and folate deficiency may lead to anemia which further leads to fatigue (medical)|fatigue and weakness and inability to concentrate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthfiles/hfile68g.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biochemistry of DNA base and amino acid production ===

Image:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|Right|Metabolism of folic acid to produce methyl-vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;

In the form of a series of tetrahydrofolate (THF) compounds, folate derivatives are substrate (biochemistry)|substrates in a number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the synthesis of dTMP (2′-deoxythymidine-5′-phosphate) from dUMP (2′-deoxyuridine-5′-phosphate). It is a substrate for an important reaction that involves vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and it is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, and so required for all dividing cells.&lt;ref&gt;Goh YI &amp; Koren G (2008) Folic acid in pregnancy and fetal outcomes. J Obstet Gynaecol 28, 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (FH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) begins when folate (F) is redox|reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.expasy.org/enzyme/1.5.1.3 EC 1.5.1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis.

Methylene-THF (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. It is important to note that Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the only acceptor of methyl-THF. There is also only one acceptor for methyl-B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; which is homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by homocysteine methyltransferase. This is important because a defect in homocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; can lead to a methyl-trap of THF and a subsequent deficiency&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffbrand AV 2001&quot;/&gt;. Thus, a deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; can generate a large pool of methyl-THF that is unable to undergo reactions and will mimic folate deficiency. Another form of THF, formyl-THF or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.

In other words:
: folate → dihydrofolate → tetrahydrofolate ↔ methylene-THF → methyl-THF

==== Overview of drugs that interfere with folate reactions ====
A number of drugs interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF. Among them are the :Category:Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors|dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim, pyrimethamine and methotrexate; the Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase).

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988–91) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–96 CSFII) indicated that most adults did not consume adequate folate.&lt;!--

Folic acid is an important nutrient for women who may become Pregnancy|pregnant, because a woman's blood levels of folate fall during pregnancy due to an increased maternal RBC synthesis in the first half of the pregnancy and fetal demands in the second half.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot;/&gt; The first four weeks of pregnancy (when most women do not even realize they are pregnant) require folic acid for proper development of the brain, skull, and spinal cord.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatrightontario.ca&quot;/&gt; Serious birth defects like neural tube defects are less likely to occur when women take 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatrightontario.ca&quot;/&gt; Adequate folate intake during the preconception period, the time right before and just after a woman becomes pregnant, helps protect against a number of congenital malformations including neural tube defects (which are the most notable birth defects that occur from folate deficiency).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_21&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shaw GM, Schaffer D, Velie EM, Morland K, Harris JA|title=Periconceptional vitamin use, dietary folate, and the occurrence of neural tube defects|journal=Epidemiology|volume=6|issue=3|year=1995|pages=219–226|pmid=7619926|doi=10.1097/00001648-199505000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of folic acid use in primigravid women.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking 400 micrograms of synthetic folic acid daily from fortified foods and/or supplements has been suggested. The RDA for folate equivalents for pregnant women is 600-800 micrograms, twice the normal RDA of 400 micrograms for women who are not pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/health_recomm.htm Health Professionals Recommendations, Folic Acid, NCBDDD, CDC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published by Milunski et al. has indicated that women who took folic acid supplements during the course of pregnancy can dramatically reduce the prevalence of infant neural tube defects by 3.9 times.  The prevalence had dropped from 3.5 to 0.9 defects per 1000 births.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/eks/Milunsky1989.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the recommended folic acid intake for women planning for pregnancy is 400 micrograms per day, the mechanisms and reasons why folic acid prevents birth defects is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steegers-Theunissen&quot;&gt;Steegers-Theunissen RP et al., PLoS One. 2009 Nov 16;4(11):e7845. Periconceptional maternal folic acid use of 400 microg per day is related to increased methylation of the IGF2 gene in the very young child.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene is differentially methylated and these changes in IGF2 result in improved intrauterine growth and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steegers-Theunissen&quot;/&gt;

===Stroke===
Folic acid appears to reduce the risk of stroke. The reviews indicate only that in some individuals the risk of stroke appears to be reduced, but a definite recommendation regarding supplementation beyond the current recommended daily allowance has not been established for stroke prevention.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6709101.stm Folic acid 'reduces stroke risks'] 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Observed stroke reduction is consistent with the reduction in pulse pressure produced by folate supplementation of 5&amp;nbsp;mg per day, since hypertension is a key risk factor for stroke. Folic supplements are inexpensive and relatively safe to use and that is why stroke or hyperhomocysteinemia patients are encouraged to consume daily B vitamins including folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Terwecoren A, Steen E, Benoit D, Boon P, Hemelsoet D.

===Cancer===
Folate deficiency decreases intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which inhibits cytosine methylation in DNA, activates proto-oncogenes, induces malignant transformations, causes DNA precursor imbalances, misincorporates uracil into DNA, and promotes chromosome breakage; all of these mechanisms increase the risk of prostate cancer development.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie SJ, Folic acid deficiency and cancer: mechanisms of DNA instability, British Medical Bulletin 55:578-592 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigations have proposed that good levels of folic acid may be related to lower risk of esophageal, stomach, and ovarian cancer, but benefices of folic acid against cancer may depend on when it is taken and on individual conditions.  In addition folic acid may not be helpful, and could even be damaging, in people who already are suffering from cancer or from a precancerous condition.

The cancer drug methotrexate is designed to inhibit the metabolism of folic acid.  Folic acid may interact unexpectedly with the cancer drug fluorouracil.  The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/folic-acid_d00241_xeloda_d04311.html &quot;folic-acid and Xeloda Interactions&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The low dihydrofolate reductase activity in the liver of humans compared to other animals and so the low conversion of folic acid into its active derivatives might be due to the control of this enzyme by transcription factors such as E2F-1 involved in cell proliferation. It has been suggested that &quot;the low level of DHFR, and the other proteins under the control of E2F-1, in humans may have evolved to hinder the development of cancer. If this is the case, other animals with slow tissue turnover rates, possibly related to long life span, might also have low DHFR activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt;

Although the relationship between folate and prostate cancer is not yet clear, there has been suicide gene studies that show a target vector for folate to prostate and nasopharyngeal cancer cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/cgt/journal/v12/n10/pdf/7700844a.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Growth of tumor cells are significantly inhibited when a folate-linked nanoparticle is injected intratumorally.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;/&gt; The mechanism might be due to the interference of transfection and communication failures of intracellular gap junctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;/&gt;

===Antifolates===
Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_2&quot;/&gt; Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. The antifolate methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from the inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_46&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rubio IT, Cao Y, Hutchins LF, Westbrook KC, Klimberg VS | title=Effect of glutamine on methotrexate efficacy and toxicity | journal=Annals of Surgery | volume=227 | issue=5 | year=1998 | pages=772–8 | pmid=9605669 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199805000-00018 | pmc=1191365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_47&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wolff JE, Hauch H, Kuhl J, Egeler RM, Jurgens H | title=Dexamethasone increases hepatotoxicity of MTX in children with brain tumors | journal=Anticancer Research | volume=18 | issue=4B | year=1998 | pages=2895–9 | pmid=9713483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_48&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kepka L, De Lassence A, Ribrag V, Gachot B, Blot F, Theodore C, Bonnay M, Korenbaum C, Nitenberg G | title=Successful rescue in a patient with high dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure | journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma | volume=29 | issue=1-2 | year=1998 | pages=205–9 | pmid=9638991 | doi = 10.3109/10428199809058397}}&lt;/ref&gt;
producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. Also, bone marrow depression (inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), acute renal and hepatic failure have been reported.

Folinic acid, under the drug name leucovorin, is a form of folate (formyl-THF) that can help &quot;rescue&quot; or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_49&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Branda RF, Nigels E, Lafayette AR, Hacker M. | title=Nutritional folate status influences the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in rats | journal=Blood | volume=92 | issue=7 | year=1998 | pages=2471–6 | pmid=9746787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. The supplement of folinic acid in patients undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give non rapidly dividing cells enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given will be depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) very fast and so will not negate the effects of methotrexate.
Low dose methotrexate is used to treat a wide variety of non-cancerous diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus erythematosus|lupus, scleroderma, psoriasis, asthma, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, polymyositis, and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_52&quot;&gt;Morgan SL, Baggott JE {{Section:Chapter reference after author|Year=1995|Title=Folate antagonists in nonneoplastic disease: proposed mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity|Editor=Bailey LB| Book=Folate in Health and Disease|Pages=405–33|Publisher=New York: Marcel Dekker|isbn=0-8247-9280-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Low doses of methotrexate can deplete folate stores and cause side effects that are similar to folate deficiency. Both high folate diets and supplemental folic acid may help reduce the toxic side effects of low dose methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_53&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan SL, Baggott JE, Alarcon GS | title=Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis: folate supplementation should always be given | journal=BioDrugs | volume=8 | issue=1 | year=1997 | pages=164–75}} [http://www.adisonline.info/reprints.asp Click here to request reprint from publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_54&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan SL, Baggott JE, Lee JY, Alarcon GS | title=Folic acid supplementation prevents deficient blood folate levels and hyperhomocysteinemia during longterm, low dose methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: Implications for cardiovascular disease prevention | journal=Journal of Rheumatology | volume=25 | issue=3 | year=1998 | pages=441–6 | pmid=9517760}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anyone taking low dose methotrexate for the health problems listed above should consult with a physician about the need for a folic acid supplement.

While the role in folate as a cancer treatment is well established its long term effectiveness is diminished by cellular response. In response to decreased THF the cell begins to transcribe more DHF reductase, the enzyme that reduces DHF to THF. Because methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of DHF reductase increased concentrations of DHF reductase can overcome the drugs inhibition.

===Fertility===
Folate is necessary for fertility in both men and women. In men, it contributes to spermatogenesis.

===Macular degeneration===
A substudy of the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study published in 2009 reports that use of a nutritional supplement that contains folic acid, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin decreased the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration by 34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christen WG, Glynn RJ, Chew EY, Albert CM, JoAnn E.

===Bone health===
It has been hypothesized that folate deficiency can lead to elevated homocysteine levels which in turn lead to an increased risk of bone fractures, osteoporosis, and reduction in BMD but research studies so far show controversial results.&lt;ref&gt;Halıloglu B, Aksungar FB, Ilter E, Peker H, Akın FT, Ozekıcı U. Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2009 Nov 28. Relationship between bone mineral density, bone turnover markers and homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 levels in postmenopausal women.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menopause===
Folic acid supplements help relieve hot flushes in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaweesh S p 29&quot;/&gt; Just like in estrogen hormone replacement therapy, folic acid interacts with neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, serotonin) in the brain to reduce hot flushes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaweesh S p 29&quot;/&gt;

Folate deficiency is linked to anemia causing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in areas such as Colombia where malaria has reached endemic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Caicedo O et al, Acta Trop. 2009 Nov 18., Relation between Vitamin B12 and Folate Status, and Hemoglobin Concentration and Parasitemia during Acute Malaria Infections in Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD)===
Folate lowers homocysteine (Hcy) levels which in turn prevents bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients taking levodopa (a psychoactive drug taken to treat Parkinson's disease).&lt;ref&gt;Lee SH, Kim MJ, Kim BJ, Kim SR, Chun S, Ryu JS, Kim GS, Lee MC, Koh JM, Chung SJ.

===Folic acid supplements and masking of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency===
There has been concern about the interaction between Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and folic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid_10466189&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Scott JM | title=Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Proc Nutr Soc. | volume=2 | issue=58 | year=1999 May| pages=441–8 | pmid=10466189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folic acid supplements can correct the anemia associated with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Unfortunately, folic acid will not correct changes in the nervous system that result from vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is not treated. Therefore, intake of supplemental folic acid should not exceed 1000 Kilogram|micrograms (1000&amp;nbsp;µg = 1&amp;nbsp;mg) per day to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. In fact, to date the evidence that such masking actually occurs is scarce, and there is no evidence that folic acid fortification in Canada or the U.S. has increased the prevalence of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency or its consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid_12791626&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mills JL, Von Kohorn I, Conley MR, Zeller JA, Cox C, Williamson RE, Dufour DR | title=Low vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in patients without anemia: the effect of folic acid fortification of grain | journal=Am J Clin Nutr. | volume=6 | issue=77 | year=2003 June| pages=1474–7 | pmid=12791626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one recent study has demonstrated that high folic or folate levels, when combined with low B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels, are associated with significant cognitive impairment among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris MS, Jacques PF, Rosenberg IH, Selhub J |title=Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; status in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and cognitive impairment in older Americans in the age of folic acid fortification |journal=Am J Clin Nutr. |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=193–200 |date=1 January 2007|pmid=17209196 |pmc=1828842 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17209196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, it is important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, because they are at greater risk of having a vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Patients 50 years of age or older should ask their physicians to check their vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; status before taking a supplement that contains folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1856060.stm | work=BBC News | title=Folic acid 'heart boost for elderly' | date=6 March 2002 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health risk of too much folic acid===
The risk of toxicity from folic acid is low because folate is a water soluble vitamin and is regularly removed from the body through urine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_55&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hathcock JN. | title=Vitamins and minerals: efficacy and safety | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=66 | issue=2 | year=1997 | pages=427–37 | pmid=9250127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institute of Medicine has established a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folate of 1&amp;nbsp;mg for adult men and women, and a UL of 800&amp;nbsp;µg for pregnant and lactating (breast-feeding) women less than 18 years of age. Supplemental folic acid should not exceed the UL to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_29&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Baggott JE, Morgan SL, HaT, Vaughn WH, Hine RJ | title=Inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs | journal=Biochemical Journal | volume=282 | issue=Pt 1 | year=1992 | pages=197–202 | pmid=1540135 | pmc=1130907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10,000-patient study at Tufts University in 2007 concluded that excess folic acid worsens the effects of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency and in fact may affect the absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tufts&quot;&gt;[http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/news/ng.asp?n=82165-vitamin-b-folate-dementia Foodproductiondaily]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Adelaide concluded that the intake of folic acid supplements during late pregnancy increases the risk of babies developing childhood asthma by 30%, although researchers emphasized that their finding did not contradict recommendations to supplement folic acid in first trimester, when no additional risk was found.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science [http://www.popsci.com.au/node/40657 Uh-oh: Folic Acid Linked to Rise in Childhood Asthma] 4 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
====Elderly population====
There are benefits and risks of food folic acid fortification for elderly populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food Supply 1885&quot;&gt;Folic Acid Fortification of the Food Supply: Potential Benefits and Risks for the Elderly Population, Tucker KL et al, JAMA, 1996;276(23):1879-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; Elevated exposure to folic acid due to fortification can improve folate and homocysteine levels but can also mask symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food Supply 1885&quot;/&gt; A study where 747 subjects aged 67 to 96 years were measured for B vitamin and homocysteine status showed that diets with folic acid fortification of 140&amp;nbsp;µg/100 g of grain product decreased homocysteine level and heart disease risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food Supply 1885&quot;/&gt; However, Canada's food supply is fortified with 150&amp;nbsp;µg/100 g of grain and much of the elderly population also take a supplement which includes a folic acid component of 400&amp;nbsp;µg. Therefore it is important not to consume quantities over the recommended DRI.

===Folate deficiency===
Folate deficiency may lead to glossitis, diarrhea, depression, confusion, anemia, and fetal neural tube defects and brain defects (during pregnancy).&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;&gt;http://www.merck.com&lt;/ref&gt; Folate deficiency is diagnosed by analyzing CBC and plasma vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and folate levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; CBC may indicate megaloblastic anemia but this could also be a sign of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; A serum folate of 3 μg/L or lower indicates deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Serum folate level reflects folate status but erythrocyte folate level better reflects tissue stores after intake.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; An erythrocyte folate level of 140 μg/L or lower indicates inadequate folate status.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Increased homocysteine level suggests tissue folate deficiency but homocysteine is also affected by vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, renal function, and genetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; One way to differentiate between folate deficiency from vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is by testing for methylmalonic acid levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Normal MMA levels indicate folate deficiency and elevated MMA levels indicate vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Folate deficiency is treated with supplemental oral folate of 400 to 1000 μg per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; This treatment is very successful in replenishing tissues even if deficiency was caused by malabsorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Patients with megaloblastic anemia need to be tested for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency before folate treatment because if the patient has vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, folate supplementation can remove the anemia but can also worsen neurologic problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck.com&quot;/&gt; Morbidly obese patients with BMIs of greater than 50 are more likely to develop folate deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malterre T 2009 247–57&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malterre T |title=Digestive and nutritional considerations in celiac disease: could supplementation help? |journal=Alternative Medicine Review |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=247–57 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19803549 |url=http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/14/3/247.pdf}}{{MEDRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron-Folic acid supplementation risk for children===
Some studies show that iron-folic acid supplementation in children under 5 may result in increased mortality due to malaria; this has prompted the World Health Organization to alter their iron-folic acid supplementation policies for children in malaria prone areas such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pasricha S, Shet A, Sachdev HP, Shet AS |title=Risks of routine iron and folic acid supplementation for young children |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=857–66 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19887691 |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct2009/857.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary fortification==
Image:GrainProducts.jpg|right|thumb|In the USA many grain products are fortified with folic acid.
{{See also|Food fortification}}
Since the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and neural tube defects (NTDs), governments and health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic acid ''dietary supplement|supplementation'' for women intending to become Pregnancy|pregnant.

This has led to the introduction in many countries of ''fortification'', where folic acid is added to flour with the intention of everyone benefiting from the associated rise in blood folate levels. This is controversial, with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and the masking effect of folate fortification on pernicious anaemia (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency). However, several western countries now fortify their flour, along with a number of Middle Eastern countries and Indonesia. Mongolia and a number of Soviet Union|ex-Soviet republics are amongst those having widespread voluntary fortification; about five more countries (including Morocco, the first African country) have agreed but not yet implemented fortification. To date, no European Union|EU country has yet mandated fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russell A |title=The UK campaign on folic acid and flour fortification |journal=Cerebrospinal Fluid Res. |volume=3 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S33 |year=2006 |doi=10.1186/1743-8454-3-S1-S33 |pmc=1716791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folates can be produced by engineering Lactococcus lactis strains using a rodent depletion-repletion bioassay and the bioavailabilities of these folates are comparable with commercial folic acid currently being used for food fortification.&lt;ref&gt;Leblanc JG et al, Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats. Nutrition. 2009 Nov 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These engineered folates can potentially help alleviate the effects of folate deficiency in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Leblanc JG et al, Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats. Nutrition. 2009 Nov 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hematologic studies show an improvement in megaloblastic anemia after the addition of L. lactis strains; this again suggests that lactic acid bacteria can potentially reverse some of the harm done by folate deficiency by acting as an essential, bioavailable vitamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leblanc JG, Sybesma W, Starrenburg M, ''et al.'' |title=Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats |journal=Nutrition |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19931414 |doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of fortification and plasma folate and homocysteine levels===
A study has shown that folate fortification will substantially increase in folate status, particularly for the elderly.  In the study group, the subjects who did not use vitamin supplements has increased folate concentrations of 4.6&amp;nbsp;ng/mL to 10.0&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (11 to 23 nmol/L) (P&lt;0.001) from the base-line visit to the follow-up visit.  The prevalence of low folate concentrations (&lt;3&amp;nbsp;ng/mL [7 nmol/L]) decreased from 22.0% to 1.7% (P&lt; 0.001). The mean total homocysteine concentration has decreased from a value of 10.1 µmol/L to 9.4 µmol/L during this period (P&lt;0.001), while the prevalence of high homocysteine concentrations (&gt;13 µmol/L) has been reduced from 18.7% to 9.8% (P&lt;0.001). To further clarify the study methods, there were no statistically significant changes in concentrations of folate or homocysteine for the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques PF, Selhub J, Bostom AG, Wilson PW, Rosenberg IH |title=The effect of folic acid fortification on plasma folate and total homocysteine concentrations |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=19 |pages=1449–54 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10320382 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199905133401901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been previous debate in Australia regarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as bread and flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Bread-fortification-not-justified/2006/07/29/1153816426688.html|title=Bread fortification 'not justified'|date=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement is 0.135&amp;nbsp;mg of folate per 100g of bread.

===Canada===
In 2003, a Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, research group published findings showing that the fortification of flour with folic acid in Canada has resulted in a dramatic decrease in neuroblastoma, an early and very dangerous cancer in young children.&lt;ref&gt;French AE, Grant R, Weitzman S, Ray JG, Vermeulen MJ, Sung L, Greenberg M, Gideon Koren|Koren G.  Folic acid food fortification is associated with a decline in neuroblastoma.

Canada's fortification program has been successful with a decrease of neural tube defects by 19% since its introduction.&lt;ref name =&quot;Quinlivan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Quinlivan, E.

The fortification program was estimated to raise a person’s folic acid intake level by 70–130&amp;nbsp;µg/day, however an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinlivan&quot; /&gt; This could be from the fact that many foods are over fortified by 160–175% the predicted value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinlivan&quot; /&gt; In addition, much of the elder population take supplements which adds 400&amp;nbsp;µg to their daily folic acid intake. This is a concern because 70-80% of the population have detectable levels of unmetabolized folic acid in their blood and high intakes can accelerate the growth of preneoplasmic lesions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chustecka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |name= Chustecka, Z.|title= Folic-acid fortification of flour and increased rates of colon cancer|year=2009 Retrieved 11/09, 2009 | url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/591111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still unknown the amount of folic acid supplementation that might cause harm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot; /&gt;.

====Folic acid supplementation promotion in Canada====
According to a Canadian survey, 58% of women said they took a folic acid containing multivitamin or a folic acid supplement as early as three months before becoming pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Women in higher income households and with more years of school education are using more folic acid supplements before pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Women with planned pregnancies and who are over the age of 25 are more likely to use folic acid supplements.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Canadian public health efforts are focused on promoting awareness of the importance of folic acid supplementation for all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio-economic inequalities by providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt;

There has been previous debate in the United Kingdom regarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as bread and flour.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/601909.stm 'Put folic acid in bread'] 2000-01-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The Food Standards Agency has recommended fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2007/may/folatefort |title=Board recommends mandatory fortification |accessdate=2007-05-18 |author=FSA |date=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6665109.stm |title=Backing for folic acid in bread |accessdate=2007-05-18 | work=BBC News | date=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6648059.stm Experts back folic acid in flour] 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States Public Health Service recommends an extra 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which can be taken as a pill. However, many researchers believe that supplementation in this way can never work effectively enough since about half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned and not all women will comply with the recommendation. Approximately 53% of the US population uses dietary supplements and 35% uses dietary supplements containing folic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;&gt;Bailey RL et al Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 Nov 18. Total folate and folic acid intake from foods and dietary supplements in the United States: 2003-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Men consume more folate (in dietary folate equivalents) than women and non-Hispanic whites have higher folate intakes than Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; Twenty nine percent of black women have inadequate intakes of folate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; The age group consuming the most folate and folic acid is the &gt;50 group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; Only 5% of the population exceeds the Tolerable Upper Intake Level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Malinow MR, Duell PB, Hess DL, Anderson PH, Kruger WD, Phillipson BE, Gluckman RA, Block PC, Upson BM | title=Reduction of plasma homocyst(e)ine levels by breakfast cereal fortified with folic acid in patients with coronary heart disease | journal= New England Journal of Medicine | volume=338 | issue=15 | year=1998 | pages=1009–15 | pmid=9535664 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199804093381501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Daly S, Mills JL, Molloy AM, Conley M, Lee YJ, Kirke PN, Weir DG, Scott JM | title=Minimum effective dose of folic acid for food fortification to prevent neural-tube defects | journal=Lancet | volume=350 | issue=9092 | year=1997 | pages=1666–9 | pmid=9400511 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07247-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ruling took effect on January 1, 1998, and was specifically targeted to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects in newborns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_9&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Crandall BF, Corson VL, Evans MI, Goldberg JD, Knight G, Salafsky IS | title=American College of Medical Genetics statement on folic acid: fortification and supplementation | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics| volume=78 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=381 | pmid=9714444 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19980724)78:4&lt;381::AID-AJMG16&gt;3.0.CO;2-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that the amount of folate added is insufficient &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/women/articles/2004/01/06/fda_muffed_chance_to_prevent_birth_defects/?page=full|title=FDA muffed chance to reduce birth defects|publisher=Boston Globe|date=6 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In October 2006, the Australian press claimed that U.S. regulations requiring fortification of grain products were being interpreted as disallowing fortification in non-grain products, specifically Vegemite (an Australian yeast extract containing folate). The FDA later said the report was inaccurate, and no ban or other action was being taken against Vegemite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20641599-1702,00.html|title=US denies Vegemite ban|date=25 October 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070211072808/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20641599-1702,00.html|archivedate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the folic acid fortification program, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the American diet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia used data from 23 birth defect registries that cover about half of United States births, and extrapolated their findings to the rest of the country.  These data indicate that since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25% in the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_57&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title=Spina bifida and anencephaly before and after folic acid mandate--United States, 1995-1996 and 1999-2000 | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume=53 | issue=17 | year=2004 | pages=362&amp;ndash;5 | pmid=15129193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results of folic acid fortification on the rate of neural tube defects in Canada have also been positive, showing a 46% reduction in prevalence of NTDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=De Wals P, Tairou F, Van Allen MI, Uh SH, Lowry RB, Sibbald B, Evans JA, Van den Hof MC, Zimmer P, Crowley M, Fernandez B, Lee NS &amp;amp; Niyonsenga T|year=2007|title=Reduction in neural-tube defects after folic acid fortification in Canada|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=357|pages=135&amp;ndash;142| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067103}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magnitude of reduction was proportional to the prefortification rate of NTDs, essentially removing geographical variations in rates of NTDs seen in Canada before fortification.

When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the folic acid fortification regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100&amp;nbsp;µg/d.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choumenkovitch SF 2798&quot;&gt;Choumenkovitch SF et al, Folic Acid Intake from Fortification in United States Exceeds Predictions, The American Society for Nutritional Sciences J. Nutr. 132:2792-2798, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Data from a study with 1480 subjects showed that folic acid intake increased by 190&amp;nbsp;µg/d and total folate intake increased by 323&amp;nbsp;µg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/d.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choumenkovitch SF 2798&quot;/&gt; Folic acid intake above the upper tolerable intake level (1000&amp;nbsp;µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming folic acid supplements as well as folic acid found in fortified grain products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choumenkovitch SF 2798&quot;/&gt; Taken together, folic acid fortification has led to a bigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choumenkovitch SF 2798&quot;/&gt;

==Future directions for research==
*Identifying polymorphisms or mutations in genes involved in the synthesis of thymidylate, purines, regulatory proteins, or substrates involved in folate and homocysteine metabolism, such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, rather than simply focusing on 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase as the main cause &lt;ref&gt;Marbbn, C.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==

The preliminary inquiry justice derives all of its authority from Part XVIII of the Code. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;



{{reflist|2}}
===Purpose===

The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to set the matter down for trial before a Justice of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O’Connor (1995), 191 N.R. 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 134 (&quot;The primary function of the preliminary inquiry...is undoubtedly to ascertain that the Crown has sufficient evidence to commit the accused to trial&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hynes (D.W.) (2001), 278 N.R. 299 (SCC) at para. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice the Inquiry is used to test the strength of the Crown’s case.

Its purpose is also &quot;to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process.&quot; 
&lt;ref&gt;
Skogman v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpfg 1984 CanLII 22] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 93 at p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an &quot;expeditious charge-screening mechanism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Hynes 2001 SCC 82 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the amendments in 2005, it has also been used as a venue for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;
Skogman v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpfg 1984 CanLII 22] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 93 at p. 105
(&quot;the preliminary hearing has become a forum where the accused is afforded an opportunity to discover and to appreciate the case to be made against him at trial where the requisite evidence is found to be present&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
See R. v. Kasook, [http://canlii.ca/t/5btq 2000 NWTSC 33] at para. 25&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry judge has a general power to regulate the inquiry process under s. 537. The judge may require counsel to define the issues for which evidence will be called (see s.536.3), and may further limit the scope of the inquiry under section 536.5 and 549.

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure==

A Preliminary Inquiry can only be available for indictable offences. A hearing will be scheduled in any one of the following situations:
* the accused elects trial by judge alone or judge and jury (s. 536(2), (4))
* the accused is charged with an offence under s. 469 (e.g. murder, treason, etc)
* the accused refuses to make an election (s. 565)
* the judge exercises discretion in ordering the matter be prosecuted by indictment (s 555(1))
* the attorney general orders a trial by judge and jury (s. 568)

On the election the judge must endorse the information to show the election and who made the election. (s. 536(4.1))

Where there are more than one accused, if one person elects to have a preliminary inquiry the remainder are deemed to have made the same election. (s. 536(4.2), 567)

The time limit is set by the rules of the Court pursuant to [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec482 s. 482 and 482.1]

{{reflist|2}}

===Setting of Preliminary Inquiry===
Under s. 536, at sometime before the setting of a preliminary inquiry date, the judge must read the accused his election address:
{{cquote|
You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury, or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?
}}


===Statement of Issues===
Under s. 536.3, where an accused elects to have a preliminary inquiry, counsel must provide the court and the other party with a statement that identifies the issues that the evidence should cover and a list of the witnesses expected to provide the evidence:
{{quotation|
'''Statement of issues and witnesses'''&lt;Br&gt;
536.3  If a request for a preliminary inquiry is made, the prosecutor or, if the request was made by the accused, counsel for the accused shall, within the period fixed by rules of court made under section 482 or 482.1 or, if there are no such rules, by the justice, provide the court and the other party with a statement that identifies
:(a) the issues on which the requesting party wants evidence to be given at the inquiry; and
:(b) the witnesses that the requesting party wants to hear at the inquiry.
&lt;P&gt;

===Crown Evidence===

The Crown has unfettered discretion on whom they wish to call as witnesses. A judge has no authority to direct the Crown to call witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brass (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 206 (Sask. Q.B.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Defence Evidence===
Under s. 541(2), once the Crown has closed its case at the preliminary inquiry, the presiding judge must ask the accused whether he wishes to testify on his own behalf. The address to the accused is as follows:
{{cquote|
Do you wish to say anything in answer to these charges or to any other charges which might have arisen from the evidence led by the prosecution? You are not obliged to say anything, but whatever you do say may be given in evidence against you at your trial. You should not make any confession or admission of guilt because of any promise or threat made to you but if you do make any statement it may be given in evidence against you at your trial in spite of the promise or threat.
}}

Anything the accused says can be taken down and used as evidence.(s. 541(2))

The accused is entitled to call any witnesses he wishes (s. 541(4)). The judge should be sure to inquire whether the accused is calling any other witnesses.(s.541(3)

The judge must inquire into whether a self-represented accused has any witnesses to call as evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. LeBlanc, 2009 NBCA 84, 250 C.C.C. (3d) 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burden of proof==

The test for a preliminary inquiry is the same as a motion for non-suit or directed verdict.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Arcuri per McLachlin&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Evidence==
The justice presiding the inquiry will received evidence including that evidence &quot;that would not otherwise be admissible but that the justice considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances of the case, including a statement that is made by a witness in writing or otherwise recorded.&quot; (s.540 (7)) Anytime evidence is put forward under s.540(7) there must be reasonable notice to the other parites of &quot;the intention to tender it, together with a copy of the statement&quot;. (s. 540(8))

The crown may adduce evidence of an admission or confession by the accused “that by law is admissible” against him. ([http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec542 s. 542(1)])

Under s. 548(1), the Court must decide whether any admissible evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a guilty verdict.
&lt;ref&gt;
See
R. v. Arcuri, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc54/2001scc54.html 2001 SCC 54]&lt;br&gt;

Where direct evidence on each element of an offence is presented, the court must order the accused to stand trial on the charge. Exculpatory evidence will not result in a discharge of the charges.

Where circumstantial evidence is presented, the court engages in &quot;limited weighing&quot; of all the evidence, to determine whether a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a guilty verdict.
This involves considering the reasonableness of the inferences drawn from the evidence.

The judge may not exclude evidence at the inquiry due to any constitutional violations.&lt;Ref&gt;
See, R. v. R. (L.),  1995 CanLII 8928 (ON CA), (1995), 28 C.R.R. (2d) 173 at p. 183, per Arbour J.A.&lt;br&gt; 
also R. v. Mills 1986 CanLII 17 (SCC), (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Seaboyer 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.), at paras. 28, 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge does not have the authority to compel the Crown to provide particulars or disclosure to the defence or compel the production of Third Party Records. Further, the judge cannot order a stay proceedings for abuse of process.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359,  (S.C.C.), at paras. 33 and 38&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge however may exclude a statement of the accused as involuntary.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.), at paras. 32 and 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}
===Admissions or Confessions===
Confessions, admissions or statements of the accused are admissible under the same test to be applied at trial.&lt;ref&gt;
See, R. v. Pickett (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 297 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 303, per Jessup J.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the crown must advance some evidence that the statement was made and to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntary.&lt;REf&gt;
For example, R. v. Mulligan (1955), 111 C.C.C. 173 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 176-7, per MacKay J.A.&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Pickett, Pickett (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 297 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 302, per Jessup J.A.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Defence evidence===
Where the accused is unrepresented, under s. 541(2), the judge must warn the accused before he calls any defence evidence. The suggested warning consists of the following:
{{cquote|
“Do you wish to say anything in answer to these charges or to any other charges which might have arisen from the evidence led by the prosecution? You are not obliged to say anything, but whatever you do say may be given in evidence against you at your trial. You should not make any confession or admission of guilt because of any promise or threat made to you but if you do make any statement it may be given in evidence against you at your trial in spite of the promise or threat.”
}}
{{reflist|2}}

==Decision to Commit==
After hearing evidence and argument the court must make a ruling on whether to commit the accused to stand trial for the charges alleged.

Where the evidence is not sufficient to commit the matter to trial the Judge may discharge the accused of the charges alleged:

{{quotation|
'''Order to stand trial or discharge'''&lt;br&gt;
548. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice, he shall
:(a) if in his opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction, order the accused to stand trial; or
:(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec548 CCC]
}}

{{reflist|2}}

==Consent to Committal==
At any time before the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry the accused may consent to committal.

{{Quotation|
'''Order to stand trial at any stage of inquiry with consent'''&lt;br&gt;
549. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the justice may, at any stage of a preliminary inquiry, with the consent of the accused and the prosecutor, order the accused to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction, without taking or recording any evidence or further evidence.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Limited preliminary inquiry'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) If the prosecutor and the accused agree under section 536.5 to limit the scope of a preliminary inquiry to specific issues, the justice, without recording evidence on any other issues, may order the accused to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Procedure'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) If an accused is ordered to stand trial under this section, the justice shall endorse on the information a statement of the consent of the accused and the prosecutor, and the accused shall after that be dealt with in all respects as if ordered to stand trial under section 548.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 549; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 101; 2002, c. 13, s. 30.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec549 CCC]
}}

{{reflist|2}}

==Bail==

After a judge orders a person to stand trial, he may also review any detention orders or conditions of release. (s. 523(2)(b))

      <comment>/* Superior Court */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
&quot;Jurisdiction&quot; refers to the legal authority or power of the court over the subject matter, time and location, the persons connected to the proceeding. &lt;ref&gt;Reference re Judicature Act (1988), 46 CCC 203 NBCA at p. 218; R. v. Gray (1991), 68 CCC 193 (Ont.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdiction is intimately tied with the state based on a geographic region or territory. This is known as the &quot;principle of territoriality&quot;. From this two forms of jurisdiction arise. The was discussed in R v Hape 2007 SCC 26 at 59: 
:''...The principle of territoriality extends to two related bases for jurisdiction, the objective territorial principle and the subjective territorial principle.  According to the objective territorial principle, a state may claim jurisdiction over a criminal act that commences or occurs outside the state if it is completed, or if a constituent element takes place, within the state, thus connecting the event to the territory of the state through a sufficiently strong link:  Brownlie, at p. 299.  See also Libman, at pp. 212-13.  Subjective territoriality refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over an act that occurs or has begun within a state’s territory even though it has consequences in another state.''

This requirement is further modified by the principle of comity which says that where two or more states “have legal claim to a jurisdiction” then a state should only claim jurisidciton where ther is a “real and substantial” connection with the event.

The matter of jurisdiction can be broken down into several components:
# jurisdiction over persons
# jurisdiction over subject matters
# jurisdiction over period of time

Behind this division, is a court which itself has imposed limitations.


{{reflist|2}}
==Jurisdiction of Courts==

===Superior Court===
A Superior Court has &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; that is derived from s. 96 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This is also referred to as “original and plenary jurisdiction”. This means that the Superior Court has jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters unless expressly removed by statute.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Bloedel v. Simpson Ltd, [1995] SCR 725&lt;/ref&gt; However, the “core powers” of the superior court cannot be removed by statute without violating s.96 of the Constitution Act 1867.&lt;ref&gt; See McMillan Bloedel v Simpson Ltd. [1995] 4 SCR 725&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 468 of the Criminal Code, provides authority over indictable offences unless the Province of the particular Superior Court lacks a real and substantial connection to the offence itself. This &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; also provides power to control the judicial process and to remedy unfairness.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 SCR 262; R. v. Pilarinos (2001) 158 CCC 1 (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Provincial and Appellate Court===
A Provincial or Territorial Court has jurisdiction derived by statute alone.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Doyle, [1977] 1 SCR 597; R. v. SJL (2002), 163 CCC (3d) 560 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; This authory generally allows judges sitting in any part of the province. However, the limit does not cover offences that have no real and substantial connection with the jurisdiction of the provincial court judge.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Doyle [1977] 1 SCR 597&lt;br R v JLS 2002 163 CCC (3d) 560 (BCCA) at 23&lt;/ref&gt;

A provincial court has “authority to control the court’s process” as well others authorities derived by necessary implication. However, the authority must be exercised “according to the rules of reason and justice”&lt;ref&gt; eg. see R v Price 2010 NBCA&lt;/ref&gt;

An appellate court only has jurisdiction that is provide to it by statute and so can only hear appeals permitted under statute.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Kevork (1985), 21 CCC (3d) 369&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Jurisdiction over persons==

===Adults===
The Courts have jurisdiction over an accused by virtue of their presence in court.&lt;ref&gt;s.470(a); R. v. Gordon (1980), 55 CCC (2d) 197 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; The accused is required to be present for all indictable matters. It is because the accused must be a part of all matters of &quot;vital interest&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vezina; Cote [1986] 1 SCR 2&lt;/ref&gt; The accused must be present at trial so as to hear the case against them. 

For Summary matters the court may proceed without the presence of the accused except if liable for more than 6 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s. 800(2) and 802.1&lt;/ref&gt; This would include trial matters by way of an ''ex parte'' motion.&lt;ref&gt;s. 803(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Designations of counsel'''&lt;br&gt;
As stated, the Courts have jurisdiction over an accused present in court. The accused may appoint counsel to represent them for any proceedings under the Criminal Code by filing a designation of counsel pursuant to s. 650.01(1). &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Golyanik (2003), 173 CCC 307 (SCJ); R. v. C(JJ) (2003), 12 AtlaLR 191; R. v. L(GY) 2009 84 WCB 341 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a designation has been properly filed with the Court the accused does not need to be present for certain court appearances except for when oral evidence is being heard.&lt;ref&gt;s. 650.01(3)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; As such the Court will not lose jurisdiction over the accused due to his or her absence.&lt;ref&gt;For indictable offences, the Court will only have jurisdiction over the accused where they are present in court for an appearance. Otherwise, the charge will be a nullity and voidable&lt;/ref&gt; A valid designation must contain the name and address of the counsel, as well as set out the charge(s) and date(s) of alleged offences or any particulars identifying the matters, and it must be signed by the accused and designated counsel.&lt;ref&gt;s. 650.01(2)&lt;bR&gt;
R. v. Butler, 2010 NSSC 284 - rejected designation for no listed charges
&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Specific Persons===
The Crown is generally immune from prosecutions for executive conduct unless statute otherwise directs.&lt;ref&gt; see s. 17 of Interpretation Act&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Youths===
A court cannot have jurisdiction over any person under the age of 12.&lt;Ref&gt;see s.13 of the Criminal Code&lt;/ref&gt; This date is set as of the date of the offence. &lt;reF&gt; see s. 16 YCJA nad  R v McDonald 1985 ONCA 21 CCC 330&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Jurisdiction over subject matter==


Section 553 is procedural in nature and does not usurp the jurisdiction of superior court on matters that have properly been brought before it.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Manitopyes, 2012 SKQB 141 at 69&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sexual Assault-based Offences==

It is not always necessary that the Crown call a toxicologist or any other type of forensic expert to prove that the complainant was drugged using a date-rape drug.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fleming 2007 ONCA 808&lt;/ref&gt;

For sexual offences (s. 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 212, 271, 272 or 273), section 274 prohibits the need for any corroboration of evidence. However, it remains a useful practice to consider further corroboratoin where applicable.&lt;ref&gt;
F.H. v. McDougall, [http://canlii.ca/t/20xm8 2008 SCC 53], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41 at para. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Radiation Oncology/Pancreas/RTOG Pancreas|RTOG Pancreas Trials]]
* ''Title:'' A Phase III Study of Pre and Post Chemoradiation 5-FU vs. Pre and Post Chemoradiation Gemcitabine for Postoperative Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
* ''Objectives:'' 
** 1) To determine whether 5-FU based chemoradiation preceded and followed by gemcitabine improves the overall survival, local-regional and distant disease control, and/or disease-free survival as compared to 5-FU based chemoradiation preceded and followed by 5-FU in the postoperative adjuvant treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.
** 2) To compare the acute and late toxicities between 5-FU chemoradiation preceded and followed by gemcitabine and 5-FU chemoradiation preceded and followed by 5-FU.
** 3) To prospectively evaluate the ability of post-resectional CA19-9 to predict survival among adjuvantly treated patients who have undergone a potentially curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
* ''[http://rtog.org/members/protocols/97-04/97-04.pdf Protocol]:''

* ''Conclusion:''
** '''2008''' PMID 18319412 '''Fluorouracil vs gemcitabine chemotherapy before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiation following resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a randomized controlled trial.''' (Regine WF, JAMA. 2008) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: The addition of gemcitabine to adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemoradiation was associated with a survival benefit for patients with resected pancreatic cancer, although this improvement was not statistically significant. 

* ''Publications:''
** '''2009''' '''Correlation of cytidine deaminase single nucleotide polymorphism and toxicity from gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer from RTOG 9704.''' (Farrell J, [Abstract] American Society of Clinical Oncology 2009 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, 15-17 January 2009, San Francisco, CA. A-115, 2009.)
** '''2009''' PMID 18992248 '''Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 levels predict response to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer.''' (Farrell JJ, Gastroenterology. 2009)
** '''2009''' '''Single institutional experience with oral capecitabine (Cap) in adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer: Gemcitabine (G) followed by Cap/RT followed by G''' (Piperdi B, [Abstract] American Society of Clinical Oncology 2009 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, 15-17 January 2009, San Francisco, CA. A-229, 2009.)
** '''2008''' PMID 19029412 '''Postresection CA 19-9 predicts overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation: a prospective validation by RTOG 9704.''' (Berger AC, J Clin Oncol. 2008) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: To our knowledge, this is the first phase III trial to perform prospective analysis of CA 19-9 levels in patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. It definitively confirms the prognostic importance of postresectional CA 19-9 levels after surgery with curative intent in patients with pancreatic cancer.
** '''2006''' [http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016%2806%2902611-3/fulltext Abstract] '''RTOG 9704: radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) review and survival.''' (Abrams RA, [Abstract] Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 66 (3 Suppl 1): A-39, S22, 2006.) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: This is the first phase III adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to require XRT QA review. In this study Pts whose XRT did not adhere to protocol specified XRT parameters experienced inferior S. These results suggest that in this context failure to adhere to XRT protocol guidelines compromises S. NPI and S did not correlate in this study. XRT QA compliance appears to be an important parameter in adjuvant pancreatic cancer trials and should be regarded as such for future trials.

==Stealing==
The term &quot;steal&quot; is defined in s. 2 as meaning &quot;to commit theft&quot;. While &quot;committing theft&quot; is defined in s. 322:
{{quotation|
'''Theft'''&lt;br&gt;
322. (1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent
:(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;
:(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;
:(c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or
:(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.&lt;br&gt;

'''Time when theft completed'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A person commits theft when, with intent to steal anything, he moves it or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Secrecy'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A taking or conversion of anything may be fraudulent notwithstanding that it is effected without secrecy or attempt at concealment.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Purpose of taking'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) For the purposes of this Act, the question whether anything that is converted is taken for the purpose of conversion, or whether it is, at the time it is converted, in the lawful possession of the person who converts it is not material.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 283.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec322 CCC]
}}

{{reflist|2}}

==Violence or Threat of Violence: 343 (a)==
The violence is made out by an unlawful assault. However, to make out robbery the assault must be for a specific intent.

The violence or threats of violence must be ''for the purpose of'' taking whatever that is stolen and so it requires that the violence or threats be before or contemporaneous to the theft.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Newell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qlq9 2007 NLCA 9] (CanLII) at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jean, [http://canlii.ca/t/fttg4 2012 BCCA 448] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If however the property was &quot;stolen clandestinely&quot; or &quot;surreptitious[ly]&quot;, then the presence of violence or threats of violence to enable escape will not make out a robbery.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Downer (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 532, Martin J.A. at para. 14 (&quot;If property was stolen clandestinely, violence or threats of violence to enable the thief to escape, or to prevent the re-taking by the owner of what had been stolen, did not have the effect of escalating larceny into robbery&quot;) see also para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Purse-snatching will not make out a robbery where the item was taken before the victim had a chance to resist.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Picard (1976) 39 CCC (2d) 57 &lt;/ref&gt;

The violence can be used against a target other than the victim being robbed.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Newell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qlq9 2007 NLCA 9] &lt;/ref&gt;

An utterance threatening force will be sufficient to make out the violence element of the offence. There is no need to measure the degree of violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lecky (2001), 157 CCC (3d) 351&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduct alleging to be implicit in its violence or threat of violence is determined by whether a reasonable person would have felt or apprehended that violence was conveyed or threatened in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacCormack (2009), 241 CCC (3d) 516, [http://canlii.ca/t/2289j 2009 ONCA 72] (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sayers, (1983) 8 CCC (3d) 572 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Pelletier, (1992) 71 CCC (3d) 438
&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing a note requesting money to a bank teller can be sufficient to make out a threat of violence.&lt;reF&gt; R. v. Katrensky (1975), 24 CCC (2d)350&lt;/ref&gt;

A threat of violence need not be overt. A display of a knife while hooded and a demand for money is an implied threat of violence. &lt;Ref&gt;R v Griffin 2011 NSCA 103; R. v. Douglas, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsbpx 2012 MBQB 197] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding a person down to prevent resistance constitutes violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Trudel (1984), 12 CCC (3d) 342&lt;/ref&gt;

What constitutes a threat comes from the case law of the charge of uttering threats under s.264. If the utterance meets the criteria, it is irrelevant whether the victim appreciated the threatening nature of the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Carons (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 19 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; To put it another way, the effect of the threat on the prospective victim is of no consequence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v. Nabis [1974] 18 C.C.C. (2d) 144 &lt;/reF&gt;

&quot;Extort&quot; is defined in the shorter Oxford English Dictionary in part as, &quot;To wrest from a reluctant person by force, violence, torture, intimidation&quot;.

{{reflist|2}}

==Stealing with Personal Violence: 343 (b)==
&quot;violence&quot; in this section means more than a technical assault.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lew (1978), 30 CCC (2d) 140 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; It is determined using a subjective/objective test.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bourassa (2004), 189 CCC (3d) 438, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j0x4 2004 NSCA 127] (NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Assault with Intent to Steal: 343 (c)==

Assault has the same meaning as s. 266. This includes technical assaults&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Lew (1978), 40 CCC (2d) 140&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no need to prove that a theft actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Allison (1983), 33 C.R. (3d) 333 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Weapon'''&lt;br&gt;
Under s. 343(d) the &quot;weapon&quot; must be either (1) an actual firearm; (2) an imitation firearm; or (3) an offensive weapon. Simply using one's hand to imitate a firearm is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Delage (2001) 154 CCC (3d) 85 (Que CA), [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/2001/2001canlii12656/2001canlii12656.html 2001 CanLII 2656]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armed'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Armed&quot; must be the actual possession of a weapon. This does not include simulating possession of a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sloan (1974), 19 CCC (2d) 190 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gouchie (1976), 33 CCC (2d) 120&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==As Opposed to Theft==
Given that robbery is a form of theft, there can be cases where the proximity and connection between theft and violence is limited. A theft where there is violence after the completion of the theft can be treated as distinct from robbery.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Newell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2007/2007nlca9/2007nlca9.html 2007 NLCA 9]
&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction is most seen in robbery under s. 343(a) which requires violence or threats to &quot;overcome resistance to stealing&quot;. Where the threats are made after the completion of the theft, such as after a shoplifter leaves a store and is followed by staff, threats or violence may be found as only for the purpose of escape and not the purpose of preventing stealing which is already complete by this point.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Daughma, [1989] O.J. No. 1765 - in this case, threats occurred outside of store after accused steals a bottle of wine.
c.f. R v Morgan, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvrn1 2013 ABCA 26] (CanLII) - offender pointed a gun at guard in the parking lot while offender was getting into his car. Judge found it was a robbery&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Dangerous Offenders and Long-Term Offenders==
Robbery is classified as a &quot;serious personal injury offence&quot; (s. 752) where there is violence or threats of violence involved.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lebar  [http://canlii.ca/t/28wdc 2010 ONCA 220]&lt;Br&gt;
R v Griffin [http://canlii.ca/t/fnwsk 2011 NSCA 103] - court found threat of violence and SPIO where offender wore a disguise and tapped a knife on the counter while asking for money&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Included Offences==
The following have been found to be included offences:
* Assault&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Luckett (1981) 20 CR (3d) 393 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horsefall, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1990/1990canlii1039/1990canlii1039.html 1990 CanLII 1039 (BC C.A.)]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theft&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Boisvert (1991) 68 CCC (3d) 478, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pg0m 1991 CanLII 3039] (Que CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Defence Election */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Crown Election==
The election process is a &quot;means by which the criminal law provides the Attorney General with sufficient flexibility to take the specific circumstances of each case into account and ensure that, in each case, the interests of justice are served.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Century 21 Ramos Realty Inc. and Ramos, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p77d 1987 CanLII 171] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has the power of election on hybrid criminal offences. A hybrid offence is an offence defined in the Criminal Code as having both summary and indictable classes of punishment. Hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable until the Crown elects to proceed summarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Marr, [http://canlii.ca/t/1l8fs 2005 NSCA 73] at para. 20; R. v. Dudley [http://canlii.ca/t/272k3 2009 SCC 58] at para. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

No offences with maximum penalty of 14 years or life are hybrid offences.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Sentencing/Offences/Offences_by_Penalty|List of Offences by Penalty]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The power to elect is at the discretion of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Smythe [http://canlii.ca/t/1twrk 1971 SCR 680]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceedings on summary offences must commence within six months of the incident date. ([http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec786 s. 786(2)]) That is, unless the Crown and Defence agree.&lt;ref&gt;s. 786(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is acceptable practice to elect indictable in order to allow the prosecution to proceed, such as where the 6 month time limit has expired, and then re-elect summarily with consent.&lt;ref&gt;Burke (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 163 (NLCA) &lt;/ref&gt; 
The judge cannot interfere by refusing to allow re-election.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Linton (1994) 90 CCC 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable &quot;unless and until the Crown elects to proceed summarily&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Dudley 2009 SCC 58 para. 21 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc58/2009scc58.html]; see also R. v. Paul-Marr, 2005 NSCA 3 at para 20; see also s.34 of the Interpretation Act&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a proceedings progresses to its conclusion without the Crown having made no election on a hybrid offence and the charge was within 6 months of the incident, the Crown is deemed to have elected to proceed by &quot;summary conviction&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mitchell, [http://canlii.ca/t/6h2k 1997 CanLII 6321] (ON CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marcotullio (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 478 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. W. (W.W.) (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 214 (Man. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, where the accused elects mode of trial even though the Crown failed to make an election, the trial will be deemed indictable.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mitchell (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a matter is part of the discretionary core functions of the Attorney General is a question of law.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nixon, 2009 ABCA 289 at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6 month limitation under s. 786 does not count from the beginning of the offence where it spans several days. An offence spanning a timeframe will be valid for the entire span as long as the end date is within the 6 month limit.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nadir, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v6mp 2004 CanLII 59965] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Defence Election==
Unless the Code provides otherwise, where an accused is charged with an indictable offence or a hybrid offence which was elected to proceed indictably, the accused has the right of electing the mode of trial under s. 536(2).

The defence election consist of trial by the following methods:
# trial by a provincial court judge;
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge and jury, with a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge alone, with a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge and jury, without a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge alone, without a preliminary inquiry

The Court is required to read the &quot;election address&quot; unless it is waived by the accused. The address is set out in s. 536:

{{quotation|
s.536...&lt;p&gt;
'''Election before justice in certain cases'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) If an accused is before a justice charged with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to an election in the following words:
:You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?
}}

The right of election is not available for indictable offences that are either &quot;absolute jurisdiction&quot; offences or &quot;exclusive jurisdiction offences&quot;.

Under s. 471, a person charged with an indictable offence is presumed to be be tried by a judge and jury unless they consent to otherwise.

An election to provincial court under s. 536(3) requires that the judge endorse the information showing the election and direct the matter before a provincial court judge for the purpose of taking a plea.

==Absolute and Exclusive Jurisdiction==

Under [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec553 s. 553], the Provincial Court has jurisdiction that is &quot;absolute and does not depend on the consent of the accused where the accused is charged in an information&quot; with several classes of offences. These are classified as &quot;absolute jurisdiction&quot; offences.

Under section 469, courts of criminal jurisdiction, being provincial courts, have judisdiction over all indictable offences except for those listed in the following table.

==Re-election==

The relevant provisions state as follows:
{{quotation|
'''Right to Re-elect'''&lt;Br&gt;
561 (2) An accused who elects to be tried by a provincial court judge or who does not request a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) may, not later than 14 days before the day first appointed for the trial, re-elect as of right another mode of trial, and may do so after that time with the written consent of the prosecutor.
&lt;P&gt;
(4) idem — Where an accused wishes to re-elect under subsection (2), the accused shall give notice in writing that he wishes to re-elect together with the written consent of the prosecutor, where that consent is required, to the provincial court judge before whom the accused appeared and pleaded or to a clerk of the court.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec561 CCC]
}}

After the initial election, the Defence may change the mode of trial by re-electing under s. 561. The Defence is permitted to elect from provincial court to Superior Court judge alone or judge and jury (s.561(2)). This will only be possible without consent of the Prosecution when it is within the 14 day time limit.

There is a discretion with the provincial court judge to allow re-election during a trial to allow the accused to re-elect without the Crown's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Re Diamonti (1981), 61 CCC (2d) 483 (BCSC); R v Jonkers (1991) unreported (BCPC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused may only re-elect once, after which they have no further discretion of election.&lt;ref&gt;R v Ishmail, (1981) 6 WCB 148 (BSCS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much nicer than the micro-controllers.

Intel didn't support Vtune on Linux well when they spun Xscale off to Marvell, but TI used a completely different (non-infringing?) trace and profile architecture on the OMAP. Why these important commercial tools are so hard to obtain decent support for is confusing, but the Microsoft-Linux tension probably had something to do with it. Apparently you can use addr2line(1) with http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Profiling_with_DSS on the OMAP. Presumably if you profile your code on an OMAP, that will help you optimize it on whatever non-TI system you are targeting, as long as the cache geometries are sufficiently similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a quick reference page of sample functions that work with dates and times.

== Method ==
We will provide a sample list of XQuery expressions and their results.

=== Current Date ===
This function returns the current date on the system that is executing the XQuery in W3C XML Schema date format:
   current-date()
Result:
   2010-05-28-05:00

Note that the &quot;-05:00&quot; is the offset from GMT of the server.

=== Current Time ===
   current-time()
Result:
   07:02:11.616-05:00

=== Current Date and Time ===
   current-dateTime()
Result
   2010-05-28T06:59:05.526-05:00

Note that default the letter 'T&quot; seperates the date and the time.  The results after the decimal point are the number of milliseconds.

=== One Week Ago ===
   xs:date(current-dateTime()) - xs:dayTimeDuration('P7D')
Result:
   2010-05-21-05:00

The rectangular coordinate system, or Cartesian coordinate system, is a systematic way of locating objects. It was invented by a mathematician called Descartes. It is similar, though not exactly the same as, the coordinate systems in geography or computer literacy.

==Basic concept==
[[File:Cartesian plane.svg|right|300px|thumb|A summary of basic Cartesian plane-related terms]]
A rectangular coordinate plane, or Cartesian plane, is made of two axes, the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis is the horizontal axis, while the y-axis is the vertical one. The point of intersection of these two axes is called the origin, and is always named ''O''. On the x-axis and y-axis is the scale, which is very similar to those in statistical diagrams, only there are negative numbers. In fact, they look like number lines, one horizontal and one vertical, with the '0' points overlapping.

We can locate a point in the coordinate system with an ordered pair. An ordered pair is made of two numbers: the reading of the two axes. We put the x reading first, then the y, like this: (x, y). The coordinate plane is divided into four parts: the first quadrant (quadrant I), the second quadrant (quadrant II), the third quadrant (quadrant III) and the fourth quadrant (quadrant IV). The position of the four quadrants can be found on the figure on the right. A point can lie on any of these quadrants, the x-axis, the y-axis or the origin. We can find out some basic properties of the ordered pair just by looking at the position of the point.
* Quadrant I: (''x'', ''y'')
* Quadrant II: (''-y'', ''y'')
* Quadrant III: (''-x'', ''-y'')
* Quadrant IV: (''x'', ''-y'')
* The x-axis: (''x or -x'', 0)
* The y-axis: (0, ''y or -y'')
* The origin: (1, 1)

When determining the ordered pair of a point, remember that the scale may not necessarily be one-to-one. That means the numbers don't have to go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. They can also go 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or even 5, 10, 15, 20.

If you are absolutely sure that two points form a horizontal of vertical line, the definition of horizontal being parallel to the x-axis and the definition of vertical being parallel to the y-axis, you can find the one or both of the coordinates of one point with reference to another, without the help of the scale. For example, if ''P'' (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as ''Q'' (3, ''y''), then ''y'' = 4.

==Determining length and area==
[[File:Cartesian plane problem.svg|right|300px]]
We will introduce the next part with a complex problem (see the figure on the right).&lt;br/&gt;
Given:
*''XD''//''YE''
Find:
*The length of ''QP''
*The sum of all shaded areas
*The coordinates of ''I'' if ''F'': (-2, -3)

It looks a bit complicated at first, so let us start from the line on the first quadrant, ''QP'', which appears to be rather easy. We will work out all the unknowns if we can as well as solve the first bulleted goal. First, let's take a look at the coordinates of ''P''. They are (1, 2). As ''P'' and ''Q'' lie on the same horizontal line, their ''y''-coordinate must be the same. Therefore, the coordinates of ''Q'' must be (3, 2). In other words, ''z'' = 2. To find the length of PQ, all we need to do is to find the difference between their ''x''-coordinates; in this case, 3 - 1 = 2 units. Therefore, ''QP'' = 2 units. In mathematical representation, that would be:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } P = 2\\
\therefore z = 2 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ PQ &amp;= 3 - 1\\
&amp;=2 \text{ units} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Good! Now that we have solved the first goal, let's move on to the little triangle on the second quadrant. Again, we'll work out all the unknowns. First, let's look at the ''x''-coordinate of ''C''. we already know that ''z'' = 2, so ''-z'' must be -2, and so is the ''x''-coordinate of ''C''. What about the ''y''-coordinate? we know that B and C lie on the same horizontal line, so their ''y''-coordinates must be the same. Therefore, the ''y''-coordinate of ''C'' must be 1 also, and ''y'' = 1. The ''x''-coordinate of ''B'', called ''x'', is also missing. As A and B are on the same vertical line, their ''x''-coordinate must be the same. So, we can deduce that ''x'' = -4. In mathematical expressions:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The }\ x \text{-coordinate of }\ C  &amp;= -z \\
&amp;= 1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } B = 1\\
\therefore y = 1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } A = -4\\
\therefore x = -4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Next, we will find out the area of the triangle, ''ABC''. This is going to prove to be very helpful when finding the total area of the shaded regions. Before we do that, we must find out the height and base of the triangle. Do you still remember the formula for the area of triangles? It is height times base over two. Let's choose ''BC'' as the base of the triangle. As AB and BC are perpendicular to each other, ''AB'' can be the height. As ''BC'' is horizontal, the length of ''BC'' is the difference between the ''x''-coordinates of ''B'' and ''C''. That would be -4 and -1, so the length of ''BC'' is  [(-1)-(-4)] units = 3 units. With ''AB'' the situation is opposite. Since AB is a vertical line, we should find the difference between their ''y''-coordinates instead. In this case, that would be (3-1) units = 2 units. Therefore, the area if triangle ''ABC'' is  (3-2) sq. units = 1 sq. unit. Let's see what that is in mathematical expressions.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ BC  &amp;= x - (-z) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= [(-1)-(-4)] \text{ units}\\
&amp;= 3 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ AB  &amp;= 3 - 1 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 2 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of }\ \triangle ABC  &amp;= \frac{BC \times AB}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{3 \times 2}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 3 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Now we only have to figure out the area of the figure in the two bottom quadrants. The figure is shaped like a trapezium with a triangle stuck to its side and a hole in the middle. Using the knowledge we learnt previously, you should be able to figure out that ''a'' = -4 and ''b'' = -6. Note that we already know the value of ''-z'' from above, which is -2. Now we have to find the areas of the trapezium, the triangle, and the squared hole. Let's figure out the triangle first. Draw an imaginary line from ''Z'' perpendicular to ''XY'', and name it ''R''.  The coordinates of ''R'' are (-4, -5) with reference to points ''X'' and ''Z''. The lengths of ''RZ'' and ''XY'' should be 1 and 4 respectively, so the area of triangle ''XYZ'' is surely 2 sq. units. The details are presented below in mathematical expressions.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } X = -4\\
\therefore a = -4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } Y = -6\\
\therefore b = -6 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } D = -z \\
= -2 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ ZR  &amp;= (-5) - (-4) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 1 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ XY  &amp;= (-2) - (-6) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of }\ \triangle XYZ &amp;= \frac{ZR \times XY}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{1 \times 4}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 2 \text{ sq.  units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Now we have to find the area of the right-angled trapezium. Do you still remember the formula for the area of a trapezium? It is the sum of the parallel lines times the height, over two. We need to find the length of the parallel lines and height in order to find the area. We already know the height ''XY''. The lengths of ''XD'' and ''YE'' are 9 and 8 respectively, so the area of the trapezium is 34 sq. units. The details are below.


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ XD  &amp;= (-4) - 5 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 9 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ YE  &amp;= (-4) - 4 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of trapezium}\ XYDE &amp;= \frac{(XD+YE) \times XY}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{(9+4) \times 4}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 26 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our next step is to find the area of the square. The formula for the square is the length of one side squared, so the area of square ''FGHI'' is ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; units = 4 units.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of square}\ FGHI &amp;= FI^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= z^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 2^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The last part of point two is figuring out the total shaded area using the skills we learnt from previous chapters such as [[../Plane shapes|plane shapes]]. The first job is finding the total area of the figure in the third and fourth quadrants. The shaded area of the third and fourth quadrants = The area of pentagon XZYED - The area of square FGHI = The area of triangle XYZ + The area of trapezium XYDE - The area of square FGHI = (2+26-4) sq. units = 24 sq. units. Next, we add that to the area of triangle ABC, which gives us (24+3) sq. units = 11 sq. units. The mathematical expressions are shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp;\text{The shaded area in quadrants III and IV }\\
&amp;= \text{Area of } \triangle XYZ \text{ sq. units} + \text{Area of trapezium } XZYED - \text{Area of square } FGHI \\
&amp;= (2+26-4) \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 24 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The sum of all shaded areas } &amp;= (24+3) \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 27 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Since we have finished two goals already, it is time to find the third one. The third goal requires a technique that is the other way around the ones we used above. You may have noticed that the third goal is different from the others in that it requires the coordinates to be found, not a measure. Remember that the only coordinate we know from the question is those of point ''F''. Also recall that all four sides of a square are the same. Since we can find the length of a segment given the coordinates of its endpoints, we can find the coordinates of the endpoints with the length of a segment.

So, how exactly do we do it? The coordinates of ''F'' are (-2, -3). We can find the ''y''-coordinate of ''I'' which, we have learnt is the same as ''F'''s. Therefore, the ''y''-coordinate is -3. But what about the ''x''-coordinate? Since we know that ''FI'' = ''z'' = 2 units, we can work out that the ''x''-coordinate of ''I'' is [(-2)+2)] units = 4 units. Remember that the position of the endpoint whose coordinate we are finding relative to the endpoint whose coordinate we already know is significant. If ''I'' were on the right of F, not on the left of it, its ''x''-coordinate would be [(-2)-2)] units = -4 units. If ''I'' were above or below ''F'', their ''x''-cooridinates would be the same, and the ''y''-coordinate of ''I'' would be [(-3)-2)] units = -5 units (below) or [(-3)+2)] units = -1 unit (above).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } F = -3\\
\therefore \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } I = -3 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because FI = z\\
= 2 \text{ units} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \therefore \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } I = [(-2)+2)] \\
&amp;= 4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

That's it! Not only have we learnt how to figure out the length and area of shapes and coordinates of points in a rectangular coordinate plane, but we have also seen an important example of how area is calculated.</text>

In the coordinate system we have discussed last chapter, the rectangular/Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is only used to determine how the coordinates are numbered. However, there is another coordinate system where the origin is the very heart and sole of the system. It is called the polar coordinate system. In this chapter, we will discuss the polar coordinate system, and compare it to the rectangular coordinate system.

== Basic concepts ==
[[File:Polar concept introduction.svg|250px|right]]
On the right is a typical polar coordinate plane. Nothing is italicised in the diagram because of technical difficulties. The point on the centre is the pole, and is the 'origin' of the polar coordinate system. ''OX'' is called the polar axis. ''OP'' is the radius vector of ''P'' and is usualy represented by a lowercase ''r''.

This page deals with methods which are available for most estimation commands. This can be useful for all kind of regression models. 

== Formulas ==

Most estimation commands use a formula interface. The outcome is left of the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and the covariates are on the right.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
y ~ x1 + x2
&lt;/source&gt;

It is easy to include multinomial variable as predictive variables in a model. If the variable is not already a factor, one just need to use the &lt;code&gt;as.factor()&lt;/code&gt; function. This will create a set of dummy variables. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
y ~ as.factor(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

For instance, we can use the Star data in the '''Ecdat''' package : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;)
data(Star)
summary(lm(tmathssk ~ as.factor(classk), data = Star))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;I()&lt;/code&gt; takes arguments &quot;as is&quot;. For instance, if you want to include in your equation a modified variable such as a squarred term or the addition of two variables, you may use &lt;code&gt;I()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y ~ x1 + I(x1^2) + x2)
lm(y ~ I(x1 + x2))
lm(I(y-100) ~ I(x1-100) + I(x2 - 100))
&lt;/source&gt;

It is easy to include interaction between variables by using &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; adds all interaction terms whereas &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; adds interaction terms and individual terms.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y~x1:x2) # interaction term only
lm(y~x1*x2) # interaction and individual terms
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to generate polynomials using the &lt;code&gt;poly()&lt;/tt&gt; function with option &lt;code&gt;raw = TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 3, raw = TRUE))
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also an advanced formula interface which is useful for instrumental variables models and mixed models. For instance &lt;code&gt;ivreg()&lt;/code&gt; ('''AER''') uses this advanced formulas interface. The instrumental variables are entered after the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. See the [[R_Programming/Linear_Models#Instrumental_Variables|Instrumental Variables]] section if you want to learn more.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;AER&quot;)
ivreg(y ~ x | z)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Output ==

In addition to the &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; functions which display the output for most estimation commands, some authors have developed simplified output functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Dietary Fiber===
Eating the right amount of dietary fiber a day can help manage a person's weight as well as the prevention of obesity. According to the article written by Linda Boeckner and Karen Schledewitz, &quot;soluble and insoluble fibers make up the two basic categories of dietary fiber. Insoluble fibers – cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin – are not soluble in water. Foods that contain insoluble fibers are wheat bran, whole grain products and vegetables. Insoluble fibers are responsible for increased stool bulk and help to regulate bowel movements.&quot; With that said, fibers can do great progression for the human body. However, eating too much fiber can cause a strain on the human body therefore it is important to watch the intake of fiber. There are many side effects that can be caused by consuming too much fiber such as an unbalanced diet, or inadequate liquids that can result to pain. The best way to see if fiber is meeting needs, going to see a nutritionist is recommended. Everyone's needs are different based on their age, sex and activity level. A great resource to visit is www.mypyramid.gov, this gives an insight on what foods will help provide a balanced diet such as fruits, vegetables and grains. {{Citation

===From the Harvard school of public health:===

==Introduction==
Fiber refers to carbohydrates that can't be digested. it is present in all plants that are eaten for food, (fruits, begetables, grains, and legumes.)There are a number of ways to categorize fiber. One way is from its source of origin, for example, fiber from grains is referred to cereal fiber. Another way is how easily the fiber dissolves in water. Soluble fiber partially dissolves, and insoluble fiver does not dissolve. 

Currently its recommended that children and adults consume at least 20 grams of dietary fiber per day from food. The more calories you eat each day, the more fiber you need; teens and men may require upwards of 30 to 35 grams per day or more. Unfortunately, the average American eats only 15 grams of dietary fiber a day. 

Fiber appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. 

==Fiber and Colon Cancer==
For a long time, Americans have been told to consume a high-fiber diet to lower the risk of colon cancer—mainly on the basis of results from relatively small studies. More recently, larger and better-designed studies have largely failed to show a link between fiber and colon cancer. One example is a Harvard study that followed over 80,000 female nurses for 16 years—found that dietary fiber was not strongly associated with a reduced risk for either colon cancer or polyps (a precursor to colon cancer). 

==Fiber and Heart Disease==
In the United States, coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death for both men and women. This disease is characterized by a buildup of cholesterol-filled plaque in the coronary arteries which are the arteries that feed the heart. This causes them to become hard and narrow, a process referred to as atherosclerosis. Total blockage of a coronary artery produces a heart attack.

High intake of dietary fiber has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease in a number of large studies that followed people for many years. (3) In a Harvard study of over 40,000 male health professionals, researchers found that a high total dietary fiber intake was linked to a 40 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease, compared to a low fiber intake. (4) Cereal fiber, which is found in grains, seemed particularly beneficial. A related Harvard study of female nurses produced quite similar findings. (5)

Fiber intake has also been linked with the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of factors that increases the chances of developing heart disease and diabetes. These factors include high blood pressure, high insulin levels, excess weight (especially around the abdomen), high levels of triglycerides, the body's main fat-carrying particle, and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. Several studies suggest that higher intake of cereal fiber and whole grains may somehow ward off this increasingly common syndrome. (6,7)  
 
==Sources of Soluble &amp; Insoluble Fiber== 

Soluble Fiber: Oatmeal, oatbran; Nuts and seeds; Legumes; Beans; Dried peas; Lentils; Apples; Pears; Strawberries; Blueberries 
 
Insoluble Fiber: Whole wheat bread; Barley; Couscous; Brown rice; Bulgur; Whole grain breakfast cereals; Wheat bran; Seeds; Carrots; Cucumbers; Zucchini; Celery; Tomatoes 
 
The Harvard studies of male health professionals and female nurses both found that a diet high in cereal fiber was linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Other studies, such as the Black Women's Health Study (8) and the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam, have found similar results. 

When it comes to factors that increase the risk of developing diabetes, a diet low in cereal fiber and rich in high-glycemic-index foods (which cause big spikes in blood sugar) seems particularly bad. Both Harvard studies—of nurses and of male health professionals—found that this sort of diet more than doubled the risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to a diet high in cereal fiber and low in high-glycemic-index foods. (9-11)

A recent meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21 percent less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week. (12) Another meta-analysis of several large studies, including more than 700,000 men and women, found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21 percent. (13) So to protect against heart disease and diabetes, perhaps the best advice is to choose whole grain, high-fiber foods at most meals.

==Fiber and water intake==
 
The fiber in wheat bran and oat bran seems to be more effective than similar amounts of fiber from fruits and vegetables. Experts recommend increasing fiber intake gradually rather than suddenly. As fiber intake is increased, the intake of beverages should also be increased, since fiber absorbs water.  

==Recommendations for Fiber==
Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet, and you should get a least 20 grams a day, more is better. The best sources are whole grain foods, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts.  Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices. Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole grain products. Choose whole grain cereals for breakfast. Snack on raw vegetables instead of chips, crackers, or chocolate bars. Substitute legumes for meat two to three times per week in chili and soups.

==dietary fiber and diabetes==
A high dietary fiver intake is recommended by most diabetes and nutritional associations. &quot;It is accepted that viscous and gel-forming properties of soluble DF inhibit macronutrient absorption, reduce postprandial glucose response, and beneficially influence certain blood lipids. Colonic fermentation of naturally available high fiber foods can also be mainly attributed to soluble DF, whereas no difference between soluble and insoluble DF consumption on the regulation of body weight has been observed. However, in prospective cohort studies, it is primarily insoluble cereal DF and whole grains, and not soluble DF, that is consistently associated with reduced diabetes risk, suggesting that further, unknown mechanisms are likely to be involved. Recent research indicates that DF consumption contributes to a number of unexpected metabolic effects independent from changes in body weight, which include improvement of insulin sensitivity, modulation of the secretion of certain gut hormones, and effects on various metabolic and inflammatory markers that are associated with the metabolic syndrome.

==Health benefits and practical aspects of high-fiber diets==
Over the past 20 years dietary fiber has emerged as a leading dietary factor in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. High fiber intakes are associated with lower serum cholesterol concentrations, lower risk of coronary heart disease, reduced blood pressure, enhanced weight control, better glycemic control, reduced risk of certain forms of cancer, and improved gastrointestinal function. Dietary fiber can be categorized into water-soluble and water-insoluble components. Dried beans, oat products, and certain fruits and vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber. Most plant foods are good sources of insoluble fiber and wheat bran is a concentrated form of insoluble fiber. Current guidelines advise a doubling of dietary fiber intake for Americans. Inclusion of ample servings of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and dried beans and peas will help individuals meet these guidelines.

Insoluble fiber binds water, making stools softer and bulkier. Therefore, fiber, especially that found in whole grain products, is helpful in the treatment and prevention of constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. Diverticula are pouches of the intestinal wall that can become inflamed and painful. In the past, a low-fiber diet was prescribed for this condition. It is now known that a high-fiber diet gives better results once the inflammation has subsided.
Low blood cholesterol levels (below 200 mg/dl.) have been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. The body eliminates cholesterol through the excretion of bile acids. Water-soluble fiber binds bile acids, suggesting that a high-fiber diet may result in an increased excretion of cholesterol. Some types of fiber, however, appear to have a greater effect than others. The fiber found in rolled oats is more effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels than the fiber found in wheat. Pectin has a similar effect in that it, too, can lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood.Other claims for fiber are less well founded. Dietary fiber may help reduce the risk of some cancers, especially colon cancer. This idea is based on information that insoluble fiber increases the rate at which wastes are removed from the body. This means the body may have less exposure to toxic substances produced during digestion. However, more recent studies have not confirmed the protective effects of fiber in developing colon cancer. A diet high in animal fat and protein also may play a role in the development of colon cancer.

High-fiber diets may be useful for people who wish to lose weight. Fiber itself has no calories, yet provides a &quot;full&quot; feeling because of its water-absorbing ability. For example, an apple is more filling than a half cup of apple juice that contains about the same calories. Foods high in fiber often require more chewing, so a person is unable to eat a large number of calories in a short amount of time.

==Foods high in dietary fiber==
Soluble: beans, oat bran, fruits, and vegetables.
Insoluble: whole grains, vegetables and beans.

Dietary fiber is found only in plant foods: fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains. Meat, milk and eggs do not contain fiber. The form of food may or may not affect its fiber content. Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables contain just as much fiber as raw ones. Other types of processing, though, may reduce fiber content. Drying and crushing, for example, destroy the water-holding qualities of fiber.

The removal of seeds, peels or hulls also reduces fiber content. Whole tomatoes have more fiber than peeled tomatoes, which have more than tomato juice. Likewise, whole wheat bread contains more fiber than white bread. Table 2 lists the dietary fiber content of some common foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I saw your comment over at [[Talk:Number Theory/Pythagorean Triples]] and your correct, though we have very few active editors working on mathematics at the moment.  So I wanted to encourage you to try your own hand at it and I could try to help you out.  As a side note, I noticed on your talk page that your equation is a little bit off.  Your just mixing html math and Latex math.
You could do &lt;nowiki&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&amp;pi;&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1&lt;/nowiki&gt; to get ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&amp;pi;&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.  Or you could do &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}=-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}=-1&lt;/math&gt;... or my personal favorite
&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}+1=0\,&lt;/math&gt; which involves the 5 most important numbers in mathematics. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:45, 28 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* False position */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The methods in this section are for solving numerically equations of the form  ''f''(x) = 0  that cannot be solved analytically, or are too difficult to solve analytically. 

==Change of sign methods==
===Introduction===
If we have a continuous function ''f''(''x''), and two ''x'' values ''a'' and ''b'', then provided ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') have opposite signs, we know that the interval [''a'', ''b''] contains a root of the equation ''f''(''x'') = 0 (somewhere between ''a'' and ''b'' must be a value where ''f''(''x'') = 0).

Graphically, if the curve y = ''f''(''x'') is above the ''x''-axis at one point and below it at another, it must have crossed the ''x''-axis somewhere in between. Therefore, a root of ''f''(''x'') = 0 lies somewhere in between the two points. 

Change of sign methods use this information to progressively shrink an interval containing a change of sign, in order to find a root. 

Note that: 
* The function must be continuous within the interval for the above to hold true
* There may be more than one root in the interval. For example, ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-''x'', solving ''f''(''x'')=0 . The interval [-2, 2] has a change of sign and contains three roots: x=-1,x=0,x=1
* Repeated roots do not cause a change of sign. For example, solving ''f''(''x'')=0 where ''f''(''x'')=(''x'' -1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . ''f''(''x'') will evaluate as positive at the endpoints of any interval, yet there is a repeated root at ''x''=1.

===Bisection===
Bisection is a change of sign method. It requires an initial interval containing a change of sign. On each step (called an '''iteration'''), the bisection method involves doing the following:
# Bisect (divide into 2 equal parts) an interval in which a root is known to lie, hence giving two new intervals.
# Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the two new intervals.
# A change of sign indicates (provided the function is continuous) that there is a root in that interval. Hence deduce that a root lies in the interval which has a change of sign of the evaluation of the function between its endpoints.
# Take the interval containing a root as your new starting interval in the next iteration.


Given an interval [''a'', ''b''], let ''x'' be the new estimate of the root. 

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a+b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The function is then evaluated at ''a'', ''b'' and ''x'', and the interval containing a sign change - either [''a'', ''x''] or [''x'', ''b''] - is selected as the new interval. 

[graph, example]

====Advantages====
* Bisection always converges - it will always find a root in the given starting interval.
* It carries a definite statement of the bounds in which the result must lie. Numerical work is of much more value if you know how accurate the answer you obtain is.
* It has a fixed rate of convergence - the interval halves in size on each iteration. Under certain conditions, other methods may converge more slowly.

====Disadvantages====
* It requires a starting interval containing a change of sign. Therefore it cannot find repeated roots. 
* It has a fixed rate of convergence, which can be much slower than other methods, requiring more iterations to find the root to a given degree of precision. 


===False position===
False position expands on bisection by using information about the value of the function at the endpoints to make a more intelligent estimate of the root. If the value of ''f''(''x'') at one endpoint is closer to zero than at the other endpoint, then you would expect the root to lie closer to that endpoint. In many cases, this will lead to faster convergence on the root than bisection, which always estimates that the root is directly in the middle of the interval. 

The procedure is nearly exactly the same as bisection. However, given an interval [''a'',''b''], the new estimate of the root, ''x'', is instead:

&lt;math&gt; x = \frac {af(b) - bf(a)} {f(b) - f(a)} &lt;/math&gt;


This can be seen as just a weighted average of ''a'' and ''b'', with the weightings being the value of ''f''(''x'') at the other endpoint. This is because we want the endpoint with a smaller ''f''(''x'') to have a larger weight, so that the estimate is closer to it. We therefore use the larger value of ''f''(''x'') as the weighting for the endpoint which produces a smaller ''f''(''x'').

The false position method is equivalent to constructing a line through the points on the curve at ''x''=''a'' and ''x''=''b'', and using the intersection of this line with the ''x''-axis as the new estimate. 

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

([[w:False_position_method]])

==Other methods==

===Iterative method notation===
''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' means the value of ''x'' after ''r'' iterations. For example, the initial estimate of the root would be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the estimate obtained by performing one iteration of the method on this would be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. 

We write down iterative methods in the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; (the next estimate of the root) in terms of ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the current estimate of the root). For example, the fixed point iteration method is:

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = g(x_r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If the new estimate is calculated from the previous two estimates, as in the case of the secant method, the new estimate of the root will be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, written in terms of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Secant===
This is similar in some ways to the false position method. It uses the co-ordinates of the previous two points on the curve to approximate the curve by a straight line. Like the false position method, it uses the place where this line crosses the axis as the new estimate of the root.

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+2} = \frac { x_rf(x_{r+1}) - x_{r+1}f(x_r) } { f(x_{r+1}) - f(x_r) } &lt;/math&gt;

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

===Newton-Raphson===
The Newton-Raphson method is based on obtaining a new estimate of the root on each iteration by approximating ''f'' by its tangent and finding where this tangent crosses the ''x''-axis.

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = x_r - \frac{f(x_r)}{f'(x_r)} &lt;/math&gt;

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

===Fixed point iteration===
In this method, the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is rearranged into the form ''x'' = g(''x''). We then take an initial estimate of ''x'' as the starting value, and calculate a new estimate using g(''x'').

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = g(x_r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If this method converges, then provided g is continuous it will converge to a '''fixed point''' of ''g'' (where the input is the same as the output, giving ''x'' = ''g''(''x'') ). This value of ''x'' will also satisfy ''f''(''x'') = 0, hence giving a root of the equation. 

Fixed point iteration will not always converge. There are infinitely many rearrangements of ''f''(''x'') = 0 into ''x'' = ''g''(''x''). Some rearrangements will only converge given a starting value very close to the root, and some will not converge at all. In all cases, it is the gradient of ''g'' that influences whether convergence occurs. Convergence will occur (given a suitable starting value), if when near the root: 

&lt;math&gt; -1 &lt; g'(x) &lt; 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''g''&amp;#039; is the gradient of ''g''. Convergence will be fastest when ''g''&amp;#039;(''x'') is close to 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Historical Issues: Vienna, Austria ==


In Linz, Austria the oldest tradition of &quot;Torte&quot; or cake can be traced to a black currant latice work detailed creation in the year 1696.  The &quot;Linzertorte&quot; as it is known today is still produced using much of the original recipe and 80,000 tortes are produced each year for Austrians and people all over the world.  A history of fine torte production has followed over the years in Austria and this art form has become an intertwined aspect of Viennese culture.

In 1832 in Vienna, a talented sixteen year old apprentice chef named Franz Sacher created a very special chocolate cake.  The legendary story began when Prince Metternich requested a mememorable creation be prepared for some important visitors; that day the head chef was home sick and the order became the young Sacher's first culinary test and proved to be his enduring legacy.  The Original Sacher Torte was created and established a long line of rivals and imitators that can still be found to this day in many of Vienna's finest ''kaffeehauser''(coffee houses).

It is important to realize Vienna's claim of being the &quot;coffee house capital of the world&quot;.  A strong tradition of coffee houses created an environment where people both local and visitors could meet, share ideas, and leisurely discuss the events of the day.  The coffee houses status in Vienna would become central to its culture and tradition with the cornerstone of each fine coffee house being its freshly baked cakes.  The analogy of Vienna's coffee house and fine cakes would be similar to the tradition of baseball and apple pie in the USA.

These classic tortes overtime became highly regarded works of art and intense rivalries developed as to who could create the finest work of art.  Today, the Original [[Sacher Torte]] is one of the most recognized cakes in the world and even helped establish the five star Hotel Sacher Wein founded in 1876 by Franz Sacher's son, Eduard Sacher.  The Original Sacher Torte is still made almost entirely by hand using Franz Sacher's recipe and is a closely guarded secret.  More than 360,000 cakes a year are made in Vienna by its 41 employees, many of which are shipped all over the world allowing a &quot;taste of Vienna&quot; to be delivered to many far away places.  The most popular destinations for its cakes are Germany, Italy, France, The USA, and many countries in Asia.  The Original Sacher Torte is a combination of two layers of soft and light chocolate cake separated by apricot jam and coated with a chocolate icing, often accompanied with unsweetened whipped cream.

The tradition of Grand Hotels having their own signature cake continued with the creation of the &quot;Imperial Torte&quot; to celebrate the opening of the Hotel Imperial during the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna.  The cake was designed to impress the Emperor Francis Joseph I and the square shaped chocolate torte is still produced today.  Other Vienesse classic cakes include a Sacher Torte made by Demel confectionery which up until the early 1960's had fought a legal battle over the name rights of the cake.  The &quot;Esterhazy Torte&quot; can trace its legacy back to the days of the ruling Hungarian family of the same name and is still produced in many of Vienna's coffee houses.

The issue of the &quot;torte wars&quot; and the competition to create a memorable cake is significant when you consider how coffee houses and their cakes have become an integral part of Viennese culture.  When the question is asked, how much of this culture has shaped the world?  Consider how many coffee houses (although somewhat less refined) are there in the US today.  It would be difficult to walk more than a few blocks in most major US cities without walking past some type of American style coffee house selling freshly baked goods with gourmet coffee.  Bookstore/coffee houses often provide the same type of environment, a place to relax, meet friends or family, and talk about important issues in peoples lives.  Many Americans officially start their day with a visit to the local coffee house and the number of new franchises being established shows the trend in America has embraced part of this export of Viennese culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Apfelmus' outline: Calculating with Truth ==

Numbers are not the only thing we can calculate with. In the following, we are going to calculate with ''truth'' (also called ''boolean'') values.

* Introduction to Types, &lt;code&gt;2 == False&lt;/code&gt; is ill-typed.

* Pattern Matching
* Infix operators?

  True  || x = True
  False || y = y

* Defining more functions: Guards

 abs x
     | x &lt;= 0    = 0 - x
     | otherwise = x

=== Duplode's comment ===

In my attempt to write this page I took some liberties with Apfelmus' outline. One particularly important change was the omission of definitions for &lt;tt&gt;(||)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(&amp;&amp;)&lt;/tt&gt;. I feel that introducing pattern matching on the top of all the other things discussed on this very early module might not work as well as we would like. Furthermore, it won't be intuitive to a newbie that pattern matching with pseudo-literal values like &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; is the same thing as pattern matching with, say, &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;tt&gt;; so it may be better to defer this explanation a little. One possible place for that would be the discussion on piece-wise definitions, if it is going to remain within Basics (I assume we will need to do so, since it is a prerequisite for Recursion at the very least). And finally, comments, criticism and bold rearrangements are always welcome :) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 07:46, 29 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Intermediate Accounting''' is a course of study in financial accounting.  In traditional universities it is often a two-semester course required of students majoring in accounting.  While the title could be applied to managerial accounting, the title in use is most commonly applied to the courses and textbooks in the financial accounting area, and financial accounting is the topic of this wikibook.

The scope of the course is broad:  to cover, in considerable detail, the accounting concepts, policies, and practices involving most types of accounting assets, liabilities, and equities.  The purpose is to describe options in prevailing practice and to give adequate preparation to accountants for treatment of most usual cases.  There will be specialized topics that are not covered.  Practices that are not Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP) are not the focus of this work, but may be covered in order to illustrate basic ideas.  Some other practices have become discredited and are no longer GAAP, and some other practices are arguably better treatments than current GAAP.

Prerequisites are:
*a basic understanding of financial accounting concepts, including debits and credits.  Perhaps helpful is this [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Financial_Accounting Financial Accounting introductory course at Wikiversity]

==Note on Writing and Sources==
The material in this textbook is meant to be written entirely from scratch, and not to copy wording or general form from any source, except where quotes explicitly noted by quotation marks and corresponding footnote references are to be provided.  Where material is quoted from another source, only short quotes consistent with copyright restrictions are to be included.

For a textbook, less specific attribution of material is ethically or legally required than for writing that purports to be original and to make new research contributions.  This is a textbook and is meant to be non-original, and kept simple, although we also hope to provide really good explanations of material.  Excessive footnoting would get in the way of learning, and the material is generally standard.  Experienced teachers of accounting who have perspective about multiple textbook approaches can usually present material in their own words, and also can understand when, in one source, original ideas or idiosyncratic language is being used which would require specific attribution, if mentioned here.  Current students may not have the same perspective to know when they're restating original ideas or wording that should be attributed.  Please take care, and give explicit attribution when in doubt.  This is a collective work.  Please note that it is easy for later editors to reword materials and remove footnotes where credit is not really due.  But it is hard for others, later, to identify the actual specific source for a given original phrasing or idea.  So again, please be conservative and note specific sources when in doubt.

In broad terms, the source for material in this textbook is the corpus of material taught by many teachers and many textbooks, and which comprise the usual content of Intermediate Accounting courses taught in the United States.  More specifically, the following textbooks have been consulted and serve as general background sources:
*''Intermediate Accounting'', by Spiceland, Sepe, Nelson, and Tomassini, published by McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 5th edition, (c) 2009 (abbreviated as SSNT-2009 herein), and/or earlier or later editions
*''Intermediate Accounting'', by Kieso, Weygandt, and Warfield, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 13th edition, (c) 2010 (abbreviated as KWW-2009 herein), and/or earlier editions.

==Introduction on liabilities==
Liabilities are obligations.  For U.S. GAAP accounting, liabilities are broadly defined as being 
#probable future sacrifices of economic benefits
#that arise from present obligations
#that result from past transactions

Note while most liabilities involve known amounts of obligations to be paid in cash on specific dates, the definition is open to many other obligations where amounts and timing are not certain.

===Current vs. long-term liabilities===
Current liabilities are often loosely defined as liabilities that must be paid within one year.  For firms having [[w:operating cycles]] longer than one year, current liabilities are defined as those which must be paid during that longer period.  The more correct definition, however, is that current liabilities are liabilities that will by settled by current assets or by the creation of other current liabilities.

Typical short term liabilities include accounts payable, short-term notes payable, commercial paper, and trade notes payable.

For example, consider what happens in the last year of a long term note, when the full face amount of the bond will become payable.  Technically, it would appear the full amount due within one year is a current liability.  However, if a new note is in process, and various terms are met, it is allowable to classify the full value as being a long term note.  It will be replaced by a new long term note.  If the full amount will be fully paid off by cash or by creating new short-term liabilities such as a new short-term note, then the full amount is to be recorded as a current liability.

Other long-term term obligations that can be classified as current are those that are callable by the creditor. When a debt becomes callable in the upcoming year (or operating cycle, if longer), the debt is required to be classified as current, even if it is not expected to be called. Debt should also be classified as current if the creditor has the right to demand payment because of an existing violation of a provision of a debt agreement. Situations in which debt is not yet callable but will be callable within the year if a violation is not corrected within a specified grace period are current, unless it's probable that the violation will be collected or waived.

The classification of liabilities as either current or long-term is important because it helps investors and creditors assess the relative risk of a business's liabilities.

== Refinancing Short-Term Liabilities ==
The purpose of refinancing short term liabilities is to remove the expectation of using working capital during the ensuing fiscal year. This improves important financial ratios, such as the current ratio, making the organization more financially appealing.

Current Ratio - Current Assets/Current Liabilties

'''Conditions for Long-Term Refinancing'''

Certain conditions must be met for an organization to refinance on a long-term basis. According to FASB codification 470-10-45-14 and SFAS No. 6 (under the old system), a short-term liability can be excluded from current liabilities if:

(i) The entity intends to refinance the obligation on a long term basis.

and(ii)The intent to refinance the short-term obligation on a long-term basis is supported by an
ability to consummate the refinancing.


'''When Short-Term Liabilities intended for Refinancing are Repaid Early '''

Often an entity expresses intent to refinance short-term liabilities with long-term debt, but it ends up repaying the obligation before the issuance of the long-term debt. According to FASB codification 470-10-45-15 or SFAS No. 6, the short-term liability remains current, even if the funds used to repay are replenished by the long-term debt.

== Questions ==

     1. Which of the following liabilities should not be classified as current?
           a. accounts payable
           b. short-term notes payable
           c. short-term commercial paper that is expected to be refinanced with a long-term bond
           d. long-term debt that is callable within a year


     2. True/False: A long-term note payable that has become callable within a year increases the current ratio.

        Book Bonanza is a publishing company with the following financial obligations:
           -Accounts payable of $50,000
           -Long-term notes payable of $100,000 in which half of them become callable within the year
           -A long-term loan of $200,000 in which Book Bonanza is in violation of a debt agreement provision
            It is probable that it will be corrected within the grace period
           -$25,000 of short-term commercial paper that will be refinanced with a long-term loan 

     3. Calculate the total current liabilities

     4. Calculate the total non-current liabilities

     5. Pizza fountain has $50,000 in short-term commercial paper that is intends to refinance with a long term 
        loan of $300,000 in Dec. 2009. Pizza Fountain repaid half of commercial paper with excess cash in Oct.
        2009. $25,000 of the loan replenished working capital, $25,000 was used to repay the commercial paper,
        and $250,000 was used to purchase equipment. Calculate total current and non-current liabilities 
        related to these transactions.


'''Answers'''

     1. c
     2. false
     3. $100,000
     4. $275,000
     5. current- $25,000 non-current- $275,000

==Promissory notes==
===Credit Lines===
Short-term loans offered by a bank based by a prearranged line of credit.  Compensating balances are sometimes required to be on deposit with the lending bank and is usually calculated as a percentage of the line of credit.

==Bonds payable==
Accounting for bonds involves recording, at issue, both the nominal or face value of bonds issued, and also the amount of cash proceeds actually yielded by their sale.  The difference between these is recorded as a premium on bonds (when bond proceeds are higher than face value of bonds) or as a discount on bonds (when proceeds are lower than face value).  The difference arises because the bonds can only be sold for what investors are willing to pay.  Only rarely will the effective interest rate equal the stated interest rate (and then there will be no premium or discount).  When investors pay less than the face value of bonds, they are effectively demanding an &quot;effective interest rate&quot; that is higher than the stated interest rate.  When they pay more than face value, they are accepting an effective interest rate lower than the stated rate.

In subsequent periods, over the term of the bond, the premium or discount is &quot;amortized&quot; down towards zero.  The main principle applied is that interest expense is recorded in each period as the product of the book value of the bond times the effective interest rate.

===Amortization table===
An amortization table is useful to prepare upfront, and can be entirely determined using the terms of the bond contract and the purchase price of the bond (or equivalently in the proceeds yielded from its sale).  The nominal interest rate is stated in the bond contract;  the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return that is implicit in the cash flows (upfront yield of bond proceeds, vs. future nominal interest payments and payment of the face value of the bond at maturity).  The internal rate of return can be found by trial and error, or it can easily be calculated in software such as Excel spreadsheet software's Internal Rate of Return formula.

For a 2,000,000 face value 10 year bond with 10% annual interest, with interest paid semiannually, sold at a premium, yielding $2,080,000, the amortization table is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
              Cash           Effective        Amortization of       Balance
              payments       interest         premium               outstanding
  Period                                                           (or carrying value)
    0
    1
    2
    3    
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Straightline variation===
When the results will not be materially different, it is allowable to use a straight-line approach to amortize the premium or discount, and accordingly to set what is the interest expense that is recorded.  The accounting principle involved is that of [[w:Materiality (auditing)|materiality]].

The corresponding amortization table for the same bond, but now using 
&lt;pre&gt;
              Cash           Effective        Amortization of       Balance
              payments       interest         premium               outstanding
  Period                                                           (or carrying value)
    0                                                               2,080,000
    1          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,076,000
    2          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,072,000
    3          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,068,000

   ...           ...           ...              ...                    ...

   20          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,000,000
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: where effective interest rate is more different from stated interest rate (or, equivalently, where bond proceeds are significantly different from face value of the bond), the effective interest rate method provides a materially better analysis.

===Debt issue costs===
A small complication is needed to treat the various administrative costs of a bond issuance, which reduce its overall yield of proceeds for the firm.  For exammple, consider a bond issue where $60,000 of printing, legal, and other administrative costs are incurred, where the face value is $10,000,000 bond, and total proceeds collected are $10,020,000.

Under U.S. GAAP accounting, oddly, the debt issue costs of $40,000 are recorded as an asset.  The overall cash proceeds received is not reported as that, but rather the cash collected less the debt issue cost is reported as increasing the firm's cash account.

&lt;pre&gt;
   Debt issue costs         $60,000
   Cash                  $9,960,000
      Bond payable                    $10,000,000
      Premium on bond                      20,000
&lt;/pre&gt;

In future periods, the debt issue cost is expensed off over the period of the bond.  For example, with straigthline amortization over 10 years, each year would show:
&lt;pre&gt;
   Debt issue expense         $6,000
      Debt issue cost                     $6,000

   Interest expense         $x-2,000
      Premium on bond         $2,000
      Interest payable                        $x
&lt;/pre&gt;

Under IFRS accounting, the accounting is done more naturally.  However, if the same straightline methods are used, the totals expensed each year are the same.

==Accounts payable==
Most purchases made for services or supplies are made on open accounts.  The obligations that arise from these purchases are known as accounts payable.  Purchases made on open account generally have a short-term payment period, are non-interest bearing, and are reported at face-value (time value of money is ignored).  Unlike most other payables, the only formal agreement between companies related to purchases on account is the purchase invoice.

==Trade Notes Payable==
Trade notes issued for merchandise purchases that are not made on open account.  Unlike accounts payable, trade notes are characterized by longer terms and written promissory notes.

==Unearned revenue==
Just draw a t-account and figure this shit out

==Advance collections==

===Refundable Deposits===
When deposits are collected in advance from customers and expected to be returned at a future date, a liability for the deposit must be created.  A debit is made to cash, with a credit to the corresponding liability account.  When the deposit is returned, the entry is reversed.  If any part of the deposit is forfeited, the forfeited amount is credited to revenue.  If the deposit was made on, for example, a piece of equipment that was rented and not returned, along with the credit to revenue upon forfeiture, a second entry would be made to account for the decrease in inventory and cost of goods sold. 

Self-Study Question: 
Happy Productions, Inc. rents chairs to the public for parties and special events.  Upon rental, they require a $10 deposit per chair, which is twice of Happy Production’s cost to purchase the chairs.  Deposits are forfeited if the chairs are not returned at the end of the rental period.  A recent customer rented 50 chairs, but only returned 90% of the chairs at the end of the rental period.  What is the amount of revenue that Happy would recognize at the end of the rental agreement?  What would be the amount of Happy’s reduction to inventory?
Answer: 
Revenue-$50
Inventory-$25

===Advances from customers===
Advances are payments from customers before goods are delivered or services rendered, for example magazine subscriptions.  The funds collected in advance will be applied to the purchase price, and are considered liabilities until the earnings process is complete.

==Taxes==
:''For expanded treatment, see [[Intermediate Accounting/Accounting for Income Taxes]]''
In many countries, accounting for tax purposes is the same as accounting for financial reporting.  However, the purposes of tax laws often diverge from the purposes of GAAP financial reporting.  For example, a tax law may allow for accelerated depreciation of new capital equipment, which makes firms' new purchases less expensive in real terms.  This is one way to implement a nation's economic policy of promoting new investment and perhaps full employment.  Extremely accelerated depreciation goes against the matching principle in accounting, however.  By the matching principle, the costs of use of the equipment should be matched to the time periods in which the benefits of use are enjoyed.

In the United States, specifically, accounting for income taxes is complicated by differences between GAAP accounting for financial reporting versus tax accounting for U.S. IRS tax forms.  

===Permanent differences===
There are &quot;permanent differences&quot; which are relatively easy to account for.  For example, a firm may invest in a tax-free municipal bond, and its total GAAP earnings would reflect interest income that is deductible from the firm's taxable income reported on its tax returns.  If the firm's GAAP tax expense is computed simplistically as the firm's GAAP earnings times its marginal income rate, that would yield an incorrect, higher value for its tax expense.  The firm's actual income tax rate is lower.

===Temporary differences===
The temporary differences are more complicated to account for.  They give rise to &quot;deferred tax liabilities&quot; and &quot;deferred tax assets&quot;.  These are accounts needed to track the timing differences between recognition of expenses and revenues for GAAP books vs. for tax books, for events that have already occured.  Most firms of any size have multiple&quot; specific differences which need to be tracked.  There are four general types:

1.) &quot;GAAP-first revenues&quot; is a shorthand term (coined here, not a widely used term) which describes cases where firms' GAAP accounting recognizes revenues before those revenues appear in taxable income.  Installment sales is a prime example.  Under GAAP accounting, the revenue associated with a sale of land or property is recorded when a firm contract is reached and the new owner takes possession of the property.  So all the earnings related to a sale of land that will be paid for by installments over several years, may be recognized at the time of sale.  But by U.S. IRS tax accounting, the revenue is not recognized until it is collected.

2.) &quot;Tax return-first revenues&quot; is a shorthand term (coined here) for cases where firms' taxable income shows revenues that are not yet recognized in GAAP accounting.  The IRS counts as taxable income the advance collections of rent and other advance collections.  Under GAAP accounting those collections are recorded first as unearned revenues, which are only recognized as revenues when the service or product are delivered.

3.) &quot;GAAP-first expenses&quot; include estimated expenses, such as bad debt expense which is recognized along with setting up a general allowance for bad debts (a.k.a. an allowance for uncollectible receivables).  Tax accounting does not recognize bad debts until the specific customer accounts are written off.

4.) &quot;Tax return-first expenses&quot; include MACRS accelerated depreciation.


===Categorization as short- vs. long-term liabilities===
On the GAAP balance sheet, balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities conceivably could be reported in four places: under Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Long-term Assets, and Long-term Liabilities.  GAAP allows, however, for short-term DTA to be offset by short-term DTL, and the same for longterm DTA and DTL, so the balance sheet in fact shows just one DTA or DTL in the current section, reported at net, and shows similarly just one net position in the long-term section.

==Pensions==

There are two types of pension plans, the defined contribution plan and the defined benefit plan. 

===defined contribution pension plan===

The defined contribution pension plan promises fixed annual contributions to a pension fund by the employer. The employee chooses where funds are invested. The retirement benefit is determined by the amount accumulated in the pension account upon retirement (Spiceland).

===defined benefit pension plan===

The defined benefit pension plan promises fixed retirement benefits “defined” by a pension formula. The pension is normally based on the employees’ years of service and annual compensation. The employer is responsible for paying promised benefits (Spiceland).

==Contingent liabilities==
Provisions for court decisions

'''To learn about contingent liabilities we will first explore disclosure notes found on recent 10K filings from three well known corporations. We will then learn the Accounting Standards Codification and SFAS references regarding contingent liabilities. Next, we will learn why the corporations recorded their contingencies as they did as it relates to the Accounting Standards Codification. Finally, we will further explore contingent liabilities by working through some various problems. Various references are used from an Intermediate Accounting Textbook (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.)'''

'''1. Verizon Communications Inc; December 31, 2009; Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies''' 
		“Several state and federal regulatory proceedings may require our telephone operations to pay penalties or to refund to customers a portion of the revenues collected in the current and prior periods. There are also various legal actions pending to which we are a party and claims which, if asserted, may lead to other legal actions. We have established reserves for specific liabilities in connection with regulatory and legal actions, including environmental matters that we currently deem to be probable and estimable. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory and legal matters in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below, will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.”

“During 2003, under a government-approved plan, remediation commenced at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, New York that processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. Remediation beyond original expectations proved to be necessary and a reassessment of the anticipated remediation costs was conducted. A reassessment of costs related to remediation efforts at several other former facilities was also undertaken. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the Hicksville site into the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. This may result in the ACE performing some or all of the remediation effort for the Hicksville site with a corresponding decrease in costs to Verizon. To the extent that the ACE assumes responsibility for remedial work at the Hicksville site, an adjustment to a reserve previously established for the remediation may be made. Adjustments to the reserve may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at this or any other site requiring remediation.”

		The above contingencies are related to litigation claims against Verizon Communications. The first two sentences, “Several state and federal regulatory proceedings may require our telephone operations to pay penalties or to refund to customers a portion of the revenues collected in the current and prior periods,” are related to claims the organizations in this industry find throughout their course of business. The second portion of this contingency relates to various legal actions pending. These items are not accrued because these are either litigation claims or the likelihood is not probable and the amount cannot reasonably be estimated. From chapter 13 (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.), “A loss contingency is accrued only if a loss is probable and the amount can reasonably be estimated.” Later in chapter 13 we learn, “the majority of medium and large corporations annually report loss contingencies due to litigation. In practice, accrual of a loss from pending or ongoing litigation is rare.” With this in mind, we know that the events stated in the contingency notes form Verizon should not be accrued and listed only as a disclosure note. 

'''2. Dell Inc; January 29, 2010; Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies'''

Legal Matters — Dell is involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including matters involving consumer, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and other issues on a global basis. While Dell does not expect that the ultimate outcomes in these proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the results and timing of the ultimate resolutions of these various proceedings are inherently unpredictable. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material effect on Dell’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, will depend on a number of variables, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages or other remedies or consequences. Dell accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Dell reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and Dell’s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in Dell’s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. 
The following is a discussion of Dell’s significant on-going legal matters and other proceedings: Investigations and Related Litigation — In August 2005, the SEC initiated an inquiry into certain of Dell’s accounting and financial reporting matters and requested that Dell provide certain documents. The SEC expanded that inquiry in June 2006 and entered a formal order of investigation in October 2006. In August 2006, because of potential issues identified in the course of responding to the SEC’s requests for information, Dell’s Audit Committee, on the recommendation of management and in consultation with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Dell’s independent registered public accounting firm, initiated an independent investigation, which was completed in the third quarter of Fiscal 2008. Although the Audit Committee investigation has been completed, the SEC investigation is ongoing. Dell continues to cooperate with the SEC investigation. Dell and the SEC staff have had preliminary discussions about a potential settlement of the matter. Thus far, an agreement has not been reached. Dell believes that any resolution would likely include monetary penalties, which cannot be quantified at this time, and other relief within the SEC’s authority. Discussions with the SEC staff are ongoing, and no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, including the terms and conditions of any settlement. Dell and several of its current and former directors and officers were named as parties to the following outstanding securities and shareholder derivative lawsuits all arising out of the same events and facts. 
		
— Four putative securities class actions filed between September 13, 2006, and January 31, 2007, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, against Dell and certain of its current and former officers were consolidated as In re Dell Securities Litigation, and a lead plaintiff was appointed by the court. The lead plaintiff asserted claims under sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on alleged false and misleading disclosures or omissions regarding Dell’s financial statements, governmental investigations, internal controls, known battery problems and business model, and based on insiders’ sales of Dell securities. This action also included Dell’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as a defendant. On October 6, 2008, the court dismissed all of the plaintiff’s claims with prejudice and without leave to amend. On November 3, 2008, the plaintiff appealed the dismissal of Dell and the officer defendants to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was fully briefed, and oral argument on the appeal was heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 1, 2009. On November 20, 2009, the parties to the appeal entered into a written settlement agreement whereby Dell would pay $40 million to the proposed class and the plaintiff would dismiss the pending litigation. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the district court on December 21, 2009. The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including opt-outs from the proposed class not exceeding a specified percentage and final approval by the district court. Until these conditions to the settlement have been satisfied, there can be no assurance that the settlement will become final. If the settlement does not become final, Dell will continue its defense of the appeal before the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, as of January 29, 2010, Dell has not accrued a liability for these class actions. 
 		
—In addition, seven shareholder derivative lawsuits filed between September 29, 2006, and January 22, 2007, in three separate jurisdictions were consolidated as In re Dell Derivative Litigation into three actions. One of those consolidated actions was pending in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, but was dismissed without prejudice by an order filed October 9, 2007. The second consolidated shareholder derivative action was pending in Delaware Chancery Court. On October 16, 2008, the Delaware court granted the parties’ stipulation to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ claims in the Delaware lawsuit without prejudice. The third consolidated shareholder derivative action was pending in state district court in Williamson County, Texas. These shareholder derivative lawsuits named various current and former officers and directors as defendants and Dell as a nominal defendant and asserted various claims derivatively on behalf of Dell under state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties. On September 11, 2009, Dell entered into an agreement to settle the derivative suit pending in state district court in Williamson County, Texas, and the previously reported shareholder demand letter dated November 12, 2008, asserting allegations similar to those made in these lawsuits. The settlement received final approval by the court on December 15, 2009. The settlement required Dell to initiate and maintain certain corporate governance changes and provided for the payment of approximately $1.75 million in fees to the plaintiffs’ counsel. 

Ironically, on July 22, 2010 this information came from Washington, D.C.:(http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-131.htm)
SEC Charges Dell and Senior Executives with Disclosure and Accounting Fraud
Company to Pay $100 Million Penalty, Michael Dell to Pay $4 Million Penalty
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-131
Washington, D.C., July 22, 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Dell Inc. with failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses.

The first paragraph titled, “Legal Matter,” explains the policies Dell employs regarding the various legal matters that it finds throughout the course of their business. As we move further into the disclosure note we find a specific legal matter that Dell is currently involved in. In August of 2005, the SEC initiated a concern regarding some of Dell’s accounting and financial reporting. This matter started an internal investigation between internal Dell auditors and an independent auditing firm. This investigation was completed in 2008. At the time of this disclosure there was still an ongoing SEC investigation and is sitting in the court system pending a final approval for a possible settlement amount to be paid. The second bullet within this case is regarding Dell Derivative Litigation, which was divided into three separate actions. The first two actions were dismissed without prejudice. The third action was settled and approved by the courts. This settlement required Dell to initiate and maintain certain corporate governance changes and pay $1.75 million in fees to the plaintiff’s council. This final action should be accrued because, as Dell put it, “the liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.” 

The initial investigation spurred by the SEC is not accrued because it is not settled and the penalty amount is not known. Also, as discussed in Intermediate Accounting (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.) textbook, if an amount was to be accrued before the case is settled in court, this accrual “would be welcome ammunition for the opposing legal counsel.” 

'''3. Best Buy Co. Inc. February 27, 2010; 13. Contingencies and Commitments'''
Contingencies 
“In December 2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, Jasmen Holloway, et al. v. Best Buy Co., Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. At February 27, 2010, no accrual had been established as it was not possible to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because this matter had not advanced to a stage where we could make any such estimate. A class certification hearing was held in June 2009, and we await the Court's decision. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend this action vigorously. 
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.”
The initial paragraph is explaining a pending class action lawsuit against Best Buy on the basis on employment discrimination. This situation has not been accrued because it is a pending lawsuit; therefore Best Buy cannot determine if it is neither probable nor the amount of money to be paid out. Also, again, pending court matters are not accrued until a court decision has been determined and finalized. 

'''FASB Accounting Standards Codification:'''
	The above examples of contingencies from Verizon, Dell, and Best Buy demonstrate litigation claims. These organizations list the general policies the organization employs to handle these situations and also gives specific information regarding specific cases it is currently dealing with. FASB Accounting Standards Codification provides us with the below guidance when dealing with such contingencies (information below to SFAS No. 5 is from FASB Accounting Standards Codification):

(Code: 450 Contingencies: 20 Loss Contingencies: 25 Recognition) Provides general rules when dealing loss contingencies.
'''General Rule'''
'''25-1'''When a loss contingency exists, the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. As indicated in the definition of contingency, the term loss is used for convenience to include many charges against income that are commonly referred to as expenses and others that are commonly referred to as losses. The Contingencies Topic uses the terms probable, reasonably possible, and remote to identify three areas within that range. 
'''25-2''' An estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met: 
•	a.  Information available before the financial statements are issued or are available to be 
issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25) indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements. Date of the financial statements means the end of the most recent accounting period for which financial statements are being presented. It is implicit in this condition that it must be probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. 
•	b.  The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
The purpose of those conditions is to require accrual of losses when they are reasonably estimable and relate to the current or a prior period. Paragraphs 450-20-55-1 through 55-17 and Examples 1–2 (see paragraphs 450-20-55-18 through 55-35) illustrate the application of the conditions. As discussed in paragraph 450-20-50-5, disclosure is preferable to accrual when a reasonable estimate of loss cannot be made. Further, even losses that are reasonably estimable shall not be accrued if it is not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of an entity's financial statements because those losses relate to a future period rather than the current or a prior period. Attribution of a loss to events or activities of the current or prior periods is an element of asset impairment or liability incurrence.

(Code: 450 Contingencies: 20 Loss contingencies: 55 Implementation Guidance and Illustrations) Deals specifically with litigation and provides an example with the appropriate footnote. 

'''&gt; &gt;Litigation, Claims, and Assessments'''
'''55-10'''The following factors should be considered in determining whether accrual and/or disclosure is required with respect to pending or threatened litigation and actual or possible claims and assessments: 
•	a.  The period in which the underlying cause (that is, the cause for action) of the pending or threatened litigation or of the actual or possible claim or assessment occurred 
•	b.  The degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome 
•	c.  The ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. 
Examples 1 through 2 (see paragraphs 450-20-55-18 through 55-35) illustrate the consideration of these factors in determining whether to accrue or disclose litigation. 

'''55-18''' An entity may be litigating a dispute with another party. In preparation for the trial, it may determine that, based on recent developments involving one aspect of the litigation, it is probable that it will have to pay $2 million to settle the litigation. Another aspect of the litigation may, however, be open to considerable interpretation, and depending on the interpretation by the court the entity may have to pay an additional $8 million over and above the $2 million. 
'''55-19''' In that case, paragraph 450-20-25-2 requires accrual of the $2 million if that is considered a reasonable estimate of the loss. 
'''55-20''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the accrual,and depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the $2 million that was accrued. 
'''55-21''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the additional exposure to loss if there is a reasonable possibility that the additional amounts will be paid. 

'''&gt; &gt; Example 2: Multiple Case Litigation Example'''
'''55-22''' The following Cases illustrate application of the accrual and disclosure requirements in the following stages of litigation: a.  The trial is complete but the damages are undetermined (Case A). 
	    b.  The trial is incomplete but an unfavorable outcome is probable (Case B). 
	    c.  The trial is incomplete and unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible (Case C). 
	    d.  There is a range of loss and one amount is a better estimate than any other (Case D). 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt; Case A: Trial Is Complete but Damages Are Undetermined''' 
'''55-23''' An entity is involved in litigation at the close of its fiscal year and information available indicates that an unfavorable outcome is probable. Subsequently, after a trial on the issues, a verdict unfavorable to the entity is handed down, but the amount of damages remains unresolved at the time the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). Although the entity is unable to estimate the exact amount of loss, its reasonable estimate at the time is that the judgment will be for not less than $3 million or more than $9 million. No amount in that range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount. 
'''55-24''' In this Case, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of the $3 million (the minimum of the range) at the close of the fiscal year. 
'''55-25''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-26''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $6 million. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case B: Trial Is Incomplete but Unfavorable Outcome Is Probable'''
'''55-27''' Assume the same facts as in Case A, except it is probable that a verdict will be unfavorable and the trial has not been completed before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). In that situation, the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) would be met because information available to the entity indicates that an unfavorable verdict is probable. An assessment that the range of loss is between $3 million and $9 million would meet the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(b). 
'''55-28''' In this Case, if no single amount in that range is a better estimate than any other amount, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of $3 million (the minimum of the range) at the close of the fiscal year. 
'''55-29''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-30''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $6 million. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case C: Trial Is Incomplete and Unfavorable Outcome Is Reasonably Possible'''
'''55-31''' Assume the same facts as in Case B, except the entity had assessed the verdict differently (for example, that an unfavorable verdict was not probable but was only reasonably possible). The condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) would not have been met and no amount of loss would be accrued. Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and any amount of loss that is reasonably possible. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case D: Range of Loss and One Amount Is a Better Estimate than Any Other'''
'''55-32''' Assume that in Case A and Case B the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) has been met and a reasonable estimate of loss is a range between $3 million and $9 million but a loss of $4 million is a better estimate than any other amount in that range. 
'''55-33''' In this Case, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of $4 million. 
'''55-34''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-35''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $5 million. 

'''&gt; &gt;Example 3: Illustrative Disclosure'''
'''55-36''' Entity A is the defendant in litigation involving a major competitor claiming patent infringement (Entity B). The suit claims damages of $200 million. Discovery has been completed, and Entity A is engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiff. Entity A has made an offer of $5 million to settle the case, which offer was rejected by the plaintiff; the plaintiff has made an offer of $35 million to settle the case, which offer was rejected by Entity A. Based on the expressed willingness of the plaintiff to settle the case along with information revealed during discovery and the likely cost and risk to both sides of litigating, Entity A believes that it is probable the case will not come to trial. Accordingly, Entity A has determined that it is probable that it has some liability. Entity A's reasonable estimate of this liability is a range between $10 million and $35 million, with no amount within that range a better estimate than any other amount; accordingly, $10 million was accrued. 
'''55-37''' Entity A provides the following disclosure in accordance with Section 450-20-50. 
•On March 15, 19X1, Entity B filed a suit against the company claiming patent infringement. While the company believes it has meritorious defenses against the suit, the ultimate resolution of the matter, which is expected to occur within one year, could result in a loss of up to $25 million in excess of the amount accrued. 

'''SFAS No. 5''' (Found in the text on page 672)
“If the failure to disclose the possible loss would cause the financial statements to be misleading, the situation should be described in a disclosure note, including the effect of the possible loss on key accounting numbers affected.” (“‘Accounting for Contingencies’, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (Stamford, Conn.: FASB, 1975), par. 11.
~As stated by SFAS No. 5, disclosure notes allow an organization to communicate a possible change or future affect in relation to past situation where the outcome is still pending. This allows investors and/or creditors to be aware of what the internal organization is aware without accruing the possible outcome. 

'''Relating Accounting Standards Codification to our three corporate examples:'''
'''Verizon Communications Inc.''' The Hicksville matter seems to align with “Case A” (450:20:55:23) which reads: Case A: Trial Is Complete but Damages Are Undetermined
'''55-23''' An entity is involved in litigation at the close of its fiscal year and information available indicates that an unfavorable outcome is probable. Subsequently, after a trial on the issues, a verdict unfavorable to the entity is handed down, but the amount of damages remains unresolved at the time the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). Although the entity is unable to estimate the exact amount of loss, its reasonable estimate at the time is that the judgment will be for not less than $3 million or more than $9 million. No amount in that range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount. 
I decided this situation is most like Case A because of the following information that was provided in the disclosure note: “To the extent that the ACE assumes responsibility for remedial work at the Hicksville site, an adjustment to a reserve previously established for the remediation may be made. Adjustments to the reserve may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at this or any other site requiring remediation.” This statement implies that the decision has been made that Verizon is liable for the damages; however, the amount of total damages will be decided as cleanup continues. Assuming this is the case Verizon Communications recorded this incident correctly and no accrual is needed. 

'''Dell Inc.'''
	Dell’s situation is similar to Verizon’s in that nothing has been settled. The court has not made a decision on this matter; however, we do have a settlement amount that has not been finalized. I was thinking this could be Case A because there is an amount discussed. However, Case A implies that the case is settled but there is not a set amount to be paid. With this in mind Dell falls into Case B as an unfavorable outcome is probable, a disclosure note is needed because the amount cannot be determined at the time of the financial statements. If we are considering the 2010 financial statements an accrual would be required because the case is finalized with a bill of $100 million to Dell. 
	
'''Best Buy Co. Inc'''. 
	The discrimination in employment suit is going to be a Case C because we cannot determine much of anything at this point regarding the probability or the amount. However, this is a pending case so we need a disclosure note as Best Buy has done. 

'''Questions:'''

1. Referring to the Dell case and more particularly the recent news from July 22, 2010, what would change on the 2010 financial statements? (Provide needed journal entries and/or disclosure notes).

2. Read the disclosure note below. This contingency seems probable and the amount seems to have a reasonable estimate, why does Dell not accrue the contingency? “On November 20, 2009, the parties to the appeal entered into a written settlement agreement whereby Dell would pay $40 million to the proposed class and the plaintiff would dismiss the pending litigation. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the district court on December 21, 2009, (Dell financial statements 2009)”

3. For the following example record the required journal entry and/or disclosure not. Explain your reasoning by citing the Accounting Standards Codification above.

During the fiscal year 2009, XYZ Corporation is facing a class action lawsuit because a trinket they designed, manufactured, and sold malfunctioned and caused bodily harm to customers. Towards the end of the fiscal year the court handed down an unfavorable verdict against XYZ Corporation. The total amount of the damages has not been resolved at the time of the financial statement issuance. XYZ Corporation, though does not have an exact amount, reasonably estimates damages to be between 10 and 15 million dollars. 

4. Working off the same situation for XYZ Corporation as in question 3. Before the financial statements are released we have an update for the total damages. The corporation has found that $12 million is the best estimate of total damages (though not known for sure). How does this change our journal entry and/or disclosure note?

5. In an unsettled court case why would you not accrue an anticipated loss even if it is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated?

6. ABC Corp is charged with a pending lawsuit. The amount nor the probability of damages is known. How should ABC Corp disclose this information to investors and creditors?

7. Why, if an expense has not accrued, is it important to tell investors or creditors about future obligations that might occur?

'''Answers'''

1. Loss-litigation(Debt).........................$100 Million Liability-litigation(Credit)...............................$100 Million
A disclosure note is also appropriate explaining the cause of the loss, ongoing litigation, and the recent court decision.

2. Dell would not accrue this contingency because it is still not finalized. As we realized in 2010, this $40 Million turned into $100 Million.

3.Loss Contingency-Litigation(Debt)..................$10 Million Liability(Credit)............................................$10 Million
Reference Case A (55-23) above as it states that a case where the trial is complete but damages are undetermined we would record an accrual for $10 million, the minimum in the range.

4. Loss Contingency-Litigation.............$12 Million Liability-Litigation.................................$12 Million
In questions 3 and 4, refer to Case A (55-23) where additional disclosure would be required for the potential range of the loss. 

5. In an unsettled court case we would not accrue an anticipated loss because, as stated earlier, the fact that the corporation accrued this amount can be used as evidence for the other side in the court room. When it comes to a jury decision, a corporation already anticipating a loss makes it easier for the jury to issue damages to the corporation. 

6. On July 3rd, 2008 ABC Corp was served with a lawsuit regarding the waste they left on a previous site. On February 27, 2009 no accrual has been established because it is not possible to estimate the possiblity of loss nor the amount of loss. This lawsuit is not at a point where we could make an estimate. (This case is very similar to the Best Buy case above). 

7. It is important to provide full-disclosure in all financial reporting, as explained in SFAS No. 5. SFAS No. 5 explains, &quot;“If the failure to disclose the possible loss would cause the financial statements to be misleading, the situation should be described in a disclosure note, including the effect of the possible loss on key accounting numbers affected.”

==Leases==
'''Leases'''
A lease is a contractual arrangement by which a ''lessor/owner'' provides a ''lessee/user'' the right to use an asset for a specified period of time. In return, the lessee agrees to make periodic cash payments during the term of the lease. An apartment lease is a typical rental agreement referred to as an ''operating lease'' in which the fundamental rights and responsibilities of ownership are retained by the lessor. ''Capital leases''(Direct financing or sales-type leases to the lessor) are contracts that are formulated outwardly as leases, but in reality are installment purchases/sales.
Typically,
&lt;u&gt;Lessee&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Capital 
&lt;u&gt;Lessor&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Direct Financing Lease
or Sales-type lease
Leasing sometimes is used as a means of off-balance-sheet financing. Operational, tax, and financial market incentives often make leasing an attractive alternative to purchasing.

&lt;big&gt;Lease Classification&lt;/big&gt;
'''Capital Leases''': A lessee should classify a lease transaction as a capital lease if it includes a noncancelable lease term and one or more of the four criteria listed are met. Otherwise, it is an operating lease.
1. The agreement specifies that ownership of the asset transfers to the lessee.
2. The agreement contains a bargain purchase option.
3. The noncancelable lease term is equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset.
4. The present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset.

A '''Bargain purchase option (BPO)''' is a provision in the lease contract that gives the lessee the option of purchasing the leased property at a bargain price. This is defined as a price sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property that the exercise of the option appears reasonably assured at the inception of the lease.

'''Expected economic life''': If an asset is leased for most of its useful life, then most of the benefits and responsibilities of ownership are transferred to the lessee. 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset is threshold point for this purpose.

'''Bargain renewal options''' gives the lessee the option to renew the lease at a bargain rate. That is, the rental payment is sufficiently lower than the expected fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable that exercise of the option appears reasonably assured.  

'''Minimum lease payments''': If the lease payments required by a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease equivalent to an installment purchase. It is considered to exist when the present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease.
&lt;big&gt;Additional Lessor Conditions&lt;/big&gt;
1. The collectibility of the lease payments must be reasonably predictable.
2. If any costs to the lessor have yet to be incurred, they are reasonably predictable. (Performance by the lessor is substantially complete.)

'''Operating Lease'''
If a lease does not met any of the criteria for a capital lease it is considered to be more in the nature of a rental agreement and is referred to as an ''operating lease''. In an operating lease, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method more clearly reflects the benefits of the asset's use. So, if rental payments are uneven-for instance, if rent increases are scheduled-the total scheduled payments ordinarily would be expensed equally over the lease term.
&lt;u&gt;Advance Payments&lt;/u&gt;
Often lease agreements call for advance payments to be made at the inception of the lease that represent prepaid rent. For instance, it is common for a lessee to pay a bonus in return for negotiating more favorable lease terms. Such payments are recorded as prepaid rent and allocated( normally on a straight-line basis ) to rent expense/rent revenue over the lease term. Sometimes advance payments include security deposits that are refundable at the expiration of the lease or prepayments of the last period's rent. Rent payments may be scheduled to increase periodically over the lease term. The total rent over the term of the lease is allocated to individual periods on a straight-line basis. As a result, the temporarily unpaid portion of rent expense must be credited to deferred rent expense payable until later in the lease term when rent payments exceed rent expense.

On January 1, 2010, Doogin Wagon, Inc., a computer services firm, leased a printer from ElernZac Corporation. The lease agreement specifies four annual payments of $100,000 beginning January 1, 2010, the inception of the lease, and at each January 1 thereafter through 2013. The useful life of the printer is estimated to be eight years. Before deciding to lease, Doogin Wagon considered purchasing the printer for its cash price of $625,000. If funds were borrowed to buy the copier, the interest rate would have been 10%.
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
5. How should this lease be classified?

'''ANSWER''':
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
''NO''

2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
''NO''

3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
''4 years &lt; 75% of 8 years''
''4 years &lt; 6 years''
''NO''

4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
''$100,000 x 3.48685 (Table 6, n=4, i=10%)= $348,685''
''$348,685 &lt; 90% of $625,000''=''$348,685 &lt; $562,500''

5. How should this lease be classified?
''Since none of the four classification criteria is met, this is an operating lease.''

==Stock options and other share-based compensation==
===Stock options===
Current U.S. GAAP accounting allows and requires that the award of stock options be expensed over the period of employee vesting, and that the total amount to be expensed must equal a valid estimate, upfront, of the value given away.  Using various model-based approaches to estimating the value, as of award date, is acceptable.
  
===Cliff vesting===
Often stock options are issued using graded vesting, also known as &quot;cliff vesting&quot;.  When multiple tranches are issued at the same time, i.e. a stock option package is issued in which an employee vests portions at a time, various accounting approaches for averaging are allowed by U.S. GAAP.  Simplest, conceptually, is to treat each tranche as a separate stock option.  More complicated, in a way, is to value the entire package of stock options at a per-option value based on a weighted average of option lives, and then to straightline that.  This usually yields a higher option value (and higher total compensation cost to be recognized), than the average of the individual options.  But it also can significantly slow the recognition.

For example, p.1078 Spiceland v.6 example, involving package of options that vest 20%, 30%, 50% in three successive years.

However, straight-line approach is not allowed if the amount expensed lags behind the amount vested.  Obviously the accounting should recognize cumulative expense at least as high as cumulative amount vested.  If vesting pattern was front-loaded, i.e. vest 50%, 30%, 20%, then the straightline expensing would not be adequate to stay up with vesting pattern.

Open question:  Would U.S. GAAP accounting allow for applying the vested amounts, when the cumulative vested would be higher than cumulative expense under straight-line method?  (To be examined by considering ASC).</text>

The lyrics to &quot;Danny Boy&quot; were written by the English lawyer and lyricist [[w:Frederick Weatherly|Frederick Weatherly]] in 1910. Although the lyrics were originally written for a different tune, Weatherly modified them to fit &quot;[[w:Londonderry Air|Londonderry Air]]&quot; in 1913 when his sister-in-law in America sent him a copy.

Da ''Danny Boy'' i.d.R. sehr langsam vorgetragen wird, besteht relativ viel Spielraum zum Arrangieren der Begleitakkorde. Hier werden nur die wesentlichen verwendet, die natürlich sehr effektvoll durch melodieangepasste Zwischenakkorde ergänzt werden können.

=Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack=
White's 6. g4 begins the Keres Attack, a sharp and important line in the Scheveningen Variation. 

Black's previous move, 5...e6, boxes in his light squared bishop and relinquishes control over the g4 square. Now, White advances his g pawn with the idea of following with 7. g5, pushing black's f knight back and winning more space on the kingside. Note that against the Sicilian, White often opens up a kingside pawn storm, such as in the English Attack, and 6. g4 furthers that goal well.

Black's most common response, therefore, is 6...h6, preventing the g pawn from advancing. Other responses, such as 6...Nc6, do not discourage the g pawn push, and are therefore usually followed by 7. g5 Nd7. Now black's kingside knight has been pushed back into a much more passive position and white's pawns are dangerously close to black's kingside, if black chooses to castle there. After 6...h6 Black should certainly not proceed to castle kingside quickly against this line. 

Attempting to counterattack with 6...e5 is easily met by 7.Bb5+ Bd7 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7 9.Nb3. White has traded off light squared bishops, and is preparing to set up the standard English Attack. Note that this is one reason that many Scheveningen players use a [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...a6/6._Be3/6...e6|Najdorf move order first]] and transpose to the Scheveningen. In this case, the presence of the a6 pawn discourages Bb5+, and lines here in which white plays g4 are referred to as the Perenyi Attack rather than the Keres Attack.

=Introduction=

It is evident that the framework of information laid out by Advanced Structural Analysis is complex and vast.  Therefore, the clarity of the book's structure is vital to its writers and readers.  Some fundamental guidelines are outlined in the [[/Strategy/]] section whereas the precise architecture is illustrated in the [[/Map/]] section.

=High Level=

Advanced Structural Analysis contains two main sections: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Advanced_Structural_Analysis/Part_I_-_Theory Part I - Theory] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Advanced_Structural_Analysis/Part_II_-_Application Part II - Application].  The idea is that Part I - Theory provides the foundation for the analysis described in Part II - Application.  Ideally, all the reasoning described in Part II - Application should stem from and refer to statements in Part I - Theory.

Furthermore, the global structure should, if possible, comply with the following concepts:

* &quot;All-encompassing&quot; - all matters related to structural analysis should be covered as thoroughly as possible 
* Non-repetitive - a non-redundant layout where efforts are focused and not repeated 
* Stringent - the topics should be organized in a logical sequence where the foundation for each section is established previous sections
* Categorized - natural groupings of content
* Transparent - the branch-like architecture should be intuitively understood and easy to browse
* Concise - a minimal amount of excessive material
* Maintainable - an untangled structure where things can be added without major structural changes

=Low Level=

==Part I - Theory==

Specific principles, key-points and recommendations should be highlighted like the following example:

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac {F}{A} &lt;/math&gt;

==Part II - Application==

=Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack=
White's 6. g4 begins the Keres Attack, a sharp and important line in the Scheveningen Variation. Black's 6...h6 is the standard continuation, preventing an advance to g5 which would force the f6 knight to retreat.

Now White has a number of options. These include advancing anyway with [[/7. g5|g5]] and exchanging pawns or continuing the pawn storm with [[/7. h4|h4]], [[/7. h3|h3]] or [[/7. f3|f3]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book aims to cover algebraic structures and methods that play basic roles in other fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry and representation theory. More precisely, the first chapter covers the rudiments of non-commutative rings and homological language that provide foundations for subsequent chapters. The second chapter covers commutative algebra, which we view as the local theory of algebraic geometry; the emphasis will be on (historical) connections to several complex variables. The third chapter is devoted to field theory, and the fourth to Linear algebra. The fifth chapter studies Lie algebra with emphasis on applications to arithmetic problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Old VarFun section on where ==

So far we have seen two sorts of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in the examples: a variable, which stores some value of our choice, and a parameter of a function (say, &lt;code&gt;area r&lt;/code&gt;). But what would happen if we use both at the same time? Say I type something in like this (don't type it in yet):

 Prelude&gt; let r = 0
 Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r ^ 2
 Prelude&gt; area 5

What do you think that should happen here? Will &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; work as expected or are we in for an unpleasant surprise? Think about an answer, then test it, see if it was what you expected and then follow on with the text...


(...)


 
=== Scope and parameters ===

:'''Warning: this section contains spoilers to the previous &quot;exercise&quot;'''

Fortunately, the following fragment of code does not contain any unpleasant surprises:

 Prelude&gt; let r = 0
 Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r ^ 2
 Prelude&gt; area 5
 78.53981633974483

An unpleasant surprise here would have been getting the value 0 because of the &lt;code&gt;let r = 0&lt;/code&gt; definition getting in the way. That does not happen because when you defined r the second time is that you are talking about a ''different'' r. This is something that happens in real life as well. How many people do you know that have the name John? What's interesting about people named John is that most of the time, you can talk about &quot;John&quot; to your friends, and depending on the context, your friends will know which John you are referring to. Programming has something similar to context, called '''[[Wikipedia:Scope (programming)|scope]]'''. We won't explain the technicalities behind scope (at least not now), but Haskell's lexical scope is the magic that lets us define two different r and always get the right one back depending on context.

Thanks to scope, the value of a parameter is strictly what you pass in when you call the function. Informally, we could say the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;let r = 0&lt;/code&gt; is not the same &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as the one inside our defined function &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; - the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; overrides the other &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;; you can think of it as Haskell picking the most specific version of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; there is. If you have many friends all named John, you go with the one which just makes more sense and is specific to the context; similarly, what value of r we get depends on the scope.

=== where clauses ===

''Readers: don't worry about this missing section. As of now where clauses are explained [[Haskell/More on functions|later on]], and there is no need to rush over there to check them. This is just a placeholder for when they are moved to this section in the near future.


== Old VarFun/Type basics introduction to types ==
&lt;!-- This example is plain broken. I eagerly await for when we find ourselves in a position to replace it --&gt;
Let us have another look at the circumference examples in [[Haskell/Variables and functions|Variables and functions]]. While playing around with the expressions you might be tempted to try storing a plain value such as &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; and using it in other expressions. Let's see what happens:

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r = 25
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:9:
    Couldn't match `Double' against `Integer'
      Expected type: Double
      Inferred type: Integer
    In the second argument of `(*)', namely `r'
    In the definition of `it': it = 2 * pi * r
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whoops! You've just run into a programming concept known as '''types'''. Types are a feature of many programming languages which are designed to catch some of your programming errors early on so that you find out about them before it's too late. One simple analogy for us to start with are plugs and connectors. For example, many of the plugs on the back of your computer are designed to have different shapes and sizes for a purpose. This is partly so that you don't inadvertently plug the wrong bits of your computer together and blow something up. Types serve a similar purpose, but in this particular example, well, types aren't so helpful.

The tricky bit here is that numbers like &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; can be interpreted as being &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; is one of several types for representing real numbers). For lack of other information, Haskell has &quot;guessed&quot; that its type must be &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; (which cannot be multiplied with a &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;).  To work around this, we simply insist that it is to be treated as a &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r = 25 :: Double
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r
157.07963267948966
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that Haskell only has this &quot;guessing&quot; behaviour in contexts where it does not have enough information to infer the type of something.  As we will see below, most of the time, the surrounding context gives us all of the information that is needed to determine, say, if a number is to be treated as an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; or not.

{{body note|1=
There is actually a little bit more subtlety behind this problem.  It involves a language feature known as the  '''monomorphism restriction'''.  You don't actually need to know about this for now, so you can skip over this note if you just want to keep a brisk pace.  Instead of specifying the type &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, you also could have given it a '''polymorphic''' type, like &lt;code&gt;Num a =&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which means &quot;any type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which belongs in the class &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.   The corresponding code looks like this and works just as seamlessly as before:
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r :: Num a =&gt; a ; r = 25
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r
157.07963267948966&lt;/pre&gt;

Haskell could &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; assign such polymorphic types systematically, instead of defaulting to some potentially incorrect guess, like Integer. But in the real world, this could lead to values being needlessly duplicated or recomputed.  To avoid this potential trap, the designers of the Haskell language opted for a more prudent &quot;monomorphism restriction&quot;.  It means that values may only have a polymorphic type if it can be inferred from the context, or if you explicitly give it one. Otherwise, the compiler is forced to choose a default monomorphic (i.e. non-polymorphic) type. This feature is somewhat controversial. It can even be disabled with the GHC flag (-fno-monomorphism-restriction), but it comes with some risk for inefficiency. Besides, in most cases, it is just as easy to specify the type explicitly.
}}

== Reworked sections of Type basics ==

=== Boolean values ===
One of the other types found in most languages is called a Boolean, or Bool for short. This has two values: true and false. This turns out to be very useful. For example, consider a program that would ask the user for a name then look that name up in a spreadsheet. It might be useful to have a function, &lt;code&gt;nameExists&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates whether or not the name of the user exists in the spreadsheet. If it ''does exist'', you could say that it is ''true'' that the name exists, and if not, you could say that it is ''false'' that the name exists. So we've come across Bools. The two ''values'' of bools are, as we've mentioned, true and false. In Haskell, boolean values are capitalized (for reasons that will later become clear):

{{HaskellExample|Exploring the types of True and False in GHCi|
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t True
True :: Bool
Prelude&gt; :t False
False :: Bool
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

This shouldn't need too much explaining at this point. The values True and False are categorized as Booleans, that is to say, they have type Bool.

=== Numeric types ===
If you've been playing around with typing :t on all the familiar values you've come across, perhaps you've run into the following complication:

 Prelude&gt; :t 5
 5 :: (Num t) =&gt; t

We'll defer the full explanation of this until later. The short version of the story is that there are many different types of numbers (fractions, whole numbers, etc) and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; can be any one of them. This weird-looking type relates to a Haskell feature called [[../Class_Declarations/|type classes]], which we will be playing with later in this book.

== Type signatures in code ==

''As of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Type_basics&amp;oldid=1827970 this revision of Type Basics].''

''Readers: As of now there are a few forward references in this section. We are in the process of sorting out some module sequencing issues, which means that problem will be solved soon. In the meantime, you might prefer to go through the next module, &quot;Lists and tuples&quot; and then return here to finish this one.''

Now we've explored the basic theory behind types as well as how they apply to Haskell, let's look at how they appear in actual code. The first thing to point out is that it is a good practice to ''annotate'' every function with its associated type. For an applied example, let us have a look at a very small ''module'' (modules in Haskell are just a neat way of making a library by packing functions for usage in other programs. No need to worry with details now).

{{HaskellExample|Module without type signatures| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module StringManip where

import Data.Char

uppercase = map toUpper
lowercase = map toLower
capitalise x = 
  let capWord []     = []
      capWord (x:xs) = toUpper x : xs
  in unwords (map capWord (words x))
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

This tiny library provides two handy string manipulation functions. &lt;code&gt;uppercase&lt;/code&gt; converts a string to uppercase, &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; to lowercase, and &lt;code&gt;capitalize&lt;/code&gt; capitalizes the first letter of every word. Each of these functions takes a String as argument and evaluates to another String. For now, don't worry with how the code actually works, as it is obviously full of features we haven't discussed yet. Anyway - and specially because we don't understand the implementation yet - stating the type for these functions explicitly would make their roles more obvious. For example, most Haskellers would write the above module something like the following:

{{HaskellExample|Module with type signatures| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module StringManip where

import Data.Char

uppercase, lowercase :: String -&gt; String
uppercase = map toUpper
lowercase = map toLower

capitalise :: String -&gt; String
capitalise x = 
  let capWord []     = []
      capWord (x:xs) = toUpper x : xs
  in unwords (map capWord (words x))
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The added signatures inform the type of the functions to both the interpreter/compiler and the human readers. Note that you can group type signatures together into a single type signature (like ours for &lt;code&gt;uppercase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; above) if the two functions share the same type.

=== Type inference ===
We just said that type signatures tell the interpreter (or compiler) what the function type is. However, in the modules before this one you wrote perfectly good Haskell code without any signatures, and it has been accepted by GHC/GHCi. That means it's not strictly necessary to add type signatures. But that doesn't mean that if you don't add type signatures Haskell simply forgets about typing altogether! Indeed, when you didn't tell Haskell the types of your functions and variables, it ''figured them out''. This is a process called ''type inference'', in which the compiler starts with the types of things it knows, then works out the types of the rest of the things. Type inference for Haskell is ''decidable'', which means that the compiler can ''always'' work out the types, even if you never write them in &lt;ref&gt;Some of the newer type system extensions to GHC ''do'' break this, however, so you're better off just always putting down types anyway.&lt;/ref&gt;. Let's look at some examples to see how the compiler works out types.

{{HaskellExample|Simple type inference| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- We're deliberately not providing a type signature for this function
isL c = c == 'l'
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

This function takes a character and sees if it is an &lt;code&gt;'l'&lt;/code&gt; character. The compiler ''derives'' the type for &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; through a process like the following:

{{HaskellExample|A typing derivation|
&lt;pre&gt;
(==)  :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
'l'   :: Char
Replacing the second ''a'' in the signature for (==) with the type of 'l':
(==)  :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool
isL   :: Char -&gt; Bool
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

The first line indicates that the type of the function &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, which tests for equality, is &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; (you can think of the &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; as a placeholder which stands for any type - &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; will accept any two arguments as long as they are of the same type. That is called a ''polymorphic function'') &lt;!-- This needs to be reworked when the introduction to polymorphism is finished --&gt; &lt;ref&gt;This is a slight lie. That type signature would mean that you can compare two values of any type whatsoever, but this clearly isn't true: how can you see if two functions are equal? Haskell includes a kind of 'restricted polymorphism' that allows type variables to range over some, but not all types. Haskell implements this using ''type classes'', which we'll learn about later. In this case, the correct type of &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The compiler also knows that something in single quotes has type Char, so clearly the literal &lt;code&gt;'l'&lt;/code&gt; has type Char. Next, the compiler starts replacing the type variables in the signature for &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; with the types it knows. Note that in one step, we went from &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, because the type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was used in both the first and second argument, so they need to be the same. And so we arrive at a function that takes a single argument (whose type we don't know yet, but hold on!) and applies it as the first argument to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;. We have a particular ''instance'' of the polymorphic type of &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, that is, here, we're talking about &lt;code&gt;(==) :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; because we know that we're comparing Chars. Therefore, as &lt;code&gt;(==) :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; and we're feeding the parameter into the first argument to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, we know that the parameter has the type of Char. Phew!

But wait, we're not finished yet... What's the return type of the function? Thankfully, this bit is a bit easier. We've fed two Chars into a function which (in this case) has type &lt;code&gt;Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, so we must have a Bool. Note that the return value from the call to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; becomes the return value of our &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; function.

So, let's put it all together. &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes a single argument. We discovered that this argument must be of type Char. Finally, we derived that we return a Bool. So, we can confidently say that &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; has the type:

{{HaskellExample|&lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; with a type|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
isL :: Char -&gt; Bool
isL c = c == 'l'
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

And, indeed, if you miss out the type signature, the Haskell compiler will discover this on its own, using exactly the same method we've just run through.

So if type signatures are optional, why bother with them at all? Here are a few reasons:

* '''Documentation''': the most prominent reason is that it makes your code easier to read. With most functions, the name of the function along with the type of the function is sufficient to guess at what the function does. Of course, you should always comment your code properly too, but having the types clearly stated helps a lot anyway.&lt;!-- add a discreet note on Haddock later --&gt;
* '''Debugging''': if you annotate a function with a type, then make a typo in the body of the function, the compiler will tell you ''at compile-time'' that your function is wrong. Leaving off the type signature could have the effect of allowing your function to compile, and the compiler would assign it an erroneous type. You wouldn't know until you ran your program that it was wrong. In fact, since this is such a crucial point we will explore it some more.

=== Types prevent errors ===
Imagine you have a few functions set up like the following:

&lt;!-- I think now I see why to add basic pattern matching in Truth values, and stand corrected --&gt;
{{HaskellExample|Type inference at work|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fiveOrSix :: Bool -&gt; Int
fiveOrSix True  = 5
fiveOrSix False = 6

pairToInt :: (Bool, String) -&gt; Int
pairToInt x = fiveOrSix (fst x)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Our function &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt; takes a Bool. When &lt;code&gt;pairToInt&lt;/code&gt; receives its arguments, it knows, because of the type signature we've annotated it with, that the first element of the pair is a Bool. So, we could extract this using &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; and pass that into &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt;, and this would work, because the type of the first element of the pair and the type of the argument to &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt; are the same.

This is really central to typed languages. When passing expressions around you have to make sure the types match up like they did here. If they don't, you'll get ''type errors'' when you try to compile; your program won't ''typecheck''. This is really how types help you to keep your programs bug-free. To take a very trivial example:

{{HaskellExample|A non-typechecking program|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot; + &quot; world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Having that line as part of your program will make it fail to compile, because you can't add two strings together! In all likelihood the intention was to use the similar-looking string concatenation operator, which joins two strings together into a single one:

{{HaskellExample|Our erroneous program, fixed|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot; ++ &quot; world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

An easy typo to make, but because you use Haskell, it was caught when you tried to compile. You didn't have to wait until you ran the program for the bug to become apparent.

This was only a simple example. However, the idea of types being a system to catch mistakes works on a much larger scale too. In general, when you make a change to your program, you'll change the type of one of the elements. If this change isn't something that you intended, or has unforeseen consequences, then it will show up immediately. A lot of Haskell programmers remark that once they have fixed all the type errors in their programs, and their programs compile, that they tend to &quot;just work&quot;: run flawlessly at the first time, with only minor problems. ''Run-time errors'', where your program goes wrong when you run it rather than when you compile it, are much rarer in Haskell than in other languages. This is a huge advantage of having a strong type system like Haskell does.

# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;f x y = uppercase (x ++ y)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sheaf theory ==

We say &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''pre-sheaf'' on a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if
* (i) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt;
* (ii) For each inclusion &lt;math&gt;U \hookrightarrow V&lt;/math&gt;, we have the group morphism &lt;math&gt;\rho_{V, U}: \mathcal{F}(V) \to \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that
*:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{U,U}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{W,U} = \rho_{V,U} \circ \rho_{W,V}&lt;/math&gt; for any inclusion &lt;math&gt;U \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;

A pre-sheaf is called a ''sheaf'' if the following &quot;gluing axiom&quot; holds:
:For each open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and its open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \mathcal F(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;f_j = f_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a ''unique'' &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = f_j&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the uniqueness implies that if &lt;math&gt;f, g \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = g|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''4 Example''': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a topological group (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all continuous maps from open subsets &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; forms a sheaf. In particular, suppose the topology for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is discrete. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''constant sheaf''.

Given sheaves &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt;, a ''sheaf morphism'' &lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathcal F \to \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of group morphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi_U: \mathcal F(U) \to \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying: for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset V&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_U \circ \rho_{V, U} = \rho_{V, U} \circ \phi_V&lt;/math&gt;
where the first &lt;math&gt;\rho_{V, U}&lt;/math&gt; is one that comes with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; and the second &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt;.

Define &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{ker}\phi)(U) = \operatorname{ker}\phi_U&lt;/math&gt; for each open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\phi&lt;/math&gt; is then a sheaf. In fact, suppose &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \operatorname{ker}\phi_{U_j} &lt;/math&gt;. Then there is &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = f_j&lt;/math&gt;. But since
:&lt;math&gt;(\phi_U f)|_{U_j} = \phi_{U_j} (f|_{U_j}) = \phi_{U_j} f_j = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\phi_U f = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}\phi&lt;/math&gt; does not turn out to be a sheaf if it is defined in the same way. We thus define &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{im}\phi)(U)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that there is an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt; is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a sheaf. In fact, as before, let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} \in \operatorname{im}\phi_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have an open cover of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; restricted to each member &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of the cover is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi_V&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^0, \mathcal{F}^1, \mathcal{F}^2&lt;/math&gt; be sheaves on the same topological space.

A sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''flabby'' if &lt;math&gt;\rho_{X, U}:\mathcal{F}(X) \to \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_p = \lim_{U \ni p} \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and, for each &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}f = \{ x \in U | f|_p \ne 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}f&lt;/math&gt; is closed since &lt;math&gt;f|_p = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;q \in U&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}\mathcal{F} = \{ x \in X | \mathcal{F}_x \ne 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;i: Z \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}\mathcal{F} \subset Z&lt;/math&gt;, then the natural map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \to i_* i^{-1} \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.

'''4 Theorem''' ''Suppose
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^2 \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
''is exact. Then, for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;''

''is exact. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^1) \to \Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^2)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^0&lt;/math&gt; is flabby.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: That the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\mathcal{F}^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1&lt;/math&gt; is trivial means that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\mathcal{F}^0(U) \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1(U)&lt;/math&gt; has trivial kernel for any &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the first map is clear. Next, denoting &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^1 \to \mathcal{F}^2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, suppose &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}^1(U)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;df = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j \in \mathcal{F}(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d u_j = f|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d u_j = f = d u_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{U_j \cap U_k}&lt;/math&gt; is injective by the early part of the proof, we have &lt;math&gt;u_j = u_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt; and so we get &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;du = f&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, to show that the last map is surjective, let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}^2(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{ (U, u) | du = f|_U \}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\{ (U_j, u_j) | j \in J \} \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is totally ordered, then let &lt;math&gt;U = \cup_j U_j&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; agree on overlaps by totally ordered-ness, there is &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u|_{U_j} = u_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;(U, u)&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of the collection &lt;math&gt;(U_j, u_j)&lt;/math&gt;. By Zorn's Lemma, we then find a maximal element &lt;math&gt;(U_0, u_0)&lt;/math&gt;. We claim &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose not. Then there exists &lt;math&gt;(U_1, u_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d u_1 = f|_{U_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d(u_0 - u_1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_0 \cap U_1&lt;/math&gt;, by the early part of the proof, there exists &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathcal{F}^0(U_0 \cap U_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;da = u_0 - u_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;d(u_1 + da) = du_1 = f|_{U_1}&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;(U_1, u_1) \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;) while &lt;math&gt;u_1 + da = u_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_0 \cap U_1&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the maximality of &lt;math&gt;(U_0, u_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we conclude &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;du_0 = f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map. The sheaf &lt;math&gt;f_* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; (called the pushforward of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by &lt;math&gt;f_* \mathcal{F}(U) = \mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(U))&lt;/math&gt; for an open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: Y \to X&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map. The sheaf &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is then defined by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\mathcal{F}(U) = &lt;/math&gt; the sheafification of the presheaf &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto \varinjlim_{V \supset f(U)} \mathcal{F}(V)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The two are related in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be an open subset. Then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}f_*\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; consists of elements &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(V))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V \supset f(U)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V) \supset U&lt;/math&gt;, we find a map
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}f_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
by sending &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f|_U&lt;/math&gt;. The map is well-defined for it doesn't depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

It was fun to have the opportunity to ask the contest administrator whether we should nuke a comet.  I am in favor of both nuking a comet for AsteroidWatch target practice (because comets represent the greatest potential threats, with short lead times from the Oort Cloud) and excavation.  I had the opportunity to suggest an engineering analysis of which comet would be easiest to excavate and park in a [[w:Mars cycler|cycler]] orbit using its inherent fluids as propellant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Types of religion

Religions generally demand respect for parents, elders and certain wise or brave leaders. Hierarchical power structures culminate in monotheism, where a supreme, all-wise, ever-present but undetectable God monitors a believers' every thought and action. The contrary view is of polytheism, where many gods deny supremacy to any person or deity. Universal democracy is a form of this, since every elector is an individual, but the average of their collective will (eventually) reign supreme. Rather than respecting the personal wishes of a king or president, democrats require their leaders to conform to their collective will, and punish those who abuse their delegated power. Neither absolute personal princely power nor absolute democracy is very efficient, and most societies strike a balance - The United States of America and the Republic of France have powerful presidents, but their term of office is very short. Conversely the monarchs of the Kingdoms of Spain and Britain rule 'for life' but they have very little power or freedom although their experience may lend them a certain moral authority.


Needs to be reworded in line with a new heading types of religious belief. Needs to define only what each type is.  I would also suggest that the hierarchical structure of a religion has nothing to do with the belief system of the religion (e.g. islamic religion does not have a hierarchical structure but is a monotheistic religion, Christianity on the other hand can (depending on the denomination) have ecclesial structures that are hierarchical  and is also monotheistic.    I would remove the non-religious examples as they are not sound foundations for a basis of theology.

The article is actually a brief introduction to religion and not at all to theology. While there's not much wrong with doing them both, there are many problems in confusing them.</text>

[[File:VISITA A LOS SANTOS MACARACAS 039.jpg|thumb|right|You are made of matter too. So are mountains, grass, and so on.]]
Everything is made of matter. Almost everything, that is. There are two criteria that determine whether something is composed of matter:
* Matter must have mass;
* Matter must take up space.
As you know, air takes up space. Therefore, air is matter. In fact, if you were hot enough you could turn into gas too, just like air. That will be [[../Three states of matter|explained later]].

Here are some other examples of matter:
* You
* Other living things
* Your schoolbag
* Your science textbook

However, not everything is made up of matter. Here are some common exceptions:
* The light that comes out of lamps
* The sound from your radio

But how does this all link to particles? As you will learn later, matter is made up of particles. Since almost everything around us is made of matter, learning about particles is essential in explaining further topics. This book will help you begin your quest by introducing the properties of particles and explaining the types of objects made up from matter. This book is based on the curriculum of chapter 6 of form one in Hong-Kong, but you don't have to be a Hong-Kong-er to read this book!

== Using this book ==
Children can use this book in a number of ways.
* To find out more about our world and fulfill their curiosity.
*As a set of notes for studying and future reference.
* To use within the curriculum of a class.
* And pretty much anything else that you can think of.

If you are reading this book as an e-book on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main page Wikibooks], feel free to edit or modify this book! If you are reading this offline or as a pdf, the url of this book is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Particles http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Particles].

[[File:Bleu de Gex.jpg|100px|thumb|right|This chunk of cheese is solid.]]
[[File:Orange juice 1.jpg|100px|thumb|right|The orange juice is liquid.]]
[[File:Automobile exhaust gas.jpg|100px|thumb|right|This is exhaust gas and it's gas!]]
As we have found out from the introduction, anything that occupies space and has mass is matter. However, not all matter is the same. Matter, in fact, can appear as three forms: liquid, solid and gas. Water is the only kind of matter whose all three states appear in nature. Therefore, we will use water as a primary example as we go through the three states of matter. Later in the book, we will also explain the three states of matter with the particle model.

== Properties of matter ==
[[File:Frigidaire tm.jpg|thumb|left|100px|If you put water in a fridge, it freezes after a while.]]
The properties of matter are as follows:
*Solids' shapes cannot be altered, and nor can its volume
*Liquids' shapes can be altered, but not its volume
*Gases' shapes can be altered (so it's compressible), and so can its volume

These properties can be verified with a series of experiments. First, you can try to alter the shape of volume of solids. Try doing that to your pencil – it won't budge. Then try to pour some water from a bottle to a cup. The shape changes. Now, if the bottle is full, but its size reduces, will the liquid spill? The answer is yes. Therefore, liquids have a fixed volume. Finally, try gases. If you transfer some coloured gas from one container to another, whose shapes and sizes are different, there will be no problem.

== Change of states ==
[[File:Kettle decorative.JPG|right|thumb|100px|When you boil water in a kettle, some of it turns to gas.]]
Sometimes matter can change from one state to another. For example, if you blow onto the surface of glass, the water vapour that comes out of your mouth transforms into liquid. If you put the piece of glass into a freezer, a few hours later it will become ice.

There are specific names for the changes of states.

{|class = &quot;wikitable&quot; borders=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Solid
|Melting&lt;br/&gt; →→→→→→
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Liquid 
| Boiling&lt;br/&gt;→→→→→→
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Gas
|-
| ←←←←←←&lt;br/&gt;Freezing
| ←←←←←←&lt;br/&gt;Condensation
|}

Melting, freezing and boiling happen at fixed temperatures. The temperature of distinction between different states are called the melting point, the freezing point and the boiling point. For water, these points are 0°C, 0°C and 100°C respectively. Actually, the freezing and melting points of any matter are the same.

Condensation does not take place at a fixed temperature. There is a related process called evaporation, which does not take place at a fixed temperature, although a higher temperature does accelerate the rate of evaporation. Evaporation is the process in which a solid changes into a liquid. When your wound is sterillised, it feels cold as the alcohol evaporates, carrying with it heat.

==Quiz==
# X is heated, so that transforms into another state. The initial form is not liquid. What is the current form? What is the process it went through?
# True or false? As the boiling point of Y is 300°C, it cannot change into its gaseous form at 250°C, nor change into liquid form at 350°C.

Answers:
#Liquid; melting
#False. Condensation and evaporation can happen at any temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Matter|Next=Diffusion}}
[[File:Leitz 117298 frei.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Unfortunately, this little thing cannot help us see particles.]]
The particle theory is a theory that scientists have proposed. It suggests the following points:
* Matter is made of particles;
* Particles are extremely small, and current scientific instruments cannot see them;
* Different kinds of particles have different sizes;
* There must be gaps between particles
* Particles are always in motion.

== Spaces between particles ==
[[File:Alcohol water particles.svg|right|200px]]
There are spaces between particles. Imagine you put pebbles into a measuring cylinder. The reading is 200mL. Then you get 200mL of sand, and mix it in. The result is not 400mL, as there are spaces between the pebbles, and the sand can fill them up.

So, if you mix equal volumes of alcohol and water, the result is not twice the volume of alcohol or water, but slightly less. See the diagram on the right for what the particles look like. Or, if you put sugar into coffee, the coffee level does not rise up the same volume as the sugar. This is because there are spaces between particles.

== Particles always moving ==
Particles are always moving, although they do move differently - this will be explained in the states of matter chapter later on. For example, when water is boiled, the 'steam', which are actually tiny water particles, cannot stay in one place. More about this will be discussed in the next chapter, which is about diffusion.

As we have found in the last chapter, particles are always moving. However, how exactly would they move? A common phenomenon observed from the movement of particles is diffusion. Diffusion means a kind of particles going from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration. Imagine a herd of lions and a herd of tigers mixed together. If diffusion happens, lions will go to a place with more tigers than lions, and tigers will go to a place with less tigers than lions. At the end, the tigers and lions will be mixed more thoroughly. That is what particles are like during diffusion.

== Examples of diffusion ==
[[File:Diffusion.svg|left|thumb|100px|What diffusion looks like.]]

If you dip a paintbrush with a bit of red paint on the tip into a cup of water, the paint will spread all over the cup. The red will spread to places that are more transparent, while the transparency spreads to places that are redder. At the end, the paint and water will be thoroughly mixed so the water is red. (Here we assume that the paint is soluble in water.)

Another example is smell. Imagine a piece of stilton cheese is placed on a table in a corner of a room. You are standing on the opposite corner, a friend of yours is standing in the centre, and another friend is standing right next to the stilton cheese. You must be the last to smell it.

== Perfume in a plastic bag ==
This experiment is inspired from an experiment from the following source:
*{{cite book|first1=W. K.|last1=Chan|first2=W. Y.|last2=Luk|first3=S. W|last3=Kong|publisher=Aristo Educational Press LTD.|title=Understanding Integrated Science|volume=1B|chapter=Matter as particles|page=131–132}}

#Put a drop of perfume into a plastic bag, then tie up its opening.
#Sniff. You can't smell perfume yet.
#Wait a little bit, sniff again. You should be able to smell perfume now.

This experiment proves that there are spaces between the particles of the wall of the plastic bag, and that the perfume diffuses. When the perfume on the bottom of the bag diffuses, it flies to the wall of the bag. As the perfume particles are small enough, they escape through the gaps between the plastic particles and into your nose.

== Quiz ==
[[File:Diffusion particles.svg|200px]]&lt;br/&gt;
If A and B are to meet, do you think A will come to B or B will come to A? Why?

Answer:
B will come to A. This is because A is in a place of lower concentration while B is in a place of higher concentration. B will flow to A's place because of diffusion.

==Introduction on Assets==

Assets may be viewed as resources owned or controlled by an entity. They include such items as cash, accounts receivable (amounts owed to the company by customers), land, building and equipment, and supplies.
Current assets are often defined as assets that are in cash, or can be converted to cash, in a relatively short period.  In practice that is often defined as convertible within one year or operating cycle, whichever is longer.

==Cash==
Cash are currency and coins, balances in checking accounts, and items acceptable for deposits in these accounts, such as checks and money orders received from customers.

==Accounts receivable==
This is the receivables resulting from the sale of goods or services.This is treated as a current asset on the balance sheet.

==Prepaid expenses==
Prepaid expenses result from businesses making payments for goods and services to be received in the near future.

==Property, plant and equipment==
Property, plant and equipment are tangible, long-lived assets used in the operations of the business. Land, natural resources, buildings, furniture, equipment, and machinery are included in this category. They are listed under the asset portion of the balance sheet. One major component that comes into play with property, plant, and equipment is depreciation. Mostly for equipment and machinery things are depreciated on either a straight line, declining, sum of the years digits, or units of production balance. For natural resources they use a method similar, but it is called depletion. Accounting for these things is pretty simple. The item, or land, is listed on the books at its value and every year the calculated depreciation is taken off and that determines its book value. Many times there is an estimated life and salvage value if the company thinks it can resell the item. If not, it is disposed of and the gain or loss of the sale is recorded on the books as well as removal of the item from the books. 

Figuring the cost of an item takes into consideration more than just the purchase price. Added to that would be any taxes paid, less any discounts received, cost of transportation that a company pays to bring the item to where it needs to go, and the cost of getting it ready for use. The cost of land would include any attorney fees, real estate fees, title fees, back taxes that need to be paid, and the cost of preparation for the lands intended use. Buildings also have additional costs such as legal fees and remodeling fees to prepare it for use. The same goes for natural resources. Basically any costs that are necessary to get an item or land ready to use for business is included in the cost of the item.

===Questions:===
#The amount reported on the balance sheet for Property, Plant and Equipment is the company's estimate of the fair market value as of the balance sheet date. True or False?
# Initial cost of land would include all of the following except:
   A. Cost of Grading
   B. Title Search Cost
   C. Recording Fees
   D. Property Taxes for the current period
# Property, plants, and equipment are reported as current assets. True or False?
# What is the most commonly used form of depreciation?
# Would tearing down an existing building on newly purchased land qualify as a cost under property, plant, and equipment?

Answers:
# False
# D
# False
# Straightline
# Yes

==Intangible Assets==
Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, and goodwill.  This classification of assets generally represents exclusive rights that provide future economic benefit to the owner.

===Goodwill===
Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the unique value of a company as a whole over and above its identifiable tangible and intangible assets.  Because goodwill represents the fair value of a company over and above the fair value of its net assets, its costs can’t be directly associated with any specific identifiable right, subsequently making it non-separable from the company itself.  Examples of a company’s goodwill would be, its clientele, good reputation within its market, well trained employees and management team, its favorable business location, and any other unique features of the company that can’t be associated with a specific asset (Spiceland, Sepe, Nelson, Tomassini, Page 486).  

As previously mentioned goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of a company’s identifiable assets.  The following example illustrates how we derive the value of goodwill for a company.

Ex) The fair value of Company X’s net assets is $500,000, and can be broken down as follows; Inventory $90,000, Receivables $70,000, Property and Equipment $200,000, and Patent $140,000.  Company X’s fair value of liabilities assumed is $200,000, and the purchase price of Company X is $450,000.  By taking the difference of the fair value of net assets and fair value of liabilities assumed, the fair value of the company being purchased would be $300,000.  Because the purchase price of the company was $450,000, and the fair value of the company was $300,000, we can conclude that the difference (excess) of $150,000 represents the value of the goodwill.

Understanding how the value of goodwill is derived; it’s important to note that there is no specific identifiable cost of goodwill separate from the company itself.  That being said, one would conclude that goodwill cannot be separated from a company as a whole, and therefore cannot be purchased or exchanged separately from a company as a whole.  Without being separable from the company, goodwill lacks two key components of most, if not all other assets; those being the ability of “equating costs of an asset” as well as “exchangeability” of an asset. 

There has been great debate for some time regarding whether or not goodwill should be classified as an asset, with opposing views centering on, equating costs and assets, exchangeability of assets, and controllability of assets (Johnson, Petrone 1998, p.7).  Although these opposing viewpoints do merit some consideration, the Financial Accounting Standards board (FASB) has determined that goodwill does in fact meet the three key elements that define an asset (probable future economic benefits, obtained or controlled by an entity, from a past transaction) and consequently is to be classified as an intangible asset (FASB, 350-20-05-3).

Questions
 
1)	How is the value of goodwill derived?

2)	Does goodwill meet FASB’s requirements for classification as an asset?

3)	What are the key concerns from opposing viewpoints regarding the classification of goodwill as an asset?

4)	What type of asset is goodwill classified as?

5)	Would a company’s client list be an example or component of goodwill?

==Depreciation and amortization==

==Impairment==
An impairment loss is accrued when a sudden decrease in the value of the asset occurs.In other words, depreciation and amortization will not be able to significantly decrease the book value of the asset in accordance with its market or fair value. The codification that deals with impairment can be found at 350-10-S35 for intangible assets and at 360-10-40 tangible assets.
===Testing===

Operational assets that a finite life should be tested for impairment when a situation arises that causes the asset to lose value. An extreme example of one situation is when the asset is destroyed. Another example is if the asset is severely damaged. Generally, operational assets should be tested for impairment when one of the following occurs; market price is significantly decreased, legal factors cause a negative change in the asset, the asset is going to be disposed of before the end of its useful life, or a negative change in the physical condition of the asset. 

However, some operational assets, such as intangible assets with infinite lives and goodwill should be tested for impairment annually.


===Implementation===

When measuring the impairment of an asset with a finite life, a two step process is used. The first step of the process is called the recoverability test. The recoverability test determines if an impairment loss is needed by seeing if the undiscounted future value of the cash flows from the asset is less than the book value of the asset. If the future value is lower than the current book value, an impairment loss measurement is needed. The second step is to actually measure the impairment. The impairment loss is measured by the difference between the book value and the fair value of the asset.  

In the case of intangible assets with indefinite lives, the impairment loss is also the difference between the book value and the fair value of the asset. However, in order to determine whether an impairment loss is needed, future cash flows cannot be used, and the only determination is the current fair value of the asset. 

Goodwill is a special category of assets and is measured in a different way than other operational assets. Impairment to goodwill is measured by the difference between book value and fair value. However, the value of goodwill is only implied, so the market value of the asset cannot be used in this determination of impairment.


===Journal entries===

The journal entries for the impairment loss have the following format.

&lt;pre&gt;
Loss on impairment                     xx
Accumulated depreciation               xx
      Asset                                xx
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Independent study questions===

====Questions====

# A piece of machinery has a book value of $35 million and accumulated depreciation of $10 million. The fair value of this machinery is $10 million. The future, undiscounted cash flows estimated for the machinery are $15 million. Calculate the impairment loss on the machinery.
#Prepare the jounal entry needed for the calculation completed in question 1.
#How does the calculation of impairment for goodwill differ from that of other intangible assets?
#What are some possible situations that causes a company to determine if their assets are impaired?
#Where are impairment losses reported in financial statements?


====Answers====

#Since the book value is more than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the asset, an impairment loss is needed. The fair value of $10 million is subtracted from the book value of $35 million, less the accumulated depreciation of $10 million. The impairment loss is calculated to be $15million.
#The journal entry should be:
&lt;pre&gt;
Loss on impairment                     $15million
Accumulated depreciation               $10million
      Machinery                                  $25million
&lt;/pre&gt;
3. Goodwill is considered to be a special asset. The market value of goodwill is implied, therefore it can never be used in the calculation of an impairment loss. Instead, the implied fair value of goodwill is subtracted from the book value to determine the impairment loss.

4. It would not be cost effective for companies to measure all of their assets for impairment every year. Some situations that are used to identify when an impairment loss may be needed is when there is a major decrease in market price, legal factors cause a negative change in the asset, the asset is going to be disposed of before the end of its useful life, or a negative change in the physical condition of the asset.

5. A disclosure note is needed to describe the impairment loss. Impairment losses are also seen on the income statements, as well as the balance sheet.

==Investments==
Accounting methods for investments held by a firm vary according to whether the firm has control over the investee.

===Trading Securities===
Marked to market, and gains and losses are recognized immediately in income.  Balance sheet shows fair value.

===Held-to-maturity debt===
Recorded at amortized cost by a schedule determined at the original investment date.  Gains and losses are not recognized.  Balance sheet shows amortized cost.

===Available-for-sale===
For other debt and securities that do not meet Trading Securities or HTM requirements.  Unrealized gains and losses are not recognized in regular income, but they are recognized in &quot;other comprehensive income&quot;.  Balance sheet shows fair value.

==Significant influence==
Equity method is primarily used;  fair value option is also available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Target grade level ==

This book could be very cool.  Right now I think it's pitched a bit high for Wikijunior, but any possible redress of that is contingent on clarifying the target audience.

To start with, what is the grade level of the material that this book is initially based on?  (I know from nothing about Hong Kong's system, so &quot;chapter&amp;nbsp;6 of form one&quot; doesn't tell me anything.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:07, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

'redress' and 'contigent on' are really tough words for me. This ''is'' Wikijunior, you know. :) Had to check the dictionary.

*I agree, the authorship seems to waiver between various agegroups, e.g. (&quot;stationary means not moving&quot; then &quot;gases are compressible&quot;).  If it's for a younger audience, I would suggest redoing the entire book as a narrative.  Something like Patty the Particle and then describing his/her activities with his/her particle friends.

==Featured Book Feedback==

To have a hope of featured book status, most vital first:
* Go to wikimedia commons and get loads loads more pictures.  Vital for a junior book.  Water/Ice/Steam.  Carbon/Diamond.  Submarines(underwater)/Hot-air-balloon(in flight).  Consider even 'inside an atom'. 
* Really serious content review...  Find and fix statements like &quot;Gas particles do not have a fixed shape so you can safely bend them and they won't even break.&quot;  Please.  
* Echoing the comments on this page about 'level': cover other simple topics like what happens when salt dissolves?  How can I separate salt, sawdust, sand and iron filings?  How big is an atom?  Why do they put salt on roads?  Brownian motion is a more advanced topic, so to me the book seems seriously incomplete for its (apparent) intended level.

[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 16:39, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

**Hm... that sounds like the easy part. :)
**I think Pi zero will handle that part.
**'''What happens when salt dissolves''': I do not see why that is more 'simple' than the info stated here. One must have a basic understanding of the particle theory to explain that. '''How can I separate salt, sawdust, sand and iron filings''' and '''Why do they put salt on roads''': Er, how is that supposed to be related to particles? (I didn't even know the put salt on roads. :P) '''How big is an atom''': I do not intend to mention atoms and molecules in the book, as it may complicate matters. '''Brownian motion is a more advanced topic''': Actually no, I don't think it's an advanced topic. In fact, I think it's quite a basic concept related to particles.

* &quot;Particles are infinitesimal, and current scientific instruments cannot see them&quot;.  If you mean ''atoms'' then they do have size and individual Xenon atoms can be seen with a [[wikipedia:Atomic_force_microscopy#Identification of individual surface atoms|Atomic Force Microscope]].  Please fix.  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 20:09, 12 November 2010 (UTC)

* The book is called 'Particles'.  It looks like a kind of wikijunior introduction to chemistry and states of matter, in which case giving some notion of the difference between a mixture and a compound is called for.  In this sentence &quot;In solids, the particles are cramped together tightly in regular positions&quot;  I can only think the particles you are talking about there are atoms.  But children have heard of particles of dirt, particles of sand, particles of sawdust.  Either you have to tell them that those are not the kinds of particles you mean, and if you do you might as well mention atoms, or you have to be talking about those kinds of particles too.  Those two points at any rate should partially explain my comments about sand and iron filings.  Clearer?  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 20:09, 12 November 2010 (UTC)

:I think the readers should understand that by 'infinitesimal' I mean 'extremely small', not literally infinitely small, which of course is impossible to reach. :) If there is a highly advanced microscope that can see some sort of particles, I don't think I will include this in the book, for the same reason why teachers tell small kids that lines are what you draw with rulers instead of an infinite set of points extending in either direction.
:About the scope of the book, this is what the message I intended to bring out is that stuff are made of particles according to the particle theory, (assuming that the reader has no previous knowledge of atoms whatsoever), which can explain things with the particle model. It's not intended to be an introduction to chemistry. About the word 'particles', I'm ready to hear your opinion and/or [[WB:BOLD|bold]] fixes. How do you think you could explain to kids about 'heights' and 'altitudes' of triangles, the 'foci' of an ellipse, etc? [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

:: Avoid the word &quot;infinitesimal&quot; when discussing particles unless you really mean &quot;infinitely small&quot;.  The concept of point particles is quite important in the history of theoretical physics, and so the word should not be used unless that's really what is meant.  Besides, &quot;infinitesimal&quot; is going to increase your [[w:Gunning fog index|Gunning fog index]]&amp;nbsp;:-).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:38, 13 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== two finite and different critical points ==

Hi,

I'm not sure if it is what you wanted, but here are [http://www.ijon.de/mathe/julia/some_julia_sets_1_en.html non-standard examples of Julia set made with IIM/J]. What do you think about it ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 15:23, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

:These pictures look nice - white on black background - and the creator gives interesting information. But the pictures do not bear witness of a completely developed drawing technique. The creator talks about fixed points, why not cycles? Are the pictures drawn simply by examining if the sequence of iteration converges to a fixed point? By examining 100 points for each pixel, it is really possible to make such pretty pictures in this way - but very time-consuming. Besides, they are drawn without using a Mandelbrot set. Therefore they have a &quot;casual&quot; look. I have drawn some of these pictures using different colour scales for different Fatou domains and lighting effect, and it is such pictures I advertise for.

==Explaining Flaws in Conventional Renderings==

I'm trying to be consistent by having conventional image on left, improved image on right. Also trying to make it clearer what pronouns refer to by replacing them by phrases.--[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 21:59, 6 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

Firearms and other weapon offences is set out in Part III of the Criminal Code.

Lawful possession of firearms is governed by the ''Firearms Act''.

On April 5, 2012, the Long-Gun Registry was eliminated removing the requirement that non-restricted firearms be registered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Organizations Case Report: Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP)/ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview/History==
The Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention has undergone several name changes since its inception in 1997, most recently in 2002 the ODCCP changed its name to its current name, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  For purposes of this case study the ODCCP will be refereed to as UNODC.  The mission of UNODC revolves around &quot;the three pillars of the UNODC work programme.&quot;

# Research and analysis to enhance understanding of crime and drug issues and provide useful data for policy makers.
# Assist member states in ratification and implementation of international treaties and assist with local law procedures related to drugs, crime, and terrorism.
# Provide useful field based assistance to member states to reduce drugs, crime, and terrorism.

The official mandate of UNDOC is to assist member states in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime, and terrorism.  At the center of UNODC's mission is reform of the criminal justice system to bring about a system that is more effective and humane.
UNODC is headquartered in Vienna, Austria and based in the Vienna International Center which opened in January 1, 1980.  This is also the base of operations for the United Nations of Vienna (UNOV).  UNOV is the third largest headquarters of the UN behind New York City and Geneva, Switzerland of the four worldwide headquarters.  UNODC employs almost five hundred workers in Vienna, its 23 worldwide field offices, and at the UN offices in New York.  The membership of the UNODC is comprised of member states that make up the UN.  

The Executive Director of UNODC is Antonio Maria Costa of Italy, who also serves as the Director-General of UNOV. Director Costa has placed special emphasis on organized crime as a threat to global security and democratic stability in UNODC's mission to diminish drugs, crime, and terrorism worldwide.  In Costa's remarks on the 2010 World Drug Report he stated &quot;strengthen integrity tackles the corruption that enables crime.  Promoting justice prevents criminals from operating with impunity.  Improving health prevents the spread of drug addiction and blood-borne diseases-particularly in the developing world.  And cutting criminal networks disrupts a range of illicit activities that carve out paths of death and destruction through some of the worlds most fragile regions.&quot;

Recently, UNODC's Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice met in Vienna from May 17 to May 21, 2010 to discuss new criminal justice challenges around the world.  Among the new emerging threats discussed were the problems of cybercrime, trafficking in cultural artifacts, and treatment of female prisoners.  The commission put forward two resolutions to strengthen UNODC work with &quot;public-private partnerships to counter crime&quot; and efforts to curb human trafficking, piracy off the coast of Somalia, and form networks of cooperation.  The second resolution calls for greater cooperation to curb criminal activity at the South Korean hosted 2011 World Summit of Prosecutors General, Attorneys General, and Chief Prosecutors.

==Local Significance==
The local significance of UNODC being located in Vienna, Austria is recognition of Vienna's importance as a world capital.  Stability and an understanding of humanitarian issues provide an environment and location suitable for the mission of UNODC.  While crime recently has been on the rise in Austria, overall crime occurs at a low rate in comparison to many counties.  Much of Austria's crimes are crimes of opportunity, for example pick pocketing or theft of personal property.  Violent crime, organized crime and terrorist activity remain at some of the lowest levels in Europe.  Also, the training, expertise, and effectiveness of Austria's police force compares favorably to police departments in large US cities.  These factors contribute to the image of Vienna as a place where global crime and drug issues can be discussed and global projects aimed at real solutions can be launched.

The Czech Republic also has a fairly low overall rate of crime.  Petty theft crimes are the most frequently encountered crimes and are focused on key tourist areas of Prague such as Wenceslas Square, the Charles Bridge, and Old Town Square with pick pocketing rings operating with a high degree of skill and coordination.  The drug trade in the Czech Republic is more of a problem then in Austria due to several factors including lower capability of monitoring money laundering, a central location for drug running, and fairly light penalties for drug crimes.

==Global Impact and Significance==
UNODC currently has at least eight major areas of focus that have a global impact and fulfill its UN mandate.  The eight areas of UNODC focus are money laundering, organized crime, piracy, drug control &amp; treatment, corruption, terrorism, trafficking in persons, and reform of criminal justice systems &amp; prisons.

In May of 2009, UNODC launched an anti-piracy campaign providing assistance to Kenya, The Seychelles, and Tanzania.  The program laid out legal frameworks to handover and prosecute piracy suspects many of which are currently housed in Kenyan prisons.  The burden of piracy in Kenya has been eased through UNODC support for Kenyan law enforcement and increased court facilities, while improving prison conditions in Mombasa' ''Shimo La Tena'' Prison.  UNODC is currently looking to build upon its work in East Africa and plans to extend its coverage to other countries in the region including Somalia.

Organized crime and its transnational impact are regarded by UNODC as one of the main threats to &quot;human security, impeding the social, economic, political and cultural development of societies worldwide.&quot;  UNODC assists member states by creating new frameworks and improved domestic legislation to cooperatively combat organized crime.  Enhancing law enforcement capability through training and technical expertise, cooperation with legal assistance allows for uniformity of enforcement.  For example, faster and easier extradition of organized crime members.  The Treaty of UN Conventions Against Transnational Organized Crime set up a framework in 2003 to combat organized crime.  The treaty not only allows for greater cooperation, but produces a free flow of information between international law enforcement agencies and analyzes new organized crime trends.

Another key issue for UNODC is Human Trafficking often a component of organized crime.  A 2009 UNODC Global Report on Human Trafficking found data hard to compile with inadequate reporting in many counties, however the study did shed some light on some statistical evidence.  Seventy-nine percent of human trafficking according to the report was for sexual exploitation with forced labor involving eighteen percent.  Women made up between 80 to 84 % of the victims.  Another finding of the report was that although the number of convictions for human trafficking is on the rise it is not keeping pace with the scale of the growing trade.  Many developing countries still lack the legal infrastructure and capability to address human trafficking and this is one example why UNODC has a significant role to play in the world today.

UNODC's program in East Africa to combat terrorism was launched in 2003.  Kenya and Tanzania have been the site of terrorist attacks in 1998 at the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and again in 2002 in Mombasa with the attempted shoot down of a civilian aircraft.  The program aims at providing counter-terrorism technology to prevent further attacks.  UNODC also provides training to law enforcement and elected officials to form a framework to deal with the regional threat of terrorism.

Reform of criminal justice systems and prisons are key components of UNODC.  Fair legal systems and protection of human rights based on the rule of law are essential aspects of criminal justice systems and the implementation of standards.  These endeavors will stabilize countries in conflict and UNODC works in developing countries to improve training and skills.  

The illicit drug trade is one of the most significant barriers to global security and prosperity.  UNODC recognizes many of the shortfalls of drug control however does not support the growing movement towards ''legalize and tax'' which it dismisses as overly simplistic.  UNODC urges governmental action in the direction away from punishing the user and onto treatment of the user with greater enforcement aimed at the drug runners.  By governments fine tuning their policies and focusing controls on crime and promoting health access to drug addicts the problem may eventually show signs of success.  One example of a UNODC project is that of Alternative Development.  Six countries currently (Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Lao, Myanmar, and Peru) participate in a program to provide rural farmers with legal alternatives to such crops as marijuana, popy, cocoa, etc.  The goal is to provide impoverished areas of the world with real economically sustainable crops to harvest.

Money is usually at the heart of all criminal activity.  From drug smugglers to terrorist organizations, funds are necessary to further operations but also ways of concealing money from law enforcement officials often takes the form of money laundering.  Money laundering often promotes corruption and when public officials engage in corruption , the publics trust is broken.  One of UNODC's primary goals is to interrupt and break the cycle of money laundering by strengthening financial institutions making them less susceptible to &quot;dirty money&quot;.

Going hand in hand with UNODC's money laundering campaign is an effort to combat corruption at all levels.  For example, UNODC's program in East Africa provides accounting computer software technology to track corruption in Ethiopia, Maritious, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, and Southern Sudan.  The objective of UNODC is to enhance integrity both in the public and private sectors by creating greater transparency and accountability.


== Summary ==

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is an institution of growing importance around the world as criminal activity becomes more of a cross border problem. The need for an organization to fill in the gaps becomes more apparent.  UNODC's many missions launched from its Vienna, Austria headquarters adds to the image of Vienna as a global capital and a leader in the effort to make the world a more stable and prosperous place to live.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Lymphocyte Predominant'''&lt;/big&gt;

*Lymphocyte-predominant has a different natural history (especially stages I-II) and response to therapy than classical HL. 
*Chemo is not indicated in most early stage cases, and standard is IFRT.
*LP has best prognosis of HL subtypes, but late recurrences common and long-term followup necessary.

==NCCN Guidelines==
*Stage I-IIA: IFRT or regional RT
*Stage I-IIB w/ B sx's: chemotherapy followed by IFRT
*Stage III-IVA: chemotherapy +/- RT –OR— observation (cat 2B) –OR— local RT (palliation only)  or rituximab
*Stage III-IVB: chemotherapy +/- RT or rituximab +/- chemo +/- RT

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Secure Hash Algorithm SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), based on the MD4 (Message Digest) algorithm created by Ronald L. Rivest of the MIT. Consists in three SHA distinct algorithms labeled SHA-0, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

SHA-1 was considered a cryptographically secure one-way hash algorithm (some weaknesses have already been found). It was designed by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), along with the NSA (National Security Agency), see the [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm Secure Hash Standard FIPS 180-1].

Loglan has a set of numbers composed of 10 little words which represent a single digit each:

* 0 - ni
* 1 - ne
* 2 - to
* 3 - te
* 4 - fo
* 5 - fe
* 6 - so
* 7 - se
* 8 - vo
* 9 - ve

All odd numbers end in ''e'' and all even numbers end in ''o''. You can form larger numbers though combining words in the same way we combine digits. 

=== Examples ===

* 10 - neni
* 123 - netote

== Sequences ==

You can add ''fi'' on to the end of a number to describe a sequence such as ''first, second, third''.

=== Examples ===

* Nefi - first
* tofi - second
* tefi - third

== Letters ==

Loglan has away to refer to each letter. You might want to do this when using letters as variables. You just need to add an ending to the letter depending on weather you use a Latin of Greek letter, vowel or consonant. NB Loglan does not use the letter '''c''' or '''w''' for Greek letters as Greek has no corresponding sounds (c = ''sh'' and w = ''eu'' in Loglan).

* -ei for lower case Latin consonant letters
* -si for lower case Latin vowel letters
* -ai for upper case Latin consonant letters
* -ma for upper case Latin vowel letters

* -eo for lower case Greek consonant letters
* gao- for upper case Greek consonant letters 
* -fi for lower case vowel letters
* gao,- for upper case Greek vowel letters 

=== Examples ===

* A - Ama
* a - asi
* B - Bai
* b - bei

* Alpha - gao,afi
* alpha - afi
* Beta - gaobeo
* beta - beo

{{Quotation|
344. (1) Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
:(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of
::(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and
::(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;
:(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and
:(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.&lt;br&gt;
'''Subsequent offences'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), whether a convicted person has committed a second or subsequent offence, if the person was earlier convicted of any of the following offences, that offence is to be considered as an earlier offence:
:(a) an offence under this section;
:(b) an offence under subsection 85(1) or (2) or section 244 or 244.2; or
:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 239, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1 or 346 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence.&lt;br&gt;
However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.
&lt;br&gt;

98.1 Every person who commits a robbery within the meaning of section 343 with intent to steal a firearm or in the course of which he or she steals a firearm commits an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.
&lt;br&gt;

2008, c. 6, s. 9.
|[http://canlii.ca/7vf2#sec98.1 CCC]
}}
==Application==
===Principles===
In most provinces the case law has set the starting point for robbery in general start at 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnas (1982), 32 C.R. (3d) l (Alta. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence is adjusted from that starting point either up or down based on the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the accused. The normal range is in excess of 2 years.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Wozny, 2010 MBCA 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In Manitoba, there is no starting point for robberies.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sorensen, 2006 MBCA 38 at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, The starting point for a mugging robbery is 12 to 18 months.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Nerling, 2011 ABPC 371 (CanLII) at 6&lt;br&gt;
R v Carter, [1992] AJ No 561 (CA) (no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;br&gt;
R v Nyland, [1991] AJ No 1136 (CA)(no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;Br&gt;
R v Saeed, 2004 ABCA 385, 357 AR 238 (no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Robberies involving stabbings are frequently in the four to five years range.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Biln, 1999 BCCA 369 (CanLII), 1999 BCCA 369&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most robberies and break and enters, the primary focus is deterrence and denunciation, thus, characteristics of the offender may be of limited to no relevance.

In Alberta, the starting point for robbery of a bank by use of a note is 4 years incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brennan [2003] A.J. No. 1366 (Alta. C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jenkins, 2004 ABPC 48&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Earl, [1985] A.J. No. 168&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Trudell, [1984] A.J. No. 932&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Hung (1990), 113 A.R. 205, [1990] A.J. No. 1074 (QL) (Alta. C.A.), at 214: &quot;the starting‑point for any sentence involving robbery of a financial institution is five years in the penitentiary&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Nova Scotia, financial institution robberies are in the range of 6 to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;R v Leet (1989) 88 NSR (2d) 161 per Chipman&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rare cases, robberies can include suspended sentences.&lt;Ref&gt;
see  R. v. Carver, [1980] M.J. No. 257 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ramsay, [1985] M.J. No. 417 (C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bartlett, [1961] M.J. No. 2 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
====Home Invasion====
The term “home invasion” can be applied to wide range of offences and so can be misleading to assume they are all similar cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. A.J.C.; R. v. Joseph, 2004 BCCA 268 (CanLII) at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta has required a '''home invasion''' is a robbery to include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Matwiy, [1996] A.J. No. 134 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# plan to commit robbery in a home where offender expects to be found in dwelling
# arms self with weapon
# enters dwelling that is reasonably known to be occupied
# confines occupants 
# threaten occupants
# steals money or valuable property

In Nova Scotia, private dwelling robberies are in the range of 6 to 10 years. &lt;ref&gt;R v Leet (1989) 88 NSR (2d) 161 per Chipman&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, the range of sentence for home invasions involving serious violence is 8 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;R v DAW, [2002] BCJ 1156 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Newfoundland,the &quot;low end&quot; of the acceptable range is 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. P.J.B., [http://canlii.ca/t/27prb 1999 CanLII 18938] (NL CA), (1999), 182 Nfld. and P.E.I.R. 14 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

= Break and Enter =
==Legislation==
{{quotation|
348. (1) Every one who
:(a) breaks and enters a place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
:(b) breaks and enters a place and commits an indictable offence therein, or
:(c) breaks out of a place after
::(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or
::(ii) entering the place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
is guilty
:(d) if the offence is committed in relation to a dwelling-house, of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life, and
:(e) if the offence is committed in relation to a place other than a dwelling-house, of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Aggravating circumstance — home invasion'''&lt;br&gt;
348.1 If a person is convicted of an offence under section 98 or 98.1, subsection 279(2) or section 343, 346 or 348 in relation to a dwelling-house, the court imposing the sentence on the person shall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the dwelling-house was occupied at the time of the commission of the offence and that the person, in committing the offence,
:(a) knew that or was reckless as to whether the dwelling-house was occupied; and
:(b) used violence or threats of violence to a person or property.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec348 CCC]
}}

==Application==

A first-time offender of good character who is charged with Break and Enter and where the offence is of a low-end nature (e.g. single incident, low value of property, property recovered), a suspended sentence may be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Davenport [1977], 1 W.C.B. 176 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, there are multiple incidents, a custodial sentence is the usual punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, [1981] O.J. No. 140 (C.A.) -- 9 months concurrent&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Aggravating '''
* whether it was a private dwelling rather than a commercial building;
* extent of planning and sophistication
* the building was occupied at the time;
* the offender was aware or reckless to whether it was occupied;
* used violence or threats of violence to a person or property
* damage to property

The maximum penalty for Break and Enter on a dwelling house is life. The maximum penalty for Break and Enter on a premises other than a dwelling house is 10 year on indictable election and 6 months on summary election.

Certain provinces have set a benchmark for residential B&amp;E's at 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McAllister, 
[http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2008/2008nsca103/2008nsca103.html 2008 NSCA 103]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Home Invasion===
In Newfoundland, courts have suggested that a range of break and enter into dwellings is between 12 and 36 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Walbourne, [2012] N.J. No. 171 (P.C.), per Judge Orr &lt;/ref&gt;

For which values of &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; does this system 
have a unique solution?

&amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;z  &amp;-  &amp;w  &amp;=  &amp;2
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Answer:

When is the determinant not zero?

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
1  &amp;0  &amp;k  &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1
\end{vmatrix}
=
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;k-1&amp;1   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1
\end{vmatrix}           
&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, 
&lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; gives nonsingularity and hence a nonzero determinant. 
If &lt;math&gt;k\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; then 
we get echelon form with a &lt;math&gt;(-1/k-1)\rho_3+\rho_4&lt;/math&gt; pivot.

:&lt;math&gt;
=
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;k-1&amp;1   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;-1-(1/k-1)
\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying down the diagonal gives &lt;math&gt;(k-1)(-1-(1/k-1))=-(k-1)-1=-k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and so the system has a unique solution, if and only if &lt;math&gt; k\neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

A upper-triangular matrix is in echelon form.

A lower-triangular matrix is either singular or nonsingular. If it is singular then it has a zero on its diagonal and so its determinant (namely, zero) is indeed the product down its diagonal. If it is nonsingular then it has no zeroes on its diagonal, and can be reduced by Gauss' method to echelon form without changing the diagonal.

;Answer:

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The properties in the definition of determinant 
show that 
&lt;math&gt; \left|M_i(k)\right|=k &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; \left|P_{i,j}\right|=-1 &lt;/math&gt;,
and
&lt;math&gt; \left|C_{i,j}(k)\right|=1 &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; The three cases are easy to check by recalling the action
of left multiplication by each type of matrix.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; is invertible &lt;math&gt; (TS)M=I &lt;/math&gt; then
the associative property of matrix multiplication 
&lt;math&gt; T(SM)=I &lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is invertible.
So if &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is not invertible then neither is &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is singular then apply the prior answer:

&lt;math&gt; \left|T\right|\cdot\left|S\right|=0\cdot\left|S\right|=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is not singular then it can be written as a product of
elementary matrices

\left|TS\right|=\left|E_r\cdots E_1S\right|=

&lt;li&gt; We must show that if

T\xrightarrow[]{k\rho_i+\rho_j}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;d(T)=\left|TS\right|/\left|S\right|
=\left|\hat{T}S\right|/\left|S\right|=d(\hat{T})&lt;/math&gt;.
We will be done if we show that pivoting first and
then multiplying to get &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
multiplying first to get &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; and then pivoting
(because the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; is unaffected by the
pivot so we'll then have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;, and
hence &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
That argument runs: after adding 
&lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; times row &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; to
row &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt; j,p &lt;/math&gt; entry is
&lt;math&gt; (kt_{i,1}+t_{j,1})s_{1,p}+\dots+(kt_{i,r}+t_{j,r})s_{r,p} &lt;/math&gt;,
which is the &lt;math&gt; j,p &lt;/math&gt; entry of &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; We need only show that swapping
&lt;math&gt;
T[b]{\xrightarrow[]{\rho_i\leftrightarrow\rho_j}}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then multiplying to get &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
multiplying &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; and then swapping (because,
as the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; changes sign on
the row swap, we'll then have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=-\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=-d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
That argument runs just like the prior one.
&lt;li&gt; Not surprisingly by now, we need only show that 
multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar
&lt;math&gt;
T[b]{\xrightarrow[]{k\rho_i}}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then computing &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
first computing &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; and then multiplying the row by &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;
(as the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; is rescaled by &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;
the multiplication, we'll have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=k\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;,
so &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=k\,d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
The argument runs just as above.
&lt;li&gt; Clear.
&lt;li&gt; Because we've shown that &lt;math&gt; d(T) &lt;/math&gt; is a determinant
and that determinant functions (if they exist) are
unique, we have that
so &lt;math&gt; \left|T\right|=d(T)=\left|TS\right|/\left|S\right| &lt;/math&gt;.

Prove that for any square matrix,
the rank of the matrix is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the largest
integer such that there is an &lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt; submatrix with a nonzero
determinant.
;Answer:

We will first argue that a rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; matrix has a &lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt;
submatrix with nonzero determinant.
A rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; matrix has a linearly independent set of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; rows.
A matrix made from those rows will have row rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; and thus has
column rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;.
Conclusion: from those &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; rows can be extracted a linearly
independent set of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; columns, and so the original matrix has a
&lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt; submatrix of rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;.

We finish by showing that if &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the largest such integer then the rank of the matrix is &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;. We need only show, by the maximality of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;, that if a matrix has a &lt;math&gt; k \! \times \! k &lt;/math&gt; submatrix of nonzero determinant then the rank of the matrix is at least &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;. Consider such a &lt;math&gt; k \! \times \! k &lt;/math&gt; submatrix. Its rows are parts of the rows of the original matrix, clearly the set of whole rows is linearly independent. Thus the row rank of the original matrix is at least &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;, and the row rank of a matrix equals its rank.

;Problem 16:
Prove that a matrix with rational entries has a rational determinant.
;Answer:

A matrix with only rational entries can be reduced with Gauss' method to an echelon form matrix using only rational arithmetic. Thus the entries on the diagonal must be rationals, and so the product down the diagonal is rational.

;Answer:

''This is how the answer was given in the cited source.''

The value &lt;math&gt; (1-a^4)^3 &lt;/math&gt; of the determinant is independent of the values &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;. Hence operation (e) does not change the value of the determinant but merely changes its appearance. Thus the element of likeness in (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) is only that the appearance of the principle entity is changed. The same element appears in (f) changing the name-label of a rose, (g) writing a decimal integer in the scale of &lt;math&gt; 12 &lt;/math&gt;, (h) gilding the lily, (i) whitewashing a politician, and (j) granting an honorary degree.

Embroidery is the art or handicraft of decorating fabric or other materials with needle and thread. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills, and sequins.

The basic stitches used in embroidery are chain stitch, buttonhole or blanket stitch, running stitch, satin stitch, and cross stitch.  These stitches have been used since ancient times and are still the foundation of hand embroidery today.

Machine embroidery immitates hand embroidery, especially in the use of chain stitches, but the &quot;satin stitch&quot; and hemming stitches of machine work rely on the use of multiple threads and resemble hand work in their appearance, not their construction.

==Stitches==

Embroidery stitches are the smallest units in embroidery. Embroidery patterns are formed by doing many embroidery stitches, either all the same or different ones, either following a counting chart on paper, following a design painted on the fabric or even working freehand.

Embroidery uses various combinations of stitches. Each embroidery stitch has a special name to help identify it. These names vary from country to country and region to region. Some embroidery books will include name variations. Taken by themselves the stitches are mostly simple to execute, however when put together the results can be extremely complex.

===Straight stitches===

Straight stitches pass through the fabric ground in a simple up and down motion, and for the most part moving in a single direction. 

[[File:Running stitch.gif|center|thumb|Running or basting stitch]]

Examples of straight stitches are:

* Running or basting stitch 
* Simple satin stitch 
* Algerian eye stitch 
* Fern stitch 

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some straight stitches have two journeys (generally forwards and backwards over the same path). These include:

* Holbein stitch, also known as the double running stitch 
* Bosnian stitch

===Back stitches===

Back stitches pass through the fabric ground in an encircling motion. The needle in the simplest backstitch comes up from the back of the fabric, makes a stitch to the right going back to the back of the fabric, then passes behind the first stitch and comes up to the front of the fabric to the left of the first stitch. The needle then goes back to the back of the fabric through the same hole the stitch first came up from. The needle then repeats the movement to the left of the stitches and continues. 

[[Image:Backstitch1.png|center|Stitch diagram for working Back stitch]]

Some examples of a back stitch are:

* Stem stitch or outline stitch 
* Split stitch. The needle pierces the thread as it come back up. 
* Crewel stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Chain stitches===

Chain stitches catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric. In the simplest of the looped stitches, the chain stitch, the needle comes up from the back of the fabric and then the needle goes back into the same hole it came out of, pulling the loop of thread almost completely through to the back; but before the loop disappears, the needle come back up (a certain distance from the beginning stitch -the distance deciding the length of the stitch), passes through the loop and prevents it from being pulled completely to the back of the fabric. The needle then passes back to the back of the fabric through the second hole and begins the stitch again. Examples of chain stitches are:

* Chain stitch 
* Lazy Daisy stitch, or detached chain. The loop stitch is held to the fabric at the wide end by a tiny tacking stitch. 
* Spanish Chain or Zig-zag Chain

Image:Zig zag chain stitch.jpg|Zig-zag chain stitch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Buttonhole stitches===

Buttonhole or blanket stitches also catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric but the principle difference is that the needle does not return to the original hole to pass back to the back of the fabric. In the classic buttonhole stitch the needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The finished stitch in some ways resembles a letter &quot;L&quot; depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric. This stitch is also the basis for many forms of needle lace. Examples of Buttonhole or Blanket Stitches.

* Blanket stitch 
* Buttonhole stitch 
* Closed Buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch touch to form triangles 
* Crossed Buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch cross 
* Buttonhole stitches combined with knots: 
* Top Knotted Buttonhole stitch 
* German Knotted Buttonhole stitch 
* Tailor's Buttonhole stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Feather stitches===

Feather or fly stitches also catch a loop of thread on the surface of the fabric but they differ from buttonhole stitches in that the catching of the loop is not at right angles or it alternates from side to side. The result is a very naturalistic looking stitch that is often used to make leaves and branches. Examples of fly stitches are:

* Fly stitch, or Y stitch 
* Feather stitch 
* Faggoting stitch, or Straight Open Cretan 
* Cretan Stitch

Image:Chained feather stitch.gif|Chained featherstitch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cross stitches===

Cross stitches or cross-stitch have come to represent an entire industry of pattern production and material supply for the craft person. The stitch is done by creating a line of diagonal stitches going in one direction, usually using the warp and weft of the fabric as a guide, then on the return journey crossing the diagonal in the other direction, creating an &quot;x&quot;. Also included in this class of stitches are:

* Herringbone stitches, including the hem stitch 
* Breton stitch, here the threads of the &quot;x&quot; are twisted together 
* Sprat's Head stitch 
* Crow's Foot stitch, these last two stitches are often used in tailoring to strengthen a garment at a point of strain such as a pocket corner or the top of a kick pleat.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Knotted stitches===

Knotted stitches are formed by wrapping the thread around the needle, once or several times, before passing it back to the back of the fabric ground. This is a predominate stitch in Brazilian embroidery, used to create flowers. Another form of embroidery that uses knots is Candlewicking, where the knots are created by forming a figure 8 around the needle. Examples of knotted stitches are:

* French knot, or twisted knot stitch 
* Chinese knot, which varies from the French knot in that it takes a tiny stitch in the background fabric while creating the knot 
* Bullion knots 
* Coral stitch 
* Four-legged knot stitch 
* Turk's head knot 

There are also more complex knotted stitches such as: 
* Double-knot stitch
* Knotted Loop stitch 
* Plaited Braid stitch 
* Sorbello stitch 
* Diamond stitch 

Knotted edgings based on buttonhole stitches include: 
* Antwerp edging stitch 
* Armenian edging stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Couching and laid work===

Couching or laid stitches involve two sets of threads, the set that is being 'laid' onto the surface of the fabric and the set which attach the laid threads. The laid threads may be heavier than the attaching thread, or they may be of a nature that does not allow them to be worked like a regular embroidery thread, such as metal threads. The stitches used to attach the laid thread may be of any nature; cross stitch, buttonhole stitch, straight stitch; but some have specific names:

* Pendant couching 
* Bokhara couching 
* Square laid work 
* Oriental couching 
* Battlement couching 
* Klosterstitch 
* Roumanian couching

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Technique==
Basically, there are two ways to do embroidery efficiently and orderly. What works better depends on the stitches and materials used, and on personal preference.

===Hand-sewing method===
The needle is brought to the upside of the fabric. For doing the stitch properly, it is inserted into the fabric and brought back to the surface in one movement. Then the thread is pulled through. The same method is used for plain hand sewing.

A thimble is usually used on the middle finger to avoid minor injury. Once the needle is inserted into the fabric, the hooded middle finger is used to push it through; the thumb and index finger grab the needle at the front as soon as possible and pull at the same time. This can speed up working when the embroiderer is used to it.

This method can be done using an embroidery frame or free-hand, but usually an embroidery frame or hoop is used to make work easier. The technique uses frames that allow for adjustment of fabric tension, as the fabric can't be too strongly stretched. in order to allow inserting the needle without pulling the fabric too much.

===Stab method or Maggam work===

This method is popular in India.

The needle is inserted into the fabric at a 90 degree angle, then the thread is pulled through. Then, the needle is again inserted, this time from the underside to the surface; again, the thread is pulled through.

A thimble is not usually required to avoid injury with this method, but is sometimes used to make pushing the needle through easier.

A frame or hoop is used. A mounted hoop or frame makes the work faster, such that both hands are free for the embroidery. The dominant hand is held under the fabric, the non-dominant hand above it, and the needle is handled by each respective hand without necessity for hand position changes.

If you think too much about how novels are written they may lose some of their magic.
As a frequent reader of novels you might want to stop reading this guide here.
A reviewer should find this guide helpful but the primary target audience are beginning authors or authors who want to reconsider the design phase of their novels.
The book also tries to offer criteria for evaluation.

== Chapters==
{{Rquote|right|Novel-reading is the worst thing for children, since they can make no further use of it, and it merely affords them entertainment for the moment. Novel-reading weakens the memory. For it would be ridiculous to remember novels in order to relate them to others. Therefore all novels should be taken away from children. Whilst reading them they weave, as it were, an inner romance of their own, rearranging the circumstances for themselves; their fancy is thus imprisoned, but there is no exercise of thought.|On education&lt;ref name=&quot;On_Education&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Immanuel |last=Kant |origyear=Compiled 1803 by Theodor Rink |others=trans.

      <comment>Add best way to type Vietnamese as people in Vietnam</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To type the consonants, you can use a standard keyboard. It is possible to type the accents on the vowels in Microsoft Office Word 2007; however, it is time-consuming. The accents can be typed by using the symbol function.

Step 1: Type the vowel that needs the accent. Make certain that the cursor is behind the vowel that needs the accent.

Step 2: Click on the Insert tab on the tool bar.

Step 3: Click on the Symbol button on the right-hand side. It looks like an upside-down horseshoe.

Step 4: The symbol dialogue box will appear. It will have two tabs. They will say Symbols and Special Characters.

Step 5: On the Symbols page there is a drop down menu under font. Select VNI-Times.

Step 6: Choose the correct accent and click the insert button at the bottom of the box. The accent will appear over the vowel in the text.

{{BookCat}}

If you want to type Vietnamese easily, You can download the Vietnamese-type software. The best one is Unikey. Almost people in Vietnamese use this software to type Vietnamese.
You can download here : http://www.unikey.org/
 And you can choose Unicode font, so you must not install any font to type Vietnamese correctly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview/Statisical Background'''==

This chapter looks at sustainable development and environmental degradation in the countries of Austria and the Czech Republic.  The sources for this chapter include government reports, government databases, personal experiences from ten days of travel within the region, news articles, information provided by non-governmental organizations (NGO's), and international inter-governmental organizations (IGO's).  Some of the various topics that will be explored relating to Austria and the Czech Republic will be land development, transportation, energy usage, industrial development, water quality and the importance of the Danube River.  Also how a planned system of growth has provided a high quality of life rating for cities like Vienna, Austria. 
 
One of the key factors while looking at sustainable development and environmental degradation within any country is the size of the population and the size of the country in square kilometers in relation to how quickly the annual population growth rate is expanding.  This mathematical formula contributes greatly to the understanding of the urgency of sustainable development and its ultimate success or failure. It is important to understand the global implications of a world population which as of June 24, 2010, according to the US Census Bureau was estimated at 6,829,330,046.  With a global population soon to exceed the 7 billion mark, it is crucial that we develop strategies that are effective in creating an environment where humans can flourish and the planet's resources are not destroyed.  By studying Austria and the Czech Republic and their actions or lack of action, we can learn from some of their initiatives in trying to create a more sustainable way of life globablly.

The Czech Republic has an estimated population of 10.3 million people within its 78,864 square kilometer borders (roughly the size of the State of Virginia in the US) and has an annual population growth rate of just 0.1%, according to the US Department of State.  The largest city in the Czech Republic is Prague, its capital city with a population of approximately 1.21 million people.  Austria, by comparison, is slightly larger in terms of size in square kilometers; however, has a lower population of 8,332,000, and a higher annual population growth rate of 0.4%.  Austria's largest city is Vienna, the capital city with a population of 1.68 million people, according to the US Department of State.  Both countries have a fairly modest population growth rate, which combined with a heightened public awareness of sustainable development, provides a much brighter future for the region than the rapid urbanization that is taking place in many still developing countries. 

=='''Land Usage/Development'''==


The other part of the sustainable development formula besides population growth is land usage.  The Czech Republic launched the National Strategic Rural Development Plan in 2007 with its goals being to stabilize rural populations and improve quality of life in rural towns.  73.6% of the total area of the Czech Republic falls under the category of rural land, while about one quarter of the population reside in these areas.  The Czech Government realizing one of the greatest risks to rural development is the loss of young people who tend to migrate toward urban areas where jobs have traditionally been available has funded programs to open opportunities for young people in rural areas.  In terms of agricultrual land development, about half the country is utilized for this purpose with the size of agricultrual land decreasing every year.  Forested lands surprisingly are on the increase in the Czech Republic with approximately one third falling under this land use category.

Industrial development in the Czech Republic has soared since the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; of 1989 and the freedom that followed many years of communist planned economies.  At one point in the Czech Republics free market embrace it was the fastest growing economy in Europe and one of the worlds most dynamic economies only lagging behind China and South Korea in terms of expansion.  This became somewhat of a double edged sword with growth on one side and all of the social and evironmental issues on the other.  It seems as though rapid expansion and all of the issues that go along with being a magnet country in Europe have lessened to a degree as the worlds economies have slowed.

In urban areas of the Czech Republic and Austria, one of the things that struck me, while in the region, was how well a balance has been found between development and preservation of cultural heritage.  Both countries capital cities of Prague and Vienna enjoy listings as world heritage sites in their historical city centers.  Recognition by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) considers these sites as having a universal value that transcends borders.  It has been a fine line between development and preservation that Austria and the Czech Republic have found in their city centers, adding to the draw of many international visitors.  Many of the historical features of the city centers have been preserved while adding into the modern fabric of these cities infrastructure for transportation, communication, and energy delivery.  City planning has been a tradition for many years in both countries, with an excellent example in Austria being the historic &quot;Ringstrasse&quot;, which began implementation in 1858.  These cultural heritage sites represent many forms of architectural design, including Gothic, Romanesque, Baroque, Neo-Classical, and Art Nouveau almost all well preserved.

Another great example of well planned sustainability in Vienna is how well green areas are worked into the cities design.  The &quot;Weinerwald&quot; or the Vienna Woods is a huge track of open space preserved for outdoor recreations, measuring 1,250 square kilometers.  This green area within the city consists of forest, vineyards, hiking trails, and bike paths.  The &quot;Prater&quot; is another type of park worked into Vienna's cultural fabric and is an easy retreat with many family attractions, including arcades, a giant ferris wheel, and &quot;beirgartens&quot;.  The &quot;Volksgarten&quot; or &quot;peoples garden&quot; is a third type of park within Vienna, much smaller in size but set aside for residents and visitors to relax among thousands of rose bushes.  On a typical day you might find people reading a book, relaxing, or just enjoying an opportunity to get away from typical city life for a moment.  One interesting green initiative was launched in 2006 called the Austrian National Cycling Strategy, which seeks to increase the use of bicycles as a means of transportation in Austria from 5% to 10% by the year 2015.

=='''Transportation'''==

The Czech Republic on December 8, 2004 implemented the Sustainable Development Strategy.  One of the key objectives focused on transportation of people and products.  The objectives laid out in this Government Resolution 1242 were: &quot; create conditions for ensuring a quality transport with focus on its economic, social and evironmental impacts within the framework of sustainable development principles, and lay realistic foundations to initiate changes in proportions among individual transport modes.&quot;  The Resolution called for improving railway systems through technological upgrades mainly by modernizing existing systems, improving and promoting water transportation corridors, as well as several initiatives to reduce harmful emissions.  Besides the bycycle transport initiative the Czech Government introduced a tax system that penalizes fuels that lead to pollution and promote clean energy usage that benefits the environment. 

Transportation planning in Vienna and Prague is based upon the principle that if clean, efficient, and well organized systems of Trams, buses, and subways are offered as an alternative to private vehicles there will be a long term sustainable benefit.  One of the many promoting factors of using public transportation in Vienna and Prague is that one ticket allows access to buses, subways, and trolleys.  In Vienna for example, which has one of the most efficient transportation systems in the world 35% of city trips are taken through public transportation versus 32% by automobile.  Austria has increased public transportation usage outside of city centers as well with higher percentage growth in the use of rail and bus lines for holiday travel.

The Austrian Transport Master Plan focused on more sustainable practices and called for spending of 45.000 million euros with a 2/3 share dedicated to railway infrastructure while 1/3 share set aside for traditional road work.  Austria similarly to The Czech Republic has instituted a tax structure that rewards green initiatives and penalizes CO2 emission polluters.  One interesting initiative samples air quality from monitored stations and when levels of emissions are high the speed limit for autos can be lowered to reduce output of CO2 gases.  Public awareness of green issues are supported by a National Car Free Day which has become one of the most successful public awareness campaigns in Austria.

=='''Energy Usage'''==

Interconnected with the issue of transportation is the topic of energy usage in a sustainable economy.  The Czech Republic has pushed for a complete overhaul of its energy sector while overcoming two unique hurdles to its economy.  First, the country moved from a communist regime that planned all aspects of its economy, to a free market economy all in the last twenty years.  The Czech Republic has also had to overcome its separation from Slovakia in the early 1990's.  The Government has put forward its three E's of its energy future 1) Energy security 2) Economic growth 3)Environmental sutainability.  The Czech Republic currently draws half of its energy needs from domestic sources of which coal provides the largest share at 40% of domestic output.  The second largest sector is natural gas at 22% with nuclear power providing 17% with a new reactor ''Temlin'' having been brought online in 2003.  The Czech Republic is now able to export electricity through its nuclear facilities and shows a promising trend for its economic growth.  Part of the energy sectors transformation has been to close some out dated coal fired power plants and replace them with more modern and cleaner facilities.  The Czech energy transformation has been further spurred on by participation in The European Union and has set goals for reform in line with EU standards.  Currently, the goal for 2010 is to achieve 8% of Czech energy requirements from renewable sources.

Austria has stressed &quot;eco-friendly&quot; initiatives for many years however recently a European Commission study released information that Austria is one of the least effective countries in reducing green house gas emissions.  The study detailed that Austria was unable to reduce its CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2008, it actually increased emissions by 9.6%.  Only Spain and Luxemborg were bigger polluters percentage wise, in the EU then Austria and according to the Kyoto Agreement were supposed to reduce emissions by 13%.  Green jobs in Austria are a popular issue with The Government investing 760 million Euros in a sustainable future.  Austria has set a much higher bar than the Czech Republic in terms of renwable energy with goals of 34% by the year 2020.  &quot;Eco-taxes&quot; are slated to be the engine in the push for sustainable and renewable energy sources. 

=='''Water Quality/The Importance Of The Danube River'''==

The Danube River is Europes lifeline with 83 million people in ten countries enjoying its benefits.  The European Commission &quot;recognizes the Danube as the single most important non-oceanic body of water in Europe.&quot;  Many of Europes most ecologically important areas rely on the Danube.  In Austria, the Danube provides a source of clean drinking water, a clean source of water to irragate crops, an alternative transportation system, a habitat for dynamic bio-diversity, and an area for many types of recreation.  In the last thirty years special emphisis has been placed on conservation of the Danube.  Many of the past conservation problems were created by the construction of dams and shipping channels which have cut off drainage routes and creating major problems with flooding in cities like Vienna.  

The Danube was once known as the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; however much of its length has now been turned brown because of poor engineering, deforestation, and farm pollutants.  The main contributors to Danube pollution are 50% farm related, 25% industrial waste, and 25% human related waste.  In Vienna as the Danube cuts through the city it is easy easy to spot some of the threats to Europes most vital lifeline.  From a vantage point in the cities hills four sections of the Danube are discernable, the canal section, the old Danube section, the new Danube section, and the lake section which is completely cut off from its natural flow.  Only the lake section retains its famous blue color, nevertheless many Viennese rely on the wealth of benefits provided by the Danube.

=='''Quality Of Life'''==

In a recently completed survey by Mercer (based in London,UK) of 221 world cities and their respective quality of life, found Vienna, Austria as the number one city to live.  Among the many considerations factored into Vienna's top ranking were issues related to transportation, housing, air pollution, public utilities, cultural venues, drinking water, and economic conditions.  Prague ranked a respectable 70th or in the top 1/3 of world cities.  Many of the issues related to sustainable development and environmental degradation contributed to the positive results for Austria's and the Czech Republic's capital cities.    

=='''Conclusion'''==

In conclusion, many of the key issues of sustainable development are interconnected and help to reinforce each other.  For example, in Vienna by improving transportation systems, energy usage declines, air quality is improved, urban sprawl is reduced, traffic congestion is eased, and the overall quality of life is vastly improved for residents and visitors alike.  Policies and awareness campaigns are most successful when a multi-faceted approach is taken towards sustainable development.  The return on investment in a sustainable way of life ensures that for many generations to come the same high qualitity of life is possible beyond Vienna and Prague.

Dear people who know more about Wikibooks categories than I do:  If you want to use both the Dewey Decimal and LC classification systems, wouldn't it be a good idea to include as categories the terms used [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Dewey_and_Library_of_Congress_subject_classification here], such as Manufacturing and Commerce?

:Frankly the DDC and LOC systems don't have much applicability to an electronic medium; we have no need to worry about shelving books back in the exact same spot on a physical bookshelf.  I'd rather do without them entirely, but I can't get enough input from others to go ahead and remove them. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:45, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
::I think controlled vocabulary identifiers are useful.  I use [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced PubMed] a lot because that's where all the secondary peer reviewed medical literature can easily be found, and I like their thesaurus-based expansion of terms which is made possible by controlled vocabulary identifiers in MeSH. Thomson-Reuters' &quot;Web of Science&quot; (formerly ISI's Science Citation Index) also uses controlled vocabulary identifiers along with uncontrolled user- and indexer-supplied descriptor terms.  Once people start calling it an ontology, sometimes people will get more interested. [[Special:Contributions/71.198.176.22|71.198.176.22]] ([[User talk:71.198.176.22|talk]]) 21:09, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Goats make great pets. They are loving and sweet. If they are bottle fed, which you should not do unless you have to, they become dog like. Bottle goats like to go on walks and be petted. Do not bottle-feed unless you have to. Goats can get something called bloat if overfed, and it can kill a goat in less than 24 hours. Another problem goats can get from being overfed is scours, or diarrhea. Scours can kill goats in less than 24 hours. If your goat has scours make sure to give it lots of fluids, goats with scours get dehydrated fast and can die from dehydration. If your goat has bloat or scours, call the vet immediately. Goats eat hay, sweet feed, and goat food. You can graze goats, but make sure they don't eat too much grass. Goats are very curious and smart. They are loving and gentle. If you don't have a goat, you don't know what you're missing! Your goat can be your best friend! Goats are truly the dogs of the livestock world.

* Automatic goat waterers?
** Duramate is a good water or you could just have a timer that turns on a small hose to fill a bucket for them
* Automatic feeders? 
** QuickFeed is a good automatic feeder but expensive
* Goat feed: quantity/week? price? where to buy?  how heavy are the bags?
** wethers need about cup of feed, does need the same amount if they are not pregnant, increase there feed by 1/2 cup for the first 6 mouths of pregnancy and another 1/2 cup for the last month   
** The type of feed you buy at the local feed store can be pellets, grain, sweet feed
* Goat &quot;minerals&quot;?  Same questions as above, plus: what's in it? 
** salt, copper, iron and other unavailable minerals that they need
* Do we need to buy hay/straw?  How much?  Price?  Where to buy? 
** you should if they don't have access to a land for browsing, about one bail and it costs about $10-$40
* What are goat &quot;worms&quot;?  How likely to get it? How bad is it?
** they are like tapeworms and can hurt the goat overtime so see the vet to deworm them and it's cheap
* How much does a hoof trimming cost?  Is there a 4-H group that will help me learn it?
** Probably, it costs nothing to a vet visit and they could teach you
* What will a goat area look like?  Find example videos/photos. 
** It should have grasses, bushes, leaves and lots of vegetation and if its small the grass won't grow in places 
* How to build a welded-wire fence?  How to add a gate? 
** Get some stakes in the ground around the area for the goat and make sure they are pretty close to give more support. Just add hinges or ask someone at homedepo
* How much do we have to worry about predators?  Find info about fencing to protect against bobcats, coyotes, etc.
** If the fence is good enough to keep them in then the predators should not be able to get in
* How to build/buy goat shelter?  Specific links.
** It should be about 20 square feet per pair, draft free, and have their loose minerals, extra hay and feed incase of rain
* How does one transport a pet goat?
* Is milking optional, or a mandatory chore?

==Introduction==
The Ocarina Method Book, or TOMB is a wikibook for learning and practicing the Ocarina.  It is our hope that with this book (when it is finished), any dedicated ocarina enthusiast can go from absolute beginner to being a skilled ocarinist.  TOMB is a detailed exercise book with practice lessons that will help you develop your skills on the ocarina.

You might be here for the wrong reasons and to save us all some trouble, we'll try to redirect you.  
*TOMB is not a guide to buying ocarinas.  The online ocarina community has a substantial presence and most questions about buying new ocarinas are or can be answered on their forums.  Two western forums which are not affiliated with any ocarina brands are [http://octalk.net/forum OCtalk] and [http://theocarinanetwork.com The Ocarina Network].
*TOMB is not an encyclopedia entry about ocarinas.  This can be found at [[w:Ocarina|Ocarina]].  
*TOMB is not a collection of sheet music, tabs or songs.  Again, such things can be found at those forums, among other places.

== Chapters of this Book ==
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Fingering Charts|Fingering Charts]].  Charts and advice on playing various types of ocarinas.
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Introduction to sheet music|Introduction to sheet music]].  A little about sheet music to get started on the [[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]].
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]].  Lessons and practice.  Beginner lessons are tabbed, but a goal of this Chapter is to teach the nuances of sheet music.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The book's purpose and style (please edit this, even though I wrote it like a letter) ==
OK hi.  The basic intention of this wikibook is to make a more practical version of the Mezzetti method books available at [http://www.giorgiopacchioni.com/biblioteca.html].  He states on his site that things are creative commons (no derivatives, share alike), but to my knowledge, these method books are in the public domain.  Anyone contributing significantly to the curriculum of the wikibook should at least browse the mezzetti material if not actually do some of the lessons.

'''Our audience:'''

Ocarinists seem to be all over the map but I think the book should be conscious of the following three groups.

*young zelda/anime fans.  These people will want to practice on some video game music, maybe see some drawings that appeal to them etc.  Some video game pieces are very simple (and some is not) and it would be nice if the wikibook supplied some backtracks and a fast way to satisfy them with the ability to play a song.  Then, the wikibook should convince them to practice further and polish their skills with more advanced music.

*people with a more general interest in playing music and will play ocarina as their first (or nearly) instrument.  again, it will be important to try to get them playing a familiar song early on. They will want something more popular than anime music.

*musicians.  I expect this group to be less concerned with learning a song right away and more inclined to do fingering drills.

'''The following things about the mezzetti books should be considered'''
*the mezzetti books launch the student a bit sharply into playing sheet music without enough advice.

*the wikibook needs to have an introduction to some common styles of ocarina (4,6,8,10,12 hole, fingering styles etc).

*the wikibook should be more neatly divided into reasonable lessons, giving the student the satisfaction of finishing one and moving to the next.

*the wikibook can make use of audio, video and midi.  for example we can have midi backtracks for end-of-section projects.

==On the current todo list:==

# register and post here about how you can contribute
# figure the rest out later!
# add art work and music to make the book more attractive to young and old ocarina players
# transcribe mezzetti material into the exercise section
# recruit other editors

== Table of contents of TOMB ==
These are the sections I think we should start with
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Fingering Charts|Fingering Charts]]
** different kinds? '''We need contributors for this'''
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Introduction to sheet music|Introduction to sheet music]]
** redirect to another book for the moment?
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]]
**This is where the bulk of our work will be for the moment

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Diffusion|Next=Particle model}}

Apart from diffusion, there is another interesting phenomenon that can be observed. It is called the Brownian motion, discovered by a scientist called Brown.

== Smoke cells and Brownian motion ==
Before we start on Brownian motion, let's look at an interesting experiment. A smoke cell is a small box full of smoke and air. If you have one (or your teacher gives you one), place it under a microscope. Otherwise, there is a short clip [http://www.practicalphysics.org/fileLibrary/wmv/brownian_motion.wmv here]. As you can see, the bits of smoke move at random directions, unassisted. Or do they?

Smoke particles are larger than air particles. That's why we can see the smoke particles better than the air particles. As you will learn later, gas particles always move at high speed, in random directions. The same things is happening to the air particles. When an air particle bombards a smoke particles, the smoke particle moves to the same direction as the air particle that hit it. When another air particle hits the smoke particle, it changes its direction to that of the second air particle, and so on. This is called Brownian motion.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Brownian motion 1.svg|What will happen to the small black particle on top and the large blue particle when they collide?
Image:Brownian motion 2.svg|Their directions will change.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== The story of pollen grains ==
[[File:Robert brown botaniker.jpg|thumb|150px|A portrait of Robert Brown]]
The Brownian motion was discovered by, and named after, a botanist called Robert Brown. A botanist is a person who studies plants. In 1827, he was observing some pollen grains when he saw that the pollen grains were moving mysteriously. Do you know why the pollen grains were moving like that? The movement of the water particles causes that of the pollen grains, enabling them to move in random, constantly changing directions. This is what Robert Brown later figured out.

== Quiz ==
# Brownian motion is named after:
## Charlie Brown
## Gordon Brown
## Robert Brown
## John Brown
# Which of the statements below best describes of movements of particles in a smoke cell?
## The smoke particles flow to places of higher concentration
## The air particles flow to places of lower concentration
## The smoke particles dodge the air particles, thereby causing the smoke particles to rotate
## The air particles hit the smoke particles, thereby causing them to move in random directions

Answers:
# 3
# 4

* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:19, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for your methods.  I'm trying to recruit authors in the ocarina community.  Until I get some help from some musicians, this will be a vapourbook.  Do you think I should write some of it on my talk page before making it a book? [[User:Alejandro Erickson|Alejandro Erickson]] ([[User talk:Alejandro Erickson|talk]]) 17:31, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

:You should start by contributing some content and structuring it (create the TOC and establish the scope, what will the book cover and what will it teach to readers). If you chose to do it on you userspace you will have to authorize contributions (it not seen as acceptable to edit pages on the userspace outside of the main talk without a direct instruction to do so), this will permit greater control on what you do but will reduce collaboration or and probably even interest in collaborating on those resources.
:I've noticed your attempt to establish a structure for the book on the project talk pages, there is nothing wrong with that but be extremely aware not to impose your views on others and be open for having your expectations challenged, also remember that most people will shy away from engaging in discussions. If you need to establish a more fixed framework for participation on the project, establish some book conventions (see [[C++ Programming/Conventions]]), by making proposals and adopting them as a specific framework for the book's evolution. Sometimes this is required to permit some stability and order to the creative process, but for the low content you still have on the project it may be premature.
:Mine other resources, use free content from Wikipedia and other compatible sources, remembering to ask for transclusions of the articles. You can even tag Wikipedia articles to link to the book as soon as it begins to take shape. It all depends on the level of participation you are after, make an announcement on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], and in other books that share some commonalities, etc. (Check out the [[Wikiversity]] project also).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:02, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

PS: If the book is in the public domain and has been published ( &quot;Mezzetti curriculum&quot; ) check out the Wikisource project and ask for help importing it first there before duplicating the effort here (or change what you do import from that work). This will also enable you to reference the source on the project you are creating.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:13, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

Ok yeah, I was wondering how to get the book onto a wiki-affiliated site.  I'll look into this so that contributors don't have to chase 
it down at pacchioni's website.  As for duplicating efforts, I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm promoting the Mezzetti book as a general guideline, but I would like contributors to make more modern exercises (especially musical pieces). [[User:Alejandro Erickson|Alejandro Erickson]] ([[User talk:Alejandro Erickson|talk]]) 06:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:Having the book stored at Wikisource will reduce the need to duplicate it (you can reference it there) or duplicate parts of it here and alter them. For what I understood you don't want to evolve the source material but are especially interested in shaping the exercises. I also noted that the Mezzetti book only covers that particular type of ocarina and you are aiming to go beyond that limitation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:16, 3 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Brownian motion|Next=Three states of matter}}

Before we begin on particle models, let us recall a few points from the previous chapters.
* Matter is made of particles.
* Particles are always moving.
* Particles usually move from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration.
Here is one more point that we have not discussed before, but is equally important:
{| class = wikitable width = &quot;820&quot;
| &lt;center&gt;[[File:Star*.svg|25px]]&lt;big&gt;'''Heat makes particles move more vigorously.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Now that these points are learnt, there are a lot of things we can explain with the particle model. But what exactly is a particle model? A particle model is basically a model which shows particles in action. You cannot find them in real life as they cannot be seen with microscopes. They can be 3-D models or 2-D ones. They can be used to explain a lot of things, such as the three states of matter, density, and thermal expansion and contraction.

== [[../Three states of matter|The three basic states of matter]] ==
[[File:States of matter En.svg|thumb|Why do they look like that?]]
Do you still remember that we learnt about the three basic states of matter earlier? We can explain the three states of matter with the particle model. You will find out why matter is compressible, and why its shape is more stable as a solid.

== [[../Gas pressure|Gas pressure]] ==
Gas is compressible; however, when compressed, the gas pressure will be different. This chapter will be all about gas and air pressure. Make sure you have read the previous chapter before proceeding to this one.

== [[../Float or sink?|Density]] ==
Density is how much of matter there is in a fixed volume. Reading this chapter does not require much previous knowledge aside from those discussed in the 'Matter' and 'Particle theory' chapters.

== [[../Expand or contract?|Thermal expansion and contraction]] ==
As you know, hotter things grow and smaller things shrink. These are called thermal expansion and contraction. But why exactly do they happen? Can they be applied in daily life?

== Quiz ==
Which of the following can be easily explained by the particle model, in your opinion?
# The water cycle
# Photosynthesis (the process in which plants make food)
# Comparison of density before and after dissolving
# Magnetic fields
# The movement of particles under different temperatures
# The respiratory system (the system by which you breathe)

Answer:&lt;br/&gt;
3 and 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
An appeal is an application to review a matter that has been decided by a Court. The appeal is directed to the &quot;higher&quot; level of court above the level of the deciding court.

The venue for the appeal depends on the venue of the original proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;s. 813&lt;/ref&gt; Matters that are elected indictably are appealed to the Court of Appeal while matters that are summary conviction offences are appealed to the Supreme Court of the province.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Edmunds, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1f5 1981 CanLII 173] (SCC), [1981] 1 SCR 233&lt;/ref&gt;  

If the accused is prosecuted indictably but convicted of a lesser summary offence, the appeal is to proceed as if by indictment.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Yaworski (1959), 31 C.R. 55 (Man. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal will assume that the election is summary unless indicated.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ashoona (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (N.W.T. S.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Gal (1985), 60 A.R. 333 (Alta. Q.B.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing a trial judge's decision, the decision should not be looked at in a piecemeal manner, but rather should be considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nichols [http://canlii.ca/t/1ffww 2001 CanLII 5680] (ON CA), (2001), 148 OAC 344, 46 CR (5th) 294&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial judges are presumed to know the elementary principles of law.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Burns, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frvk 1994 CanLII 127] (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 656, 89 CCC (3d) 193&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Appeal by Offence==
The manner of appeal depends on what type of offence was charged, whether it is a summary conviction offence or an indictable offence:
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Indictable Offences]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Summary Offences]]

==Standard of Review==
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Standard of Review]]

== Jury Instruction ==
An appellate court should assess a jury charge functionally. It is not an idealized approach considering whether better instructions could have been given.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jacquard (C.O.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr4h 1997 CanLII 374] (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314 at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cooper, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs5v 1993 CanLII 147] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146 at pp. 163-164&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewing judge should determine whether the accused, based on the review of the whole charge, has had a fair trial. It is not to look for minute errors. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski (C.T.), [http://canlii.ca/t/236fj 2009 MBCA 37], 236 Man.R. (2d) 259, at para. 102&lt;br&gt;
Cooper at p. 163&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Luciano, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fhtn 2011 ONCA 89] at para 71&lt;br&gt;
Vézeau v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mx4z 1976 CanLII 7], [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277 at p. 285&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kociuk (R.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/fnl3w 2011 MBCA 85] at para 69 to 72 &lt;br&gt;
Jacquard&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court should consider whether the instructions had the ability to fulfil their purpose and not simply whether they diverted from a formula.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacKinnon [http://canlii.ca/t/1f971 1999 CanLII 1723] (ON CA), (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 27&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

All defences that have an air of reality are to be put to the jury, even if not raised by counsel. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29], [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedial Powers of the Court of Appeal==
Part XVIII of the Criminal Code addresses the power and procedure for appeals. Appeals of indictable offences are appealed to the provincial Court of Appeal. 

The Crown can generally appeal where there is an error in law. The Crown has a limited appeal on the basis of questions of fact. This includes appeals for unreasonable verdict.&lt;Ref&gt;  R. v. Kendall, [2005] O.J. No. 2457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Crown cannot appeal on issues of credibility unless it amount to an error in law.

The Defence can appeal both issues of fact and law.([http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec675 ss. 675 and 676])

{{reflist|2}}

==Grounds for Interfering with Verdicts (The Curative Proviso)==
The powers of the Court of Appeal to interfere with a verdict on a appeal are stated under s.686:
{{Quotation|
686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal
:(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that
::(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,
::(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or
::(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;
:(b) may dismiss the appeal where
::(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,
::(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground mentioned in paragraph (a),
::(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, or
::(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby;
:(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion respecting the effect of a special verdict, may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the court to be required by the verdict and may pass a sentence that is warranted in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court; or
:(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the circumstances.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 686; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), ss. 145, 203; 1991, c. 43, s. 9; 1997, c. 18, s. 98; 1999, c. 3, s. 52, c. 5, s. 26.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec686 CCC]
}}

Where a defence appeal is allowed the court may either order a new trial or enter a verdict of acquittal. (s.686(2))

The court has discretion to enter a verdict of acquittal where:
* the accused has already served part or all of a fit sentence
* where there is still sufficient evidence to support a conviction
* where it would be unfair to the accused to have another trial

{{Reflist|2}}

===Unreasonable Verdicts===
Under s. 686(1)(a)(i), the defence may appeal a conviction where there was an &quot;unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence&quot;.

A verdict that is unreasonable must be one where the judge &quot;revealed he or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Binaris, [http://canlii.ca/t/5260 2000 SCC 15], [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at 37&lt;/ref&gt;

An error of the trial judge in finding an acquittal, once found, can only result in a new trial being ordered where the error had “a material bearing on the acquittal”&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Graveline, [http://canlii.ca/t/1n3bs 2006 SCC 16] at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate court may find a verdict is unreasonable where the trial judge has drawn an inference or made a finding of fact essential to the verdict that:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R.P., [http://canlii.ca/t/fr8qc 2012 SCC 22] at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
# is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the trial judge in support of that inference or finding, or 
# is shown to be incompatible with evidence that has not otherwise been contradicted or rejected by the trial judge 

The applicable test for unreasonable verdict &quot;requires the appeal court to determine what verdict a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could judicially have arrived at, and, in doing so, to review, analyze, and within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biniaris at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Or to put it another way: &quot;whether on the whole of the evidence the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Yebes, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftlc 1987 CanLII 17] (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168&lt;br&gt;

A judge's decision should not be analysed by &quot;dissecting them into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jtj 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No. 639 (C.A.)at para 28 (&quot;[I]t is wrong to analyze a trial judge's reasons by dissecting them into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation as if it described, or was intended to describe, a legal principle applied by the trial judge. Reasons for judgment must be read as a whole.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons should be read as a whole, and not held to a standard of perfection nor should it be the equivalent of jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;

It is inappropriate to &quot;simply plucking colloquial elements&quot; from a trial judge's &quot;thorough reasons&quot; or to &quot;cherry pick&quot; infelicitous phrases.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Davis, 1999 CanLII 638 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 759 ( inappropriateness of “simply plucking colloquial elements [from a] trial judge's thorough reasons” )&lt;/ref&gt;

A mere misstatement at &quot;one point should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B. (C.R.), 1990 CanLII 142 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts are given great deference when considering whether findings are supported by the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W. (R.), 1992 CanLII 56 (S.C.C.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, and R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 229 (S.C.C.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474)&lt;/ref&gt;

R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 outlined the principles to be applied:
#A court of appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury but in applying the Yebes test is entitled to review, analyze and, within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.
#The test applies equally to a jury and a judge sitting alone.  In the latter case, the review may be easier because the appellate court will be able to examine the reasons provided by the judge, which may reveal a flaw in the evaluation of the evidence.  Such a deficiency in analysis may appear where a judge was not alive to an applicable legal principle or entered a verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.    
#A reviewing court must articulate the basis upon which it finds that the conclusions reached by a jury were unreasonable.  A lurking doubt or vague unease based on the court’s review is not sufficient justification for a finding of unreasonableness but may trigger increased appellate scrutiny.
#A jury does not provide reasons for its verdict.  To justify a finding of unreasonableness regarding the verdict of a properly instructed jury, the appeal court will not be able to point to express deficiencies in analysis.  It must fall back upon and articulate inferences drawn from a review of the evidence to support its conclusion that the jury, in arriving at its guilty verdict, could not have been acting judicially.
#Jury instructions attempt to convey accumulated judicial experience to the jury.  Still, in certain rare cases, the totality of the evidence and the peculiar factual circumstances will lead an experienced, legally trained, jurist to conclude that the fact-finding exercise applied at trial must have been flawed in light of the unreasonable results it produced.
#Acting judicially, in this context, means not only acting dispassionately in applying the law and adjudicating on the basis of the law and nothing else.  It means, in addition, arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict with the bulk of judicial experience.  The reviewing court’s assessment must, in other words, proceed through “the lens of judicial experience” to identify and articulate, as precisely as possible, those features of the case which suggest that the verdict was unreasonable.  There may be several causes of concern, none of which, in isolation, might have required a particular warning to the jury.

A verdict may also be unreasonable if the trial judge draws an inference or makes an essential finding of fact that:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
# is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the trial judge in support of that inference or finding; or
# is shown to be incompatible with evidence that has not otherwise been contradicted or rejected by the trial judge.

'''Misapprehension of Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Appeal for misapprehension of evidence requires that the error &quot;play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction&quot;.

===Insufficiency of Reasons===
The judge is required to give reasons for his or her decision on verdict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sheppard, [2002] SCJ No 30. at para 55; &lt;Br&gt;
Pitts v. Ontario (1985), 51 OR (2d) 302 at 311;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kendall [2005] O.J. No;. 2457 (C.A.)) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of giving reasons is to &quot;show why the judge reached his or her conclusion&quot;. The reasons are to be examined in a functional test.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The requirement of reasons is tied to their purpose and the purpose varies with the context&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dinardo, at para. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The functional and substantive manner means taking the reasons, &quot;as a whole, in the context of the evidence, arguments, and the live issues at trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which reasons are given.&quot; There must be a logical connection between the verdict and the reasons. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.S., [http://canlii.ca/t/fr6gh 2012 ONCA 289] at 45&lt;br&gt;
R v REM 2008 SCC 51 at 16, 35, 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no obligation upon judges to address every argument made by counsel. &lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Dinardo, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc24/2008scc24.html 2008 SCC 24], [2008] 1 SCR 788 at paragraph 30&lt;/ref&gt; Nor must the judge articulate consideration of every part of the evidence.

The Criminal Code specifically mandates judges to give reasons on certain circumstances, such as when determining the admissibility of a complainant's prior sexual history &lt;ref&gt;see s. 276.2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;; ordering the production of prior personal information (s. 278.8(1)); and when imposing a sentence &lt;ref&gt;see s. 726.2&lt;/ref&gt;.

The reason must &quot;sufficiently intelligible&quot; to permit appellate review.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D. (J.J.R.) 2006 CanLII 40088 (ON CA), (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A verdict must be based exclusively on admissible evidence heard at trial. If a trial judge has misapprehended the evidence, including resorting to material not before him or her, and the errors &quot;play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction then … the accused’s conviction is not based exclusively on the evidence and is not a “true” verdict&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii3498/1995canlii3498.html 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA) at p. 541&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80 (CanLII), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at paras. 2-3&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering sufficiency, it is not the decision alone that should be considered but rather &quot;what the trial judge has stated in the context of the record, the issues and the submissions of counsel at trial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
REM at para. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Focus on analysis on findings concerning credibility &quot;should be directed at whether the reasons respond to the case's live issues, having regard to the evidence as a whole and the submissions of counsel&quot;(para. 25) This however does not require &quot;reasons to be so detailed that they allow an appeal court to retry the entire case on appeal. There is no need to prove that the trial judge was alive to and considered all of the evidence, or answer each and every argument of counsel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dinardo at para. 30&lt;br&gt; 
also referenced in R v REM 2008 SCC 51&lt;/ref&gt; 
Credibility cases require that the court sufficiently articulate how credibility concerns have been resolved. Failure to do so may be a reversible error.&lt;ref&gt;

R. v. Braich, 2002 SCC 27, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 903, at para. 23&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where an oral and written decision contains inconsistent findings and reasons to key findings, a new trial may be warranted.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ball [http://canlii.ca/t/frpvx 2012 ABCA 184] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial judge's reasons should be reviewed on a &quot;standard of adequacy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Flores, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvxcf 2013 MBCA 4] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The reasons are adequate if, as a whole, accomplish three purposes:&lt;ref&gt;

===Error on Question of Law===
Under s.675(1)(a)(ii), the defence may appeal a conviction on error of law.

Where there has been an error of law, such as the improper admission evidence, and the evidence may have influenced the trier of fact in reaching its verdict, the conviction must be quashed, irrespective of whether the admissible evidence supports a conviction.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Colpitts, [1965] S.C.R. 739&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Court may dismiss an appeal and deny any remedy under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), where the court &quot;is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred&quot;(s.686(1)(b)(iii)). 

{{reflist|2}}

===Miscarriage of Justice===
Under s.686(1)(a)(iii), the defence may appeal a conviction based on a miscarriage of justice.

A miscarriage of justice may arise in the following circumstances:
* a misapprehension of &quot;significant evidence&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jtj 1995 CanLII 3498] (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* improper questioning during cross-examination&lt;ref&gt;

===Lack of Prejudice===
Under s. 686(1)(b)(iv), the Court may dismiss a defence appeal despite irregularities at trial where the &quot;court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby&quot;.

In this context, &quot;prejudice&quot; refers to the prejudice suffered upon the accused's ability to defend himself, to receive a fair trial, and to the appearance of the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Incompetent or effective counsel===

=== Interfering with Sentences===
Appeal of Sentence is a separate form of appeal from an appeal of verdict. 

Under s. 673, a sentence is defined as:
{{quotation|
“sentence” includes
:(a) a declaration made under subsection 199(3),
:(b) an order made under subsection 109(1) or 110(1), section 161, subsection 164.2(1) or 194(1), section 259, 261 or 462.37, subsection 491.1(2), 730(1) or 737(3) or (5) or section 738, 739, 742.1, 742.3, 743.6, 745.4 or 745.5,
:(c) a disposition made under section 731 or 732 or subsection 732.2(3) or (5), 742.4(3) or 742.6(9), and
:(d) an order made under subsection 16(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec673 CCC]
}}

Under s. 785(b), an appeal of sentence includes appeals against ancillary orders such as driving prohibitions, restitution, discharges, etc.

An appellate court has no authority to consider any issue of fitness of sentence on an appeal of verdict. There must be a specific application to appeal sentence before it can be considered.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. W. (G.) , [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597 - consideration of sentence without appeal of sentence created an apprehension of bias&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentence can only where there is an &quot;error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of relevant factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(C.A.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1996/1996canlii230/1996canlii230.html 1996 CanLII 230] (S.C.C.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 90&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Shropshire, [1995] S.C.J. No. 52 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii47/1995canlii47.html] at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal from a sentence in a summary conviction proceeding is identical to an appeal in an indictable matter. &lt;ref&gt;
By operation of section 822(1) of the Criminal Code summary conviction appeal adopts the same procedure by reference to the provisions of 687(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The governing section states:
{{quotation| 
687(1)  Where an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,
:(a)        vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or
:(b)        dismiss the appeal.
}}
The decision on sentence is an act of discretion&lt;ref&gt; R. v. McCurdy, [2003] 210 NSR (2d) 33 at 36&lt;/ref&gt; and so the standard of review is one of deference. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shropshire, (1995) 102 CCC 193 at 209; R. v. CAM (1996) 105 CCC 327 at 374&lt;/ref&gt; This deference does not change whether the sentence was after conviction or guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. CAM at 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a Court will only interfere where it is &quot;demonstrably unfit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [2004] NSJ 133&lt;/ref&gt;

To have grounds of appeal the appellant must be able to answer at least one or more of the following questions in the affirmative: &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Long, [2001] N.B.J. No. 347 (N.B.C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Is the sentence the result of an error of law?
#Did the sentencing judge err in principle in the exercise of his or her discretion?
#Is the sentence clearly unreasonable having regard to the fundamental purpose and objective of sentencing (s. 718) as well as the principles enunciated in section 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code?
#Is the sentence a substantial and marked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated offenders committing similar crimes?

'''SOIRA Order''': only if there is an error in principle, a failure to consider a relevant factor, an overemphasis on appropriate factors, or a clearly unreasonable decision&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Redhead, 2006 ABCA 84 at para. 13, 384 A.R. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has no authority to appeal the ordering of a particular length of SOIRA as it does not fit the meaning of &quot;sentence&quot; in s. 673.&lt;Ref&gt;

:(b) impose a sentence that is warranted in law or remit the matter to the trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.&lt;br&gt;

'''Appeal from acquittal'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) If an appeal is from an acquittal or verdict that the appellant or respondent was unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal may
:(a) dismiss the appeal; or
:(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

s. 686.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''New trial under Part XIX'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Subject to subsection (5.01), if an appeal is taken in respect of proceedings under Part XIX and the court of appeal orders a new trial under this Part, the following provisions apply:
:(a) if the accused, in his notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, requested that the new trial, if ordered, should be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall be held accordingly;
:(b) if the accused, in his notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, did not request that the new trial, if ordered, should be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall, without further election by the accused, be held before a judge or provincial court judge, as the case may be, acting under Part XIX, other than a judge or provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance, unless the court of appeal directs that the new trial be held before the judge or provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance;
:(c) if the court of appeal orders that the new trial shall be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall be commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence in respect of which the new trial was ordered; and
:(d) notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the conviction against which the accused appealed was for an offence mentioned in section 553 and was made by a provincial court judge, the new trial shall be held before a provincial court judge acting under Part XIX, other than the provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance, unless the court of appeal directs that the new trial be held before the provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance.&lt;br&gt;

==Procedural Powers of the Court of Appeal==
The Court of Appeal is a court of inherent jurisdiction and is not recognized in common law. It is a &quot;creature of statute&quot; where its powers to hear cases and make orders must come from statute. 

Under s. 683, the Court of Appeal's main powers consist of the authority to:
* order the production of any writing, exhibit or other thing connected with the proceedings;
* &quot;order any witness ... to attend and be examined before the court of appeal...&quot;and admit the testimony as evidence. 
* order an inquiry and report to a special commissioner and to act on such a rport
* amend an indictment

The court also has &quot;ancillary&quot; authority to control its own process.
&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Zaharia (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{reflist|2}}

===Disclosure Motion===

An accused may apply to the court of appeal for a disclosure, usually in the context of a fresh evidence application. 

Third party records can be obtained through application under s. 683. These production orders apply the same law as at trial level.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Trotta, [2004] O.J. No. 2439 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant must show:&lt;ref&gt;
R v West, 2012 NSCA 112&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is a connection between the request for production and the fresh evidence he proposes to adduce in that there is a reasonable possibility that the material sought could assist on the motion to adduce fresh evidence; and 
#There is a reasonable possibility that the evidence to which the production request is linked may be received as fresh evidence on appeal.

==Procedure on Specific Issues==

===Notice of Appeal===
Provincial rules of court set out the notice requirements for each appealing party as well as the time limit.

Rules may permit substituted service on notice, but when they do, they require a high standard of proof.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. see R v Goodhart, [http://canlii.ca/t/fv6qs 2012 ABQB 712] - substituted notice to accused quashed
&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

===Voir Dire Appeals===
A voir dire hearing can happen at any point during a proceeding before the final decision on guilt. Parties have a right to appeal the ruling of a voir dire, however, the proceeding will generally not be put on hold pending a ruling of the appeal.

A guilty plea after a voir dire will usually extinguish any right to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chuhaniuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/2cl6p 2010 BCCA 403] at para. 45 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Carter, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fw4s 2003 BCCA 632] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bowman, [http://canlii.ca/t/21863 2008 BCCA 410] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Webster, [http://canlii.ca/t/21ls8 2008 BCCA 458]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

As best practice, to preserve the right to appeal, the accused shall admit the facts alleged by the Crown and invite the judge to convict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325] at para. 8
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues of Appeal===
It is inappropriate for the appellate court to raise any issues not raised by either Crown or Defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. T. (S.G.) [http://canlii.ca/t/29vqb 2010 SCC 20] at paras. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused may only raise a Charter issue on appeal that was not raised at trial where the following has been met:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs23 1993 CanLII 114] (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, [1993] S.C.J. No. 82 per L'Heureux-Dubé J. at para. 20 dissenting on other grounds&lt;/ref&gt;
#there must be a sufficient evidentiary record to resolve the issue. 
#it must not be an instance in which the accused for tactical reasons failed to raise the issue at trial. 
# the court must be satisfied that no miscarriage of justice will result from the refusal to raise such new issue on appeal. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Issues Not Raised at Trial===
In certain cases, such as applications for privileged information, the failure to raise the issue at trial subsequent to a lost voir dire has been found to be fatal to a potential appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Blair, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9m 2000 CanLII 16821] (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to raise a Charter issue on appeal where it  was no argued previously, there must be 1) sufficient evidence to deal with the issue, 2) satisifed that the failure to raise the issue previously was not merely a tactical issue, 3) there is no miscarriage of justice from raising the new issue.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs23 1993 CanLII 114] (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 at para. 20&lt;Br&gt;
R v Black, [http://canlii.ca/t/29v3d 2010 NBCA 36] at para. 3&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

=== Fresh Evidence ===
The test for the admission of fresh evidence is set out as follows: &lt;ref&gt;R v Palmer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at p. 775; R. v. Levesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases
#The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.
#The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and
#It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

Where however, the application arises out of the Crown's failure to provide disclosure, then test is less onerous.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McQuaid, (sub nom R. v. Dixon), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805] (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at 34&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Taillefer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g992 2003 SCC 70], [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Illes, [http://canlii.ca/t/218ct 2008 SCC 57], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 134 at para. 24&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The accused must show that his right to make full answer and defence was violated by showing either &quot;that there is a reasonable possibility the non-disclosure affected the outcome at trial&quot; or that it affected &quot;the overall fairness of the trial process&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Dixon at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Post-Sentence Evidence===
The courts are reluctant to consider fresh evidence on appeal as it is outside of the appeal court's role.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Lévesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47] at para 20 &lt;/ref&gt;

There are four criteria to consider before allowing the evidence:&lt;ref&gt;Levesque, at 35&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases.
#The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue relating to the sentence.
#The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief.
#The evidence must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

=== Intervenors ===
A party may apply to intervene in an appeal where: &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Ross, 2012 NSCA 8 at 12 [http://canlii.ca/t/fpq5l#par12]&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the intervention will unduly delay the proceedings; 
#possible prejudice to the parties if intervention is granted; 
#whether the intervention will widen the lis between the parties; 
#the extent to which the position of the intervenor is already represented and protected by one of the parties; and 
#whether the intervention will transform the court into a political arena. 

These factors are balanced against each other and the interests of convenience, efficiency, and social purpose of moving the matter forward. The decision is ultimately a discretionary one.

{{Reflist|2}}

=== Court Appointed Counsel for Appeals===
Section 684(1) provides:
{{Quotation|684(1)  A court of appeal or a judge of that court may […] assign counsel to act on behalf of an accused who is a party to an appeal or to proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal where, in the opinion of the court or judge, it appears desirable in the interests of justice that the accused should have legal assistance and where it appears that the accused has not sufficient means to obtain that assistance.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec684 CCC]
|}}

The “interests of justice” consists of many factors including:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Donald, [http://canlii.ca/t/2016c 2008 BCCA 316] at 10 to15&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Hoskins, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpv2n 2012 BCCA 51]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Assoun, [http://canlii.ca/t/4v1t 2002 NSCA 50]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Morton, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dtdw 2010 NSCA 103] &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* the points to be argued on appeal (Donald, Hoskins)
* the complexity of the case; (Donald, Hoskins, Assoun)
* the appellant's capability to advance his appeal considering his level of education and his competency; (Donald, Hoskins, Assoun)
* whether the assistance of counsel is necessary in order to marshal the evidence and make the argument; (Donald, Hoskins)
* the nature and extent of the penalty imposed; (Donald, Hoskins)
* the merits of the appeal (Donald, Hoskins)
* the court’s role to assist (Assoun)
* responsibility of Crown counsel to ensure that the applicant is treated fairly. (Morton)

{{Reflist|2}}

===Amending Indictments or Informations===
Under s. 683(1)(g), the court of appeal may amend an information or indictment subject to the appeal. In doing so, the court should consider:

It is section 683(1)(g), not section 686(1)(b)(i), that provides an appeal court with the authority to amend an indictment or information on appeal. In deciding whether to amend, an appeal court should consider:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Fraser, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tmd3 2007 SKCA 113] (CanLII) at para. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
#the original indictment;
#the evidence at trial; 
#the positions of the parties at trial; 
#the instructions of the trial judge; 
#the verdict of the jury; and 
#the issues raised on appeal.

;Problem 1:
Give the chains of rangespaces and nullspaces for the zero and
identity transformations.
;Answer:

For the zero transformation, no matter what the space, the chain of rangespaces is &lt;math&gt; V\supset\{\vec{0}\}=\{\vec{0}\}=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt; and the chain of nullspaces is &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\}\subset V=V=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt;. For the identity transformation the chains are &lt;math&gt; V=V=V=\cdots &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\}=\{\vec{0}\}=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt;.

;Problem 2:
For each map,
give the chain of rangespaces and the chain of nullspaces,
and the generalized rangespace and the
generalized nullspace.
&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_0:\mathcal{P}_2\to \mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_1:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ a \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_2:\mathcal{P}_2\to \mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx+ax^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_3:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
;Answer:

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Iterating &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; twice
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx^2\mapsto cx^2&lt;/math&gt;
gives

:&lt;math&gt;
a+bx+cx^2\stackrel{t_0^2}{\longmapsto}cx^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and any higher power is the same map.
Thus, while &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of
quadratic polynomials
with no linear term &lt;math&gt;\{p+rx^2\,\big|\, p,r\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of purely-quadratic polynomials
&lt;math&gt;\{rx^2\,\big|\, r\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
this is where the chain stabilizes
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t_0)=\{rx^2\,\big|\, n\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
As for nullspaces,
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of purely-linear quadratic
polynomials &lt;math&gt;\{qx\,\big|\, q\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of quadratic polynomials
with no &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; term &lt;math&gt;\{p+qx\,\big|\, p,q\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
this is the end &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t_0)=\mathcal{N}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; The second power

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\stackrel{t_1}{\longmapsto}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\stackrel{t_1}{\longmapsto}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the zero map.
Consequently, the chain of rangespaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{R}^2
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ p \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p\in\mathbb{C}\}
\supset\{\vec{0}\,\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chain of nullspaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\vec{0}\,\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} q \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, q\in\mathbb{C}\}
\subset\mathbb{R}^2
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

each has length two.
The generalized rangespace is the trivial subspace and the
generalized nullspace is the entire space.
&lt;li&gt; Iterates of this map cycle around

:&lt;math&gt;
a+bx+cx^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} b+cx+ax^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} c+ax+bx^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} a+bx+cx^2
\;\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chains of rangespaces and nullspaces are trivial.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{P}_2=\mathcal{P}_2=\cdots
\qquad
\{\vec{0}\,\}=\{\vec{0}\,\}=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, obviously,
generalized spaces are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t_2)=\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t_2)=\{\vec{0}\,\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; We have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and so the chain of rangespaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{R}^3
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} p \\ p \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p,r\in\mathbb{C}\}
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} p \\ p \\ p \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p\in\mathbb{C}\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chain of nullspaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\vec{0}\,\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, r\in \mathbb{C}\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ q \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, q,r\in \mathbb{C}\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

each has length two.
The generalized spaces are the final ones shown above in each chain.

;Problem 4{{anchor|exer:PropSubspStrictLowerDimen}}: &lt;!--\label{exer:PropSubspStrictLowerDimen}--&gt;
Check that a subspace must be of dimension less than or equal to the
dimension of its superspace.
Check that if the subspace is proper (the subspace does not equal the
superspace) then the dimension is strictly less.
''(This is used in the proof of
[[#le:RangeAndNullChains|Lemma 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{le:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;.)''
;Answer:

Recall that if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; then any basis &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; can be enlarged to make a basis &lt;math&gt;B_V&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. From this the first sentence is immediate. The second sentence is also not hard: &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the span of &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subspace then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is not the span of &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;B_V&lt;/math&gt; must have at least one vector more than does &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 5:
Prove that the generalized rangespace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the
entire space, and the generalized nullspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial,
if the transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular.
Is this &quot;only if&quot; also?
;Answer:

It is both &quot;if&quot; and &quot;only if&quot;. We have seen earlier that a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it preserves dimension, that is, if the dimension of its range equals the dimension of its domain. With a transformation &lt;math&gt;t:V\to V&lt;/math&gt; that means that the map is nonsingular if and only if it is onto: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t)=V&lt;/math&gt; (and thus &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t^2)=V&lt;/math&gt;, etc).
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 6{{anchor|exer:RangeAndNullChains}}: &lt;!--\label{exer:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;
Verify the nullspace half of [[#le:RangeAndNullChains|Lemma 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{le:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;.
;Answer:

The nullspaces form chains because
because if &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in\mathcal{N}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;t^j(\vec{v})=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;t^{j+1}(\vec{v})=t(\,t^j(\vec{v})\,)=t(\vec{0})=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt; and
so &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in\mathcal{N}(t^{j+1})&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, the &quot;further&quot; property for nullspaces follows from that fact that it holds for rangespaces, along with the prior exercise. Because the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; plus the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; equals the dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the starting space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, when the dimensions of the rangespaces stop decreasing, so do the dimensions of the nullspaces. The prior exercise shows that from this point &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; on, the containments in the chain are not proper&amp;mdash; the nullspaces
are equal.
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 7:
Give an example of a transformation on a three
dimensional space whose range has dimension two.
What is its nullspace?
Iterate your example until the rangespace and nullspace stabilize.
;Answer:

(Of course, many examples are correct, but here is one.) An example is the shift operator on triples of reals &lt;math&gt; (x,y,z)\mapsto (0,x,y) &lt;/math&gt;. The nullspace is all triples that start with two zeros. The map stabilizes after three iterations.
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 8:
Show that the rangespace and nullspace of a linear transformation
need not be disjoint.
Are they ever disjoint?
;Answer:

The differentiation operator &lt;math&gt; d/dx:\mathcal{P}_1\to \mathcal{P}_1 &lt;/math&gt; has the same rangespace as nullspace. For an example of where they are disjoint&amp;mdash; except for the zero vector&amp;mdash; consider an identity map (or any nonsingular map).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The purpose and principles of sentencing provide a guidance to judges in applying the available sentences for particular offenders. The sentencing regime in the criminal code and case law sets out the goals at play in all sentencings. These goals can come in conflict with each other and so must be balance against each other in every case. The principles of sentencing guide a judge to determine how these goals are balanced and how to achieve the most appropriate disposition.

Sections 718 to 718.2 codify the objectives and principles of sentencing and are intended to “bring greater consistency and clarity” to sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of sentencing is not simply a method of imposing penalties or costs upon an offender to prevent harmful conduct, but rather the system is to impose sentences which &quot;positively instills the basic set of values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. C. A. M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1frb9 1996 CanLII 230] (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts must bring the law, including sentencing, into harmony with the prevailing social values and so must reflect changes in these values.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Stone, 134 C.C.C. (5d) 353 citing R. v. C.A.M., supra&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Purpose of Sentencing==
The purposes of sentencing are laid out in section 718 of the Criminal Code:

'''Purpose'''&lt;br&gt;
718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:
:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;
:(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;
:(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;
:(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
:(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and
:(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718 CCC]}}

As stated, the fundamental purpose is that there be &quot;respect for the law&quot; and the maintenance of a &quot;just, peaceful and safe society&quot;. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Whicher, [http://canlii.ca/t/5kdn 2002 BCCA 336]; R. v. Priest [http://canlii.ca/t/6hxl 1996 CanLII 1381] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single &quot;sentencing objective [that] trumps the other&quot;. It is to &quot;the sentencing judge to determine which objective or objectives merit the greatest weight, given the particulars of the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 at para. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
=== Denunciation - s.718(a) ===
Section 718(a) sets out the objective of &quot;denounc[ing] unlawful conduct&quot;. The principle of denunciation &quot;mandates that a sentence should communicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender's conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society's basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v M(CA) 1996 CanLII 230, [1996] 1 SCR 500 at 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of denunciation and deterrence can sometimes be satisfied without incarceration. One of these circumstances is where the publicity of the case provides for public humiliation. &lt;ref&gt;R v Ewanchuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/506z 2002 ABCA 95] at 65; R v Ambrose, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rqs 2000 ABCA 264] at 134; R v Kneale, [1999] OJ No 4062 at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
=== Deterrence - 718(b) ===
Section 718(b) sets out the objectives of &quot;deter[ing] the offender and other persons from committing offences&quot; We refer to these as the twin objectives of &quot;general deterrence&quot; and &quot;specific deterrence&quot;.

The objective of general deterrence as a factor will normally result in the offender being “punished more severely, not because he or she deserves it, but because the court decides to send a message to others who may be inclined to engage in similar criminal activity.” &lt;ref&gt;R v BWP [http://canlii.ca/t/1nn6n 2006 SCC 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

When general deterrence is emphasized, the deterrent effect of incarceration can be somewhat speculative and so should be used with great restraint.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Biancofiore, [http://canlii.ca/t/6hjk 1997 CanLII 3420] (ON CA), (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344 at para. 23 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy sentence is not the only way of achieving the objective of general deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Morrissette (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.) at 310&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

=== Separation from Society - 718(c) ===

Where a person with mental illness poses a risk to the public the court may need to resort to separating the offender from society, rather than focus on treatment.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Desjardins-Paquette, 2012 ONCA 674 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Virani, [2012] A.J. No. 507 (C.A.), at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the community is generally preferred over incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Lundrigan, [2012] NJ No 231 (NLCA) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is less so for serious offences.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. J.M., [2008] N.J. No. 262 (P.C.) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor, [2012] N.J. No. 251 (P.C.))&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

=== Rehabilitation - s.718(d)===
Section 718(d) sets out the objective of &quot;assist[ing] in rehabilitating offenders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;see also R. v. Gill (2006), [http://canlii.ca/t/1msxn 2006 BCCA 127]&lt;/ref&gt; Rehabilitation can be seen to achieve the objective of protecting the public as it assists in preventing further offences.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Simmons, Allen and Bezzo (1973), 13 CCC 65 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In certain cases, where there is a realistic possibility of rehabilitation, the courts may opt not to impose a jail sentence where it would otherwise be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Preston (1990), _____ (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective rehabilitation has been seen by some courts as requiring an acceptance of responsibility, likely by way of a guilty plea, and an understanding of the harm done.&lt;ref&gt;
See R v Lee [http://canlii.ca/t/fnsvh 2011 NSPC 81] at 83&lt;Br&gt;
R v Seguin [1997] OJ No 5439 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

An offender's &quot;positive potential for rehabilitation&quot; should be to the benefit of the accused on sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gouliaeff, 2012 ONCA 690 (CanLII) at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Principles of Sentencing==

=== Fundamental Principle: Proportionality ===
No matter what the balance between objectives, the sentence must always satisfy the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1.&lt;ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''Fundamental principle'''&lt;br&gt;
718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.1 CCC]
}}

Where the sentence is not proportionate it is not just.
&lt;ref&gt;R v Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363] at para 52 (proportionality is “the overarching principle since a disproportionate sanction can never be a just sanction.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, it is central to the sentencing process.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, [http://canlii.ca/t/21h61 2008 SCC 62], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 12&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR 688, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp2 1999 CanLII 679] (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence must be no greater than the offenders moral culpability.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6], [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 40 to 42&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the “severity of sanction for a crime should reflect the...seriousness of the criminal conduct.”
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363], para. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
And when the sentence is not adequate to address the seriousness of the offence then it is not proportionate.
&lt;ref&gt;R v Arcand, at para 54&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, it is well established that sentencing is a highly discretionary endeavour. Each sentence is to be custom tailored to match the particular offender.
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Bottineau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fkgld 2011 ONCA 194](sentencing “is a fact-sensitive process. Imposing a sentence depends very much on the facts of a particular case and the circumstances and culpability of the particular offender. That said, the sentence imposed must be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the purposes and principles set out in 718 and 718.2, sentencing is a highly individualized process that takes into account the offence, as well as the offender.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Angelillo [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xt 2006 SCC 55], (2006), 274 D.L.R. (4th) 1&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Briand, [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Shoker, [2006] S.C.J. No. 44, [http://canlii.ca/t/1prjc 2006 SCC 44]&lt;br&gt;
R v Hamilton, [2004] O.J. No. 3252, [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA) at 87 (&quot;Sentencing is a very human process.  Most attempts to describe the proper judicial approach to sentencing are as close to the actual process as a paint-by- numbers landscape is to the real thing.  The fixing of a fit sentence is the product of the combined effects of the circumstances of the specific offence and the unique attributes of the specific offender.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Grady(1971), 5 N.S.R. (2d) 264 at p. 266:(&quot;It would be a grave mistake, it appears to me, to follow rigid rules for determining the type and length of sentence in order to secure a measure of uniformity, for almost invariably different circumstances are present in the case of each offender. ...&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; penalties.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpp44 2012 ABCA 17] at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is “an inherently individualized process.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(C.A.), [1996] S.C.J. No. 28,
para. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a &quot;profoundly subjective process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R.  227, at para.  46&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity of an offence can be measured in part by the lasting emotional effects of the offence upon the victim.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Butler, [http://canlii.ca/t/21bfq 2008 NSCA 102] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

When crafting a sentence for multiple offences, proportionality can be achieved either &quot;by imposing concurrent sentences&quot; or &quot;by applying the totality principle to consecutive sentences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Guha, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftgfz 2012 BCCA 423] (CanLII) at para. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravating and Mitigating Factors===
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Factors of Sentencing]]''

Section 718.2 is a non-exhaustive list of secondary principles in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Other objectives and principles are listed at s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code: 
{{quotation|
'''Other sentencing principles'''&lt;br&gt;
718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
::(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,
::(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner,
::(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,
::(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,
::(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, or
::(v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence
&lt;p&gt;
shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;&lt;P&gt;...&lt;p&gt;|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.2 CCC]
}}

Take note that certain offences have their own additional factors to consider that are found throughout the code. For example, fraud offences under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec380.1 s. 380.1].

===Other Principles===
{{quotation|
718.2&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
:(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;
:(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;
:(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hamilton, 2004 ONCA __; R. v. D.L. (1990), 53 CCC 365 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; and
:(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.2 CCC]
}}

Judges are not permitted to apply their own personal belief or views that are contrary to the principles of sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;R .v. Song  2009 ONCA __&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Totality - s.718.2(c) ===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Purpose and Principles of Sentencing/Totality Principle]]

=== Parity (s.718.2(b)) ===
The parity principle means that a sentence should be &quot;similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;see s. 718.2(b) Criminal Code&lt;br&gt;
Sentencing, 7th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2008), at ss.2.21
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge has a responsibility to &quot;impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.&quot; &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Oake, [2010] N.J. No. 94 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

To fulfil this requirement sentencing judges must consider the range of sentences of &quot;similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Tuglavina, [2011] N.J. No. 25 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle ensures fairness between similarly situated cases.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Rawn, [http://canlii.ca/t/frzp0 2012 ONCA 487] at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It does not however override the individualized approach to sentencing. 
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Knife (1982), 16 Sask. R. 40 (C.A.) at p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of the provincial courts of appeal is to maintain parity in sentence and minimize the differences in sentencing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Arcand [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363]&lt;br&gt;
Nasogaluak [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judges must also be sensitive to the needs of local community.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parity to Co-Accused====
In a situation of co-accused, the roles of the parties will be considered as well as their personal circumstances. 
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Knife (1982), 16 Sask. R. 40 (C.A.) at p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of parity does not require equal sentences for participants in the same offence. Rather, they must &quot;only [be] understandable sentences when examined together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Issa (T.), (1992), 57 O.A.C. 253 at para. 9&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rawn, [http://canlii.ca/t/frzp0 2012 ONCA 487] at para 30&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where accomplices who commit the crime at the orders of a principal and agree to testify against he principal can be afforded lesser sentences than the principal.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Ellahib, 2008 ABCA 281 -- 20 years for the principal and the 16 and 15 year sentences accomplices justified because the principal was the instigator and the accomplices entered guilty pleas and testified against him.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Restraint - s. 718.2(d),(e)===

For first time offenders, the principle of restraint &quot;requires that the sentencing judge consider all sanctions apart from incarceration&quot; and where necessary ensure the term be as &quot;short as possible and tailored to the circumstances of the accused&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Battise [http://canlii.ca/t/22cd6 2009 ONCA 114] at 32&lt;br&gt;
R v Priest [http://canlii.ca/t/6hxl 1996 CanLII 1381] (ONCA) 30 OR (3d) 538 at p. 545&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt;

The principle also requires the judge to consider rehabilitation in setting the length of the sentence. 

&quot;General deterrence cannot be the sole consideration. Appropriate consideration must be given to the rehabilitation of the offender.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Blanas, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mh80 2006 CanLII 2610] (ON CA), (2006), 207 O.A.C. 226, at para 5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Restraint not only means that prison should be a sanction of last resort, but also means that the court should &quot;seek the least intrusive sentence and the least quantum which will achieve the overall purpose of being an appropriate and just sanction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamilton [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA) at para. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Where other dispositions have been tried and failed, and jail has not previously been imposed, the imposition of a &quot;short, sharp&quot; sentence can be appropriate, particularly where the offence is related to property and not violence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Vandale (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 250, per Martin JA citing McKenna J. of the English Court of Appeal in R. v. Curran (1973), 57 Crim. App. R. 945 (&quot;As a general rule it is undesirable that a first sentence of immediate imprisonment should be very long, disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and imposed as this sentence was for reasons of general deterrence, that is, as a warning to others.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Aboriginal Offenders - s. 718.2(e)===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Aboriginal Principles and Factors]]

===Step-up Principle===
The &quot;step-up&quot; principle is where an offender is convicted of a similar or identical offence to one he's been convicted and sentenced in the past for, it can be concluded that the prior sentence was not sufficiently deterrent and so the sentence for the new offence should be increased to focus on specific deterrence.

=== Jump Principle ===
The &quot;jump&quot; principle stated that subsequent sentences passed should not be disproportionate to the prior offence (ie. a &quot;jump&quot; in sentence). A subsequent offence should have an incremental increase proportionate to frequency of the repeated offences.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. White, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2007/2007nlca44/2007nlca44.html 2007 NLCA 44]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Muyser, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2009/2009abca116/2009abca116.html 2009 ABCA 116]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Murphy, [2011] N.J. No. 43 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words a dramatic increase in sentence due to a recent prior similar record would violate this rule.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Borde [http://canlii.ca/t/1c062 2003 CanLII 4187] (ON CA), (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417, at para. 39&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, this rule does not apply where the index offence is greatly more serious than the prior offences.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Borde 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417, at para. 39
R. v. Courtney, [http://canlii.ca/t/frz4k 2012 ONCA 478] at 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The jump principle is of &quot;less utility&quot; when dealing with an accused &quot;with a lengthy criminal record on multiple convictions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Frigault v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fpvch 2012 NBCA 8] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

A jump would be inconsistent with rehabilitation where that is a significant factor in sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. White, supra, at paragraphs 5 to 8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Gap Principle===
The &quot;gap principle&quot; directs courts to take into consideration the gaps of time between offences.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p11l 2006 NSCA 95] (CanLII) at para. 36: extensive citation from Ruby on Sentencing&lt;/ref&gt; It gives credit to someone who has made an effort to avoid criminal charges.
&lt;ref&gt;see §8.83 of Clayton Ruby, Sentencing, 7th ed. (Markham:  LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===&quot;Starting Points&quot; on Sentence===
A &quot;starting point&quot; for sentences are set as guides and are factors to consider the appropriate sentence. They are meant to achieve greater uniformity and consistency. They are &quot;most useful in circumstances where there is a large disparity between sentences imposed&quot;. &lt;reF&gt;R. v. McDonnell [1997] S.C.J. No. 42, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr3d 1997 CanLII 389]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A starting point of sentence will be raised and lowered after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors on sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ostertag, 2000 ABCA 232 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A starting point cannot be artificially lowered by examination into prior case law that shows lower sentences than the designated &quot;starting point&quot; and deem it to be the &quot;correct&quot; starting point. &lt;ref&gt;R. v Marchesi, [http://canlii.ca/t/25q69 2009 ABCA 304] at para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge would does not menttion starting points in sentence where one exists is not committing an error in principle.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpp44 2012 ABCA 17] at 58&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Stone, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqn2 1999 CanLII 688] (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Wells, [http://canlii.ca/t/527n 2000 SCC 10], [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, &lt;br&gt;
L.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1x21j 2008 SCC 31], [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Ranges on Sentence===
A range of sentence is not all sentences between the minimum and maximum for the offence charged. Rather, it is narrowed by the specific offence and offender. The variations of punishment when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors creates the continuum of the range. &lt;reF&gt; R v Cromwell [http://canlii.ca/t/1m44w 2005 NSCA 137] at 26&lt;/reF&gt;

Ranges &quot;are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak 2010 SCC 6 at para. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A range of sentence can be deviated as long as it is &quot;in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing&quot; and are not necessarily unfit.&lt;ref&gt;Nasogaluak at para. 44 &lt;br&gt;
c.f. R v Doerksen, (1990) 62 Man.R. 2d 259 (CA): A set range of sentence can be deviated from in “exceptional circumstances” &lt;/ref&gt; 
However, factors such as a “good record” and remorse do not amount to exceptional circumstances to deviate from the accepted range.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Henderson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpxrx 2012 MBCA 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Effect of Election on Sentence===
A sentence is not scaled based on the election made. Thus, an offence prosecuted summarily should not be scaled to less than the maximum only because it would not have been a maximum sentence by indictment.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Solowan, [http://canlii.ca/t/21h61 2008 SCC 62], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences for breach of court orders is a gradual process without a sudden, substantial increase in penalty.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Murphy, [2011] N.J. No. 43 (C.A.) at 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of the [http://lasers.llnl.gov/ National Ignition Facility] at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, spoke about fusion at the Center Stage Meeting Pavilion at about 12:30 p.m. on the first day of the Faire.  He was followed by Mark Frauenfelder, editor-in-chief of ''MAKE''.

=== Impressions ===

The presentation was excellent.  I was able to ask about reducing fast neutrons, and was pleased to receive a reply to my followup correspondence:

 Dear Dr. Moses,
 
 First, I want to thank you again for speaking at the Maker Faire, and
 make sure you got my message I tried to send below from the NIF
 &quot;contact&quot; web form.
 
 I've been thinking, since we spoke, about all the different modes of
 radioactive decay, and how many are weak force interactions with a
 wide variety of components.  So few of them are described well, even
 in the literature produced by particle accelerators (stochastic decay
 seems to be a very different mode of producing particles than
 collisions.)  Would you please point me to the source(s) which you
 think explains electroweak-nuclear interactions best?
 
 I also want to reiterate my suggestion to expand in a way that will
 allow the U.S. to take a serious look at Widom-Larsen and related
 theories.  The academic peer reviewed secondary and tertiary
 literature has recently been very strong in its support of the
 empirical evidence of the anomalies involved.[1-7] Applications are
 intriguing[8] whether or not there is any fusion occurring.[9-10]
 Hagelstein's work at MIT has recently shown that lasers can cause
 interactions with the processes involved.[11]  Department of Energy,
 ENEA, and Navy Research Lab work at Brookhaven has recently shown that
 lasers are useful for studying the anomalies.[12]
 
 I am sure that you want people to think of you as leaving no stone
 unturned in the search for clean energy without nuclear waste.  The
 opportunity to reduce fast neutrons in the production of nuclear
 energy is too great to ignore, and I am certain that Congress will
 agree, if someone of your stature were to propose the investigation.
 Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.
 
 Best regards,
 James Salsman

 -- message sent by NIF contact web form Sunday --
 
 Thank you for taking my question about electroweak-nuclear
 interactions producing fewer fast neutrons at your Maker Faire talk.
 
 It seems that Widom-Larsen theory is the leading explanation of the
 deuterated palladium anomalies.  My assessment of the proportion of
 understood electroweak-nuclear interactions is as confident as your
 assessment if the born secret doctrine hasn't influenced either, but
 how would we know if it had influenced either of our understandings? 
 
 Given that the November, 2009 Scientific American cover story
 contemplates the feasible elimination of fossil fuels in 2030 --
 http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030
 -- I recommend that you encourage the expansion of your facility 
 with a new division to study ways to reduce fast neutron production
 in nuclear energy.
 
 Thank you again for your patient kindness and long-suffering
 tribulations on the forefront of large industrial technology.

 Dear James,
 
 Thanks for your interest.
 
 While I am not expert in these theories it is my current understanding 
 that hard scientific evidence for the ideas around cold fusion has 
 not been well developed. In fact, the whole field of cold fusion 
 remains in flux.
 
 I think that it is fair to say that attempts to measure the anomalous 
 energy production reported by Fleischman and Pons have remained 
 inconsistent and have failed to suggest any plausible underlying 
 physical mechanism.  This may be because  using very generally 
 applicable and acknowledged laws of physics, seem to preclude that 
 nuclear fusion is occurring at observable rates in the &quot;cold fusion&quot; 
 experiments.  Our current understanding of materials, chemistry, and 
 physics cannot explain the reported observations of energy 
 production, but is entirely consistent with the many experiments that 
 have observed no energy.
 
 Of course our role as scientists is to explore the unknown and learn 
 more and more about its underlying causes. Good luck in your research.
 
 Best regards
 emoses

I have been reading Wikipedia and Wikibooks for years, of course, and have been inspired to start editing by [[Wikipedia:User:John_Broughton | John Broughton]]'s book [[Wikipedia:Help:Wikipedia:_The_Missing_Manual | Wikipedia: The Missing Manual]] and the book [[How Wikipedia Works]] by [[Wikipedia:User:Phoebe | Phoebe Ayers]], [[Wikipedia:User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]], and [[Wikipedia:User:Tlogmer | Ben Yates]]. After reading the books for a while, I registered a Wikipedia user name (which carried over to other Wikimedia projects) and began editing here and there. When I see a place where I can copy edit, I copy edit. When I know of a good published source from my own professional research, I add it to an article, rewriting if need be for neutral point of view that reflects verifiable sources. 

I've enjoyed seeing how the Wikimedia projects have improved over the years through the efforts of tens of thousands of volunteers, and I want to be part of that. The Wikimedia projects seem to be a natural outgrowth of a culture long established on Usenet and other online discussion forums of sharing information freely in exchange for other free information.

=== Schooling Background ===

My higher education includes undergraduate study of Chinese, Russian, German, Greek, and Hebrew, with courses in linguistics, teaching English as a second language, library science, and research methods in Sinology. I also have a law degree. I was one of the editors of the law review published at my law school. An interesting elective class I took there was on law and social science, my first formal training in human cognitive illusions (in the context of evaluating the reliability of eyewitness testimony). 

Throughout my schooling, from elementary school through law school, I've really thought of myself as responsible for my own learning, which I pursue through independent reading. I maintain an affiliation with my alma mater's library so that I can have access to scholarly monographs, print journals, and online databases. 

=== Occupational Background ===

During my undergraduate education, I was a student assistant for a computerized database project cataloging serials held by all libraries in two states. I have visited a few other countries in North America or east Asia, living in one of them for two three-year stays. While living overseas between my two degrees, I was a teacher of English as a foreign language and translator, editor, and interpreter. I first learned what was, in essence, a markup language by using [[Wikipedia:WordStar]] on an [[Wikipedia:MP/M]] multi-user computer system for word processing while working as a manuscript and copy editor overseas. 

After returning from my first overseas stay, I was an interpreter on contract for the United States federal government and private clients. I have been to all fifty states of the United States, to the District of Columbia many times, and to the federal territory of Guam. After law school I was a judicial clerk for a state supreme court and a lawyer in private practice. 

=== Current Activities ===

For the last two decades, my occupation has included research on education policy, psychology, gifted education, mathematics, and mathematics pedagogy. I teach mathematics lessons and coach a math team. 

I attempt to maintain a Mandarin and English bilingual household as I now live in Minnesota. I am a homeschooling parent and active volunteer in parent organizations.

== What I Expect to Edit on Wikimedia Projects ==

I expect to be most active in editing articles that fit subjects for which I have primary sources at hand as I am near the computer. I have been a moderator of various online discussion forums since 1993, and I hope that experience also guides my participation in Wikimedia project editing. I have enjoyed reading article discussion pages recently as I get up the [[Wikipedia:Be_bold|boldness]] to plunge into editing articles on controversial subjects.

The one Wikimedia project I would most like to expand is the [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Primary_School_Mathematics Wikiversity Primary School Mathematics] project, and its companion Wikibooks [[Primary_Mathematics]] project. Most of my research and writing these days revolves around that topic or the topic of [[Wikipedia:Intelligence Quotient|IQ testing]].

I saw your note at primary mathematics and thought you'd also like to know our Mathematics Project.  I am freshly trying to restart it now. The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics coverage here. Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;); or actual mathematics content.  Stop by the talk page if we can help you in any way. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:43, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Packages management ==

=== In Terminal ===
: You have to softwares for packages management : &quot;dpkg&quot; and &quot;apt-get&quot;.
:1. If you want to install new software/package from repositories just type in Terminal as root:
 apt-get update
 apt-get install package_name
:2. If you want to install a package &quot;deb&quot; downloaded from other site:
 cd download_folder
 dpkg -i package_name.deb
::a. If a package needs additional dependences and installation has been stoped, then:
 apt-get install -f
::b. If a package has been not configurated correctly, fix it:
 dpkg --reconfigure -a 
:3. Removing packages:
 apt-get remove package_name
:4. Removing package with it's dependences:
 apt-get --purge remove package_name
 apt-get autoremove
:5. Removing old versions of installation packages:
 apt-get autoclean
:6. If you don't know a package name look for it using:
 apt-cache search package_name
  or
 apt-file search package_name
:7. If you want to install &quot;bin&quot; package, make:
 sh package_name.bin
: If the package doesn't have execute rights, change it:
 chmod a+x package_name


=== Packages installation with Synaptic ===
: sidux developers suggest to install packages using &quot;apt-get&quot; command only.
: But you can do it with &quot;apt-get&quot; GUI called Synaptic, if you'd like:
 apt-get install synaptic
: Run Synaptic from: Menu-&gt; System-&gt; Synaptic Package Manager-&gt; type your root password.
:1. First icon &quot;Reload&quot; will refresh packages list.
:2. &quot;Search&quot; icon will help you to find exect software.
:3. When you recive package list mark your one clicking on &quot;Mark for installation&quot; and &quot;Apply&quot;. 
[[File:Package3.png|center|600px]]
:4. Confirm it and wait for finishing, then close Synaptic down.


=== System upgrading ===
:1. sidux developers suggest to make system upgrade using &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; &quot;apt-get&quot; command:
 apt-get update
 apt-get upgrade
  or
 apt-get dist-upgrade
:2. If you want to keep older version of a package (upgrading will not be made), just block it:
  echo package_name hold|dpkg --set-selections
::a. To check blocked packages agains upgrading:
 dpkg --get-selections | grep hold
::b. If you want unblock blocked package for upgrading it: 
 echo package_name install|dpkg --set-selections


=== Other repositories and public key ===
: If you want to install a package from other server, just add an address to repositories list
: using any text editor as a root to file:
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
:2. Then refresh package list with command:
 apt-get update
:2. If you recive a missing public key message so install it:
::a. Sofware makers have public key sometimes to download so take it.
::b. If not add a key using command:
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv key_ID
 gpg --export key_ID | apt-key add -


== System management ==

=== Removing old system kernel ===
: sidux makers upgrade system kernel often but they have given a small script to help removing old one easy.
:1. Menu-&gt; System-&gt; kernel-remover
:2. Mark a kernel version with lower number-&gt; then OK. 
[[File:Pakiet1.png|center|300px]]
:3. Should I remove this kernel? -&gt; OK.
[[File:Pakiet2.png|center|300px]]
: The software doesn't show present version of kernel for removing just old ones but I suggest to not
: removing all of theme, keep one old just in a case.


=== System administration ===
: If you want to make any system changes just run: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Xfce4 Settings Manager.
[[File:Package5.png|center|500px]]
: I'll show you the most important only.
:1. Preferred Applications.
::a. If you want to change any application for your one choose it from the list or &quot;Other&quot;.
[[File:Package6.png|center|500px]]
::b. If you've selected &quot;Other&quot; choose an execute script from &quot;/usr/bin&quot; or your own folder.
[[File:Package7.png|center|500px]]
:2. Removable Drives and Media.
::a. Storage tab: I suggest to not mark &quot;Auto-run&quot; and &quot;Auto-open&quot; programs and files on new drives.
[[File:Package8.png|center|500px]]
::b. Multimedia tab: Play audio or video CD's - choose any media player or do not mark it,
::: so you will run CD's files manually.
[[File:Package9.png|center|500px]]
::c. Cameras tab: Import digital photos when connected - use one of theme: gThumb, F-spot or DigiKam.
[[File:Package10.png|center|500px]]
:3. File Manager: Bahavior tab - Single or Double click to activate items to choose.
[[File:Package11.png|center|500px]]
:4. Workspaces: choose one or more.
[[File:Package12.png|center|500px]]
:5. Desktop: choose a wallpaper, icon size or media mounting on Desktop.
[[File:Package13.png|center|500px]]
:6. Display: choose a screen if you have more then one, its resolution and refresh rate.
[[File:Package14.png|center|500px]]
:7. Window Manager.
::a. Style tab: choose a theme.
[[File:Package15.png|center|500px]]
::b. Keyboard tab: shortcut to manage.
[[File:Package16.png|center|500px]]
:8. Session and Startup.
::a. Splash tab: choose any.
[[File:Package18.png|center|500px]]
::b. Application Autostart: you may add any application to start it when system starts. 
[[File:Package19.png|center|500px]]
:9. Panel: castomize the panel settings - size, position, autohide or add new one.
[[File:Package20.png|center|500px]]
:10. Appearance: change windows style, icons theme or fonts.
[[File:Package21.png|center|500px]]


=== Working on files ===

==== Midnight Commander ====
: Sometimes you have to work on files and folders (often as a root).
: One of the best way is using terminal's Midnight Commander:
[[File:Package4.png|center|500px]]
 su
 root password
 mc 
::a. To copy a file/folder mark it in one window and click F5 key, it do that to a folder in second window.
::b. To move a file/folder use F6 key.
::c. If you want to delete a file/folder use F8.
::d. F7 key creates new folder.
::e. If you want to make a view for a file use F3 key, to edit it F4.


==== In Terminal ====
:2. Another way to make all the works is typing a command in Terminal:
::a. To create a file:
 touch /home/user_name/new_file
::b. To create folder:
 mkdir /home/user_name/folder_name
::c. To copy a file:
 cp /path_to_file /path_to_new_folder
::d. To copy a folder:
 cd -r /path_to_folder /path_to_new_folder
::e. To remove a file:
 rm /path_to_file
::f. To remove folder:
 rm -r /path_to_folder
::g. If a folder is not empty:
 rm -rf /path_to_folder
::h. To check files in a folder:
 ls
::i. To go to a folder one level lower:
 cd folder_name
::j. To go to a folder one level upper:
 cd ..
::k. To go to other folder:
 cd /folder_patch


==== Thunar ====
:  Another way to do that with graphic application is using Thunar File Manager with mouse helps menu.


=== GRUB boot loader ===
: GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package installed in main drive sector.
: It can run many operating systems.
: There is Grub version 2 provided with sidux.
:1. If you can't find all installed systems on your hard drive on boot loader list, type in Terminal as root:
 su
 update-grub
: Changes will be effective after reboot system.
:2. If you want to change system startup delay (it's normally 5 sec.) just edit the file as root:
 sux 
 mousepad /etc/default/grub
: and change the line: GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 for any you'd like and save the file.
[[File:Package30.png|center|500px]]


: More about GRUB2 read on the project page: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-2.en.html
: And on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB


=== Time zone ===
: If your system's clock doesn't display exect time, just reconfigure it:
: Terminal as root:
 dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
: Choose a continent first and a town after.


=== Default system language ===
: To change it just type in Terminal as root:
 dpkg-reconfigure locales
: Depending of &quot;locales&quot; package version mark your language or choose from a list (I suggest UTF8).  


== Personalization ==

=== Adding new entry to Menu  ===
: Most applications installers have scripts adding entry to Menu but sometimes you have to do it yourself.
: Terminal as a root:
 sux
 mousepad /usr/share/applications/application_name.desktop
: And type it in the new file:
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Application name
 Comment=What is it for
 Exec=/path_to_execute_file
 Icon=/path_to_graphic_file(icon)
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Software-categorie
: Save the file and close Mousepad down. There is en example for &quot;Touchepad&quot; application below:
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Touchpad
 Exec=gsynaptics
 Icon=/home/pavroo/Icons/touchpad.png
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Settings;
: The icon file patch can be different.


=== Desktop theme changing ===
:1. Wallpaper: download new one from: [http://gnome-look.org/ gnome-look.org] for example or use any picture.
::a. Right click on your picture and choose: &quot;Set as wallpaper&quot;
:2. Icons: download a set of icons from the same webside.
::a. Extract it.
::b. Open Terminal as root and run &quot;mc&quot; then move extracted new icon folder to: &quot;/usr/share/icons&quot;.
::c. Choose new icon theme from: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Appearance-&gt; Icons tab-&gt; choose the new one or any.
::d. Icon size changing: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Desktop-&gt; Icons tab-&gt; Icon size.
:3. Style: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Appearance-&gt; Style tab-&gt; choose any.
:4. Login window: download new one from the same webside from DGM Themes department.
::a. Open: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Login Window-&gt; Local tab.
::b. Click on &quot;Add&quot; and choose downloaded package.
::c. Mark it and close the window down, the new login style will be working after next log in.


=== Panel castomize ===
: Panel applets make faster access to many system and personal functions. I'll show you a few only.
[[File:Package22.png|center|500px]]
:1. Action Buttons lets you block desktop or shut system down in quick way.
[[File:Package29.png|center|300px]]
:2. DateTime adds a clock, date and calendar.
[[File:Package28.png|center|300px]]
:3. Weather Update brings temperature, atmosphere pressure, humidity, wind speed, etc.

[[File:Package26.png|center|500px]]
:7. Xfce4 Stopper just let you set a timer up.
[[File:Package27.png|center|300px]]


== Users and groups ==

=== User account changes ===
:1. To add new user type in Terminal as root:
 adduser new_user_name
:2. If you want to change your password type in Terminal (not as root):
 passwd
 Changing password for your_name
 Old password: ''type your present password''
 Enter the new password (minimum 5, maximum 8 characters).
 Please use a combination of upper and lower case letters and numbers.
 New password: ''type your new password''
 Re-enter new password: ''re-type your new password''
 Password changed
:3. Removing an user:
 userdel user_name
:4. Removing an user with its home folder and all files:
 userdel -r user_name


=== Root account changes ===
:1. To change root password make (if you know it):
 su
 ''type present root password''
 passwd root
 New password UNIX: ''type new root password''
 Re-enter new password for UNIX: ''re-type new root password''
:2. To change root password (if you forgot or don't know it):
::a. Run computer from sidux LiveCD or any Linux Live distribition.
::b. Open Terminal as root:
:::* check root &quot;/&quot; partition name (it's &quot;/dev/sda6&quot; on my computer):
 su or sudo (depends of Live distribution)
 fdisk -l
:::* create new folder &quot;sid_temp&quot; for example in &quot;media&quot; folder:
 mkdir /media/sid_temp
:::* mount root &quot;/&quot; partition of hard drive file system in Live system:
 mount /dev/sda6 /media/sid_temp
:::* check has been it mounted correctly:
 cd /media/sid_temp
 ls
:::* and change unknown root password for new one:
 chroot /media/sda6 passwd
 Enter new UNIX password:
 Retype new UNIX password:
 passwd: password updated successfully
[[File:Pakiet32.png|center|600px]]


=== Operations on groups ===
:1. To create a new group:
 groupadd group_name
:2. To remove a group:
 groupdel group_name
:3. To add an user to a group:
 adduser user_name group_name


== Security ==

=== Basic informations ===
:1. The main system security thing is the system itself becouse the system is locked with root password;
:: demaging it is very difficult.
:2. Linux file system is virus-proof for most known malwares.
:3. Regular updating remove mistakes and provides new applications functions.


=== Firewall ===
: The firewall keeps out incoming access to your computer from outside.
: So the first thing after system installation is the firewall activation.
: You can do that in a few ways, just have a look: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Post-installation_work#Firewall Sidux/Post-installation work/Firewall]


=== Antivirus application ===
: Sincerely - you don't need it at all but you can use it for outgoing e-mails scanning
: - most our friends use diffrent operating system; and for external drives scanning befor
: connecting theme to the diffrent OS.


: If you'd like try an antivirus application avilable from Debian's repositories ClamAV with KlamAV GUI:
 apt-get install clamav klamav

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Judenplatz museum stands on the site of a synagogue that was destroyed in 1421, after having only been standing for one year.  The Judenplatz museum in Vienna honors the 65,000 Austrian Jews who were killed by the Nazi’s during the holocaust. The unique façade is intended to honor those dead. The building’s architect designed the memorial as a cube, representing a library with books turned inside out, along the outer wall. 

It is possible for anyone in the world to look up the historical information on anyone of the 65,000 individuals who died during the Holocaust. In that sense the effect of the event has become global. Jewish citizens who cannot visit Prague may now look up the background of an ancestor who they are connected too. Also researchers can use information from that period to better solidify their own studies of the period.

In Prague, the oldest Jewish cemetery dates back to 1439. It is located in the Jewish quarter of Prague in a town named Josefov. The town was named after a late ruler of Czechoslovakia who was a staunch supporter of the Jewish community. The Jewish cemetery is noteworthy because of the density of individuals buried at the site. Before being closed to burials, it eventually accepted 200,000 residents of the Jewish community. When navigating the cemetery grounds a person will not see nameplates on the stones. In place of a name will be a unique marker such as an animal, instrument, or other item that represents the name and the individuals place in society. The cemetery recently made global news when First Lady Michelle Obama took a tour of the site.

Neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism is a problem that affects both Austria and the Czech Republic. In 1947 Austria passed a very strict anti-Neo Nazi law that goes as far as offering police protection to places the Jewish community frequent. Recent population records in Austria report the Jewish population being at 8 million. In the Czech Republic there are laws that prevent public displays of hate against the Jewish community. Despite the law supporters of the neo-Nazi ideology still openly propagate their message in public, through protests. In Austria a recent example from May of 2009 suggests that neo-Nazi supporters are capable of carrying out attacks against the Jewish community. A ground of masked gunmen attacked, with “air gun pellets”, a procession of Jewish concentration camp survivors. 

The United States Department of State reports on issues of anti-Semitism around the world and in the Czech Republic in recent years there have been numerous examples of young people who deface Jewish gravestones with swastikas and for the use of language such as “Heil Hitler.” In Austria the issue is much worse. In 2003 there was 122 reported incidents with the worst being a bomb threat at a Jewish school.

Some exercises are optional and some are more suited to certain types of ocarinas.  '''We need a way to tab the some of the exercises with various different tabs'''.

'''This Chapter should be divided up into Lessons and as a starting point the Mezzetti music should be added here.  Further discussion can be had on the discussion page.'''

{{TODO|Download the Mezzetti book, pick a musical lesson that has not been posted and transcribe it in your favourite composing software editor.  Export the files and upload them here, licensing them so that we can do whatever we want with them.}}

==Introduction==

A keymap is a keyboard layout for foreign languages. Like for example the german keyboard has a different layout (the 'ä', 'ö' and 'ü' keys and other german special keys) and a keymap 'maps' the keys to the right characters for the programs. 

Here is a list of the AROS symbol and the different Kickstart symbol shown for several key combinations. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Alt-1: inverted exclamation mark (¡) / superscript 1 (¹)
Alt-2: @ / superscript 2 (²)
Alt-3: £ / superscript 3 (³)
Alt-4: Euro (€) / cent (¢)
Alt-5: half (½) / quarter (¼)
Alt-6: three-quarters (¾) / half (½)
Alt-7: { / three-quarters (¾)
Alt-8: [ / bullet (•)
Alt-9: ] / left chevron («)
Alt-0: } / right chevron (»)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, in Kickstart pressing Alt and various letters shows a variety of symbols. With the AROS default keymap doing that just shows the letter itself.

==Introduction==

The oop.library allows drivers to use a OO (Object Oriented design). HIDDs are another example of OO usage in AROS.

==Examples==






==Discussion only - OOP Binary Object Model?==

The case for a binary object model. The ability to be able to use C++ and other programming languages from a VM that statically compiles at install time, especially if you want to ditch the JIT in the process.

Also, I'll be needing to wrap any usage of OS-specific structures or variables in a library that links at install time as well.  This could simply be a hosted AROS though. 

But Amiga style libraries are not objects in any meaningful way. The object-orientation in AmigaOS are not centered around libraries, but around other structures. Moving towards more OO might be interesting, but adding interfaces to the libraries isn't achieving that. 

In order to do OOP as a binary object model, I got the source to Marius Schwarz' [http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/oop4a OOP4a]. There were some serious flaws in it.  It used linear searches to find the names of the commands and didn't support interface inheritance.  I know how to do Java-style interfaces in a .library but the dependence on the linear name lookups made things unusable.

When I started making my Object.library implementation I decided that interface inheritance is preferable to multiple inheritance because it yields no dreaded diamond dependencies.  I used hash tables to do name lookups instead of a linear search and wrote it in C rather than 68k Assembly.  I'm not quite sure how AROS does its library headers without FD files but I realize that they have to be processor independent on AROS.

This brings us back to the subject:  A binary object model.  OOP4a used subdirectories within libs:classes/ on 68k AmigaOS to indicate the inheritance structure hierarchy of the prototype class libraries that it came with.  This would keep the namespaces separate from between the libraries so that no object would interfere with the name of another object (within reason).  I was going to use a separate interface file for each interface in a libs:interfaces/ directory that would be a global repository of all interfaces other than the direct inheritance interface (referred to on OS 4 as &quot;main&quot;).  The direct inheritance interface could be contained in the same directory as the library it defines even though my original plan was to use a hash table for the name lookup.

The way inheritance was implemented in OOP4a was for a parent link to be held in the library's global area in the positive offsets of A6.  This meant that when opening a class library, its parent directory would be accessed and the parent library opened initiating recursion leading up to root class where a null was encountered.  In my Object.library implementation the Object.library class was the root class anyway thus eliminating some specialized cases where a parent class might not have a name lookup, and so on.

oop.library is doing some of these things but I'm convinced it is the right way to do this.
I do like Amiga LVO tables over hash tables to avoid the name binding during load. I could maybe live with one hash table for the directories and then LVO tables in each directory. 

I think the OS4 interfaces of the libraries are actually doing this also. It allows to have different interfaces in one library with each having their own name and LVO table. 

It does require that the developer tells which method or function comes at which place in the LVO table during compilation of the library though.

Recreating OS 4-style interface tables is easy. What bothers me about the interfaces is that you need a pointer to the interface in whatever register (preferably a different register for each interface on PPC and other register-rich processors).  I'd assume that the base pointer for the library would be contained in the interface structure as well.

After having heard the objections to the hash table name lookup, I can tell that it would be slow to open such a library.  Likewise the inheritance chain would be even slower since it would have to execute a name lookup for each stage of direct inheritance until it was resolved.  This brings us to the big question:  How would we store the interfaces if they were more than just a name?  Fat pointers?  Making the hash lookup faster by using the same hash for each stage of inheritance?

A framework should not require a name-mangling scheme but instead, uses subdirectories within libs: to organize the namespace dependencies and support Java-style interface inheritance as well.  The downside is that I'm planning on using hash-tables of names instead of requiring FD or SFD files like AmigaOS does for its libraries to initialize its vtables.

When I looked at the source to OOP.library I didn't like the way that it did everything at runtime.  I was going to make Object.library to supplement OOP.library.  Do you think that would be suitable or should it be added directly to Exec.library like OS 4 does it?  My concern with doing it too much like OS 4 does it is that OS 4 has a utility to generate the C skeleton code from XML descriptors derived from an SFD file.  This means that making a compiler for a language other than C to generate libraries, that makes things very tricky.

In order to allow LLVM to generate code for multiple flavors of AROS, I have to replace or wrap some functions of the C runtime library in other code to make sure that they don't make assumptions about variable sizes and structure sizes. 
In GCC sizeof and offsetof are rendered as macros for minimum overhead but this gets in the way of portability so they will need to be implemented with functions.

If we wanted to take it a step or two farther and make it generate code for all OSs, we'd need to make no assumptions about the structures themselves, thus FILE * would have to be replaced by void * (or i8 * as LLVM represents it; a pointer to a byte) in every instance in the wrapper code only to be reverted to FILE * at second link time on the destination platform.  For an early attempt at wrapping the C stdio.h headers in cross-platform LLVM code, you can look at the project the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/llvmlibc/ Mattathias] team started at in the SVN browser. 

Clearly the LVO method is faster at load time, and load time linking can be *slow* - witness apps like OpenOffice where optimizing load time linking has been a significant part of speeding up the application startup on Linux. But I'm unsure how much it would matter in most cases...

There's also nothing that precludes supporting/using both direct offsets and offering name lookups. E.g. I'm plodding along on a Ruby compiler (in Ruby), and while I use C++ style vtables where possible, it also needs to support name lookups because if certain constructs are used in Ruby you can't determine at compile time the full set of method names that will be used, and you also need to support &quot;send&quot; which means it needs a name =&gt; method mapping. So I have the vtables, but will add a hash table that maps names to vtable slots for cases where it's not feasible to determine the offset at compile time.

E.g. adding a function pointer to the library definitions that can be used to query the library for meta-data such as name =&gt; lvo lookup at runtime would be a fairly non-invasive change that would only slow down apps that for whatever reason actually need name based lookup.





As for the OOP method used in AmigaOS and AROS, that is slow on a whole another level... It made sense on Amiga hardware because it can be made very memory efficient, but there are approaches that can be made far faster and allow the same extensibility... I'm not sure if it matters though - one thing we really ought to have for both cases would be some real measurements and profiling..

The practical use case was never introduced on OS4, unfortunately. What the OS4 interfaces try to mimic a little bit, is the COM known on Windows or XPCOM known from mozilla suite. There, you have objects which can implement several interfaces, all of them inherited from IUnknown. 

The COM method QueryInterface is replaced in exec by exec.library/GetInterface. The COM/XPCOM solution can, in contrast to OS4 version, be called on *any* interface we want. COM-style objects would serve the same type of purpose on OS 4 if there were additional programming languages available.  Unfortunately there are none. C++ classes need interfaces to implement themselves in a binary library format though.

This [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARruTS7x_Cf8ZGZxanZ2c2RfMWN4aHpqMmQ2&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CLOrsRk link] has some C-like pseudo-code demonstrating the implementations and usages of an interface in an interface-inheritance chain. 

This [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARruTS7x_Cf8ZGZxanZ2c2RfMGM4cTQ1dGNw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CMuW7ooK link] is a higher-level pseudo-code if you want a guide to how the low-level C code works.

None at the moment. And, as far as I know, only few system libraries are using anything else than the &quot;main&quot; interface (most famous example is expansion.library and it's pci interface)

I suggest reading [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:f4f3KSDwFEMJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.42.9750%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dps+protocol+extension+franz&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk this] for inspiration:

Protocol Extension: A technique for Structuring Large Extensible Software Systems (Dr. Michael Franz, 1994)

Protocol Extension uses vtables, but allows them to be dynamically updated at runtime by propagating changes down the inheritance chain.Calls are far faster than Amiga/AROS BOOPSI-style dispatch - the vtable for the most derived classes always holds the right method pointer to call, so the cost compared to C++ virtual calls is just an extra indirection.

The downside is that plain vtables would grow large if the class hierarchy is large since every class vtable needs a slot for every possible method. This can be mitigated by splitting the API's into smaller interfaces that are not inherited from a single root class, in effect creating a shallow, sparse trie of method pointers.

You still have the lookup cost if you want name based lookup of course, but for apps that can be compiled against a symbol table containing the static method id's you very good performance with flexibility as good as dispatcher function based OO systems like BOOPSI (as you can add/remove methods at runtime as long as the vtables are big enough, with a fallback to a dispatcher as the worst case for fully dynamic calls).

(incidentally Franz' wrote his PhD on a method for architecture independent binaries called Semantic Dictionary Encoding; more recently his claim to fame is trace trees, together with Andreas Gal, as used by TraceMonkey and LuaJIT)





I think I may limit the subdirectory thing to namespace resolution.  Other than that, most of what I had already written looks good.  I planned on having LVOs as well as a name lookup originally.  This saves me from having a separate file for the method names in the interface files.  Also, unlike the Protocol Extension technique, I'll maintain a root class since it only defined a &quot;toString&quot; method anyway, though I may rename the method &quot;DebugPrint&quot;.

I thought at least in part it was to cope with the `problem' that amigaos libraries can only version forward and must remain 100% backward compatible.  The only real way to reset the interfaces to remove deprecated snot is to put a version in the library name, and then you're stuck with lots of libraries.  Of course except for amigaos-only libraries there's no practical way to do anything else, so the usefulness of this idea probably isn't huge.  I think it's used for things like MMU support too which are system specific.

But as with system libraries in general it isn't really a solution intended for application programming which is why boopsi was created.

Note that the 'C-object' based mechanism (i.e. structs in structs) has lots of shortcomings too.  This is what glib and gtk+ uses and after a lot of over-engineering they managed to address most problems - such as structure sizes growing breaking binary compatibility (store a separate private data chunk which is allocated and used more like the
way boopsi allocates objects), add interfaces (look it up in a cast at run-time called from a simple function), property handlers, events, and so on.  But it's big, slow, hard to use requires a ton of boilerplate, and in general just not very nice ... it's been a few years since I've used it but I don't think the core has changed much since then.

* every public function (and most internal ones, sigh) has a 'cast'  macro which checks the class type of the object using a tree scan, or a linear scan iirc for interfaces (actually most USERS of an object do another cast which did this
same check too - so error messages point to the source ...) (and usually every member access either uses a macro too or calls another function which does, or uses the get/set interface) 
* private data requires a class lookup (same as boopsi for data pointer), and also means every object instantiation is at least 2 allocated memory blocks 
* IIRC every 'property' is keyed on a string which it has to look up in a global table to convert to a dynamic integer which then needs an if/then if/else tree to process since it isn't static (i.e. much worse than boopsi).
* the event handling was stuff of nightmares, i don't think anybody deserves to know how that works.

Note that a lot of the mess was supposedly to support language bindings to things other than c.

It's possible to fix some of that with a simpler implementation but you're still stuck with some serious limitations since it is essentially a static binding.  So it's still difficult to cope with versioning and binary compatibility and dynamic interfaces. 

x86 is particularly good at executing crappy branchy code, and cpu's are so damn fast anyway i doubt moving to another outdated technique will really be worth it unless you gained a lot.  And by the time you add all the necessary baggage I have a good feeling you probably wont. There are always trade-offs ...

Also depends on the problem being fixed.  e.g. 'i want to write/call system libraries in/from c++' is different to 'i want a c-based application level object system'. 

I am not satisfied with our current oop.library implementation. So I did not put any effort in it as I first want to improve the whole OO system. I find there is still too much happening during a method call. I have some ideas but no time to test if my ideas make any sense. If anyone wants to have a look I can try to put down my rough &amp; vague ideas.

==Introduction==


The AOS3 icon info has a priority adjuster. Wonder how the priority can be stored in an icon. These priority adjusters are features of RAWBInfo. workbench.lib's own info window will display them as tooltypes. The normal &quot;Priority&quot; setting corresponds to the TOOLPRI tooltype which is mapped to the NP_Priority tag for CreateNewProc() in workbench.library. For autostart applications in SYS:WBStartup RAWBInfo will display two additional elements for the launch sequence priority (STARTPRI=&lt;-128..+127&gt;) and the optional delay to wait for the application to terminate (WAIT=&lt;seconds&gt;, seconds==0 means 'don't wait'). All tooltypes default to zero.

Please, don't forget to change the array &quot;layout_expansion_table&quot; in the file &quot;workbench/prefs/input/prefs.c&quot; when you add/change keymap names. 



===SetFunction===


Its been pointed out that workbench.library may be better implemented by merging Workbook and workbench.library.
Wanderer would Exec/SetFunction the routines it needs to override, instead of using the rather limited message passing mechanism we currently have. 

If there are no objections, I would like to implement this, by merging Workbook and workbench.library, and updating Wanderer to SetFunction the necessary parts of workbench.library. Well, its against the philosophy of the AROS implementation of workbench.library (which is meant to be &quot;client&quot; agnostic) - however ive already started using SetFunction localy anyhow in my own code. It does mean I will have to rework my AppIcon/Menu code though. 
In the past people have been talking about some kind of registration API in workbench.library. So that any Workbench implementation like Workbook, Wanderer, ScaleOS could register so that they get the needed information when workbench.library function are called. This way also several workbench implementation could be registered at the same time. 




===AppIcon===

I have a questions about AppIcon interfaces.

Currently the interactions look like this:

Application &lt;--A-&gt; workbench.library &lt;-B-&gt; &quot;workbench replacement&quot;

The interfaces between application and workbench.library (A) are public and defined since release 2.0. On the other hand, I was not able to locate any information about interfaces between workbench.library and &quot;workbench replacement&quot; (B). I checked Amiga Developer CD 2.1 RKMS, AmigaOS 4 SDK and MorphOS SDK.

Does anyone know if there is any standardization on this interface between Amiga-like OSs?

Does anyone know how &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; application on Classic Amigas are doing it? Are they providing their own workbench.library replacements/function patches? That is the normal behaviour.  AROS's workbench.library is more of a special case, and &quot;tries&quot; to be generic.  Normally it is down to the workbench replacements to implement their own workbench.library, or patch the functions in the original. 

Additionally, were there any designs and plans in the past to implement the AROS specific interface for (B)? I checked our workbench.library and it has some AROS-specific functions, but this support looks like work-in-progress rather than finished/frozen API.

Is this (patching) also the way you want to port Scalos to AROS? It seems to me each &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; will have to carry some amount of duplicated code this way - for example registering appicons and communication with them. I'm wondering whether it would not make sense to redo current AROS extension functions to allow sending messages from &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; to Application via workbench.library - there already is one such function in the API - SendAppWindowMessage




===Alternatives===

The task of making a new Wanderer file browser, could involve making it a bit more modular one that includes an abstraction layer to allow different types of items to be displayed in it.  Case in point:  An object-oriented graphical programming language could be implemented in the plugin format to make an AmigaVision-style scripting engine.  Since it would be fully graphical and use the analogy of a directory structure, it would bring many people into the high-level programming arena to contribute code.

This isn't the first time the idea has been brought up. It was discussed once before on [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?viewmode=flat&amp;topic_id=3827&amp;forum=2 AROS-Exec]. 

Want to make the browser aspect kind of like a datatype for directory structures and other hierarchical data formats.  (XML, anyone?)  Maybe we could even make the new Wanderer like a Multiview and Workbench rolled into one program. Of course this should be a longer-term goal than ABI 1.0 so it would be a worthy goal for AROS 2.0. 

For the long term solution, I'd suggest making AROS extensions to workbench.library and icon.library which multiple apps can register with, use and get notifications. If remember correctly this should already be the case or the basics should be available in workbench.library. See RegisterWorkbench()/UnregisterWorkbench(); appicon support seems not available. App developers should be able to give users a workbench like experience on their own screens (for example open a drawer and show the icons of only PNG files and let the user drag it over to a document they're working on) as well as allowing a system wide workbench functions to operate on multiple public screens, or give  the user the freedom to have multiple &quot;workbench&quot; programs running at the same time to decide what they like best, if they so choose. 

The commodore examples for AppMenu, AppIcon, AppWindow are available in the Aminet archive  http://aminet.net/dev/misc/AmigaMail.lha 

uncompress the lzh file in the downloaded lha archive and look in the am_Jul91/AppWorkbench directory. 

While generally in favour of trying to implement things in a generic way - while working on wanderer I came to the conclusion that it would be pointless/overkill. 

* It will likely only be ever fully used by Wanderer (and perhaps workbook).  It makes no sense for existing Workbench replacements to have their internals reworked just to be able to use these specific extensions. 

* It would mean backporting Wanderer to amigaos/other also needs the special workbench.library. 

* It already has had some hard coded wanderer specific and workbook specific changes.  It would be easier to maintain these in patch functions (imho) 

* The existing functions only expose the appicon/menu objects themselves so the &quot;handler&quot; has no way to communicate to the applications themselves with the need to invent more aros specific functions.  Even the implemented code is incomplete (it lacks the ability to inform the handler a new object is added for instance).  It would be easier to maintain handler specific implementations of this stuff imho (since it is very much tied to the workings of the handler in question) 

* How WorkbenchControlA will operate is also undefined. 

... + a few other reasons.

==Introduction==

The arosc library only allows that one task at a time calls a function with the same libbase. AFAIK this does not break any standards. In a later stage a thread implementation will be provided that will to do proper locking around the C functions that need, this should also be usable when you implement your own thread implementation. 

Current arosc is not thread-save and the C libs in ABI V1 neither. The best way to get is have a front-end similar to clib2-ts on AROS. 

YAM is not using any threading library but its own thread implementation. And even if it would use stuff like pthreads it is the C runtime lib's task to protect its internal stuff from race conditions. No thread framework is able to take this load off the C lib, because this is internal stuff. 

For AROS' arosc.library a simple ObtainSemaphore()/ReleaseSemaphore() pair around all implicit and explicit accesses to the __stdio_files list would be a good start. However, there will very probably be many more locations which require enforced single threading to avoid race conditions. 

As an intermediate solution already a static link library can be provided that does the proper locking around the function that need it, e.g. arosc-ts (analog to clib2-ts). 

Perhaps you should contact Olaf Barthel and port over his clib2 to AROS. I already asked him and he has no objections against such a port. The more systems use clib2 the more possible bugs will be found.
I think clib2 C implementation as a static link library would complement the AROS C shared libraries for the programs that depend on certain clib2 peculiarities. 

This may be a bit naive, we may need to consider an OpenLibrary() of the AROS C *shared* library for each thread. That eliminates the locking issue, we just need to make the AROS C data area private to each thread.

This may need some headers and linker support, but it should be much easier to implement than a full locking implementation, and would be a lightweight code change. That is not what users want. They want to be able to have one thread do IO with a file opened by another thread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Particle model|Next=Gas pressure}}

This chapter, as mentioned in the previous, is about using the particle model to explain the three states of matter.

== To explain the three states ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! State
! Model
! Explanation
|-
| Solid
| [[File:Solid particles.svg|200px]]
| In solids, the particles are cramped together tightly in regular positions, and they can only vibrate (wobble) a little, but in fixed positions. Their positions cannot change freely, as a result.
|-
| Liquid
| [[File:Teilchenmodell Fluessigkeit.svg]]
| In liquids, the positions of particles are not fixed like in solids, but the particles cannot move as freely as those in gas, as they can only slide over one another. They are arranged irregularly.
|-
| Gas
| [[File:Gas particle movement.svg|200px]]
| In gases, the positions of particles can alter easily, as the particles move at random directions very quickly. The particles are not packed tightly like those of the two states above, and are arranged irregularly. The particles can be very far apart!
|}

== To explain the properties of each of the states ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! State
! Model(s)
! Flexibility of shape
! Compressibility
|-
| Solid
| [[File:Solid particles incompressible.svg|200px]]
| Solids have a fixed shape; their shape cannot be altered.
| Solids have a fixed volume; you cannot compress them.
|-
| Liquid
| [[File:Teilchenmodell Fluessigkeit.svg|200px]]
[[File:Liquid model.svg|143px]]
| Liquids do not have fixed shapes. As you can see, the shape can alter depending on the shape of the container.
| Liquids have a fixed volume. You can see from the model that there are the same number of liquid particles and that the size of the particles are the same.
|-
| Gas
| [[File:Gas particles in a square.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Gas particles in a triangle.svg]]
| Gas particles do not have a fixed shape so you can safely bend them and they won't even break. In the model, the shape of the particles changed from the shape of a square and the shape of a triangle.
| Gas particles are perfectly compressible, as opposed to the above two. That means you can press it and it will actually become smaller. Then if you put them in a really big container, it will spread all around the container, through [[../Diffusion|diffusion]]. Note that the triangle here is a lot smaller than the square.
|-
|}

== Quiz ==
#Briefly explain, in your own words, the different properties of the three states of matter and arrangement and movement of their particles.
#Go to the library or search the Internet about 'plasma' the 'fourth' state of matter, and write about 200 words about it.

Answers will vary.

&lt;s&gt;{{trans}}&lt;/s&gt;  I feel it fails to fall under our scope. There are no references give, or that I know of, and this seems indistinguishable from original research to me.  But, since it appears to have been published elsewhere, and appears to have a free license, it would fall under [[s:Wikisource:What_is_Wikisource|Wikisource]].  If we can verify it was published in some form elsewhere we should transwiki it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:07, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{del}} I did a little further investigating.  A transwiki doesn't make sense, as this book used to be at Wikisource. It then got deleted over copyright concerns, but still occurs as a redlink at [[s:Author:Shriram_Sharma_Acharya]].  Basically this is a previously published work which is not annotated.  Per our policy on annotated texts, &quot;..we do not permit verbatim copies of pre-existing works...&quot; So this book doesn't fall under our scope.  If someone is looking for it, and it really is freely available, they can request an undeletion at wikisource.

{{del}} - I have to say that the phrase &quot;copyright concerns&quot; rather caught my eye. If it's possible copyvio at Wikisource, should we not also be concerned about it being possible copyvio here?

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  Before my reasons, let me point out for the benefit of other readers, this was nominated for deletion previously, and its discussion can be read [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/AAVE|here]].  I agree this seems to be a very stalled stub.  I say we provisionally keep it.  The hope being under Linguistics, someone interested will find it and improve it.  But I feel if it has not recieved significant attention within... say a year, it would be appropriate to delete it.

:Hi, I'm new to Wiki, but not so to Linguistics and I saw the original page for this and knew it needed some updates. As i'm figuring out all the interfaces here I will be updating the AAVE page as well as similar ones, so hopefully there'll be no reason to delete a topic as interesting as AAVE [[User:Sociolinguist|Sociolinguist]] ([[User talk:Sociolinguist|talk]]) 08:26, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

==Introduction==

The preparation for trial can be summarized generally into 
# develop the theory and theme(s) for your case
# outline the elements that you need to prove to be successful in your case
# select the witnesses and exhibits you will call 
##match at least one witness to each of the elements needed to be proven
##evaluate the witnesses based on their purpose, and
##identify problems they may present
# outline cross examinations of the otherside's witnesses
# review your theory, themes,and outlines

==Organizing the File==

===Trial Materials===
There are a number of endorsed methods of preparing and organizing materials for trial. There is:
# the Trial Brief and Trial Book&lt;ref&gt;JW McElhaney, ''Trial Notebook''&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Trial Notebook &lt;ref&gt;David Baum, ''Art of Advocacy Preparation''&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Trial Folder &lt;ref&gt;LR booth, &quot;Throw away your trial notebook&quot; (1988) 24 Trial 53&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Trial Brief and Notebook====
A '''trial brief''' and '''trial book''' are documents that contain all the materials that you will need for trial. 

The '''trial brief''' consists of all official documents and materials relevant to the trial matter. That should be on hand during the trial 
proceedings.
 
This should include:
# the indictment or information that outline the charges
# a summary of the case 
# investigation materials 
# police notes 
# witness statements
# medical/expert reports
# court orders
# other official documents (driving abstracts, etc.)
# demonstrative evidence
# correspondence
# legal memos
# case law

The '''trial book''' contains mostly the advocates work-product. This includes:
# a to do list
# witness list
# elements of the offence and an analysis of them
# Exhibit list
# notes for any motions
# outline of opening address
# notes for witness examinations 
# notes of evidence to present
# outline of closing address 
# notes on the charge to the jury
# potential grounds of appeal

===Motions===
The advocate must consider whether to prepare motions for the commencement of trial and equally whether motions from the opposing side are to be anticipated. 

Motions to be considered at the outset:
* exclusion of witnesses
* exclusion of evidence (notice required)
* adjournment
* directed verdict
* severance
* change of venue
* quashing the indictment

==Preparing Witnesses==
Counsel should prepare all essential witnesses who provide non-trivial evidence in trial. 

The most important goal is to refresh the witnesses memory of the incident. Counsel should speak with the witnesses and review the facts of the case and have them review their prior statement.

Counsel should also consider:
* the order in which to call witnesses 
* whether the client wishes to testify

==Effective Presentation and Style==
A trial, in many respects, is a performance with as much drama as is found on TV or on film. Likewise, persuasion exists not just on the level of the substance of a presentation but also in the form of presentation. As such, the advocate's style of presentation can  be just as important as the actual content and structure of an argument. An effective style may come naturally to some, but others will need to practice and refine their presentation to be an effective advocate.

An effective advocate will have control over their voice and body language while presenting. It is a whole package.

Confidence is key. You must appear to be in charge from the very beginning.

===Voice===
There are certain necessary qualities of an effective voice.
* speak slowly
* speak clearly
* speak loudly

===Body language===
Qualities of good body language:
* look the person you are addressing in the eye
* good posture
* take up space with your body

Much of a person's communication comes from non-verbal sources. A nervous tick or a habit that connotes uncertainty or weakness will have an impression on the audience. Negative unconscious body language must be eliminated.

Actions that should be avoided:
* slouching
* fidgeting with papers
* looking down too much
* rocking back and forth
* too much politeness and deference

===Use of Notes===
While having prepared materials for trial are essential, it is generally said that extemporaneous presentation is more effective and persuasive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Energy Change ==
Energetics is all about the energy transfer involved in the  making and breaking of bonds.  The breaking of a bond involves the injection of energy into the system so that the bond can no longer hold the parts together; the creation of bonds involves the removal of energy from the system so that components are captured by the binding forces.  In a typical reaction some bonds are broken and some are created so some energy is injected and some is removed.  Whether the total(net) of these amounts to an injection or removal determines whether the reaction is endothermic (involving an net injection of energy) or exothermic (involving a net removal of energy.)

== Enthalpy change (ΔH) ==

The simple idea described above is complicated by the interaction of the system(reaction) being studied and its environment. This interaction amounts to the changes in volume of the system brought about by the reaction.  To deal with this complexity we introduce the idea of enthalpy(given the symbol H). Enthalpy is not measured directly: we concern ourselves instead with CHANGES in enthalpy (ΔH) resulting from a reaction.

For a given reaction change in Enthalpy is equal to the heat energy change under conditions of constant pressure.

===Exothermic===
*negative ΔH
Such reactions include the combustion of a fuel like methane
CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)                = -890kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
Also including the oxicdation of carbohydrates such sa glucose C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

===Endothermic===
*positive ΔH
Such reactions include the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate
CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) → CaO (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)                                               = +178kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

;Enthalpy change
:The heat energy transferred under constant pressure.
:ΔH = ΔH products – ΔH reactants

;Standard conditions
We often deal with enthalpy change under standard conditions. i.e.
:100kPa, 298K
;Standard enthalpy of formation
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^{\ominus}_f&lt;/math&gt;
:The enthalpy change when 1 mole of compound in its standard state is formed from its elements in their standard states (under standard conditions).
;Standard enthalpy of combustion
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^{\ominus}_c&lt;/math&gt;
:The enthalpy change when 1 mole of substance is completely burned in oxygen under standard conditions.

== Calorimetry ==
===Calculating energy changes===

*&lt;math&gt;q=mc \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
** heat energy = mass of substance x specific heat capacity x temperature change
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \frac{q}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
**enthalpy change = heat energy / moles

== Hess's Law ==

;Hess's Law
:The overall enthalpy change is independent of the route the chemical reaction takes place.

== Bond Enthalpies ==
===Bond Enthalpy===
*Energy/enthalpy needed to break/dissociate a bond averaged over different molecules.
*Always positive because breaking bonds requires energy.
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^\ominus_r = \Sigma \Delta H^\ominus_r (bonds\ broken) - \Sigma \Delta H^\ominus_r (bonds\ made)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC was originally formed among a group of Persian Gulf nations in response to the United States refusal to buy oil from the region. Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, Venezuela were the founding nations. Over the years the organization grew with more members. The rest of the member states joined in 1973. Those states include Indonesia, Libya, Algiers, and Gabon. Ecuador joined in 1973 but later withdrew itself from the organization. OPEC controls oil prices by regulating the production of oil among its member nations, therefore creating balance in the market. 

The organization faced a dire situation in 1975 when it came under attack from a terrorist ground led by llich Ramirez Sanchez. The armed group stormed into the room where oil ministers were meeting and after killing several people, took the oil ministers and nearly 70 people hostage. They forced the oil ministers to read propaganda on the airwaves. 

Vienna, Austria is the current location that houses OPEC. Vienna along with the Austrian government makes efforts to provide lodgings when OPEC holds it annual meetings, which bring over a 1000 people into the city. In return OPEC spends nearly its entire 20 million Euro budget in Austria. OPEC provides money for social institutions.

In 1975 after the ministers of OPEC first gathered in Algiers, they laid the groundwork for a financial institution that would be able to promote economic development in the southern hemisphere. This organization is now known as OFID or the OPEC Fund for International Development. This is an institution that is directly connected to OPEC. The ministers make voluntary donations but also utilize public sector money in offering grants to those in need. At the end of April 2010 1,205 grants were dispersed among 125 countries, totaling $483 million USD.

OPEC and OFID are globally important institutions. Due to the economic connections that countries now have through fuel needs, OPEC has become an important mediator of the issue.  OPEC is as only as strong as its member nations and Saudi Arabia is its strongest member. In the early 1980s the country made huge sacrifices on profits to keep OPEC quotas. OPEC has the power to fine nations that veer away from their set production quotas. The fines are needed because too much oil on the market could drive down the price too low and could be costly for everyone involved.

Humans do not need gene therapy to survive, though it may prove helpful to treat certain diseases. Special gene modification research has been carried out on groups such as the 'bubble children' - those whose immune systems do not protect them from the bacteria and irritants all around them. The first clinical trial of human gene therapy began in 1990, but (as of 2008) is still experimental. Other forms of human genetic engineering are still theoretical, or restricted to fiction stories. Recombinant DNA research is usually performed to study gene expression and various human diseases. Some drastic demonstrations of gene modification have been made with mice and other animals, however; testing on humans is generally considered off-limits. In some instances changes are usually brought about by removing genetic material from one organism and transferring them into another species.

There are two main types of genetic engineering. Somatic modifications involve adding genes to cells other than egg or sperm cells. For example, if a person had a disease caused by a defective gene, a healthy gene could be added to the affected cells to treat the disorder. The distinguishing characteristic of somatic engineering is that it is non-inheritable, e.g. the new gene would not be passed to the recipient’s offspring.

Germline engineering would change genes in eggs, sperm, or very early embryos. This type of engineering is inheritable, meaning that the modified genes would appear not only in any children that resulted from the procedure, but in all succeeding generations. This application is by far the more consequential as it could open the door to the perpetual and irreversible alteration of the human species.

There are two techniques researchers are currently experimenting with:
* Viruses are good at injecting their DNA payload into human cells and reproducing it. By adding the desired DNA to the DNA of non-pathogenic virus, a small amount of virus will reproduce the desired DNA and spread it all over the body.
* Manufacture large quantities of DNA, and somehow package it to induce the target cells to accept it, either as an addition to one of the original 23 chromosomes, or as an independent 24th human artificial chromosome.

Human genetic engineering means that some part of the genes or DNA of a person are changed. It is possible that through engineering, people could be given more arms, bigger brains or other structural alterations if desired. A more common type of change would be finding the genes of extraordinary people, such as those for intelligence, stamina, longevity, and incorporating those in embryos.

Human genetic engineering holds the promise of being able to cure diseases and increasing the immunity of people to viruses. An example of such a disease is cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that affects lungs and other organs.

Researchers are currently trying to map out and assign genes to different body functions or disease. When the genes or DNA sequence responsible for a disease is found, theoretically gene therapy should be able to fix the disease and eliminate it permanently. 

However, with the complexity of interaction between genes and gene triggers, gene research is currently in its infancy. Computer modeling and expression technology could be used in the future to create people from scratch. This would work by taking existing DNA knowledge and inserting DNA of &quot;superior&quot; body expressions from people, such as a bigger heart, stronger muscles, etc. and implanting this within an egg to be inserted into a female womb. The visual modeling of this process may be very much like the videogame Spore, where people are able to manipulate the physical attributes of creatures and then &quot;release them&quot; in the digital world.

The possibilities of physical changes are endless. Strength, speed, endurance and so on can be enhanced. The baby can be made taller, more beautiful, the changes possible are really up to the imagination, and the ability of the techniques employed by future gene manipulators. Certain people have been identified with extraordinary physical abilities, (such as athletes, geniuses, physical and mental event record holders) and their genes could be identified and replaced into the target embryo. There is also the possibility that science will advance so much that people will create genes not identified or discovered in nature (or people) and implant these into the human body as artificial genes.

Corresponding gene function to intelligence or mental aptitude in various fields is much harder because while researchers are finding out which sections of the brain light up when used through MRI imaging, corresponding genes to manipulate and/or expand intelligence are harder to map. The brain seems to be the last great medical mystery because unlike a muscle, it transfers information and handles complex processes like a computer, but without any logical process discernible to researchers. However, in certain individuals that have a higher aptitude at certain tasks, the history of their family having done the same work seems to show that either through practice, teaching, or gene expressions these individuals find tasks such as composing music or mathematics much easier than the average member of the population.

==Methods and technology==
==='''Current technology'''===
One of the types is gene manipulation through virus insertion.  The main mechanism by which this operates is a fairly standard one; one is taking DNA throughout the host’s body.  Problems with this approach may be:

:: Randomness of the insertion of the DNA fragment wanted (this might lead, for instance, to a cell turning cancerous, or being more subtly disrupted),
:: Possible lack of control over the immune response to the &quot;retrovirus&quot;, and
:: Possible problems getting complete transformation of the target cell population.

Another approach is to take advantage of the cell's endogenous ability to undergo homologous recombination wherein an exogenous DNA fragment with ends matching an endogenous gene replaces the target gene by action of enzymes called recombinases.  This is the technology used for &quot;knockouts&quot; and &quot;knock-ins&quot; and generally cannot be performed on an intact organism and is therefore only a candidate for germline (i.e. single cell) genetic manipulation.  This technology has very widespread usage in mouse genetics wherein genetically altered embryos are grown in a surrogate mother.  This could easily be extended to humans in the very near future as there are no major additional technological hurdles remaining to engineer humans versus mice (though minor hurdles certainly remain).  The primary hurdle is ethical, as the efficiency of this process can be quite poor and many embryos would be sacrificed in order to produce one genetically modified offspring.

===Future technology===
There are limitations to what current technology can do.  Research scientists want to get finer control on how DNA sequences might be added to a host cell.  Technologies that could offer this sort of control might well result from a merger of highly engineered/modified viruses with micromechanical technologies, modified to migrate to a particular specified N nucleotide sequence in the host DNA for N significantly large to minimize targeting errors, then precisely and efficiently insert the desired snippet in the correct position in the host.  Evidently it would be desirable to allow such a device/organism to feed on available resources in the host in order to migrate from cell to cell and perform this process until a significant proportion of host cells had been transformed; it would then be desirable for the device to disable itself.  Also it would be desirable for the device to understand when it had finished with a cell (e.g. after levels of a desired protein reach a critical threshold, though this would be perhaps too slow, i.e. movement via measurement of some sort of chemical gradient) so that it could move on.  Certainly such devices could not be user controlled for a large population; they would need to be autonomous.

Since DNA sequences vary from individual to individual, and individuals may even be chimeras, also required would be the capability to sequence individual genomes, the ability to target fixes to particular parts of a chimera population, and finally a good understanding of how to avoid disruptive edits- that is, edits that do not disrupt the functioning of some other process in the cell.  This requires some level of mastery of the area of proteomics, that is, the understanding of a lifeform's proteome.

==Computers==
The future most likely lies in a process that is automated by a wide repository of knowledge, a method of combining that knowledge into an embryo, and a design system such as a computer program that is easily represented to human individuals. The researcher is able to pick and choose what characteristics the &quot;soon to be created human&quot; should have, such as high intelligence, high strength, 20/20 or above vision, etc., and then tells the computer to create that person. This designer baby machine would then search through current research on these genes, put them into the proper places of the DNA mode through an accurate DNA modification method, enter it into an egg (created or taken from a female), and then insert the egg into a female or a mechanical womb. 

==Nanotechnology==
Nanotechnology could be used to implement gene changes. Nanotechnology is an expression of ultra small devices or machines that are able to operate at the nanoscale level.

==When to make changes==
===Changes at conception===
Genetic engineering is most easily accomplished by making changes just after the egg and sperm have melded but before first division. In this way, the gene will be expressed throughout and will affect the recipients children, grandchildren, and all subsequent generations. Germline engineering is controversial because there is insufficient knowledge about DNA expression to accurately judge what result these changes will have. 

===Changes after birth===
As of now, this is likely to take the form of gene therapy. This would not be hereditary unless the sex cells are engineered.

==Positive and Negative Distinction==
Two types of genetic engineering exist when applied to humans. Positive and negative. The former enhances humans and the latter removes genetic disorders.

===Negative genetic engineering===
When treating problems that arise from genetic disorder, one solution is gene therapy, also known as negative genetic engineering. A genetic disorder is a condition caused by the genetic code of the individual, such as spina bifida or autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/genetic+disorder
  | accessdate = 2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, genes may be expressed in unfavorable ways or not at all, and this generally leads to further complications. 

The idea of gene therapy is that a non-pathogenic virus or other delivery system can be used to insert a piece of DNA--a good copy of the gene--into cells of the living individual. The modified cells would divide as normal and each division would produce cells that express the desired trait. The result would be that he/she would then have the ability to express the trait that was previously absent at least partially.  This form of genetic engineering could help alleviate many problems, such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or other genetic diseases.

===Positive genetic engineering===
The potential of genetic engineering to cure medical conditions opens the question of exactly what such a condition is. Some view aging and death as medical conditions and therefore potential targets for engineering solutions. They see human genetic engineering potentially as a key tool in this. The difference between cure and enhancement from this perspective is merely one of degree. Theoretically genetic engineering could be used to drastically change people's genomes, which could enable people to regrow limbs and other organs, perhaps even extremely complex ones such as the spine. It could also be used to make people stronger, faster, smarter, or to increase the capacity of the lungs, among other things. If a gene exists in nature, it could be brought over to a human cell. In this view, there is no qualitative difference (only a quantitative one) between, for instance, a genetic intervention to cure muscular dystrophy, and a genetic intervention to improve muscle function even when those muscles are functioning at or around the human average (since there is also an average muscle function for those with a particular type of dystrophy, which the treatment would improve upon).
                                                                     
Others feel that there is an important distinction between using genetic technologies to treat those who are suffering and to make those who are already healthy superior to the average. There is widespread agreement that germline engineering should not currently be allowed for either therapeutic and enhancement applications, as evidenced by a recent report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. &lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Frankel &amp; Audrey R. Chapman, Human Inheritable Genetic Modifications: Assessing Scientific, Ethical, Religious, and Policy Issues, (September 2000), available at http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/projects/germline/report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Though theory and speculation suggest that genetic engineering could be used to make people stronger, faster, smarter, or to increase lung capacity, the AAAS report finds that there is little evidence that this can currently be done without very unsafe and therefore unethical human experiments. Because different cells have different tasks, changing one cell to do a different job will not only affect that one task, it can affect many others too.

==Controversy==
===Ethics===
The genetic engineering of humans has raised many controversial ethical issues. With the release of the 1997 cult film ''Gattaca'', human genetic engineering has been widely debated. While negative genetic engineering (gene therapy) does indeed raise a debate, the use of genetic engineering for human enhancement arouses the strongest feelings on both sides. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

===Social considerations===
''Individuals'' may benefit from non-therapeutic genetic engineering, but some claim that there may be adverse ''social'' implications. Few resources – particularly those related to medicine and health care – are available to everyone, and allowing the most privileged to engineer themselves or their children to have special capabilities could lead to what some call a genetic aristocracy. Numerous enhancements via genetic engineering have been proposed, including increased memory, intelligence, and less need for sleep, in addition to some peoples’ desires to alter their physical appearance. The advantages created by genetic engineering, either real or perceived, could lead to new forms of inequality between those with genetic enhancements and those without while also exacerbating current inequalities between the rich and poor.

This isn't to say that the poor would never have access to such technologies - there is no theoretical limit on how much retrovirus can be cultured in a bioreactor. But the likely high costs would probably require harsh financing plans. Genetic mortgages of the future could go hand in hand with student loans, spelling disaster for dropouts and increasing the risks of a first-class education for a middle or lower class citizen. Many people view genetic engineering as just a way to cure diseases.

On the other hand society could get to the point where the government pays for everyone to undergo genetic engineering. There would also be a point where patents on specific treatments run out, allowing cheaper access to the majority population after a decade or two of high cost.  This may actually decrease inequalities, because natural differences in ability would be nearly eliminated leaving socioeconomic success or failure entirely to the environment and personal choice.

Did you know that everything you do takes energy? Even while you are sitting still, your body is using energy to breathe, to keep your blood circulating, and to control many different processes. But it's not just you. Everything that moves or changes in any way—from plants to animals to machines—needs energy. Have you ever wondered where all of this energy comes from?

==Lesson Objectives==
* Compare ways in which energy is changed from one form to another.
* Discuss what happens when we burn a fuel.
* Describe the difference between renewable and nonrenewable resources, and classify different energy resources as renewable or nonrenewable.

==The Need for Energy==
''Energy'' can be defined as the ability to move or change matter. Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy all day long. And because billions of people all around the world use energy, there is a huge need for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy?

The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy. Most of the time when something happens, energy is changing forms.

Even though energy does change form, the total amount of energy always stays the same. The '''Law of Conservation of Energy''' says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Scientists discovered this law by noticing that any time they observed energy changing from one form to another, they could measure that the overall amount of energy did not change.

For an example of how energy changes from one form to another, think about what goes on when you kick a soccer ball. Your body gets its energy from food. When your body breaks down the food you eat, it stores the energy from the food in a form called '''chemical energy'''. But some of this stored energy has to be released to make your leg muscles move. When this happens, the energy that is released changes from chemical energy to another form, called '''kinetic energy'''. Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion. Your muscles move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the ball gains kinetic energy by being kicked. So you can think of the action of kicking the ball as a story of energy moving and changing forms. The same is true for anything that happens involving movement or change. '''Potential energy''' is energy that is stored. Potential energy has the potential to do work or the potential to be converted into other forms of energy. An example of potential energy might be the ball you kicked, if it ended up at the top of a hill.

==Energy, Fuel, and Heat==
As you have learned, energy is the ability to move or change matter. To put it another way, you could say that energy is the ability to do work. But what makes energy available whenever you need it? If you have ever accidentally unplugged a lamp while you were using it, you have seen that the lamp does not have a supply of energy to keep itself lit. When the lamp is plugged into an outlet, it has the source of energy it needs&amp;mdash;electricity. The electricity comes from a power plant, and the power plant has to have energy to produce this electricity (Figure 5.1). The energy to make the electricity comes from a fuel, which stores the energy and releases it when it is needed. A fuel is any material that can release energy in a chemical change. The food you eat acts as a '''fuel''' for your body. You probably hear the word fuel most often when someone refers to its use in transportation. Gasoline and diesel fuel are two fuels that provide the energy for most cars, trucks, and buses. But many different kinds of fuel are used to meet the wide variety of needs for energy storage.

[[File:XN Power pole 01.jpg|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 5.1''': Electrical transmission towers like the one shown in this picture help deliver the electricity that you use for energy every day.]]

For a fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be controlled. Controlling the release of the energy makes it possible for the energy to be used to do work. When a fuel is used for its energy, the fuel is usually burned, and most of the energy is released as heat. The heat can be used to do work. For an example of how the energy in a fuel is released mostly as heat, think about what happens when someone starts a fire in a fireplace. First, the person strikes a match and uses it to set some small twigs on fire. After the twigs have burned for a while, they get hot enough to make some larger sticks burn. The fire keeps getting hotter, and soon it is hot enough to burn whole logs.

You might think at first that the heat comes from starting the fire. After all, someone struck a match to start the fire, and then the fire just spread, right? But if you think about this fire in terms of energy, almost all of the heat comes from the energy that has been stored in the wood. In other words, the wood is the fuel for the fire. There is a reason why it is easy to be confused about the source of the fire’s heat. The reason is that some energy has to be put into ''starting'' the fire before any energy can come out of the fire. At first, there is energy stored in the head of the match as chemical energy. When someone strikes a match, this chemical energy is released as heat.

The lit match gives off enough heat to set the twigs on fire. This heat is enough energy to start changing the chemical energy in the wood (and the oxygen in the air, which the wood needs in order to burn) into heat. What happens is that the heat from the match breaks chemical bonds in the twigs. When these bonds break, the atoms in the twigs are free to move around and form new bonds. When the atoms form new bonds, they release more heat. This heat causes more and more of the wood to change its stored chemical energy into heat. So, what started as a fairly small amount of heat from the match turns into a much, much larger amount of heat from the wood. The same thing is true for any fuel. We have to add some energy to the fuel to get it started. But once the fuel starts burning, it keeps changing its chemical energy into heat. As long as the conditions are right, the fuel will keep turning its energy into heat until the fuel is all gone.

==Types of Energy Resources==
Energy resources can be put into two categories—either renewable or nonrenewable. Resources that are ''nonrenewable'' are used faster than they can be replaced (Figure 5.2). Other resources that are called ''renewable'' will never run out. In most cases, these resources are replaced as quickly as they are used.

[[File:Coal_anthracite.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 5.2''': Like other fossil fuels, this piece of anthracite coal is a nonrenewable energy resource.]]

In a way, the difference between nonrenewable and renewable resources is like the difference between ordinary batteries and rechargeable ones. If you have a flashlight at home that uses ordinary batteries, and you accidentally leave the flashlight on all night long, you will need to buy new batteries once the ones in the flashlight have died. The energy in the ordinary batteries is nonrenewable. But if the flashlight has rechargeable batteries, you can put them in a battery charger and use them in the flashlight again. In this way, the energy in the rechargeable batteries is &quot;renewable&quot;.

Fossil fuels are the most common example of nonrenewable energy resources. Renewable energy resources include solar, water, and wind power. If you traced the energy in all of these resources back to its origin, you would find that almost all energy resources&amp;mdash;not just solar energy&amp;mdash;come from the sun. Fossil fuels are made of the remains of plants and animals that stored the sun's energy millions of years ago. These plants and animals got all of their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly. The sun heats some areas more than others, which causes wind. The sun's energy drives the water cycle, which moves water over the surface of the Earth. Both wind and water power can be used as renewable resources.

===Types of Nonrenewable Resources===
Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas are nonrenewable resources. Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the sun to form sugars, carbohydrates, and other energy-rich carbon compounds that were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. The solar energy stored in these fuels is a rich source of energy, but while fossil fuels took millions of years to form, we are using them up in a matter of decades and will soon run out. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources. The burning of fossil fuels also releases large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

===Types of Renewable Resources===
Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. These resources can usually be replaced at the same rate that we use them. Scientists know that the sun will continue to shine for billions of years and we can use the energy from the sun as long as we have a sun. Water flows from high places to lower ones and wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. We can use the flow of wind and water to generate power and we can count on wind and water to continue to flow. Some examples of biomass energy are burning something like wood or changing grains into biofuels. We can plant new trees or crops to replace the ones we use. Geothermal energy uses water in the rocks that has been heated by magma. The magma will heat more water in the rocks as we take hot water out.

Even renewable resources can come with problems, though. We could cut down too many trees or we might need grains to be used for food rather than biofuels. Some renewable resources have been too expensive to be widely used or cause some types of environmental problems. As the technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the prices may come down. And, as we use up fossil fuels, they will become more expensive. At some point, even if renewable energy is expensive, nonrenewable energy will be even more expensive. Ultimately, we will have to use renewable sources (and conserve).

==Important Things to Consider About Energy Resources==
With both renewable and nonrenewable resources, there are at least two important things to consider. One is that we have to have a practical way to turn the resource into a useful form of energy. The other is that we have to consider what happens when we turn the resource into energy.

For example, if we get much less energy from burning a fuel than we put into making it, then that fuel is probably not a practical energy resource. On the other hand, if another fuel gives us large amounts of energy but also creates large amounts of pollution, that fuel also may not be the best choice for an energy resource.

==Lesson Summary==
* According to the law of conservation of energy, energy is neither created or destroyed.
* Renewable resources can be replaced at the rate they are being used.
* Nonrenewable resources are available in limited amounts or are being used faster than they can be replaced.

==Review Questions==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
Have you ever seen dinosaur fossils at a museum? If so, you may have read about how the dinosaur bones turned into fossils. The same processes that formed these fossils also formed some of our most important energy resources. These resources are called fossil fuels. Fossil fuels provide a very high quality energy, but because of our demand for energy, we are using up these resources much faster than they formed.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the natural processes that formed different fossil fuels.
* Describe different fossil fuels, and understand why they are nonrenewable resources.
* Explain how fossil fuels are turned into useful forms of energy.
* Understand that when we burn a fossil fuel, most of its energy is released as heat.
* Describe how the use of fossil fuels affects the environment.
* Describe how a nuclear power plant produces energy.

==Formation of Fossil Fuels==
As you might guess from their name, fossil fuels are made from fossils. Fossil fuels come from materials that began forming about 500 million years ago. As plants and animals died, their remains settled on the ground and at the bottom of bodies of water. Over time, these remains formed layer after layer. Eventually, all of these layers were buried deep enough that they were under an enormous mass of earth. The weight of the earth pressing down on these layers created intense heat and pressure.

After millions of years of heat and pressure, the material in these layers turned into chemicals called '''hydrocarbons''', which are compounds of carbon and hydrogen. The hydrocarbons in these layers are what we call fossil fuels. The hydrocarbons could be solid, liquid, or gaseous. The solid form is what we know as coal. The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. We call the gaseous hydrocarbons natural gas.

You may be surprised to learn that anything that used to be alive could change enough to become something so different, such as coal or oil. There is enough heat and pressure deep below the earth's surface even to create diamonds, which are the hardest natural material in the world.

Like fossil fuels, diamond is made of carbon. In fact, diamond is a type of pure carbon, so it does not contain the hydrogen that fossil fuels do. What determines whether the remains of  living things deep in the earth turn into coal, oil, natural gas, diamond, or something else? All of these materials form under high heat and pressure, but the conditions are different for each material.

==Coal==
Coal is the solid fossil fuel that forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps millions of years ago. The water and mud in the swamps affected how the remains of plants broke down as they were compressed. The water and mud in the swamp keep oxygen away from the plant material. When plants are buried without oxygen, the organic material can be preserved or fossilized. Then, other material, such as sand and clay, settles on top of the decaying plants and squeezes out the water and some other substances. Over time, the pressure removes most of the material other than carbon, and the carbon-containing material forms a layer of rock that we know as coal.

Coal is black or brownish-black in appearance. Coal is a rock that burns easily. Most forms of coal are '''sedimentary''' rock. But the hardest type of coal, anthracite, is a '''metamorphic''' rock, because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure as it forms. Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found in coal, including sulfur.

Around the world, coal is the largest source of energy for electricity. The United States is rich in coal, which is used for electricity. California once had a number of small coal mines but the state no longer produces coal.

A common way of turning coal into a useful form to make electricity starts with crushing the coal into powder. Then, a power plant burns the powder in a furnace that has a boiler. Like other fuels, coal releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The heat that the burning coal releases in the furnace is enough to boil the water in the boiler, making steam. The power plant uses this steam to spin turbines, and the spinning turbines make generators turn to create electricity.

For people to use coal as an energy source, they need to get it out of the ground. The process of removing coal from the ground is known as coal mining. Coal mining can take place underground or at the surface. The process of coal mining, especially surface mining, affects the environment. Surface mining exposes minerals from underground to air and water from the surface. These minerals contain the chemical element sulfur, and sulfur mixes with air and water to make sulfuric acid, which is a highly '''corrosive''' chemical. The sulfuric acid gets into nearby streams and can kill fish, plants, and animals that live in or near the water. The process of burning coal causes other problems for the environment. A little later, we will look at these other pollution problems, when we explore problems with fossil fuels in general.

==Oil==
Oil is a thick liquid that is usually dark brown or black in appearance. It is found mostly in formations of porous rock in the upper layers of the Earth's crust. Oil is currently the single largest source of energy in the world. How does oil form? The process of making oil is similar in many ways to the process of making coal. The main difference is in the size of the living things—the organisms—whose remains turn into these fossil fuels. The organisms that die and became the material for making oil are much smaller than the plants that turned into coal. These organisms are called plankton and algae. When the plankton and algae die, their remains settle to the bottom of the sea. There, they were buried away from oxygen, just as the plants did in the process of becoming coal. As layers of sediment pile on top of these decaying organisms, heat and pressure increase. Over a period of millions of years, the heat and pressure turn the material into liquid oil.

The United States produces oil, although only about one-quarter as much as it uses. The main oil producing regions are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California. Most of California's oil fields are in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Compression from when the region was a convergent plate boundary produced a set of anticlines that are parallel to the San Andreas Fault. Oil collects in permeable sediments that are capped by an impermeable cap rock. Oil is also pumped on and off the southern California coast.

Oil as it comes out of the ground is called crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Oil refining is used to separate the compounds in this mixture from one another (Figure 5.3). We can separate crude oil into several useful fuels because each hydrocarbon compound in crude oil boils at a different temperature. An oil refinery heats the crude oil enough to boil the mixture of compounds. Special equipment in the refinery separates these compounds from one another as they boil.

[[File:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|center|500px|'''Figure 5.3''': Refineries like this one separate crude oil into many useful fuels and other chemicals.]]

Most of the compounds that come out of the refining process are fuels. The rest make up waxes, plastics, fertilizers, and other products. The fuels that come from crude oil, including gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, are rich sources of energy that can be easily transported. Because of this, fuels from oil provide about 90% of the energy used for transportation around the world.

We get gasoline from refining oil. Like oil, gasoline is most commonly used for transportation because it is a concentrated form of energy that is easily carried. Let's consider how gasoline powers a car. Like other fuels you have learned about, gasoline burns and releases most of its energy as heat. When it burns, the gasoline turns into carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The heat makes these gases expand, like the heated air that fills a hot-air balloon. The expanding gases create enough force to move pistons inside an engine, and the engine makes enough power to move the car.

When a resource like gasoline is concentrated in energy; it contains a large amount of energy for its weight. This is important because the more an object weighs, the more energy it takes to move that object. If we could only get a little energy from a certain amount of gasoline, a car would have to carry more of it to be able to travel very far. But carrying more gasoline would make the car heavier, so moving the car would take even more energy. So a resource with highly concentrated energy is a practical fuel to power cars and other forms of transportation.

Unfortunately, using gasoline to power automobiles also affects the environment. The exhaust fumes from burning gasoline include gases that cause many different types of pollution, including smog and ground-level ozone. These forms of pollution cause air-quality problems for cities where large numbers of people drive every day. Burning gasoline also produces carbon dioxide, which is a cause of global warming.

==Natural Gas==
Natural gas is a fuel that is a mixture of methane and several other chemical compounds. It is often found along with coal or oil in underground deposits. The conditions that create natural gas are similar to those that create oil. In both cases, small  organisms called plankton and algae die and settle to the bottom of the sea. In both cases, the remains of these organisms decay without oxygen being present. The difference is that natural gas forms at higher temperatures than oil does.

The largest natural gas reserves in the United States is found are in the Rocky Mountain states, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico region. California also has natural gas, mostly in the northern Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento Delta. In that region, a sediment filled trough formed aside an ancient convergent margin. Organic material buried in the sediments hardened to become a shale formation that is the source of the gas.

Because it is a mixture of different chemicals, natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel. Some of the chemicals in unprocessed natural gas are poisonous to humans. Other parts, such as water, make the gas a less useful fuel. The processing removes almost everything but methane from natural gas. At this point, the gas is ready to be delivered and used.

Natural gas, often known simply as gas, is delivered to homes for uses such as cooking and heating. Many ranges and ovens use natural gas as a fuel, and gas-powered furnaces, boilers, water heaters, and clothes dryers are also common.

Natural gas is a major source of energy for powering gas turbines and steam turbines to make electricity. When it is used in this way, natural gas works similarly to the way coal does in producing energy for electricity. Like coal and other fuels, natural gas releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The power plant is able to use this heat, either in the form of hot gases or steam from heated water, to spin turbines. The spinning turbines turn generators, and the generators create electricity.

Processing and using natural gas does have some harmful effects on the environment. Natural gas does burn cleaner than other fossil fuels, meaning that it causes less air pollution. It also produces less carbon dioxide than the other fossil fuels for the same amount of energy.

==Problems with Fossil Fuels==
Although they are rich sources of energy, fossil fuels do present many problems. Because these fuels are nonrenewable resources, their supplies will eventually run out. Safety can be a problem, too, because these fuels burn so easily. For example, a natural gas leak in a building or an underground pipe can lead to a deadly explosion.

Using fossil fuels affects the environment in a variety of ways. There are impacts to the environment when we extract these resources. There are problems that arise because we are running out of supplies of these resources. Burning these fuels can cause air pollution and burning them releases carbon dioxide, which is a major factor in global warming (Figure 5.4).

[[File:Elektrarna Prunerov II 20070926.jpg|thumb|center|500px|'''Figure 5.4''': Coal power plants like this one release large amounts of steam and smoke into the air.]]

Many of the problems with fossil fuels are worse for coal than for oil or natural gas. Coal contains less energy for the amount of carbon it contains than oil or gas. As a result, burning coal releases more carbon dioxide than burning either oil or gas (for the same energy). And yet coal is the most common fossil fuel and so we continue to burn large amounts of it. Coal is the biggest contributor to global warming.

Another problem with coal is that it usually contains sulfur. When coal burns, the sulfur goes into the air as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is the main cause of acid rain, which can be deadly to plants, animals, and whole ecosystems. Burning coal also puts other polluting chemicals and a large number of small solid &quot;particulates&quot; into the air. These particles are dangerous to people, especially those who have an illness, like asthma, that makes breathing hard for them.

==Nuclear Energy==
When scientists learned how to split the nucleus of an atom, they released a huge amount of energy. Scientists and engineers have learned to control this release of energy. The controlled release of this energy is called '''nuclear energy'''. Nuclear power plants use uranium that has been processed and concentrated in fuel rods (Figure 5.5). The uranium atoms are split apart when they are hit by other extremely tiny particles. Nuclear Power (Nuclear fission) is not the same as a nuclear bomb. Explosives cannot directly be made out of uranium, it has to be enriched with Plutonium. Therefore nuclear powerplants cannot explode, meltdown however can occur if the cooling system of the plant is interrupted.

[[File:Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 5.5''': Nuclear power plants like this one provide France with almost 80% of its electricity.]]

Nuclear power plants use the energy they produce to heat water. Once the water is heated, the process is a lot like what happens in a coal power plant. The hot water or steam causes a turbine to spin. When the turbine spins, it makes a generator turn, which in turn produces electricity.

Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of electricity. For example, France gets about 80% of its electricity from nuclear energy. In the United States, a little less than 20% of electricity comes from nuclear energy.

Nuclear energy does not pollute the air. In fact, a nuclear power plant releases nothing but steam into the air. But nuclear energy does create other environmental problems. The process of splitting atoms creates a dangerous by-product called radioactive waste. The radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power plants remain dangerous for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. So far, concerns about this waste have kept nuclear energy from being a larger source of energy in this country. Scientists and engineers are looking for ways to keep this waste safely away from people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The International Center for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) is located in Austria's capitol city of Vienna. ICMPD was founded in 1993, upon the initiative of Austria and Switzerland. ICMPD's mission statement is rooted in making our increasingly interdenpendt world more navigable in terms of the flow of individulas across the globe's many borders. Thus, the ICMPD strives to improve and facilitate regional and international co-operation in the field of migration policy and migration management. Acting as somewhat of a facilitator amongst its member states the ICMPD seeks to create contact and dialogue among countries of origin, transit and destination and to support ICMPD Member States in achieving their priorities and migration policy goals. The following states are members of the organisation: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition to facilitating dialagoue amongst member states ICMPD is dedicated to promoting innovative, comprehensive and sustainable migration policies and to function as a service exchange mechanism for governments and organizations. Migrations challenges in today's world are significant and to better approach this challenge ICMPD adheres to a philosophy based upon the conviction that the complexities of migration challenges can only be met by working in partnership with governments, research institutes, international organizations and civil society and its organizations. The organization was created to serve as a support mechanism for informal consultations, and to provide expertise and efficient services in the newly emerging landscape of multilateral co-operation on migration and asylum issues. ICMPD today is an international organization with sixty staff members at its Vienna Headquarters, a mission in Brussels and regional offices and representatives throughout Europe, CIS, Northern Africa and the Middle East. In addition to its internationl promenince the ICMPD holds UN observer status.

==History/Timeline==
Faced with the growing challenges of migration, an asylum crisis and the need to reform the European refugee reception system a small circle of European government representatives, gathered at the initiative of Switzerland, in the autumn of 1992 to launch the ICMPD. Moreover, migration from and through the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe was on the rise in addition to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to mass displacement, requiring international burden-sharing and thus the birth of ICMPD. At the global level, it was recognized that growing  Global North- Gloabl South migration pressure will be a major issue on the political agenda for the next millennium. 

Prior to the ICMPD the typical form of dealing with migration in a European context was through an ad hoc approach by the Council of Europe, OECD, ICEM/IOM and UNHCR. Informal consultations (now IGC) were created by Sweden and some like-minded countries in 1985. It worked together with the UNHCR to tackle the emerging asylum crisis. An EC/EU co-operation on immigration and asylum was initiated in 1986 in response to the new internal market system and establishment of external EU borders. The EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries also initiated a move to make immigration co-operation level with that of the EC. Radical changes in Central and Eastern Europe gave birth in 1991 to the Vienna process (incorporated by the Council of Europe in 1994) and the Berlin process, which later became the Budapest Process. Existing institutions, such as those mentioned above, worked to upgrade migration-related activities. 

The founding countries of ICMPD felt a support mechanism was needed to provide a platform for informal consultations and efficient services in this newly emerging landscape of multilateral immigration and asylum co-operation. They also wanted to ensure that co-operation with Central and Eastern Europe be given a prominent role, taking into account the need to incorporate the new democracies into the European migration regime and to act against the risk of growing illegal migration. In light of this, it was clear at the Budapest Ministerial Conference in 1993 that ICMPD would become Secretariat to the Budapest process.

==Local Significance==
In May 1993 the basic agreement on the establishment of ICMPD entered into force, the initial signatories was in Vienna between Austria and Switzerland. The following July the first Steering Group meeting took place. Under an arrangement with Sweden the late Jonas Widgren was appointed director in August 1993. A presentation letter to all the responsible ministers of 24 governments, signed by the Swiss Minister of Justice and the Austrian Federal Minister of Interior, was dispatched in September 1993. ICMPD's head office, originally at Möllwaldplatz in Vienna's fourth district, was officially opened in November 1993.

==Global Impact/Significance==
ICMPD’s work centers around three core pillars: Intergovernmental dialogues: with the aim to foster governmental discussion and enhance inter-state dialogue in the current debate on international migration, ICMPD acts as Secretariat to the consultative Budapest Process (50 European and Eurasian states), and to the Dialogue on Mediterranean Transit Migration, which brings together European as well as Mediterranean Arab states. 

Capacity building: with the aim to contribute to good migration governance and to strengthen national and regional capacities in order to deal with the current challenges in various fields of migration, ICMPD develops and organizes training and capacity building programs, facilitates international and interagency co-operation, and supports governmental and administrative bodies in their institution building efforts and legal reform in areas such as asylum, visa, human trafficking and integrated border management.

Research and documentation: with the aim to facilitate co-operation and synergy within and beyond the research community and to respond to an increased demand for a more policy relevant research, ICMPD conducts policy oriented, empirical research with a comparative, interdisciplinary and international approach. The ICMPD library offers one of the largest collections of migration-specific literature in Austria.

Together with profound understanding of our partners' working environment ICMPD provides cutting-edge expertise, sound and policy-oriented research, proficiency in establishing information exchange mechanisms, strong programs development and implementation skills and wide-ranging international networking capacities.

The aldol reaction is powerful because it unites two relatively simple molecules into a more complex one. Increased complexity arises because up to two new [[stereogenic center]]s (on the [[Alpha carbon|α- and β-carbon]] of the aldol adduct, marked with asterisks in the scheme below) are formed. Modern methodology is not only capable of allowing aldol reactions to proceed in high yield, but also controlling both the relative and absolute stereochemical configuration of these stereocenters. This ability to selectively synthesize a particular [[stereoisomer]] is significant because different stereoisomers can have very different chemical or biological properties.

For example, stereogenic aldol units are especially common in [[polyketide]]s, a class of [[natural products|molecules found in biological organisms]]. In nature, polyketides are synthesized by enzymes which effect iterative [[Claisen condensation]]s. The 1,3-dicarbonyl products of these reactions can then be variously derivatized to produce a wide variety of interesting structures. Often, such derivitization involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups, producing the aldol subunit. Some of these structures have potent biological properties: the potent immunosuppressant [[FK506]], the anti-tumor agent [[discodermolide]], or the antifungal agent [[amphotericin B]], for example. Although the synthesis of many such compounds was once considered nearly impossible, aldol methodology has allowed their efficient [[total synthesis|synthesis]] in many cases.&lt;ref name=MahrwaldSchetter2006&gt;

[[Image:typicalaldol2.gif|center]]

A typical modern '''aldol addition reaction''', shown above, might involve the [[nucleophilic addition]] of a [[ketone]] [[enolate]] to an [[aldehyde]]. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes [[Dehydration reaction|lose a molecule of water]] to form an [[α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound]]. This is called '''[[aldol condensation]]'''. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the [[enol]]s, [[enolate]]s, and enol [[ether]]s of ketones, aldehydes, and many other [[carbonyl]] compounds. The [[electrophile|electrophilic]] partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the [[Mannich reaction]], exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a '''crossed aldol reaction'''; conversely, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called '''aldol dimerization'''.
[[Image:aldolrxnpic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A typical experimental setup for an aldol reaction.&lt;br /&gt; A solution of [[lithium diisopropylamide]] (LDA) in [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) (in the flask on the right) will be transferred into a solution of ''tert''-butyl propionate in the flask on the left, forming the lithium enolate of ''tert''-butyl propionate. An aldehyde can then be added to initiate an aldol addition reaction.&lt;br /&gt; Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone [[cooling bath]] (−78&amp;nbsp;°C) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple (the wire on the left).]]

==Mechanisms==
The aldol reaction may proceed via two fundamentally different mechanisms. Carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, can be converted to enols or enol ethers. These compounds, being nucleophilic at the [[Alpha-carbon|α-carbon]], can attack especially reactive protonated carbonyls such as protonated aldehydes. This is the &quot;enol mechanism.&quot; Carbonyl compounds, being [[carbon acid]]s, can also be deprotonated to form enolates, which are much more nucleophilic than enols or enol ethers and can attack electrophiles directly. The usual electrophile is an aldehyde, since ketones are much less reactive. This is the &quot;enolate mechanism.&quot;

If the conditions are particularly harsh (e.g., NaOMe, MeOH, [[reflux]]), condensation may occur, but this can usually be avoided with mild reagents and low temperatures (e.g., LDA (a strong base), THF, −78&amp;nbsp;°C). Although the aldol addition usually proceeds to near completion, the reaction is not irreversible, since the treatment of aldol adducts with strong bases usually induces retro-aldol cleavage (gives the starting materials). Aldol condensations are irreversible.

:[[Image:Simple aldol reaction.png|600px|A generalized view of the Aldol reaction]]

===Enol mechanism===
When an acid catalyst is used, the initial step in the [[reaction mechanism]] involves acid-catalyzed [[tautomer]]ization of the carbonyl compound to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of ''another molecule'' by protonation, rendering it highly [[electrophile|electrophilic]]. The enol is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated carbonyl compound, leading to the aldol after [[deprotonation]]. This usually [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrates]] to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a typical acid-catalyzed self-condensation of an aldehyde.

'''Acid catalyzed aldol mechanism'''
:[[Image:Enol aldol formation mechanism.png|500px|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself]]
'''Acid catalyzed dehydration'''
:[[Image:Enol aldol dehydration mechanism.png|500px|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed dehydration of an aldol]]

===Enolate mechanism===
If the [[catalyst]] is a moderate base such as [[hydroxide]] ion or an [[alkoxide]], the aldol reaction occurs via nucleophilic attack by the [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance-stabilized]] enolate on the carbonyl group of another molecule. The product is the [[alkoxide]] salt of the aldol product. The aldol itself is then formed, and it may then undergo dehydration to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a simple mechanism for the base catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself.

'''Base catalyzed aldol reaction''' (shown using [[methoxide|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] as base)
:[[Image:Enolate aldol formation mechanism.png|500px|Simple mechanism for base-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself]]

'''Base catalyzed dehydration''' (frequently written incorrectly as a single step, see [[E1cB elimination reaction]])
:[[Image:Enolate aldol dehydration mechanism.png|500px|Simple mechanism for the dehydration of an aldol product]]

Although only a catalytic amount of base is required in some cases, the more usual procedure is to use a [[stoichiometric]] amount of a strong base such as [[Lithium diisopropylamide|LDA]] or [[Sodium hexamethyldisilazide|NaHMDS]]. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal alkoxide of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.

===Zimmerman–Traxler model===
More refined forms of the mechanism are known. In 1957, [[Howard Zimmerman|Zimmerman]] and Traxler proposed that some aldol reactions have &quot;six-membered transition states having a [[chair conformation]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman1920&gt;{{cite journal

| pages =1920–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now known as the '''Zimmerman–Traxler model'''. ''E''-enolates give rise to [[anti isomer|anti products]], whereas ''Z''-enolates give rise to [[syn addition|syn products]]. The factors which control selectivity are the preference for placing substituents equatorially in six-membered transition states and the avoidance of [[pentane interference|syn-pentane interactions]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1980&gt;{{cite journal

In reality, only some metals such as lithium and boron reliably follow the Zimmerman–Traxler model. Thus, in some cases, the [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]] outcome of the reaction may be unpredictable.

==Control in the Aldol reaction==
===The problem===
The problem of &quot;control&quot; in the aldol addition is best demonstrated by an example. Consider the outcome of this hypothetical reaction:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol1.gif|center|Hypothetical aldol reaction]]

In this reaction, two unsymmetrical ketones are being condensed using [[sodium ethoxide]]. The basicity of sodium ethoxide is such that it cannot fully deprotonate either of the ketones, but can produce small amounts of the sodium enolate of both ketones. Effectively, this means that in addition to being potential aldol electrophiles, both ketones may also act as nucleophiles via their sodium enolate. Two electrophiles and two nucleophiles then potentially results in four possible products:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol2.png|center|Four possible aldol reaction products]]

Thus, if one wishes to obtain only one of the cross-products, one must &quot;control&quot; the aldol addition.

===Acidity===
If one partner is considerably more acidic than the other, then control may be automatic. The most acidic proton is abstracted by the base and an enolate is formed. This type of control only works if the difference in acidity is large enough and no excess of base is used for the reaction. The simplest control is if only one of the reactants has acidic protons and only this molecule forms the enolate. For example, the addition of diethyl malonate into benzaldehyde would only produce one product:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol3.png|center|Acidic control of the aldol reaction]]

In this case, the doubly activated [[methylene]] protons of the [[malonate]] would be preferentially deprotonated by sodium ethoxide and quantitatively form the sodium enolate. Since [[benzaldehyde]] has no acidic alpha-protons, there is only one possible nucleophile-electrophile combination; hence, control has been achieved. Note that this approach combines two elements of control: increased acidity of the alpha protons on the nucleophile and the lack of alpha protons on the electrophile.

===Order of addition===
One common solution is to form the enolate of one partner first, and then add the other partner under [[kinetic reaction control|kinetic control]].&lt;ref name=OS1985&gt;Bal, B.; Buse, C. T.; Smith, K.; Heathcock, C. H. ''[[Org. Syn.]]'', Coll. Vol. 7, p.185 (1990); Vol. 63, p.89 (1985). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0185 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic control means that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; namely, it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than the transfer of the enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with [[Lithium diisopropylamide|LDA]] at −78&amp;nbsp;°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.

==Enolates==
===Formation===
The enolate may be formed by using a strong base (&quot;hard conditions&quot;) or using a [[Lewis acid]] and a weak base (&quot;soft conditions&quot;):

[[Image:scheme3a.gif]]

For [[deprotonation]] to occur, the stereoelectronic requirement is that the alpha-C-H [[sigma bond]] must be able to overlap with the pi* orbital of the [[carbonyl]]:

[[Image:scheme3c.gif|center|Stereoelectronic deprotonation requirements]]

===Geometry===
Extensive studies have been performed on the formation of enolates under many different conditions. It is now possible to generate, in most cases, the desired enolate geometry:&lt;ref name=Brown1989&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:scheme3.gif|center|Stereoselective enolate generation]]
For ketones, most enolization conditions give Z enolates. For [[ester]]s, most enolization conditions give E enolates. The addition of [[Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPA]] is known to reverse the [[stereoselectivity]] of deprotonation.

[[Image:Scheme3d.png|center|The Ireland model]]

In the Ireland model, the deprotonation is assumed to proceed by a six-membered monomeric transition state. The larger of the two substituents on the electrophile (in the case above, methyl is larger than proton) adopts an equatorial disposition in the favored transition state, leading to a preference for E enolates. The model clearly fails in many cases; for example, if the solvent mixture is changed from THF to 23% HMPA-THF (as seen above), the enolate geometry is inexplicably reversed.

===Kinetic versus thermodynamic enolates===
If an unsymmetrical ketone is subjected to base, it has the potential to form two regioisomeric enolates (ignoring enolate geometry). For example:

[[Image:Enolateregio1.gif|center|Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates]]

The trisubstituted enolate is considered the [[thermodynamic reaction control|kinetic]] enolate while the tetrasubstituted enolate is considered the thermodynamic enolate. The alpha hydrogen deprotonated to form the kinetic enolate is less hindered, and therefore deprotonated more quickly. In general, tetrasubstituted olefins are more stable than trisubstituted olefins due to hyperconjugative stabilization. The ratio of enolate regioisomers is heavily influenced by the choice of base. For the above example, kinetic control may be established with LDA at −78&amp;nbsp;°C, giving 99:1 selectivity of kinetic: thermodynamic enolate, while thermodynamic control may be established with [[organolithium reagent|triphenylmethyllithium]] at [[room temperature]], giving 10:90 selectivity.

In general, kinetic enolates are favored by cold temperatures, relatively ionic metal-oxygen bonds, and rapid deprotonation using a slight excess of a strong, hindered base while thermodynamic enolates are favored by higher temperatures, relatively covalent metal-oxygen bonds, and longer equilibration times for deprotonation using a slight sub-stoichiometric amount of strong base. Use of a sub-stoichiometric amount of base allows some small fraction of unenolized carbonyl compound to equilibrate the enolate to the thermodynamic regioisomer by acting as a proton shuttle.

==Stereoselectivity==
The aldol reaction is particularly useful because two new stereogenic centers are generated in one reaction. Extensive research has been performed to understand the reaction mechanism and improve the selectivity observed under many different conditions. The ''syn''/''anti'' convention is commonly used to denote the relative stereochemistry at the α- and β-carbon.

[[Image:Aldol syn-anti.svg|500px|Syn and anti products from an aldol reaction]]

The convention applies when propionate (or higher order) nucleophiles are added to aldehydes. The ''R'' group of the ketone and the ''R''' group of the aldehyde are aligned in a &quot;zig zag&quot; pattern in the plane of the paper (or screen), and the disposition of the formed stereocenters is deemed ''syn'' or ''anti'', depending if they are on the same or opposite sides of the main chain.

Older papers use the ''[[Erythrose|erythro]]''-''[[Threose|threo]]'' nomenclature familiar from carbohydrate chemistry.

===E versus Z enolates===
There is no significant difference between the level of [[stereoinduction]] observed with ''E'' and ''Z'' enolates:&lt;ref name=Brown1989 /&gt;

[[Image:EvsEstereoselectivity.gif|center|Anti-aldol formation via Z-enolate]]

[[Image:EvsZstereoselectivity2.gif|center|Syn-aldol formation via E-enolate]]

===Metal ion===
The enolate metal cation may play a large role in determining the level of stereoselectivity in the aldol reaction. [[Boron]] is often used because its [[bond length]]s are significantly shorter than that of other metals such as [[lithium]], [[aluminium]], or [[magnesium]]. For example, boron-carbon and boron-oxygen bonds are 1.4–1.5 [[Ångstrom|Å]] and 1.5–1.6 Å in length, respectively, whereas typical metal-carbon and metal-oxygen bonds are typically 1.9–2.2 Å and 2.0–2.2 Å in length, respectively. This has the effect of &quot;tightening&quot; the [[transition state]]:&lt;ref name=JACS1981_3099&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Metalion.gif|center]]

===Stereoselectivity: Alpha stereocenter on the enolate===
The aldol reaction may exhibit &quot;substrate-based stereocontrol&quot;, in which existing [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] on either reactant influences the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. This has been extensively studied, and in many cases, one can predict the sense of [[asymmetric induction]], if not the absolute level of [[diastereoselectivity]]. If the enolate contains a [[stereocenter]] in the alpha position, excellent stereocontrol may be realized.

[[Image:enolatealphacenter.gif|center|Aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

In the case of an E enolate, the dominant control element is [[allylic strain|allylic 1,3-strain]] whereas in the case of a Z enolate, the dominant control element is the avoidance of 1,3-diaxial interactions. The general model is presented below:

[[Image:enolatealphacentermodel.gif|center|General model of the aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

For clarity, the stereocenter on the enolate has been [[epimer]]ized; in reality, the opposite diastereoface of the aldehyde would have been attacked. In both cases, the 1,3-syn diastereomer is favored. There are many examples of this type of stereocontrol:&lt;ref name=JACS1991_1047&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:enolatealphacentereg.gif|center|Aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

===Stereoselectivity: Alpha stereocenter on the electrophile===
When enolates attacks aldehydes with an alpha stereocenter, excellent stereocontrol is also possible. The general observation is that ''E'' enolates exhibit [[Felkin model|Felkin]] diastereoface selection, while ''Z'' enolates exhibit anti-Felkin selectivity. The general model&lt;ref name=Evans1982TS&gt;Evans, D. A. ''et al.'' ''Top. Stereochem.'' '''1982''', ''13'', 1–115. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roush1991&gt;{{cite journal

Since ''Z'' enolates must react through a [[transition state]] which either contains a destabilizing syn-pentane interaction or anti-Felkin [[rotamer]], ''Z''-enolates exhibit lower levels of diastereoselectivity in this case.

==Evans' oxazolidinone chemistry==
Modern organic syntheses now require the synthesis of compounds in [[enantiopure]] form. Since the aldol addition reaction creates two new stereocenters, up to four stereoisomers may result.

[[Image:Evansaldol1.gif|center|Aldol reaction creates stereoisomers]]

Many methods which control both relative stereochemistry (i.e., syn or anti, as discussed above) and absolute [[stereochemistry]] (i.e., ''R'' or ''S'') have been developed.

[[Image:Evansaldol2.gif|center|Four possible stereoisomers of the aldol reaction]]

A widely used method is the Evans' [[acyl]] [[oxazolidinone]] method.&lt;ref name=Evans1982AldrichActa&gt;Evans, D. A. ''[[Aldrichimica Acta]]'' '''1982''', ''15'', 23. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OS1990&gt;Gage, J. R.; Evans, D. A. [[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 8, p.339 (1993); Vol. 68, p.83 (1990). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv8p0339 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by [[David A. Evans]] and coworkers, the method works by temporarily creating a chiral enolate by appending a [[chiral auxiliary]]. The pre-existing chirality from the auxiliary is then transferred to the aldol adduct by performing a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Upon subsequent removal of the auxiliary, the desired aldol stereoisomer is revealed.

[[Image:Evansaldol3.gif|center]]

In the case of the Evans' method, the chiral auxiliary appended is an [[oxazolidinone]], and the resulting carbonyl compound is an [[imide]]. A number of oxazolidinones are now readily available in both enantiomeric forms. These may cost roughly $10–$20 US dollars per gram, rendering them relatively expensive.

[[Image:Evansaldol4.gif|center]]

The [[acylation]] of an oxazolidinone is a convenient procedure, and is informally referred to as &quot;loading done&quot;. ''Z''-enolates, leading to syn-aldol adducts, can be reliably formed using boron-mediated soft enolization:&lt;ref name=Bartroli1981&gt;{{cite journal

| pages =2127–2129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evansaldol5.gif|center]]

Often, a single [[diastereomer]] may be obtained by one [[crystallization]] of the aldol adduct. Unfortunately, anti-aldol adducts cannot be obtained reliably with the Evans method. Despite the cost and the limitation to give only ''syn'' adducts, the method's superior reliability, ease of use, and versatility render it the method of choice in many situations. Many methods are available for the cleavage of the auxiliary:&lt;ref name=JACS882506&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Evansaldol7.gif|center]]

In the syn-selective reactions, both enolization methods give the ''Z'' enolate, as expected; however, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is controlled by the methyl stereocenter, rather than the chirality of the oxazolidinone. The methods described allow the stereoselective assembly of [[polyketide]]s, a class of natural products which often feature the aldol retron.

==Modern aldol chemistry==
Recent methodology now allows a much wider variety of aldol reactions to be conducted, often with a catalytic amount of [[Chiral reagent|chiral ligand]]. When reactions employ small amounts of [[enantiopure|enantiomerically]] pure ligands to induce the formation of enantiomerically pure products, the reactions are typically termed &quot;catalytic, asymmetric&quot;; for example, many different catalytic, [[asymmetric synthesis|asymmetric]] aldol reactions are now available.

===Acetate aldol reactions===
A key limitation to the [[chiral auxiliary]] approach described previously is the failure of N-acetyl [[imide]]s to react selectively. An early approach was to use a temporary [[thioether]] group:&lt;ref name=JACS882506 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In this reaction the nucleophile is a boron enolate derived from reaction with [[dibutylboron triflate]] (nBu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOTf), the base is [[N,N-Diisopropylethylamine]].

The method works on [[Branching (chemistry)|unbranched]] aliphatic aldehydes, which are often poor [[electrophile]]s for catalytic, asymmetric processes. This may be due to poor electronic and steric differentiation between their [[enantioface]]s.

The [[chemical yield|yields]], [[diastereoselectivity|diastereoselectivities]], and enantioselectivities of the reaction are generally high, although not as high as in comparable Evans cases. Unlike the Evans auxiliary, however, the thiazoldinethione can perform acetate aldol reactions (ref: Crimmins, Org. Lett. 2007, 9(1), 149–152.) and can produce the &quot;Evans syn&quot; or &quot;non-Evans syn&quot; adducts by simply varying the amount of [[sparteine|(−)-sparteine]]. The reaction is believed to proceed via six-membered, titanium-bound [[transition state]]s, analogous to the proposed transition states for the Evans auxiliary. NOTE: the structure of sparteine shown below is missing a N atom.

===Organocatalytic aldol reactions===
An exciting new development is the use of chiral secondary [[amine]] catalysts. These secondary amines form transient [[enamine]]s when exposed to ketones, which may react enantioselectively with suitable aldehyde electrophiles. This is known as '''enamine catalysis''', a type of [[organocatalysis]], since the catalyst is entirely based on a small organic molecule. In a seminal example, [[proline]] efficiently catalyzed the cyclization of a triketone:

There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy is particularly powerful because it offers a simple way of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.

Interestingly, proline-catalyzed aldol reactions do not show any non-linear effects (the enantioselectivity of the products is directly proportional to the enantiopurity of the catalyst). Combined with [[isotopic labelling]] evidence and [[computational chemistry|computational studies]], the proposed [[reaction mechanism]] for proline-catalyzed aldol reactions is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:organocatalytic2.gif|center]]

This strategy allows the otherwise challenging cross-aldol reaction between two aldehydes. In general, cross-aldol reactions between aldehydes are typically challenging because they can [[polymerization|polymerize]] easily or react unselectively to give a statistical mixture of products. The first example is shown below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title = The First Direct and Enantioselective Cross-Aldol Reaction of Aldehydes

| pages =6798–6799
| doi = 10.1021/ja0262378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:organocatalytic3.gif|center]]

In contrast to the preference for syn adducts typically observed in enolate-based aldol additions, these organocatalyzed aldol additions are anti-selective. In many cases, the organocatalytic conditions are mild enough to avoid polymerization. However, selectivity requires the slow syringe-pump controlled addition of the desired electrophilic partner because both reacting partners typically have enolizable protons. If one aldehyde has no enolizable protons or alpha- or beta-branching, additional control can be achieved.

An elegant demonstration of the power of asymmetric organocatalytic aldol reactions was disclosed by MacMillan and coworkers in 2004 in their synthesis of differentially protected [[carbohydrate]]s. While traditional synthetic methods accomplish the synthesis of [[hexose]]s using variations of iterative [[protective group|protection-deprotection]] strategies, requiring 8–14 steps, organocatalysis can access many of the same substrates using an efficient two-step protocol involving the proline-catalyzed dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes followed by tandem Mukaiyama aldol cyclization.

[[Image:organocatalytic4.gif|center]]

The aldol dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes requires that the aldol adduct, itself an aldehyde, be inert to further aldol reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier studies revealed that aldehydes bearing alpha-alkyloxy or alpha-[[silyloxy]] [[substituent]]s were suitable for this reaction, while aldehydes bearing [[Electron-withdrawing group]]s such as [[acetoxy]] were unreactive. The protected [[erythrose]] product could then be converted to four possible sugars via Mukaiyama aldol addition followed by [[lactol]] formation. This requires appropriate diastereocontrol in the Mukaiyama aldol addition and the product [[carbenium ion|silyloxycarbenium ion]] to preferentially cyclize, rather than undergo further aldol reaction. In the end, [[glucose]], [[mannose]], and [[allose]] were synthesized:

[[Image:organocatalytic5.gif|center]]

===&quot;Direct&quot; aldol additions===
In the usual aldol addition, a carbonyl compound is deprotonated to form the enolate. The enolate is added to an aldehyde or ketone, which forms an alkoxide, which is then protonated on workup. A superior method, in principle, would avoid the deprotonation-aldol-protonation sequence in favor of a &quot;direct aldol addition&quot;. The major issue in such a process is that the aldol addition generates an alkoxide, which is much more basic than the starting materials, precluding catalyst turnover:

[[Image:directaldol1.gif|center]]

One approach, recently demonstrated by Evans, is to silylate the aldol adduct:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Biological aldol reactions==
Examples of aldol reactions in biochemistry include the splitting of [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphate]] into [[dihydroxyacetone]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] in the second stage of [[glycolysis]] which is an example of a reverse aldol reaction catalysed by the enzyme [[aldolase A]].

Simple sugars are cyclic aldol trimers of acetaldehyde that can be prepared synthetically.

The '''Baeyer-Villiger oxidation''' is an [[organic reaction]] in which a [[ketone]] is [[redox|oxidized]] to an [[ester]] by treatment with [[peroxy acid]]s or [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;primary1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Adolf von Baeyer | last = Baeyer | first = A. | coauthors = Villiger, V. | title = Einwirkung des Caro'schen Reagens auf Ketone | journal = [[Chemische Berichte|Ber.]] | date = 1899 | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 3625–3633 | doi = 10.1002/cber.189903203151 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112379267/ABSTRACT | format = abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;primary2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Adolf von Baeyer | last = Baeyer | first = A. | coauthors = Villiger, V. | title = Ueber die Einwirkung des Caro'schen Reagens auf Ketone | journal = [[Chemische Berichte|Ber.]] | date = 1900 | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 858–864 | doi = 10.1002/cber.190003301153 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112334541/ABSTRACT | format = abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key features of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation are its stereospecificity and predictable [[regiochemistry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;crudden2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crudden, C.

==Mechanism==

The [[reaction mechanism]] of this oxidative cleavage involves first addition of the peroxy acid to the carbonyl forming a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] intermediate also called the [[Criegee intermediate]] for its similarity with rearrangement of that name. The transition state for this step is envisioned as a hydrogen relay involving three peroxy acid molecules with linear O-H-O interactions.&lt;ref name=Yamabe&gt;''The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Baeyer-Villiger Reactions'' Shinichi Yamabe and Shoko Yamazaki [[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''2007'''; 72(8) pp 3031 - 3041; (Article) [[doi:10.1021/jo0626562]]&lt;/ref&gt; Next is a [[concerted reaction|concerted]] migration of one of the adjacent carbons to oxygen with loss of a [[carboxylic acid]]. If the migrating carbon is chiral, the stereochemistry is retained.

[[Image:Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (mechanism).png|500px|center|Mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation]]

:Migratory aptitude: H &gt; tertiary alkyl &gt; cyclohexyl &gt; secondary alkyl, aryl &gt; primary alkyl &gt; methyl

In the [[transition state]] for this migration step the R-C-O-O [[dihedral angle]] should be 180° in order to maximise the interaction between the filled R-C [[sigma bond]] and the [[antibonding]] O-O sigma bond. This step is also (at least [[in silico]]) assisted by two or three peroxyacid units enabling the hydroxyl proton to shuttle to its new position.&lt;ref name=Yamabe/&gt; 

For unsymmetrical ketones, the migrating group is usually the one that can best stabilize positive charge. Thus, cyclic ketones produce [[lactone]]s and aldehydes usually produce [[carboxylic acid]]s, although [[formate]]s can also be formed if the migrating group is tertiary or an electron rich vinyl group or aromatic ring ([[Dakin reaction]]).  Sometimes the [[alcohol]] is formed when the formate is hydrolytically unstable.

== Biocatalytic BV oxidation ==
The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation can also be performed by [[biocatalysis]] with a so-called '''Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase''' or '''BVMO'''. Though largely an experimental technique it shows the promise of [[enantioselectivity]] and [[green chemistry]] for this reaction type. Current stumbling blocks are confinement to water as the reaction medium, substrate specificity,  dependence on the [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] use and costs of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s such as [[NADPH]] and the costs associated with BVMO's themselves because lengthy purification steps are required. [[In vivo]] oxidations with metabolically active microbial cells introduce complications on their own. 

In one study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Towards practical biocatalytic Baeyer-Villiger reactions: applying a thermostable enzyme in the gram-scale synthesis of optically active lactones in a two-liquid-phase system | author = Frank Schulz; François Leca; Frank Hollmann; Manfred T Reetz | journal = [[Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry]] | date = '''2005''' | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | url = http://bjoc.beilstein-journals.org/content/pdf/1860-5397-1-10.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1186/1860-5397-1-10 | pages = 10 | pmid = 16542025}}&lt;/ref&gt; the enzyme purification issue is addressed and a special thermally stable [[Oxygenase|monooxygenase]] is isolated from a specific [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] strain. This [[enzyme]] converts [[racemic]] 2-phenylcyclohexanone with oxygen to the corresponding (R)-[[lactone]] with 50% [[chemical yield]] and 94% [[enantiomeric excess]] with in a biphasic system of water and [[hexane]]. The NADPH cofactor is regenerated in each [[catalytic cycle]] by action of a second [[dehydrogenase]] enzyme which consumes [[isopropanol]] as a [[sacrificial catalyst]]. 
The solubility of the organic reactant and product is low in the aqueous phase thus averting [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibition]]. On the other hand the [[catalytic turnover number]] for this reaction is much larger than can be obtained with classical organic [[asymmetric catalyst]]s.

The '''Beckmann rearrangement''', named after the German chemist [[Ernst Otto Beckmann]] (1853–1923), is an [[acid catalysis|acid-catalyzed]] [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangement]] of an [[oxime]] to an [[amide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Beckmann solution''' consists of [[acetic acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[acetic anhydride]], and was widely used to catalyze the rearrangement.  Other acids, such as [[sulfuric acid]] or [[polyphosphoric acid]], can also be used. [[sulfuric acid]] is the most commonly used acid for commercial lactam production due to its formation of an ammonium sulfate by-product when neutralized with [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonium sulfate]] is a common agricultural [[fertilizer]] providing nitrogen and sulfur.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The [[reaction mechanism]] of the Beckmann rearrangement is generally believed to consist of an [[alkyl]] migration with expulsion of the hydroxyl group to form a [[nitrilium ion]] followed by [[hydrolysis]]: 

:[[Image:Beckmann rearrangement mechanism.PNG|center|900px|Beckmann rearrangement mechanism]]

In one study, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =S. | last = Yamabe | coauthors =  Tsuchida, N.; Yamazaki, S.| title=Is the Beckmann Rearrangement a Concerted or Stepwise Reaction? A Computational Study | journal=[[Journal of Organic Chemistry]] | year=2005 | volume=70| pages=10638&amp;ndash;10644 |doi=10.1021/jo0508346 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/joceah/2005/70/i26/abs/jo0508346.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mechanism is established [[in silico]] taking into account the presence of [[solvent]] molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involves three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an [[oxonium ion]]). In the [[transition state]] leading to the iminium ion (σ - complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a [[concerted reaction]] and the hydroxyl group is expulsed. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by the three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and the proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the N-methyl acetimidic acid, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the [[amide]].

[[Image:Beckmann mechanism aliphatic.png|center|600px|The Beckmann rearrangement mechanism]]

The same computation with a [[hydroxonium]] ion and 6 molecules of water has the same result but when the migrating substituent is phenyl in the reaction of acetophenone oxime with protonated acetic acid the mechanism favors the formation of an intermediate three-membered π - complex. This π - complex is again not found in the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. 

[[Image:Acetophenone oxime mechanism.png|center|600px|beckmann rearrangement mechanism acetophenone oxime]]

With the cyclohexanone-oxime, the relief of [[ring strain]] results in a third reaction mechanism leading directly to the protonated caprolactam in a single concerted step without the intermediate formation of a π - complex or σ - complex.

== Cyanuric chloride assisted Beckmann reaction==
The Beckmann reaction is known to be catalyzed by [[cyanuric chloride]] and [[zinc chloride]] [[co-catalyst]].  For example, cyclododecanone can be smoothly convered to the corresponding [[lactam]], a [[monomer]] for the production of [[nylon 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Furuya | first = Y. | coauthors = Ishihara, K.; Yamamoto, H.| title=Cyanuric Chloride as a Mild and Active Beckmann Rearrangement Catalyst | journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year=2005| volume=127| pages=11240&amp;ndash;11241| url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/2005/127/i32/abs/ja053441x.html| doi=10.1021/ja053441x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beckmann example.png|center|600px|Beckmann reaction]]

The [[reaction mechanism]] for this reaction is based on a [[catalytic cycle]] with cyanuric chloride activating the [[hydroxyl]] group via a [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction product is dislodged and replaced by new reactant via an intermediate [[Meisenheimer complex]].

==Beckmann fragmentation==
When the oxime has a [[quaternary carbon atom]] in an anti position to the hydroxyl group a fragmentation occurs forming a [[nitrile]]:

The '''benzoin condensation''' is a reaction (often called a [[condensation reaction]], for historical reasons) between two [[aromatic]] [[aldehyde]]s, particularly [[benzaldehyde]]. The reaction is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by a [[nucleophile]] such as the [[cyanide]] [[anion]] or an [[persistent carbene|N-heterocyclic carbene]]. The reaction product is an aromatic [[acyloin]] with [[benzoin]] as the parent compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = Benzoin | author = Roger Adams and C. S. Marvel | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 94 | year = 1941 | prep = cv1p0094}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early version of the reaction was developed in 1832 by [[Justus von Liebig]] and Friederich Woehler during their research on [[almond|bitter almond oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Lapworth]].&lt;ref&gt;''CXXII. — Reactions involving the addition of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to carbon compounds. Part II. Cyanohydrins regarded as complex acids'' [[Arthur Lapworth]], Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions, '''1904''', 85, 1206 - 1214. [[doi:10.1039/CT9048501206]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
[[Image:Benzoin condensation2.png|center|thumb|700px|Scheme 1. Benzoin condensation reaction mechanism. Proton transfers occur at (i) and (ii).]]

In the first step in this reaction, the cyanide anion (as sodium cyanide) reacts with the aldehyde in a [[nucleophilic addition]]. Rearrangement of the intermediate results in [[umpolung|polarity reversal]] of the [[carbonyl]] group, which then adds to the second carbonyl group in a second nucleophilic addition. [[Hydrogen ion|Proton]] transfer and elimination of the cyanide ion affords benzoin as the product. This is a [[reversible reaction]].

The cyanide ion serves three different purposes in the course of this reaction. It acts as a [[nucleophile]], facilitates proton abstraction, and is also the [[leaving group]] in the final step. The benzoin condensation is in effect a [[dimerization]] and not a condensation because a small molecule like water is not released in this reaction. For this reason the reaction is also called a '''benzoin addition'''. In this reaction, the two aldehydes serve different purposes; one aldehyde donates a proton and one aldehyde accepts a proton. 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde is an efficient proton donor while benzaldehyde is both a proton acceptor and donor. In this way it is possible to synthesise mixed benzoins, i.e. products with different groups on each half of the product.

==Scope==
The reaction can be extended to [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] aldehydes with [[base (chemistry)|base]] catalysis in the presence of [[thiazolium salt]]s; the reaction mechanism is essentially the same. These compounds are important in the synthesis of [[heterocyclic compounds]]. The addition is also possible with [[enone]]s; for instance [[methyl vinyl ketone]] is a reagent in the [[Stetter reaction]].

In [[biochemistry]], the [[coenzyme]] [[thiamine]] is responsible for biosynthesis of acyloin-like compounds. This coenzyme also contains a thiazolium moiety, which on [[deprotonation]] becomes a nucleophilic carbene.

In one study, a custom-designed [[persistent carbene|N-heterocyclic carbene]] (NHC, the framework is related to thiazolium salts) was found to facilitate an [[enantioselective]] [[intramolecular]] benzoin condensation (''Scheme 2'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Enders, O. Niemeier and T. Balensiefer | title = Asymmetric Intramolecular Crossed-Benzoin Reactions by N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis | year = 2006 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1463–1467 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200503885 | pmid = 16389609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Intramolecularbenzoin.png|thumb|center|500px|Scheme 2. An intramolecular benzoin condensation]]

This finding was confirmed in another study with a slightly modified NHC using [[DBU (chemistry)|DBU]] as the base instead of [[potassium tert-butoxide]] (''Scheme 3'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = H.

The '''Curtius rearrangement''' (or '''Curtius reaction''' or '''Curtius degradation'''), as first defined by [[Theodor Curtius]], is a [[chemical reaction]] that involves the rearrangement of an [[acyl azide]] to an [[isocyanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Curtius, T. | journal = [[w:Chemische Berichte|Ber.]] | year = 1890 | volume = 23 | pages = 3023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/prac.18940500125]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several reviews have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith, P. A. S. | journal = [[w:Org. React.|Org. React.]] | year = 1946 | volume = 3 | pages = 337–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/cr00084a001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Curtius_Rearrangement_Scheme.png|300px|The Curtius rearrangement]]

The isocyanate can be trapped by a variety of [[nucleophile]]s.  Often water is added to [[hydrolyze]] the isocyanate to an [[amine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Kaiser, C.; Weinstock, J. | title = Amines from mixed carboxylic-carbonic anhydrides: 1-phenylcyclopentylamine |  collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 910 | year = 1988 | prep = cv6p0910}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When done in the presence of [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]], the reaction generates [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]]-[[protecting group|protected]] amines, useful intermediates in [[organic synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/op970115w]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol051428b]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carboxylic acid]]s '''1''' can be easily converted to acyl azides '''3''' using [[diphenylphosphoryl azide]] '''2'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Shioiri, T.; Yamada, S. | title = Diphenyl phosphorazidate | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 206 | year = 1990 | prep = cv7p0206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja00772a052]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1016/S0040-4020(01)97352-1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:DPPA Acid To BOC Amine Scheme.png|550px|Using DPPA to convert an acid to a BOC-protected amine]]

Likewise, when the Curtius reaction is performed in the presence of [[benzyl alcohol]], [[Carboxybenzyl|Cbz]]-protected amines are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = 1-''N''-Acylamino-1,3-dienes from 2,4-pentadienoic acids by the Curtius rearrangement: benzyl ''trans''-1,3-butadiene-1-carbamate |  author = Jessup, P. J.; Petty, C. B.; Roos, J.; Overman, L. E. | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 95 | year = 1988 | prep = cv6p0095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
The first step of the Curtius rearrangement is the loss of [[nitrogen]] gas forming an [[acyl nitrene]] ('''2''').  Once formed, acyl nitrenes very quickly rearrange by migration of R-group forming the desired [[isocyanate]] ('''3''').

:[[Image:Curtius Rearrangement Mechanism.png|600px|The mechanism of the Curtius rearrangement]]

==Scope==
In one variation called the '''Darapsky degradation''' (A. Darapsky, 1936) a Curtius rearrangement takes place as one of the steps from an α-cyanoester to an [[amino acid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chempensoftware.com/reactions/RXN051.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)==

===Overview (location)===
In the former living quarters and office of Sigmund Freud in the house at Berggasse 19 in Vienna's ninth district, the Sigmund Freud Museum presents an exhibition documenting the life and work of the founder of psychoanalysis. Freud lived and worked in this house from 1891 until 1938, when on 4 June he was forced by the National Socialists to flee with his family into exile in England.
History/Timeline: Over the years the museum was expanded in several phases. Initially limited to the few rooms of Sigmund Freud's former practice, the facility underwent major expansion during the '80s and '90s. The addition of a new library was followed by a museum shop, a book storage unit and a modern lecture and exhibition hall in the newly integrated private apartment of the Freud family. The various phases of remodeling were overseen by architect Wolfgang Tschapeller, whose additions maintain a clear distance from the historical structure. Today Anna Freud's rooms house a collection of contemporary art, the Sigmund Freud Museum Contemporary Art Collection. Historical film clips assembled and commentated by Anna Freud that depict moments in the private life of Freud and his family are shown in a video room.

In 2002, the museum gained a new &quot;exterior surface&quot; through the acquisition of the Berggasse 19 storefront in which Siegmund Kornmehl operated his kosher butcher shop until 1938. Starting with the installation &quot;A View to Memory&quot; by Joseph Kosuth, the Sigmund Freud Foundation has since May 2002 regularly invited artists to redefine the storefront as a space for artistic intervention.

===Local Significance===
For many Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), the father of psychoanalysis is Vienna’s most famous sons. His writings not only influenced the intellectual thinkers of his day, but have formed the basis of psychological thought throughout the world (Vienna: City Guide). Thus, the museum is his home country of Vienna is testament to the significance the country has educating generations since the time of Sigmund Freud.  The interior decoration of the museum was carried out in 1971 with the help of Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud's youngest daughter. Original furnishings, including the waiting room, a selection from Freud’s collection of antiquities, and signed copies and first editions of his works provide a glimpse into Freud's biography, his cultural environment and the development of psychoanalysis. The museum owns the original furniture from his waiting room, nearly eighty pieces of Freud’s collection of antiques, and some of his personal belongings. In addition, the few existing original films and sound recordings of Sigmund Freud and his family can be viewed in the museum’s media room.

===Global significance/Impact===
Today Berggasse 19 stands programmatically for the institutions and activities that deepen knowledge about psychoanalysis, its historical dimensions and its links to art. While many of Freud’s ideas are as controversial today as they were in his time, there is no doubting his contribution to psychology; “free association” – the practice of having patients lie on a couch and talk about whatever came to mind- is still the common method of psychotherapy in the United States and around the world. The concept of the unconscious is present in many schools of psychoanalytical thought.  
Additional information: The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C. holds the most extensive collection of Freud documentation. Thus, Freud admirers and enthusiasts here in the United States do not have to travel to Europe to acquire a first-hand learning experience of the acclaimed psychoanalysis.

==Franz Kafka Museum (Prague)==

===Overview (location)===
The Franz Kafka Museum of Prague is dedicated to the Prague-born author, Franz Kafka. The first part of the museum is dedicated to setting the scene. It shows photographs of Prague during Kafka's lifetime and conjures up a vivid picture of the city’s thriving Jewish community. One glass box contains photos of artists, writers and musicians who were Kafka’s peers, including his friend Max Brod. It is easy to imagine these young men walking around Prague’s Old Town, or hanging out in the city’s café’s, just as the young do now. Some of these same names appear in the memorial in the Pinkas Synagogue, dedicated to victims of the Holocaust.

===History/Timeline===
The long-term exhibition, The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague, has made its home here after a stay in Barcelona and then New York. The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague takes place in summer, a time of special significance for Kafka. He was born here on 3rd July 1883, died in a sanatorium at Kierling on 3rd June 1924, and was buried in Prague on 11th  June.

'''FRANZ KAFKA BIOGRAPHY ( 1883 - 1924 ) 	'''													

1883 - Franz Kafka is born in Prague on 3 July. His father, Hermann Kafka, is a merchant from a modest background. His mother, Julie Löwy, is from a Jewish family whose religion is more deeply rooted than her husband’s.
1889 - 1893 - Primary school on the Fleischmarktgasse (Meat Market Street). Sisters, Gabrielle, called Elli, Valerie, called Valli, and Ottilie, called Ottla, are born during this period.
1893 - 1900 - Studies at the Altstädter German Institute. First friends are: Oskar Pollak and Rudolf Illový. The Kafka family lives on the Zeltnergasse.
1901 - 1902 - Higher education at the German University of Prague; first chemistry; in the summer, German studies, then law. Spends the summer holiday at Liboch, near Prague, and travels to Munich. First meetings with Max Brod. 
1903 - Up until this year, has destroyed his first exercises in style. Reads Nietzsche. July: state exams in history of law.
1904 - Autumn / winter: probably, the first draft of &quot;Description of a Strunggle&quot; (&quot;Beschreibung eine Kampfes&quot;).
1905 - In the month of August, he travels to Zuckmantel, Silesia, to stay at a sanatorium. 
1906 - Obtains his doctorate in law. In October, begins the year of legal work necessary to exercise the profession.
1907 - Writes &quot;Wedding Preparations in the Country&quot; (Hochzeitsvorbereitungen auf dem Lande&quot;). The family moves to Niklastrasse (Nikolas Street). In October, he starts work at the Prague office of the Assicurazioni Generali, a company headquartered in the Italian city of Trieste, then Austrian. 
1908 - The first pieces appear, eight fragments, in the magazine Hyperion. Beginning in July of this year until July 1922, works at the Arbeiterunfall und Versicherungsanstalt (Workers' Accident Insurance Institute).
1909 - &quot;Conversation with the Supplicant&quot; and &quot;Conversation with the Drunk&quot; are published in Hyperion. Spends holiday in Riva (on lake Garda) with Max and Otto Brod. On 29 September, the Prague daily Bohemia publishes the tale &quot;The Airplanes at Brescia&quot; (&quot;Die Aeroplane in Brescia&quot;). He started to write a diary.
1910 - In the Easter supplement of Bohemia, five prose pieces appear under the title &quot;Reflections&quot; (&quot;Betrachtungen&quot;). Starts writing the Diaries. He attends Yiddish theater performances. In the middle of October, travels to Paris with Max and otto Brod. Kafka falls ill and returns alone to Prague. In early December, travels to Berlin.
1911 - Spends his holidays by the lake in northern Italy with Max Brod. Spends a period at the Erlenbach sanatorium. His interest in Yiddish theater grows and he makes friends with Jizchak Löwy. The Diaries are already voluminous. In February, writes The Urban World (Die städtische Welt), an extraordinary dream. From 26 August to 12 Septem´ber, with Max Brod, passes through Munich on his way to Zurich, Lucerne, Lugano, Milan, and Lake Maggiore. From Italy they go on to Paris, where Kafka writes some notes as an exceptional observes, and then return to Milan, where they see plays at the Fossati Theater. In Paris, they have seen Racine's Phaedra and Bizet's Carmen. 
1912 - A decisive year for the writer. During the first month he starts The Man Who Disappeared (&quot;Der Verschollene&quot;), which will later be given the title America by Max Brod. Spends July in Weimar with Max Brod. Is introduced to Felice Bauer, with whom in October will begin a copious correspondence. From November to December, tireless and insomniac, writes &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (literally, &quot;the transformation,&quot; but known generally as &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). By January 1913, has written seven chapters of The Man Who Disappeared, the original title of the novel, which for a long time was published inder the title of America. In December, gives a public reading of &quot;The Judgment&quot; (&quot;Das Urteil&quot;). The number of pages in the Diaries decreases while the letters to Felice abound.
1913 - In Leipzig, Rowohlt publishes Meditation (Betrachtung), which has been in circulation since November 1912. In January, Kafka travels to Berlin to meet Felice Bauer's family. In May, makes a second trip to Berlin. In September, travels to Vienna, Venice, and Riva.
1914 - In June, becomes engaged to Felice Bauer. In July, breaks off the engagement. Travels to the Baltic. In August, moves to his own rented lodgings on Bilekgasse street. Begins writing The Trial (Der Prozess). Elias Canetti, in his 1969 essay Kafka's Other Trial (Der andere Prozess Kafkas), makes a connection between the &quot;trial&quot; of Kafka's engagement and breakup with Felice and its transformation into the novel The Trial. Meets Felice's friend Grete Bloch. October&quot; writes &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; (&quot;In der Strafkolonie&quot;).
1915 - In January, goes to see Felice Bauer. In March, moves to his own apartment on Lange Gasse (Long Street). (Kafka almost lived with his parents, except for some periods such as those noted and his final days in Berlin). The expressionist playwright Carl Sternheim presents the Fontane prize money to Kafka. November: in Leipzig, Rohwohlt publishes &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (Die Verwandlung&quot;). &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; is display in bookshops, along with &quot;The Judgment&quot;.
1916 - In July, goes to Marienbad with Felice. Writes short stories for A Country Doctor (Ein Landartz). In Munich, gives a reading of &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;.
1917 - In the evening and at nights, he worked on Alchemists Street, and then takes a room in the Schönborn Palace. In July, becomes engaged to Felice for the second time. On 4 September, is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Takes a leave from work and spends time in Zürau with Ottla. Writes &quot;Aphorisms&quot;. In December, in Prague, breaks off his engagement with Felice for the second time.
1918 - First, to Zürau, where he studies Kierkegaard. In the summer, to Prague. In September, to Turnau. In November, to Schelesen. Relationship with Julie Wohryzek, from a modest family, greatly displeases Kafka's father.
1919 - A Country Doctor and &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; are published. Spends the summer in Prague. Becomes engaged to Julie Wohryzek. Spends the winter with Max Brod in Schelesen. Writes &quot;Letter to his Father&quot; (&quot;Brief an den Vater&quot;), a document as hurtful as a shot to the hierarchical heart of the family, but prevented from reaching its intended recipient by his mother.
1920 - Sick leave in Merano. Correspondence with Milena Jesenská. Summer and autumn, office work in Prague. Breaks up with Julie Wohryzek. Goes to Matliare, in the Tatra Mountains, for the following moths. Strikes up a friendship with a doctor, Robert Klopstock.  
1921 - In the Tatra Mountains (Matliare) until September. In Prague for the rest of the year.
1922 - January and February in Spindelmühle. Returns to Prague.  Reads pages from The Castle (Das Schloss), which he works on from January to September. In the spring, writes &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; (&quot;Ein Hungerkünstler&quot;) and in the summer, &quot;Investigations of a Dog&quot; (&quot;Forschungen eines Hundes&quot;).  Spends June to September in Planá with Ottla, then Prague.
1923 - Spends July in Müritz, on the Baltic Sea. Meets Dora Dymant. Goes to stay with Ottla at Schelesen. From September to March, lives in Berlin with Dymant, a Zionist who revives in Kafka the desire to go and settle in Palestine. Writes some of the narratives that, together with those of the previous year, epitomize the purest traits of his production: &quot;A Little Woman&quot; (&quot;Eine kleine Frau&quot;) and &quot;The Burrow&quot; (&quot;Der Bau&quot;).
1924 - Berlin. In March, leaves for Prague. Writes &quot;Josephine, the Singer, or the Mouse Folk.&quot; Kafka can neither talk nor swallow his food. Leaves Prague at the beginning of April. Goes to the Kierling Sanatorium, with Robert Klopstock and Dora Dymant. Dies there on 3 June. The writer is buried on 11 June in Prague. &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; is published that summer. 

===Local/Significance===
The symbiosis between Prague and Kafka's life and work is well known - a linking of destinies that, for several decades, Kafka scholars have studied from every possible angle. This is due not only to the nature of the exhibits themselves but also, and primarily, to the way the exhibition is thematically presented. The exhibition has got two sections - Existential Space and Imaginary Topography.
Existential Space - In this first stage of our immersion into the world of Kafka, we look at what the city does with the writer, how it shapes his life, the kind of stamp it leaves on him. Prague acts on Kafka with all of its metamorphosing power, confining him to an existential space which he can only enter by &quot;fixing my gaze on the surface of things&quot;, Prague forces Kafka into a spatial stranglehold, perversely dosing out its secrets. Prague contributes the myth, its obscure magic, a magnificent backdrop, but it abhors clarity. And this is precisely what Kafka detects.
He sees the city as a &quot;dear little mother with claws&quot;, endowed with a past which is greater than its present, shielded by its charm, yet also raising a great, constantly threatening fist. His Diaries and a voluminous correspondence with his family, friends, lovers and editors bear witness to this influence. Our aim is to explore the city, seeing it from Kafka's point of view. An exclusively biographical or merely chronological approach would not be enough; the challenge lies in condensing the principal conflicts in the life of Kafka in Prague, guided by the writer's own gaze. This means joining Kafka on his descent into the depths of his city, adapting ourselves to his sensorial range and cognitive register, becoming involved in a slow distortion of space-time - in short, agreeing to an experience where everything is allowed except indifference.  
Imaginary Topography - The way Kafka creates the layers of his city is one of the most enigmatic operations of modern literature. With the odd exception, Kafka does not name the places he describes in his novels and short stories. The city steps back is no longer recognizable by its buildings, bridges and monuments. And even if they are recognized by an inhabitant of Prague or by a student of Kafka, they have become something else.
People are often keen to pinpoint real Prague places in Kafka's fiction. It is generally recognized that the anonymous cathedral in The Trial is none other than St. Vitus cathedral, and that the path taken by Joseph K. in the last chapter leads from the Old Town to the outer limits of Kleinseite, over Charles Bridge. It is also said that in The Judgment, from Georg Bendemann's window, we recognize the wharf, the river, the opposite bank of the Moldava, just as they could be seen from Niklasstrasse, where the Kafka family lived in 1912. Efforts have been made to prove that the topography of Prague is a constant which simply goes unnamed.

Yet this is not what really matters. In his fiction, Kafka carries out a more difficult operation: he turns Prague into an imaginary topography which transcends the fallacy of realism. Kafka's phantasmal architecture has other ends. Rather than a particular house, school, office, church, prison or castle being important, it is what these constructions reveal when they act as topological metaphors or allegorical places. What surprises does this transfigured Prague hold in store? Just how far can the metamorphosis of a city take us?

===Global Significance/Impact===
Franz Kafka is considered to be one of the most important and influential writers of the 20th century. His work, most of which was published posthumously, continues to be a source of research, scholarship and philosophical discussion in diverse academic, literary and popular arenas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter on the politics of oil takes an in depth focus on the oil industry in Austria and the Czech Republic. Every large organization deals with politics, in essence politics is about governing and managing resources. In dealing with the world’s most demanded resource, oil it can be expected that the politics that surround it will be complex, far reaching, and most of all relate to you the reader.  In studying the politics of oil in these two countries my original assumptions were quickly overturned. The original assumption would be that the politics of oil would be local issues, but I quickly discovered that while local issues do have a place in the research and discussion, regional, and even transnational issues will take precedent in the preceding sections.


&lt;u&gt;Politics of Oil:  The Top Companies That Deal With Oil Everyday&lt;/u&gt;

When the delivery truck fills up the tank in Vienna or the taxi is pumping petrol in Prague, it is more likely than not they are not thinking about the complex politics that go into getting the gas from the ground to the pump. This is where Mr. Helmut Langanger comes into the scene in Austria, and he is the man who helps make that almost mystical transition from the ground to the pump work so well.  Mr. Langanger. is in charge of exploration for the largest oil company in Austria, OMV.  . His leadership in exploring and then drilling for oil in Austria has helped place Austria in a somewhat comfortable energy position. In 2003 the largest discovery was made by his team when a well was found, containing 500,000 tons of crude oil.  (Christian, 2005) While OMV dominates holds the lions share of the market in Austria, the same cannot be said of Austria’s close neighbor, the Czech Republic.

The Ceska Rafinerska is the largest oil refiner in the Czech Republic and in early 2010 has become the center of oil politics in the Czech Republic. The largest oil company in the world, Shell, is looking to sell their share of the company to a buyer for around $200 million. There are numerous buyers vying for the purchase but nobody has reached the set price yet. Many entities have become involved in this engagement, ranging from the Czech government to Russian diplomats. The company, Mero has their sights set on acquiring the refinery in order to expand their control on the energy industry in the Czech Republic. Mero already has the market share on transporting oil throughout the country and acquiring the company would be a strategic benefit, however inside sources close to the negotiations state that their initial offer fell far below what was being asked for. (Frantova, 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of Paying: How Austria And Czech Republic Pay for Oil&lt;/u&gt;

The Czech Republic, like many countries tax oil as a way to raise funds to run the country. The most recent statistics show that there are various taxes built into the cost of a liter of oil in the country. This includes the value added tax and the consumer tax.(PetroPlaza, 2010) Across the border in Austria there is a growing debate over the oil tax. Should the country use toll roads or move to a  robust fuel tax? Organizations that support toll roads suggest that it would have economic benefits; such as lowering inflation for the Austrian economy and attracting those seeking “cheap gas” from across the border. (Austrian Times , 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of the Grid: Russia’s Role on it&lt;/u&gt;

Transporting oil from the ground to the tank is no simple task and international politics can sometimes stop the transition. The events that took place between the United States, Czech Republic, and Russia represent how divisive oil can be on the world stage. In the summer of 2008, the United States signed an agreement with the Czech Republic that would place a radar in the country. The radar, which is linked to the larger Anti-Ballistic Missile Program run by the United States Department of Defense  combats Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats. This event caused diplomatic relations between Russia and the other countries to remain shaky for a few weeks. Days after this agreement was signed Russia cut the flow of oil into the Czech Republic. Russian leaders publicly stated that how furious they were over the proceedings and vowed to take action. The Czech Republic had keenly predicted such tension over oil years before when they built a massive pipeline on the other side of the country extending from Germany. (Kramer 2008)

Austria’s largest oil company, OMV for years have been working to access the precious oil flowing from Russia. Austria and Slovakia at the same time also had their sights set on the Druzhba  Pipeline. The aged pipeline dates from the Communist Era and was constructed to bring the crude supply to countries under Soviet control. The problem that all parties are facing is there is a gap in the pipeline grid and the gap needs to be filled to help prevent stoppages of flow and increase the availability of supply for Austria and Slovakia. The project is in its second phase after the Slovakian company declared bankruptcy. New life was breathed into the project when the Slovakian government bought back a stake in the company. This is a great example of how expensive it is to build pipelines through other countries. It takes cooperation and determination to see a project too success. (Energy Business Review 2009)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of the Oil Pipeline: How Nations can Rise and Fall from Them&lt;/u&gt;.

It was March 1960, in Bratslavia, Slovakia when an oil pipeline began leaked and severely damaged a critical water reservoir that supplied the city drinking water.  The first step taken on this multi-layered oil pipeline construction plan was to build a pipeline between an Austrian refinery  and the Slovnaft refinery. This brought immediate condemnation from Slovakian citizens who want to protect the environment. The concern is that the  projected development of the pipeline will travel directly over a precious water source. concern.(Spectactor March 2010)

While the prior environmental damage remained on the front of many Slovakian minds, it was in the national interest of their country and Austria to continue with the project especially in light of the memrandum of understanding that the two countries leaders signed committing them to strong energy policies while assisting the other. The “Bratslava-Schwechat-Pipeline” has become the final design for this pipeline. As this project is completed it will be the first time that crude oil will be pumped directly from Russia. While Austria waits for Sloavkia to sort out technical issues, Slovakia must weigh the pros and cons of the project. The positive aspects of developing a more robust network of pipelines throughout central and eastern Europe can help them become more secure. In early 2009, Russia cut off gas to areas of Europe when a disagreement with Ukraine went bad. Therefore to prevent a “Ukraine Incident” it could be advantageous to develop oil that is less connected from Russia. . ( Spectator March 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of Consolidation: Why Oil Companies are Merging&lt;/u&gt;

In April of this year, 2010 Mobil Oil Austria merged with Agip Austria which is controlled by a company that goes by ENI, which is based in Italy. The European Union Commission dealing with matters like these had to agree to accept the accquistion because of the numerous countries involved in the deal.  ENI deals mainly with natural gas exporation but has its hands in oil exploration as well.  While many of these companies may sound unfamiliar if you are outside of Europe, Mobil Oil Austria which is the key company in the figure is owned by the ExxonMobil Holding Company based in Germany. (EU approves acquisition of Mobil Oil Austria by ENI)

In the Czech Republic there is a transnational oil company. It is the Czech Republic Resource Corporation. The company in Spring of 2010 has signed a deal with a Texas oil company that commits to working with them in the field. This is not strategic business move but a financial one that will allow a new Czech oil company to leverage itself in the competitive market. It has an office in Prague and one located in Texas.  (Stock Market Weekly)

The politics of Oil in Austria and the Czech Republic and the wider Eastern European market are complex, there is no debate about that. But hopefully the point has been brought to the reader that the politics of oil involve leverage and resources. Austria may use leverage to help Slovakia against Russia. OMV may use its vast network through Austria to put up a bid when the next opportunity comes to acquire a smaller company. Oil companies and states seem to have a symbiotic relationship, and that has been a unique facet of this brief look at these two countries “spheres of oil.” Austria and the Czech Republic are great examples of the symbiotic relationship that makes of the politics of oil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}


The '''Demjanov rearrangement''' (named after its discoverer [[Nikolai Demyanov]]) is the [[chemical reaction]] of primary [[amine]]s with [[nitrous acid]] to give rearranged [[alcohol]]s.{{Ref|Demjanov1903A}}{{Ref|Demjanov1903B}}{{Ref|Smith1960}} It involves substitution by an OH group with a possible ring expansion.

It is named after the Russian chemist [[Nikolai Jakovlevich Demjanov]] (Dem'anov, Demianov) ([[1861]]–[[1938]]).{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}

[[File:Demjanov_Rearrangement_Scheme.png|500px]]

==Reaction Mechanism==
The reaction process begins with diazotization of the amine by nitrous acid. The diazonium group is a good leaving group.

At this point, two possibilities occur. In possibility A, the four membered ring expands to produce a charged five membered ring, thus expelling the nitrogen gas. An water molecule adds to the carbocation, and with one further deprotonation the substituted five membered ring is produced.{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}

{|
||A. ||[[File:Demjanov mech rearrangement.png|525px]]
|}

In possibility B, the hydrogen molecule adds directly to the carbon attached to the nitrogen molecule, thus expelling the nitrogen gas in one step. After deprotonation, the substituted four membered ring is produced.{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}
{|
||B. ||[[File:Demjanov mech SN2.png|511px]]
|}

==Uses==
The Demjanov rearrangement is extremely useful in producing a 1-carbon ring enlargement in four, five or six membered rings. Ring enlargements are incredibly useful in synthesizing mechanically useful molecules.

It has been shown that the Demjanov reaction is susceptible to [[regioselectivity]]. One example of this is a study conducted by D. Fattori looking at the regioselectivity of the Demjanov rearrangement in one-carbon enlargements of naked sugars.{{Ref|Fattori1993}} It showed that when the an exo methylamine underwent Demjanov nitrous acid deamination, ring enlargement was not produced. 

[[Image: Demjanov Fattori-exo.png|402px]]

However, when the endo methylamine underwent the same conditions, a mixture of rearranged alcohols were produced. 
 
[[Image: Demjanov Fattori-endo.png|396px]] 

Often, the Demjanov rearrangement is followed by deprotonation to produce a cyclic ketone, an incredibly useful molecule for further reactions such as various nucleophilic attacks.

==Problems==
This rearrangement also leads to a substituted, but not expanded, byproduct. Thus it can be difficult to isolate the two products and acquire the desired yield. Also, stereoisomers are produced depending on the direction of addition of the water molecule and other molecules may be produced depending on rearrangements.

==Future uses==
Current research is exploring the possibilities of various directing groups to influence the selectivity of products in the Demjanov rearrangement, such as tin or silicon.{{Ref|Chow2004}}This may lead to increased success with the Demjanov, as it would allow more control in the reaction and increase the desired product yield. The rearrangement is incredibly useful, but using it can sometimes prove ineffective by the difficulty of creating the preferred product. Thus if directing groups are possible, this would greatly improve the applicability of the Demjanov. 

==Variations==
===Tiffeneau-Demjanov Rearrangement===
The [[Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement]] is a variation of the Demjanov rearrangement, and involves both a [[ring expansion]] and the production of a [[ketone]] by using [[sodium nitrite]] and [[hydrogen cation]]. Using the Tiffeneau-Demjanov reaction is often advantageous as, while there are rearrangements possible in the products, the reactant always undergoes ring enlargement. As in the Demjanov rearrangement, products illustrate regioselectivity in the reaction. Migratory aptitudes of functional groups dictate rearrangement products. 

===Use of diazomethane===
[[Diazomethane]] also produces ring enlargement, and its reaction is mechanically similar to the [[Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement]].

[[Image:dielsalder.png|right|frame|The Diels-Alder reaction]]
The '''Diels-Alder reaction''' is an [[organic chemical reaction]] (specifically, a [[cycloaddition]]) between a conjugated [[diene]] and a substituted [[alkene]], commonly termed the [[dienophile]], to form a substituted [[cyclohexene]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Synthesis in the hydroaromatic series, IV. Announcement: The rearrangement of malein acid anhydride on arylated diene, triene and fulvene'', Diels, O.; Alder, K. ''[[Ber.]]'' '''1929''', ''62'', 2081 &amp; 2087.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction can proceed even if some of the atoms in the newly-formed ring are not [[carbon]]. Some of the Diels-Alder reactions are reversible; the decomposition reaction of the cyclic system is then called the '''Retro-Diels-Alder'''. For example, Retro-Diels-Alder compounds are commonly observed when a Diels Alder product is analyzed via [[mass spectrometry]].

[[Otto Diels|Otto Paul Hermann Diels]] and [[Kurt Alder]] first documented the novel reaction in 1928 for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in [[1950]] for their work on the eponymous reaction..

The Diels-Alder reaction is generally considered the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; of reactions in organic chemistry since it requires very little energy to create the very useful [[cyclohexene]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;Kloetzel, M. C. ''Org. React.'' '''1948''', ''4'', 1-59. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, H. L. ''Org. React.'' '''1948''', ''4'', 60-173.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The reaction occurs via a single [[transition state]], which has a smaller volume than either the starting materials or the product. It is an associative type of reaction, and it is sped up by very high pressures. Diels-Alder is an example of a [[pericyclic]] reaction.

Some [[free-radical]] versions of this reaction have been observed, though these are not Diels-Alder reactions as the [[stereochemistry]] at the carbons is scrambled. These are step-wise reactions of the free radicals which form the new bonds in at least two steps. An example of this type of reaction is the reaction of ''selenobenzophenone'' with a 1,3-diene (See: [[thioketones]]).

== The diene ==
The [[diene]] component in the Diels-Alder reaction can be open-chain or cyclic and it can have many different kinds of [[substituent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kozmin, S. A.; He, S.; Rawal, V. H. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 10, p.442 (2004); Vol. 78, p.160 (2002). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=v78p0160 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one limitation: it must be able to exist in the s-''cis'' [[Geometric isomerism|conformation]].  [[Butadiene]]&lt;ref&gt;Hershberg, E. B.; Ruhoff, J. R. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 2, p.102 (1943); Vol. 17, p.25 (1937). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv2p0102 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; itself normally prefers the s-''trans'' conformation, with the two double bonds as far away from each other as possible. If there are substituents larger than hydrogen then [[steric hindrance]] may influence the relative stabilities of the conformations. For simple cases, the barrier to rotation about the central bond is small and rotation to the less favourable but reactive s-''cis'' conformation is rapid. 
Cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-''cis'' conformation are exceptionally reactive in Diels-Alder reactions ([[cyclopentadiene]] is a classic example), while cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-''trans'' conformation and cannot adopt the s-''cis'' conformation will not undergo the Diels-Alder reaction at all. An especially reactive diene is [[Danishefsky’s diene]].

[[Dendralenes]] are a new class of experimental DA dienes.

Unstable dienes, such as o-[[quinodimethane]], can be generated [[in situ]]. [[Aromatic]] stabilization in the product of a DA reaction using such a diene is, in some cases, the reason behind the very high reactivity and lack of stability of such diene. The use of such unstable dienes is advantageous, despite the trouble, in that the products will contain newly formed aromatic six-membered rings.

Benzenoid compounds rarely undergo DA reactions and often require very reactive dienophiles. One example of such rare reaction is the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]].

== The dienophile ==
In a typical Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile has an [[electron-withdrawing group]] [[conjugation|conjugated]] to the alkene. Though common, this feature is not exclusive of Diels-Alder dienophiles. There must be some extra conjugation, at least a [[phenyl]] group or [[chlorine]] atom. The dienophile can be activated by a [[Lewis acid]] such as [[niobium pentachloride]].&lt;ref&gt;''Niobium Pentachloride Activation of Enone Derivatives: Diels-Alder and Conjugate Addition Products'' Mauricio Gomes Constantino, Valdemar Lacerda Júnior and Gil Valdo José da Silva ''Molecules'' '''2002''', ''7'', 456–465. ([http://artemis.ffclrp.usp.br/PublicaPDF/Valdemar_Mol02.pdf Article])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DA NbCl5.gif|center|Dienephile activation by Lewis acid]]

[[Cyclopentadiene]] does not react with [[cyclohexenone]] in [[ethyl acetate]] unless the Lewis acid is present. The yield improves when reaction temperature is lowered to -78°C because [[polymerization]] side reactions are prevented. Niobium pentachloride catalysis gives only the [[endo conformer]]. The same reaction with [[aluminium chloride]] results in an endo and exo mixture. Many of these [[Lewis acid]]s are not good catalysts for the reaction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, this is because the carbonyl oxygen binds too tightly to the metal centre. A far better catalyst for such a system is a combination of [[silver]] [[perchlorate]] and [[Lawesson's reagent]] in cold [[dichloromethane]].

It is well known that it is possible to use heteroatom containing dienophiles for Diels-Alder reactions, for instance [[Lawesson's reagent]] (and diferrocenyl dithiadiphosphetane disulfide) can react with 1,3-dienes to form six membered ring adducts. Also selenoketones and [[thioketones]] are able to react in the same way with 1,3-dienes. [[Imines]] are reactants in the [[Aza Diels-Alder reaction]].

Dienophiles can be chosen to contain a &quot;masked functionality&quot;. The dienophile undergoes Diels-Alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule. A series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group. The end product cannot not be made in a single DA step because equivalent dienophile is either unreactive or inaccessible. An example of such approach is the use of α-chloroacrylonitrile (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CClCN). When reacted with a diene, this dienophile will introduce alpha-chloronitrile functionality onto the product molecule. This is a &quot;masked functionality&quot; which can be then hydrolyzed to form a ketone. α-Chloroacrylonitrile dienophile is an equivalent of [[ketene]] dienophile (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=C=O), which would produce same product in one DA step. The problem is that ketene itself cannot be used in Diels-Alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner (by [2+2] [[cycloaddition]]), and therefore &quot;masked functionality&quot; approach has to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan ''Synthesis'' '''1977''', 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other such functionalities are [[phosphonium]] substituents (yielding exocyclic double bonds after [[Wittig reaction]]), various [[sulfoxide]] and [[sulfonyl]] functionalities (both are [[acetylene]] equivalents), and nitro groups (ketene equivalents).

== Heterodienophiles ==
No major loss in reactivity of dienophile is seen when one, or both, of the carbons are substituted for another variety of atom.&lt;ref&gt;Weinreb, S. M. ''Comp. Org. Syn.'' '''1991''', ''5'', 513-550. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbonyl]] groups, for example, can successfully react with dienes to yield [[pyran]]oid rings. Generally, the endo [[transition state]] is favored in this case.

Nitroso compounds (N=O) react to form oxazine-like compounds (cyclic molecules with nitrogen and oxygen present in the six-membered ring).&lt;ref&gt;Streith, J.; DeFoin, A. ''Synthesis'' '''1994''', 1107-1117.&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of dienophiles successfully used for DA reactions is [[imine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greico, P.; Larsen, S. D. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 8, p.31 (1993); Vol. 68, p.206 (1990). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv8p0031 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions are useful for preparation of [[alkaloid]] and other polycyclic compounds.

== Stereoselectivity in DA Reactions ==
Diels-Alder reactions can lead to formation of a variety of structural [[isomer]]s and [[stereoisomer]]s ([[enantiomer]]s and [[diastereomer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''Diastereofacial Selectivity in the Diels-Alder Reaction'' Coxon, J. M. ''et al.'' ''Advances in Detailed Reaction Mechanisms'' '''1994''', ''3'', 131-166. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; Identity of major products can usually be predicted, however.

In unsymmetrically substituted diene and dienophile, pseudo-[[arene substitution patterns|ortho]] and [[arene substitution patterns|para]] orientations in products are usually favored over [[arene substitution patterns|meta]] orientation. A particular preference in location of substitutents in the product can, in some cases, be explained in terms of [[frontier orbital]] theory. Most commonly, [[diene]] bears an [[electron-releasing group]] (ERG) and dienophile bears an [[electron-withdrawing group]] (EWG). The strongest interaction takes place between [[HOMO]] of diene and [[LUMO]] of dienophile. Carbons that have the highest coefficients in two frontier orbitals will begin to bond; therefore these carbons will direct the orientation of substituents and thus identity of major product of a DA reaction.

Dealing with the actual frontier orbital coefficients can be avoided since the preferred orientation in product can be described in terms of partial positive and negative charges that exist in diene and dienophile. Carbon with a partial negative charge will interact most readily with carbon bearing a partial positive charge. Therefore those two carbons will start coming together, thus dictating the relative orientation of substituents. The existence of partial positive/negative charge can always be determined by drawing resonance contributors for diene and dienophile, taking their ERG and EWG into consideration.

The initial potential of the reaction was utilized in the form of insecticides, which ultimately led to the endo rule. Otto Diels’ and Kurt Alder’s reaction allowed for the production of weapons against agricultural pests to be fully realized in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, A. Diels-Alder Reactions. New York, NY: Elsevier Company, 1965. pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these chemicals contained chlorine, of which two are called [[Dieldrin]] and [[Aldrin]] after the appropriate individuals. These chemicals have been long-since discontinued because of their toxicity to not only invertebrates, but to higher orders of organisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;Damgaard, Ida N., Niels E. Skakkebaek, and Et Al . &quot;Persistent Pesticide in Human Breast Milk and Cryptorchidism.&quot; Environmental Health Perspectives 114 (2006): pp. 1133-1138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cerrillo, I, M F. Olea-Serrano, J Ibarluzea, and Et Al . &quot;Environmental and Lifestyle Factors for Organochloride Exposure Among Women Living in Southern Spain.&quot; Chemosphere 62 (2006): pp. 1917-1924.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, insecticide use may continue unabated with the recent introduction of various safe treatments. Though insecticides like Dieldrin and Aldrin cause a slew of cardiac and respiratory illnesses (as well as reproductive failure) they served as an important step towards understanding why the endo product was the major yield. The study of the insecticide’s fused [[norcamphane]] rings became a highly popular topic in the 1930s and 1940s. Oxidative degradation revealed high specificity of the stereochemistry; after much research by Kurt Alder and H.F. Rickert, it became clear that steric hindrance is not as important in Diels-Alder reactions as it is in other reactions. This led to the secondary orbital explanation as well as a satisfactory hypothesis that elucidated polymerization of certain Diels-Alder adducts.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, A. Diels-Alder Reactions. New York, NY: Elsevier Company, 1965. pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ERGandEWG.png|right|frame|DA substituent effects]]

===Cis principle===

According to the '''cis principle''' or the '''Alder-Stein rules''' formulated by Alder and Stein in 1937, the [[stereochemistry]] of substituents in the starting material is retained in the product. This means that if a [[cis]]-dienophile is reacted, both of the cis-[[substituent]]s will end up on same side (face) of the product ring. [[Trans]]-dienophile will yield a product where both of trans-substituents (that came originally from the dienophile) will be on different sides of the product ring. The same principle applies to [[diene]]s. ''Trans'', ''trans'' or ''cis'', ''cis'' 1,4-substituents will end up on same side of the ring, whereas ''trans'', cis'' 1,4-substituents will be oriented towards different faces of the ring.

Besides the ortho/meta/para-forming orientations, the [[diene]] and dienophile may arrange themselves in different ways to yield [[Endo-exo isomerism|exo and endo]] [[transition state]]s which result in different products. To determine which is the endo and which is the exo transition state, the two molecules are oriented [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other, such that diene's single bond (one which connects two double bonds) is parallel to dienophile's double or [[triple bond]]. It makes no difference whether the dienophile is positioned above or below the diene. The single substituent (or [[cis]]-substituents on the dienophile) is oriented to point in the direction of diene's pi-system. This is the '''''endo''''' transition state (pictured below). If these substituents are pointed away from the [[diene]], this would be the '''''exo''''' transition state.

===Endo addition rule===
[[Image:endoexo1.png|right|frame|Endo versus exo effect]]
Using the 'cis principle' it is understood that cis-substituents on dienophile, for example, will end up on same side of the molecule. It is not obvious where the [[substituent]]s on both [[diene]] and dienophile will end up relative to each other. To predict the [[cis]] or [[trans]] orientation of substituents that are coming from different molecules we have to examine possible [[transition state]]s. The most stable transition state will lead to the major product. Transition states will also dictate the relative orientation of the diene's and dienophile's substituents on the product ring. In some cases another rule can be applied: the '''endo addition rule'''. According to this rule, the most stable [[transition state]] results when there is a 'maximum accumulation of double bonds'. This rule is not always followed. It most often applies when dealing with cyclic [[diene]]s and dienophiles. For example, the DA reaction of [[cyclopentadiene]] and [[maleic anhydride]] yields over 95% of the [[Endo-exo isomerism|endo]] product.
It is important to note that labels &quot;exo&quot; and &quot;endo&quot; relate to the orientation of [[substituent]]s in the [[transition state]] and not to a specific orientation of substituents in the product molecule. In each individual case, the transition state has to be examined to see the most favored relative orientation of substituents. It is not true for the endo transition state that the substituents on dienophile and 1,4-substituents on diene will always point towards the same side of the newly formed ring. &quot;Endo&quot; and &quot;exo&quot; define specific transition states, not orientation of substituents. In the picture below, it just happens that the endo transition state will yield substituents on same side of the ring. This is not always so. In the case of [[maleic anhydride]] and [[cyclopentadiene]] the endo product will have the R groups of the [[diene]] and dienophile oriented toward the opposite sides of the newly formed ring.

[[Image:bothexoendo.png|center|frame|Reaction with both exo-endo effect]]

The exo product can predominate, however, for some reactions. This can happen when the resulting endo product can easily dissociate back into the starting material. In such reactions, the exo product predominates with extended reaction times because the exo product is [[thermodynamic reaction control|thermodynamically favored]]. In other cases, the endo product can convert to what would be the exo product of the reaction. In the example below, endo product B was the only one isolated after the Diels-Alder reaction. However, letting the reaction go for prolonged periods of time also yielded substantial amounts of exo product A. The authors speculated that endo product B can [[epimer]]ize to exo product A in the following way:

[[Image:conversionendo.png|center|frame|Epimerization in DA reaction]] 

In summary, [[diastereoselectivity]] is based on the postulation of the [[transition state]]. For any given DA reaction, one can imagine one possible transition state being favored over the other due to [[steric]], stereoelectronic, and complexing factors. Thus, predictions can be made on the identity of major product of a particular DA reaction by looking at the starting material available.

==Retro Diels-Alder reactions==
DA reactions are reversible and in a retro Diels-Alder reaction the diene and alkene are reformed. One representative reaction is the '''Rickert-Alder reaction'''&lt;ref&gt;Alder, K.; Stein, G.; Pries, P.; Winckler, H. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges.1929, 62B, 2337-72.&lt;/ref&gt; in which, thanks to favorable rearomatization, the oxidized cycloadduct of [[quinone]] and [[1,3-cyclohexadiene]] at elevated temperatures extrudes [[ethylene]] to form [[anthraquinone]].

:[[Image:Rickert-Alder reaction.png|400px|Rickert-Alder reaction]]

==Asymmetric DA reactions==
In '''asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions ''' only one of two possible enantiomers is formed. [[Asymmetric catalysis]] by [[organocatalysis]] is possible with catalysts based on an [[imidazoline]] skeleton  (the [[MacMillan catalyst]]) for instance in the reaction of [[cyclohexadiene]] with [[acrolein]]:&lt;ref&gt;''New Strategies for Organic Catalysis: The First Highly Enantioselective Organocatalytic Diels-Alder Reaction'' Ahrendt, K. A.; Borths, C. J.; MacMillan, D. W. C. [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; (Communication); '''2000'''; 122(17); 4243-4244.  [[doi:10.1021/ja000092s]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McMillanCatalyst.png|400px|center|DA reaction with MacMillan catalyst]]

Diels-Alder reactions also lend themselves to [[chiral synthesis]] with [[chiral auxiliary|chiral auxiliaries]]. In one research effort,&lt;ref&gt;''A fully-telescoped, aqueous, auxiliary-mediated asymmetric transformation'' Mathew P. D. Mahindaratne, Brian A. Quiñones, Antonio Recio III, Eric A. Rodriguez, Frederick J. Lakner, and George R. Negrete ''[[Arkivoc]]''(EJ-1566C) pp 321-328 '''2005'''.  ([http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1566/EJ-1566C.asp Article])&lt;/ref&gt; the auxiliary is derived from L-[[asparagine]]. The [[telescopic synthesis]] with [[cyclopentadiene]] and [[acrylic acid]] yields the DA adduct with three [[stereocenter]]s as predominantly the [[endo conformer]] and with 54% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]].

[[Image:AsymmetricDielsAlder.png|center|500px|Asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction with asparagine auxiliary]]

[[Lewis acid]]s ([[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[zinc chloride|ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and others) act as catalysts by coordinating to the dienophile. The complexed dienophile becomes more [[electrophilic]] and more reactive toward the diene. This increases the rate and often the stereoselectivity of a DA reaction.

The '''Favorskii rearrangement''' (not to be confused with the [[Favorskii reaction]]), named for the Russian chemist [[Alexei Yevgrafovich Favorskii]]&lt;!--- a.k.a. Alexei Evgrafovich Favorskii ---&gt;, is most principally a rearrangement of [[cyclopropanone]]s and [[α-halo ketones]] which leads to [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives.  In the case of cyclic α-halo ketones, the Favorski rearrangement constitutes a ring contraction. This rearrangement takes place in the presence of a base, sometimes [[hydroxide]], to yield a carboxylic acid but most of the time either an [[alkoxide]] base or an [[amine]] to yield an [[ester]] or an [[amide]], respectively.  α,α’-Dihaloketones eliminate HX under the reaction conditions to give α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds  &lt;ref&gt;Favorskii, A.

==Reaction mechanism==

The [[reaction mechanism]] is thought to involve the formation of an [[enolate]] on the side of the [[ketone]] away from the [[chlorine]] atom. This enolate cyclizes to a [[cyclopropanone]] intermediate which is then attacked by the hydroxide [[nucleophile]].

[[Image:Favorskii_Rearrangement_Mechanism.png|center|630px|Favorskii rearrangement mechanism]]

Usage of [[alkoxide]] anions such as sodium methoxide, instead of sodium hydroxide, yields the ring-contracted [[ester]] product.

The '''Hofmann rearrangement''' is the [[organic chemistry|organic]] reaction of a primary [[amide]] to a primary [[amine]] with one fewer [[carbon]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, A. W. v. ''[[Chemische Berichte|Ber.]]'' '''1881''', ''14'', 2725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, E. S.; Lane, J. F. ''Org. React.'' '''1949''', ''3'', 267-306. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shioiri, T. ''Comp. Org. Syn.'' '''1991''', ''6'', 800-806. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Hofmann Rearrangement Scheme.png|400px|The Hofmann rearrangment]]

The reaction is named after its discoverer: [[August  Wilhelm von Hofmann]].   This reaction is also sometimes called the '''Hofmann degradation''',  and should not be confused with the [[Hofmann  elimination]].

==Mechanism==
The reaction of [[bromine]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] forms [[sodium hypobromite]] ''[[in situ]]'', which transforms the primary amide into an intermediate [[isocyanate]].  The intermediate isocyanate is hydrolyzed to a primary amine giving off [[carbon dioxide]].

:[[Image:Hoffmann_rearrangement_mechanism.svg|400px]]

==Variations==
Several reagents can substitute for bromine. [[N-Bromosuccinimide]] and [[1,8-Diazabicycloundec-7-ene|1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)]] can effect a Hofmann rearrangement.  In the following example, the intermediate isocyanate is trapped by [[methanol]] forming a [[carbamate]].&lt;ref&gt;Keillor, J. W.; Huang, X. - ''Organic Syntheses'' (2004, 549pp)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:[[Image:Hoffmann_Rearrangement_NBS.png|400px|The Hofmann rearrangement using NBS]]

In a similar fashion the intermediate isocyanate can be trapped by [[tert-butanol]] yielding the [[Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate|t-butoxycarbonyl]] (Boc)-protected amine.

A mild alternative to bromine is also [[(bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;Almond, M. R.; Stimmel, J. B.; Thompson, E. A.; Loudon, G.M. - ''Organic Syntheses'' (1993, 132pp)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lossen rearrangement''' is the conversion of a [[hydroxamic acid]] ('''1''') to an [[isocyanate]] ('''3''') via the formation of an O-acyl, sulfonyl, or phosphoryl intermediate hydroxamic acid O-derivative ('''2''') and then conversion to its conjugate base.  Here, [[4-Toluenesulfonyl chloride]] is used to form a sulfonyl O-derivative of hydroxamic acid.  &lt;ref&gt;Lossen, W. ''Ann.'' '''1872''', ''161'', 347.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lossen, W. ''Ann.'' '''1874''', ''175'', 271 &amp; 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lossen Rearrangement Scheme.png|500px|center|The Lossen rearrangement]]

The isocyanate can be used further to generate ureas in the presence of amines ('''4''') or generate amines in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ('''5''').

[[Image:IsocyanateGOES.png|300px|center|]]

===Reaction Mechanism===
The mechanism below begins with an O-acylated hydroxamic acid derivative that is treated with base to form an isocyanate that generates an [[amine]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The hydroxamic acid acid derivative is first converted to its conjugate base by abstraction of a hydrogen by a base.  Spontaneous rearrangement kicks off a carboxylate anion to produce the isocyanate intermediate.  The isocyanate in the presence H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O hydrolyzes and then [[decarboxylation]] via abastraction of a hydrogen by a base generates an amine and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

The '''Mannich reaction''' is an [[organic reaction]] which consists of an '''amino alkylation''' of an acidic proton placed next to a [[carbonyl]] [[functional group]] with [[formaldehyde]] and [[ammonia]] or any primary or secondary [[amine]]. The final product is a β-amino-carbonyl compound also known as a [[Mannich base]].&lt;ref&gt;Original translated from German Wiki&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions between [[aldimine]]s and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. 
The reaction is named after [[Chemist]] [[Carl Mannich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ardp.19122500151]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Mannich.png|center|500px|Scheme 1. Ammonia or an amine reacts with formaldehyde and an alpha acidic proton to a beta amino carbonyl compound]]

The Mannich reaction is an example of [[nucleophilic addition]] of an amine to a [[carbonyl]] group followed by dehydration to the [[Schiff base]]. The Schiff base is an [[electrophile]] which reacts in in the second step in a [[nucleophilic addition]] with a compound containing an acidic proton. The Mannich reaction is also considered a [[condensation reaction]]. 

In the Mannich reaction, [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s are employed for the activation of [[formaldehyde]]. Tertiary amines lack an N-H proton to form the intermediate [[imine]]. α-CH-acidic compounds ([[nucleophile]]s) include [[carbonyl]] compounds, [[nitrile]]s, [[acetylene]]s, aliphatic [[nitro]] compounds, α-alkyl-[[pyridine]]s or [[imine]]s. It is also possible to use activated [[phenyl]] groups and electron-rich heterocycles such as [[furan]], [[pyrrole]], and [[thiophene]].

==Reaction mechanism==
The mechanism of the Mannich reaction starts with the formation of an [[iminium]] ion from the amine and the formaldehyde.

[[image:Mannichreactionmech1.svg|center|567px]]


Because the reaction takes place under acidic conditions, the compound with the carbonyl functional group (in this case a [[ketone]]) can [[Keto-enol tautomerism|tautomerize]] to the enol form, after which it can attack the iminium ion.

[[image:Mannichreactionmech2.svg|center|436px]]



[[image:Mannichreactionmech3.svg|center|650px]]

==Asymmetric Mannich reactions==
Progress has been made towards [[chiral synthesis|asymmetric]] Mannich reactions. When properly functionalized the newly formed ethylene bridge in the Mannich adduct has two [[prochiral]] centers giving rise to two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. The first asymmetric Mannich reaction with an unmodified aldehyde was carried with [[proline|(S)-proline]] as a naturally occurring [[optical isomerism|chiral]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja017833p]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Asymmetric mannich overview.png|center|500px|Scheme 4. Asymmetric Mannich reactions ref. Cordova (2002)]]

The reaction''' taking''' place is between a simple aldehyde such as [[propionaldehyde]] and an [[imine]] derived from [[glyoxylic acid|ethyl glyoxylate]] and [[aniline|p-methoxyaniline]] (PMP = paramethoxphenyl) catalyzed by (S)-proline in [[dioxane]] at [[room temperature]]. The reaction product is [[Diastereoselectivity|diastereoselective]] with a preference for the syn-Mannich reaction 3:1 when the alkyl substituent on the aldehyde is a [[methyl]] group or 19:1 when the alkyl group the much larger [[pentyl]] group. Of the two possible syn adducts (S,S) or (R,R) the reaction is also [[enantioselective]] with a preference for the (S,S) adduct with [[enantiomeric excess]] larger than 99%. This stereoselectivity is explained in the scheme below.  

[[Image:SynMannichAdduct.png|center|500px|Scheme 5. Asymmetric syn-Mannich reactions ref. Cordova (2002)]]

Proline enters a [[catalytic cycle]] by reacting with the aldehyde to form an [[enamine]]. The two reactants (imine and enamine) line up for the Mannich reaction with [[Si face|Si facial]] attack of the imine by the Si-face of the enamine-aldehyde. Relief of [[steric strain]] dictates that the alkyl residue R of the enamine and the imine group are [[antiperiplanar]] on approach which locks in the syn mode of addition. The enantioselectivity is further controlled by [[hydrogen bonding]] between the proline [[carboxylic acid]] group and the imine. The [[transition state]] for the addition is a nine-membered ring with [[chair conformation]] with partial single bonds and double bonds. The proline group is converted back to the aldehyde and a single S,S isomer is formed.

By modification of the proline catalyst to it is also possible to obtain anti-Mannich adducts.&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja056984f]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anti Mannich reaction.png|center|500px|Scheme 6. Asymmetric syn-Mannich reactions ref. Mitsumori (2006)]]

An additional methyl group attached to proline forces a specific enamine approach and the transition state now is a 10-membered ring with addition in anti-mode. The diastereoselectivity is at least anti:syn 95:5 regardless of alkyl group size and the S,R [[enantiomer]] is preferred with at least 97% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]].

==Applications==
The Mannich-Reaction is employed in the [[organic synthesis]] of natural compounds such as [[peptide]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, and [[alkaloids]] (e.g. [[tropinone]]). Other applications are in agro chemicals such as plant growth regulators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = da Rosa F. A. F., Rebelo R. A., Nascimento II M. G. | title = Synthesis of new indolecarboxylic acids related to the plant hormone indoleacetic acid| journal = Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society| year = 2003| volume = 14| issue = | pages = 11| url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-50532003000100003}}&lt;/ref&gt; paint- and [[polymer chemistry]], [[catalyst]]s and crosslinking.

The Mannich reaction is also used in the synthesis of medicinal compounds e.g. [[rolitetracycline]] (Mannich base of [[tetracycline]]), [[fluoxetine]] (antidepressant), [[tramadol]], and [[tolmetin]] (anti-inflammatory drug).

The '''Michael reaction''' or '''Michael addition''' is the [[nucleophilic addition]] of a [[carbanion]] or another [[nucleophile]] &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.03.001]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-dept/mapmuri/pdf/Mather%20reprint%206_06.pdf Mather 2006 reprint ]&lt;/ref&gt; to an [[Α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound|alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound]].  It belongs to the larger class of [[conjugate addition]]s.  This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C-C bonds.  Many asymmetric variants exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chapter 18: Enols and Enolates &amp;mdash; The Michael Addition reaction | author = Ian Hunt | publisher = University of Calgary | url = http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Ch18/ch18-4-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayden et al., Organic Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Michael Reaction general mechanism.png|400px|Michael Reaction general mechanism]]

In this scheme the R and R' [[substituent]]s on the [[nucleophile]] (a '''Michael donor''') are [[electron-withdrawing group]]s such as [[acyl]] and [[cyano]] making the methylene hydrogen [[carbon acid|acidic]] forming the carbanion on reaction with [[base (chemistry)|base]] '''B:'''. The substituent on the activated [[alkene]] also called a '''Michael acceptor''' is usually a [[ketone]] making it an [[enone]] but it can also be a [[nitro]] group.

[[Deprotonation]] of '''1''' by base leads to [[carbanion]] '''2''' stabilized by its electron-withdrawing groups.  Structures 2a to 2c are three [[resonance structure]]s that can be drawn for this species, two of which have [[enolate]] ions. This nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic alkene '''3''' to form '''4''' in a [[conjugate addition reaction]]. Proton abstraction from protonated base (or solvent) by the enolate '''4''' to '''5''' is the final step. 

The course of the reaction is dominated by orbital, rather than electrostatic, considerations.  The [[HOMO]] of stabilized [[enolate]]s has a large coefficient on the central carbon atom while the [[LUMO]] of many alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds has a large coefficient on the beta carbon.  Thus, both reactants can be considered [[HSAB theory|soft]].  These polarized [[frontier orbital]]s are of similar energy, and react efficiently to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Like the [[aldol addition]], the Michael reaction may proceed via an [[enol]], [[silyl enol ether]] in the Mukaiyama-Michael addition, or more usually, enolate nucleophile.  In the latter case, the stabilized carbonyl compound is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] with a strong base (hard enolization) or with a [[Lewis acid]] and a weak base (soft enolization).  The resulting enolate attacks the activated [[olefin]] with 1,4-[[regioselectivity]], forming a carbon-carbon bond.  This also transfers the enolate to the [[electrophile]].  Since the electrophile is much less acidic than the nucleophile, rapid proton transfer usually transfers the enolate back to the nucleophile if the product is enolizable; however, one may take advantage of the new locus of nucleophilicity if a suitable electrophile is pendant.  Depending on the relative acidities of the nucleophile and product, the reaction may be [[catalysis|catalytic]] in base.  In most cases, the reaction is [[irreversible reaction|irreversible]] at low temperature, due to [[Principle of least motion|least-motion argument]]s.

==Asymmetric Michael reaction==
Recent research has focused on expanding the scope of [[asymmetric reaction|asymmetric]] Michael additions.  The most common methods involve [[chiral phase transfer catalysis]], involving [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s derived from the [[Cinchona]] [[alkaloid]]s, and [[organocatalysis]], which uses [[enamine]] or [[iminium]] activation with chiral secondary amines, usually derived from [[proline]].

In the reaction between [[cyclohexanone]] and [[nitrostyrene]] sketched below, the base proline is derivatized and works in conjunction with a protic acid such as [[P-Toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Simple Diamine- and Triamine-Protonic Acid Catalysts for the Enantioselective Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroalkenes | author =  Sunil V.

:[[Image:Michael reaction asymmetric.png|400px|Michael reaction asymmetric]]

[[Syn addition]] is favored with 99% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]]. In the [[transition state]] believed to be responsible for this selectivity, the [[enamine]] (formed between the proline nitrogen and the cycloketone) and nitrostyrene are co-facial with the [[nitro]] group [[hydrogen bond]]ed to the protonated amine in the proline side group.  

:[[Image:AsymmetricMichaelTransitionState.png|200px|Asymmetric Michael Transition State]]

A well-known Michael reaction is the synthesis of [[warfarin]] from [[4-hydroxycoumarin]] and [[benzylideneacetone]] first reported by Link in 1944 &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja01234a019]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

:[[File:Warfarin synthesis.svg|Warfarin synthesis]]

Several asymmetric versions of this reaction exist using chiral catalysts &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/anie.200352136]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol062000v]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol062718a]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200900664]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200900831]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ed800040m]]&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Mukaiyama-Michael Addition==
In the '''Mukaiyama-Michael Addition''' the nucleophile is an [[silyl ether]] and the catalyst usually [[titanium tetrachloride]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mukaiyama, T. | title = Titanium Tetrachloride in Organic Synthesis [New synthetic methods (21)] | format =  | journal = [[Angew.

[[Image:Mukaiyama-MichaelAddition.png|center|400px|Mukaiyama-Michael addition]]

==History==
The research done by Arthur Michael in 1887 was prompted by an 1884 publication by Conrad &amp; Kuthzeit on the reaction of diethyl ''2,3-dibromopropionate'' with ''diethyl sodiomalonate'' forming a [[cyclopropane]] derivative &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/cber.188401701314]]&lt;/ref&gt; (now recognized as involving two successive substitution reactions). 

:[[File:Michael reaction Conrad Guthzeit comparison.svg]]

Michael was able to obtain the same product by replacing the propionate by ''2-bromacrylic acid ethylester'' and realized that this reaction could only work by assuming an addition reaction to the double bond of the acrylic acid. He then confirmed this assumption by reacting [[diethyl malonate]] and the ethyl ester of [[cinnamic acid]] forming the very first Michael adduct &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200901130]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

:[[File:Original Michael reaction.svg|The Original 1887 Michael reaction]]

In the same year [[Rainer Ludwig Claisen]] claimed priority for the invention &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/prac.18870350144]]&lt;/ref&gt;. He and T. Komnenos had observed addition products to double bonds as side-products earlier in 1883 while investigating condensation reactions of malonic acid with aldehydes &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/jlac.18832180204]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to biographer Takashi Tokoroyama this claim is without merit.

The '''pinacol rearrangement''' or '''pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement''' is a method for converting a [[diol|1,2-diol]] to a [[carbonyl]] compound in [[organic chemistry]]. This rearrangement takes place under acidic conditions. The name of the reaction comes from the rearrangement of [[pinacol]] to [[pinacolone]].
:[[Image:800px-Pinacol rearragement.png|500px|Pinacol rearrangement]]


This reaction was first described by [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=Fittig1860&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber einige Derivate des Acetons
 | author =  [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]]  
 | journal =  [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]
 | volume = 114 
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 54–63
 | year = 1860 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18601140107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An overview of mechanism==
In the course of this [[organic reaction]], protonation of one of the -OH groups occurs and a [[carbocation]] is formed. If both the -OH groups are not alike, then the one which yields a more stable carbocation participates in the reaction. Subsequently, an [[alkyl]] group from the adjacent carbon migrates to the carbocation center. The driving force for this rearrangement step is believed to be the relative stability of the resultant oxonium ion, which has complete octet configuration at all centers (as opposed to the preceding carbocation). The migration of alkyl groups 
in this reaction occurs in accordance with their usual [[migratory aptitude]], i.e. hydride &gt; Ph- &gt; tertiary &gt; secondary &gt; methyl .

==[[Stereochemistry]] of the rearrangement==
In cyclic systems, the reaction presents more features of interest. In these reactions, the [[stereochemistry]] of the diol plays a crucial role in deciding the major product. An alkyl group which is situated trans- to the leaving -OH group alone may migrate. If otherwise, ring expansion occurs, i.e. the ring carbon itself migrates to the carbocation centre. This reveals another interesting feature of the reaction, viz. that it is largely concerted. There appears to be a connection between the migration origin and migration terminus throughout the reaction.

Moreover, if the migrating alkyl group has a chiral center as its key atom, the configuration at this center is ''retained'' even after migration takes place.

==History==
Although Fittig first published about the pinacol rearrangement, not he but [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] did correctly identify the reaction products involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  What Is a Discovery? Carbon Skeletal Rearrangements as Counter-Examples to the Rule of Minimal Structural Change
 | author =  Jerome A. Berson  
 | journal =  [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]
 | volume = 41
 | issue = 24
 | pages = 4655–4660
 | year = 2002 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200290007   }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 1859 publication [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] described the reaction of [[acetone]] with [[potassium]] metal..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber einige Metamorphosen des Acetons der Essigsäure 
 | author =  W. R. Fittig 
 | journal =  [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] 
 | volume = 110
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 23–45
 | year = 1859 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18591100104}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fittig wrongly assumed a [[molecular formula]] of (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for acetone, the result of a long standing atomic weight debate finally settled at the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] in 1860. He also wrongly believed acetone to be an alcohol which he hoped to prove by forming a metal alkoxide salt. The reaction product he obtained instead he called '''paraceton''' which he believed to be a acetone [[dimer]]. In his second publication in 1860 he reacted paraceton with [[sulfuric acid]] (the actual pinacol rearrangement).  

:[[Image:Acetone2pinacolone.svg|Pinacol rearrangement]]

Again Fittig was unable to assign a molecular structure to the reaction product which he assumed to be another isomer or a polymer. Contemporary chemists who had already adapted to the new atomic weight reality did not fare better. One of them, [[Charles Friedel]], believed the reaction product to be the [[epoxide]] tetramethylethylene oxide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Recherches sur les acétones et sur les aldéhydes
 | author =  [[Charles Friedel]]
 | journal =  [[Annales de chimie et de physique]] Ser. 4
 | volume = 16
 | issue =  
 | pages = 310
 | year = 1869
 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34826f/f309.table 
 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in analogy with reactions of [[ethylene glycol]]. Finally Butlerov in 1873 came up with the correct structures after he independently synthesised the compound trimethylacetic acid which Friedel had obtained earlier by oxidizing with a [[dichromate]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber Trimethylessigsäure  
 | author =  [[Aleksandr Butlerov]]
 | journal =  [[Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]
 | volume = 170
 | issue = 1-2 
 | pages = 151–162 
 | year = 1873
 | url = 
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18731700114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the problems during the determination of the structure are due to the fact that carbon skeletal rearrangements were unknown at that time and therefore the new concept had to be found. Butlerov theory allowed the structure of carbon atoms in the molecule to rearrange and with this concept a structure for pinacolone could be found.

The '''Reformatsky reaction''' (sometimes spelled '''Reformatskii reaction''') is an [[organic reaction]] which [[condensation reaction|condenses]] [[aldehyde]]s (or [[ketone]]s), '''1''', with α-halo [[ester]]s, '''2''', using a metallic [[zinc]] catalyst to form β-hydroxy-esters, '''3'''.{{Ref|Reformatsky}}{{Ref|Reformatsky2}} It was discovered by [[Sergey Reformatsky|Sergey Nikolaevich Reformatsky]].

[[Image:Reformatsky Reaction Scheme.png|center|500px|The Reformatskii reaction]]

The [[organozinc]] reagent, also called a 'Reformatskii enolate', is prepared by treating an alpha-halo ester with zinc dust. Reformatskii enolates are less reactive than lithium enolates or Grignard reagents and hence nucleophilic addition to the ester group does not occur. 

Some reviews have been published.{{Ref|Shriner}}{{Ref|Rathke}}

==Reaction mechanism==

Chloroform ('''1''') reacts with strong base to form the chloroform carbanion ('''2'''), which will quickly alpha-eliminate to give dichlorocarbene ('''3''').  Dichlorocarbene will react in the ortho- and para- position of the phenate ('''5''') to give the dichloromethyl substituted phenol ('''7''').  After basic hydrolysis, the desired product ('''9''') is formed.

The '''Robinson annulation''' is an [[organic reaction]] used to create a six-member ring [[Carbonyl#.CE.B1.2C.CE.B2-Unsaturated_carbonyl_compounds|α,β-unsaturated cyclic ketone]], using a [[ketone]] (or [[aldehyde]]) and [[methyl vinyl ketone]].&lt;ref&gt;Rapson, W.

German Patent DE 2102623, July 29, '''1971'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic intermediates of natural product chemistry'' Zoltan G. Hajos, David R. Parrish [[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''1974'''; 39(12); 1615-1621. [[doi:10.1021/jo00925a003]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reaction mechanism==
Methyl vinyl ketone (or variants thereof) are essential for the [[annulation]] as they are simultaneously a [[Michael acceptor]] and able to take part in an [[aldol condensation]].  The first step in the Robinson annulation (also spelt annelation) is a [[Michael reaction|Michael addition]] followed by an [[aldol reaction]] as the [[annulation]] step in the process. The reaction then proceeds as an aldol condensation to make the desired [[cyclohexenone]] ring.

==Variations==
===Asymmetric Robinson annulation===
The [[organocatalyst]] [[Proline]] has been used to resolve the [[enantiomer]]ic [[isomer]]s of Robinson [[annulation]]s in [[asymmetric synthesis]]. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 7, p.368 (1990); Vol. 63, p.37 (1985). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0368 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;. A proline derivative was employed in an asymmetric annulation of a [[geranial]] &lt;ref&gt;''Total Synthesis and Revised Structure of Biyouyanagin'' A [[K. C. Nicolaou]], David Sarlah, and David M. Shaw [[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]] '''2007''', 46, 4708 –4711 [[doi:10.1002/anie.200701552]]&lt;/ref&gt;: 

[[Image:RobinsonAnnulationAsymmetric.png|center|400px|Asymmetric Robinsion annulation]]

===Wichterle reaction===
The '''Wichterle reaction''' is a variant of the Robinson annulation that replaces methyl vinyl ketone with [[1,3-dichloro-cis-2-butene]]. &lt;ref&gt;Wichterle, O. ''et al.'' ''Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun.'' '''1948''', ''13'', 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, M.; Matsumoto, T. ''Chem. Lett.'' '''1973''', 957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 5, p.869 (1973); Vol. 45, p.80 (1965). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv5p0869 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wichterle Reaction Scheme.png|center|550px|The Wichterle reaction]]

===Hauser annulation===
The reaction sequence in the related Hauser annulation is [[michael addition]] - [[Dieckman condensation]] - [[elimination]] &lt;ref&gt;''Recent Advances in the Hauser Annulation '' Mal, D.; Pahari, P. [[Chem. Rev.]]; (Review); '''2007'''; 107(5); 1892-1918.  [[doi:10.1021/cr068398q]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Hauser donor is an aromatic methylene [[sulfoxide]] or [[sulfone]] with a [[carboxylic ester]] group in the [[Arene substitution patterns|ortho position]]. The Hauser acceptor is also a Michael acceptor.  In the original Hauser publication  ''ethyl 2-carboxybenzyl phenyl sulfoxide'' reacts with [[3-pentene-2-one]] with [[LDA]] as a base in THF at -78°C &lt;ref&gt;''New synthetic methods for the regioselective annelation of aromatic rings: 1-hydroxy-2,3-disubstituted naphthalenes and 1,4-dihydroxy-2,3-disubstituted naphthalenes''Frank M. Hauser and Richard P.Rhee[[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''197'''8; 43(1) pp 178 - 180; [[doi:10.1021/jo00395a048]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:HauserAnnulation.png|400px|center|The Hauser annulation]]

The original reaction product still contains the sulfoxide group but it is lost on heating in an elimination reaction. The ultimate reaction product is a [[naphthalene]] derivative.  The dual purpose of the sulfoxide group is as stabilizing group for the [[carbanion]] in the first reaction step and as [[leaving group]] in the second.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A useful methodology to employ in assessing the conditions of poverty in Austria and the Czech Republic is not simply discussing the conditions of poverty in the country themselves, but to put the conditions in the context of global and European poverty. Although the conditions of poverty in Austria and the Czech Republic will be discussed a context for how these countries are performing in relation to European and global poverty will be provided. In short, this approach will allow for a broader understanding of the issue in regard to the conditions of global, European and finally a specific analysis of poverty in Austria and Czech Republic.  


==A Glimpse at Global Poverty==

'''A Glimpse at Global Poverty'''

Poverty throughout the world is an enormous issue the international community seeks to alleviate. Most recently the international community, in its Millennium Development Goals, adopted by 189 world leaders at a 2000 UN summit, has called attention to this problem by charting a course to reduce by 50% the number of people living on less than $1 a day by the year 2015. This goal will certainly be challenging as the population continues to grow and resources become scarce. In addition to this challenge the recent global economic crisis has also curtailed efforts and gains in reducing poverty. According to Global Issues.org, access to water is becoming a major issue, as “1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to water and 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Secondly, as wars between nations and internal conflicts within nations continue to rage the plight of refugees, internally displaced people and the process of migration become more problematice. As these people move about in an effort to escape the violence they often leave with nothing and thus struggle to survive while living in poverty. Using Afghanistan  as example – a country who has been inflicted with 30 years of civil upheaval and radical devolution of political, economic, and military authority - Refugees International has the following to say about Afghanistan’s situation:
Millions of Afghans need help rebuilding their lives and country. While all Afghans suffer the government’s poor capacity and lack of services, Afghan returnees and internally displaced have been neglected and are particularly vulnerable.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Today more that three million registered refugees remain in exile- 2.1 million in Pakistan and 0.9 million in Iran- and hundreds of thousands more are living abroad to escape economic hardship or targeted violence. {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
In addition to these realities, the World Bank has reported that: 

“the global economic crisis left an additional 50 million people in extreme poverty in 2009 and will leave some 64 million impoverished by the end of 2010, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern and southeastern Asia.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Hunger may also have spiked in 2009 – with over 1 billion people undernourished – as a consequence of the global food and financial crises.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Moreover, the effects of the crises are likely to persist with poverty rates slightly higher than they would have been had the world economy grown steadily at its pre-crisis pace, it said.” {{ref|Chapayev1919}}

Interestingly it is China alone that overwhelmingly drives the numbers in regard to how the world is progressing in the field of reducing poverty. For example, the World Bank has noted that “between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate has fallen by about 25%, however while this sounds encouraging, it masks regional variations, and perhaps most glaringly the impact of China.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} The World Bank continues, “China’s poverty rate fell from 85% to 15.9%, or by over 600 million people, China accounts for nearly all the world’s reduction in poverty and excluding China from the data would yield a reduction in poverty by only 10%.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
==European Poverty==
'''European Poverty'''

In an effort to tackle poverty in Europe the European Union has launched a campaign called ‘2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion’ to help the estimated 84 million Europeans currently considered at risk of poverty. “The key objectives are to raise public awareness about these issues and renew the political commitment of the EU and its Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  A 2008 report on poverty levels in Europe was concluded that the 16% of Europeans considered at risk of poverty fell within a range of 10% to 23% in terms of how much each countries popultaion was at risk throughout the 27 member states of the EU. The EU rate, in comparison to the Czech Republic found that only 10% of the Czech population was considered at risk of poverty- the lowest in the EU. The EU rate, in comparison to Austria found that only 12% of Austrians are considered at risk of poverty. In regard to social exclusion the EU is encourage member states to coordinate their approaches in fighting poverty and social exclusion by placing it at the top of their political agenda.  The EU estimates that social transfers- the public policy measures which makes it possible for people to achieve up-ward mobility and thus decreas overall social exclusion- reduced the risk of poverty by 38% on average in the EU, but this impact varies from less tham 10% to nearly 60% across Europe.  For example, one aspect helping to drive down poverty in CZ is through the public policy agenda centered on social transfers. According to a study conducted by the EU, social transfers in the Czech Republic have helped reduce poverty by 50%. 
In general view of Europe, “low levels of poverty characterize the Scandinavian countries, the so-called Corporatist countries (Austria, Germany) and the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia among the ex-Socialist countries.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  In contrast the risk of poverty tends to be relatively high in the Mediterranean and the Baltic States. Countries with the highest poor population include France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. 
Looking at the conditions of poverty in the countries of Austria and Czech Republic one can clearly see that these nations are doing exceptionally well when compared to others, especially the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. So what has set Austria and the Czech Republic apart from other nations in increasing individual wealthy and thus less of their respective populations resding in poverty? In answering this question I have found that the common link existing between Austria and the Czech Republic are the social programs and support available to their respective citizens, which have made those nations successful in reversign the tide of poverty while increasing the purchasing power of their citizens. 
==Austrian Poverty==
'''Austrian Poverty'''

Taking a closer look at indicators of Austria’s level of poverty a study was conducted by the United Nations. Below are the UN’s findings as compared to the United States:

Source: Human Development Report 2000; Trends in human development and per capita income

Although this data was taken in 2000 it not only gives a solid indication of Austria’s economic success when compared to the United States but more importantly it speaks to the prowess of Austria’s ability to sustain and improve its human development. From 1975-1998 Austria’s human development and per capita income steadily increased this is significant because human development encompasses life expectancy, literacy, average number of years of schooling, and income to assess a country’s performance in providing for its people’s welfare and security {{ref|Chapayev1919}}. In addition to this study the UN also provides reasoning to explain how Austria is able to achieve such favorable human development and per capita income rates thus reducing poverty. Specifically the report states that, “living standards are very high, and due to socialist policies of the federal government, the incidence of poverty is minimal.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
Another interesting aspect highlighting why Austria’s method of dealing with the issue of poverty and homelessness lies in their infrastructure to provide for their citizens who are in need of help. In another study conducted in 2005 by Helix, a clinical research and consulting firm located in Salzburg, Austria concluded the following:
In some counties like Vienna, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg there are chain like structures of services in force. Centers for counseling and prevention of eviction –emergency shelters and day care institutions – supported housing and provisions for re-housing. In the counties Styria, Upper Austria and Nether Austria emergency services still have an overweight and provisions headed on resettlement are less elaborated. In the counties Carinthia and Burgenland there are only very few services for homeless persons provided – especially emergency services like shelters and asylums. In some counties (like Vienna, Tyrol, Styria) some old fashioned asylums are still working and can be characterized by low standards and very low provisions of individual support. Beside the professional emergency services in most counties of Austria cheap boarding houses and private hostels are accessible also for homeless persons and used for temporary shelter.

Austria uniquely offers an extensive support system throughout its country to help those in poverty and at risk of going into poverty. One characteristic about the country’s apparuts to deal with poverty is the mix of institutions it offers in order to meet the needs of its citizenary. From the chain-like structures, emergency shelters, day care, aylums, boarding houses and private hostels Austria has a plethora of institutions to support its citizenary. 
==Czech Republic Poverty==
'''Czech Republic Poverty'''

One unique aspect about the Czech Republic society is that the citizenry enjoy vast benefits from their government in the role of state aid for social support. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA) is charged with administering the aid. MoLSA was established in 1990 and is responsible for all social and labour aspects in the Czech Republic such as social services, social benefits, and social security, equal opportunity for all citizens as well as migration and integration of foreigners.  Under a national law passed on 1 January 2008, titled State Social Support, the “citizens have a right to benefits if they and the household members assessed with them are permanent residents in the Czech Republic or if they are EU citizens- subject of directly applicable legislation of the European Communities.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  The benefits, as administered by the MoLSA, are outlined below:

''Child Allowance-'' 

Child allowance is a basic long-term benefit provided to families with dependent children. A dependent child up to the age of 26 years, living in a family with an income of less than 2.4 times the family’s living minimum is entitled to this allowance. {{ref|Chapayev1919}}

{| border=1
  |+ 
|-
  ! '''Age of the dependent child'''

  | Up to 6 years of age

|-
  | From 6 to 15 years
  | 610
  | 

|-
  | From 15 to 26 years
  | 700
  | 
|}


''Social Allowance-'' 

The aim of this benefit is to be help families with low incomes to cover the costs of their children’s needs. Parents who care for at least one dependent child are entitled to this allowance provided the family income is the previous calendar quarter does not exceed 2.0 times the family’s living minimum. The higher the family income, the lower the monthly allowance. Te social allowance may be raised in cases where the child has a long-term severe disability, a long term disability or a long-term illness. A higher level of social allowance is also paid to families in cases of multiple births- up to the age of three years and to family whose child is studying secondary school on a daily basis or attending university. {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Housing Allowance-'' 

Property owners or tenants registered as permanently resident in that property are entitled to a housing allowance of 30% (in Prague 35%) of family income is sufficient to cover housing costs and at the same time this 30% (in Prague 35%) of family income is lower than the relevant prescriptive costs set by law. The level of housing allowance is set as the difference between prescriptive housing costs and the relevant family income multiplied by a coefficient of 0.03 (in Prague 0.35). {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Parental Allowance-''
 
A parent who personally and duly cares for a child who is the youngest in the family is entitled to parental allowance. Parental allowance is provided at four rates that are set at fixed monthly amounts according to duration of drawing- increased rate (11, 400CZK), basic rate (7,600CZK) and lower rate (3,000 CZK). A parent may elect to draw parental allowance for a period of up to two, three or four years of the child.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Foster Child Allowance-''

Dependent children placed in foster care are entitled to an allowance. The child continues to be entitled to this allowance even after reaching adulthood, up to a maximum of 26 years of age, provided that they remain a dependent child and live under the same roof as the former foster parent(s).{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  

''Foster Parent Allowance-''

A foster parent who takes a child into foster care is entitled to this allowance. The monthly amount of the foster parent allowance equals the individual living minimum for each child placed in foster care. The foster allowance for one child is 3,126CZK a month.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
 
''Birth Grant-''

This a one-time benefit for women who have given birth to a child. If a woman who gives birth to a child and dies and the birth grant has not been disbursed, the child’s father is entitled to this grant. Persons who have taken a child up to the age of one year old into permanent care replacing parental care are also entitled to the birth grant. The birth grant amounts to 13,000 CZK for each child born.{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  

''Funeral Grant-''

The funeral grant is a one-time payment to a person who has arranged for the funeral of a dependent child, or to a person who was the parent of a dependent child, on condition that the deceased was a permanent resident of the Czech Republic on the date of death. The amount of the funeral grant is a fixed sum totaling 5,000 CZK.  
The amount of state support the Czech government provides to its citizens is significant and has a tremendously favorable impact on the conditions of poverty in their country as evidence by their lowest ranking of at-risk-poverty among all the EU member states.{{ref|Chapayev1919}}

The '''Schmidt reaction''' is an [[organic reaction]] involving alkyl migration over the [[carbon]]-[[nitrogen]] [[chemical bond]] in an [[azide]] with expulsion of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plagens, Andreas; Laue, Thomas M. |title=Named organic reactions | edition = 2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-470-01041-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key reagent introducing this azide group is [[hydrazoic acid]] and the reaction product depends on the type of reactant: [[carboxylic acid]]s form [[amine]]s through an [[isocyanate]] intermediate (1) and [[ketone]]s form [[amide]]s (2):

[[Image:Schmidt.png|800px]]

A [[catalyst]] is required which can be a [[protic acid]] usually [[sulfuric acid]] or a [[Lewis acid]]. The reaction was discovered in 1924 by [[Karl Friedrich Schmidt]] (1887–1971),&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/cber.19240570423]]&lt;/ref&gt; who successfully converted [[benzophenone]] and [[hydrazoic acid]] to [[benzanilide]]. It is a tool regularly used in [[organic chemistry]] for the synthesis of new organic compounds for example in that of the unusual  [[2-quinuclidone]].

==Reaction mechanism==
The carboxylic acid Schmidt reaction starts with [[acylium]] ion '''1''' obtained from [[protonation]] and loss of water. Reaction with [[hydrazoic acid]] forms the protonated azido ketone '''2''' which goes through a [[rearrangement reaction]] with the alkyl group R migrating over the C-N bond with expulsion of nitrogen. The protonated [[isocyanate]] is attacked by water forming [[carbamate]] '''4''' which after deprotonation loses [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[amine]].  

[[Image:Schmidtreactionmechanismamine.png|500px|center|Schmidt reaction mechanism amine formation]]

The reaction is related to the [[Curtius rearrangement]] except that in this reaction the azide is protonated and hence with different intermediates.

In the [[reaction mechanism]] for the [[ketone]] Schmidt reaction the carbonyl group is activated by protonation for [[nucleophilic addition]] by the azide forming intermediate '''3''' which loses water in a [[elimination reaction]] to temporary [[imine]] '''4''' over which one of the alkyl groups migrates from carbon to nitrogen with loss of nitrogen. A similar migration is found in the [[Beckmann rearrangement]]. Attack by water and proton loss converts '''5''' to '''7''' which is a [[tautomer]] of the final [[amide]]. 

[[Image:SchmidtreactionmechanismAmide.png|500px|center|Schmidt reaction mechanism amide formation]]

==Reactions involving alkyl azides==
The scope of this reaction has been extended to reactions of carbonyls with alkyl [[azides]] R-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This extension was first reported by J.H. Boyer in 1955 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Acid-catalyzed Reaction of Alkyl Azides upon Carbonyl Compounds | author = J. H. Boyer and J. Hamer | journal = [[J. Am. Chem.

The '''Shapiro reaction''' or '''tosylhydrazone decomposition''' is an [[organic reaction]] in which a [[ketone]] or [[aldehyde]] is converted to an [[alkene]] through an intermediate [[hydrazone]] in the presence of 2 equivalents of strong [[base (chemistry)|base]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Shapiro]] ; Lipton, M.F.; Kolonko, K.J.; Buswell, R.L.; Capuano, L.A. ''[[Tetrahedron Lett.]]'', '''1975''', 1811. [[doi:10.1016/S0040-4039(00)75263-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, R. H. ''[[Org. React.]]'', '''1976''', ''23'', 405. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adlington, R.M.; Barret, A.G.M. ''[[Acc. Chem. Res.]]'', '''1983''', ''16'', 55. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction was discovered by [[Robert H. Shapiro]] in 1975. The Shapiro reaction was used in the [[Nicolaou Taxol total synthesis]]. 
[[Image:Shapiro reaction.svg|center|500px|The Shapiro reaction]]

==Reaction mechanism==
In a prelude to the actual Shapiro reaction a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]] is reacted with [[p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'' Coll. Vol. 5, p.1055 ('''1973'''); Vol. 40, p.93 ('''1960''') ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv5p1055 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; to a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or tosyl hydrazone) which is an [[imine]] or [[hydrazone]]. Two equivalents of a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] such as [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] then abstract first the hydrazone [[proton (chemistry)|proton]] and then the less [[carbon acid|acidic]] α carbonyl proton leaving a [[carbanion]]. The carbanion proceeds in an [[elimination reaction]] creating the carbon to carbon [[double bond]] and converting the hydrazone group into a lithium [[Diazonium compound|diazonium]] group. This group expels [[nitrogen]] leaving a vinyllithium compound. 
[[Image:ShapiroreactionMechanism.svg|center|Shapiro reaction mechanism]]

==Scope==
Although many secondary reactions exist for this [[functional group]], in the Shapiro reaction in particular [[water]] is added resulting in hydrolysis to the [[alkene]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, R. H.; Duncan, J. H. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'' Coll. Vol. 6, p.172 ('''1988'''); Vol. 51, p.66 ('''1971'''). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0172 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Other reactions of vinyllithium compounds include alkylation reactions with for instance [[alkyl halide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'' Coll. Vol. 7, p.77 ('''1990'''); Vol. 61, p.141 ('''1983'''). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0077 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; In general the least substituted alkene is the preferred reaction product.  
[[Image:ShapiroReaction borneneSynthesis.svg|frame|center|Shapiro reactions starting from Camphor (1) through the intermediate hydrazone (2) to the vinyllithium (3). Addition of water (c) results in 2-bornene (4) and addition of an alkyl bromide (d) gives 5]]
The [[Bamford-Stevens reaction]] is also a tosylhydrazone decomposition but in this reaction a much weaker base can only abstract the hydrazone proton and not the α carbonyl proton and the [[reaction mechanism]] now involves a [[carbene]] or in a [[protic solvent]] a [[carbocation]].

([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0461 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;  The stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide is determined by the diastereomer of diethyl tartrate employed in the reaction.

[[Image:Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation Scheme.png|center|400px|The Sharpless epoxidation]]

The oxidizing agent is ''tert''-butyl hydroperoxide.  Enantioselectivity is achieved by a catalyst formed from titanium tetra(isopropoxide) and diethyl tartrate.  Only 5-10&amp;nbsp;mol% of the catalyst in the presence of 3Å molecular sieves (3Å MS) is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, Y.; Hanson, R. M.; Klunder, J. M.; Ko, S. Y.; Masamune, H.; Sharpless, K. B. ''J.

''Synthesis'' '''1986''', 89-116. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

Epoxides can be easily converted into dialcohols, aminoalcohols or ethers, so formation of chiral epoxides is a very important step in the synthesis of natural products.  K. Barry Sharpless shared the 2001 Nobel prize in Chemistry for his work on asymmetric oxidations.

The '''Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement''' is a [[rearrangement reaction]] of certain [[benzyl]] [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s &lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 4, p.585 (1963); Vol. 34, p.61 (1954) [http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV4P0585.pdf Link].&lt;/ref&gt;. The reagent is [[sodium amide]] or another alkali metal amide and the reaction product a N-dialkyl benzyl amine with a new [[alkyl]] group in the [[aromatic ortho position]]. 

:[[File:SommeletHauserReaction.svg|Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement]]

This reaction was named after M. Sommelet &lt;ref&gt;M. Sommelet, Compt. Rend. 205, 56 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles R. Hauser &lt;ref&gt;''Rearrangements of Benzyltrimethylammonium Ion and Related Quaternary Ammonium Ions by Sodium Amide Involving Migration into the Ring'' Simon W. Kantor, Charles R. Hauser [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]], '''1951''', 73 (9), pp 4122–4131 [[doi:10.1021/ja01153a022]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The benzylic methylene proton is acidic and deprotonation takes place to the [[ylide]]. The second step is a [[2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement]].

'''Stork enamine alkylation''', also known as the '''Stork-Enamine reaction''', involves the addition of an [[enamine]] to an [[enone|alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl acceptor]] in a process similar to the [[Michael reaction]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McMurry | first =John | authorlink = John E. McMurry | title =Organic Chemistry | format =Hardcover | edition =6th | date =2003-03-21 | publisher =Thomson-Brooks/Cole | location =Belmont, CA | isbn =0-534-38999-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The product is then [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] by an [[aqueous]] [[acid]] to produce a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound.

The process: 

# formation of an enamine from a [[ketone]]
# addition of the enamine to and alpha, beta-unsaturated [[aldehyde]] or ketone
# hydrolysis of the enamine back to a ketone

[[Image:Stork enamine reaction.png|center|400px|The Stork enamine reaction]]


When the electrophile is an [[acyl halide]], a 1,3-[[diketone]] is formed ('''Stork acylation'''). The reaction is named after its inventor: [[Gilbert Stork]].

==Variations==
In a special case of this reaction type it is also possible to alkylate [[ketone]]s or [[aldehyde]]s with [[alkyl halide]]s as less reactive [[electrophile]]s &lt;ref&gt;''A New Method for the Alkylation of Ketones and Aldehydes: the C-Alkylation of the Magnesium Salts of N-Substituted Imines'' [[Gilbert Stork]] and Susan R. Dowd [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1963'''; 85(14) pp 2178 - 2180; [[doi:10.1021/ja00897a040]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:Stork C alkylation.png|center|400px|Stork enamine reaction with alkyl halides]]

In this method a carbonyl compound is converted to an [[imine]] by [[alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution]] with a primary [[amine]]. The imine is then reacted with an [[Grignard reagent]] to the corresponding magnesium salt to an intermediate capable of [[nucleophilic displacement|displacing]] a halide. [[Hydrolysis]] once again yields the alkylated ketone.

The rearrangement was first discovered in [[bicyclic]] [[terpene]]s for example the conversion of [[isoborneol]] to [[camphene]]:

 

[[Image:Isoborneol2CampheneConversion.svg|Isoborneol Camphene Conversion]]


The story of the rearrangement reveals that many scientists were puzzled with this and related reactions and its close relationship to the discovery of carbocations as intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Birladeanu, L.  ''[[J. Chem. Ed.]]'' '''2000''', ''77'', 858-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

The related '''Nametkin rearrangement''' named after [[Sergey Namyotkin]] involves the rearrangement of methyl groups in certain terpenes. In some cases the reaction type is also called a '''retropinacol rearrangement''' (see [[Pinacol rearrangement]]).

The '''Wittig Reaction''' is a [[chemical reaction]] of an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with a triphenyl [[#Wittig reagents|phosphonium ylide]] (often called a '''Wittig reagent''') to give an [[alkene]] and [[triphenylphosphine oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Wittig reaction was discovered in 1954 by [[Georg Wittig]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1979.  It is widely used in [[organic synthesis]] for the preparation of alkenes.&lt;ref&gt;Maercker, A. ''Org. React.'' '''1965''', ''14'', 270-490. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Carruthers, ''Some Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1971, pp81-90. (ISBN 0-521-31117-9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. W. Hoffmann | title = Wittig and His Accomplishments: Still Relevant Beyond His 100th Birthday | year = 2001 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 1411–1416 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20010417)40:8&lt;1411::AID-ANIE1411&gt;3.0.CO;2-U}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the [[1,2-Wittig rearrangement|Wittig rearrangement]].

Wittig reactions are most commonly used to couple aldehydes and ketones to singly substituted phosphine [[ylide]]s.  With simple ylides this results in almost exclusively the [[Z-alkene]] product.  In order to obtain the E-alkene, the [[#The Schlosser modification|Schlosser modification]] of the Wittig reaction can be performed.

== Reaction mechanism ==
=== Classical mechanism ===
The steric bulk of the [[ylide]] '''1''' influences the stereochemical outcome of [[nucleophilic addition]] to give a predominance of the [[betaines|betaine]] '''3'''.  Carbon-carbon bond rotation gives the betaine '''4''', which then forms the oxaphosphetane '''5'''.  Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene '''7''' and [[triphenylphosphine oxide]] '''6'''.  With simple Wittig reagents, the first step occurs easily with both [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form '''5''') is the [[rate-determining step]].  However with [[#Stabilised Wittig reagents|stabilised ylides]] (where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; stabilises the negative charge) the first step is the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the [[Geometric isomerism|E-isomer]].  This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with [[Steric hindrance|sterically hindered ketones]]. 

[[File:Wittig Reaction Mechanism.png|center|500px|The mechanism of the Wittig reaction]]

=== Recent developments ===
Recent research has shown that the [[reaction mechanism]] presented above does not account for all experimental results.  Mechanistic studies have been done mostly on unstablilized ylides, because the intermediates can be followed by [[NMR spectroscopy]]. The existence and interconversion of the betaine ('''3a''' and '''3b''') is still under debate and a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E. Vedejs and C. F. Marth | title = Mechanism of Wittig reaction: evidence against betaine intermediates | year = 1990 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 112 | issue = 10 | pages = 3905–3909 | doi=10.1021/ja00166a026}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that phosphonium ylides '''1''' can react with carbonyl compounds '''2''' via a π²s/π²a [2+2] [[cycloaddition]] to directly form the oxaphosphatanes '''4a''' and '''4b'''. The [[stereochemistry]] of the product '''5''' is due to the addition of the ylide '''1''' to the carbonyl '''2''' and to the ability of the intermediates to [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce E.

There are distinct differences in the mechanisms of [[aliphatic]] and [[aromatic]] [[aldehyde]]s and of [[aromatic]] and [[aliphatic]] phosphonium ylides.  Vedejs ''et al.'' have provided evidence that the Wittig reaction of [[Branching (chemistry)|unbranched]] aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under [[kinetic reaction control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E.

J. ''Top. Stereochem.'' '''1994''', ''21'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittig reagents ==
=== Preparation of simple ylides ===
The Wittig reagent is usually prepared from a [[phosphonium salt]], which is in turn made by the reaction of [[triphenylphosphine]] with an [[alkyl halide]]. To form the Wittig reagent (ylide), the phosphonium salt is suspended in a solvent such as [[diethyl ether]] or [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]] and a strong base such as [[phenyllithium]] or [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] is added.    

Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R  X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  [[N-Butyllithium|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li]]  →  Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−R  +  LiX  +  [[Butane|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The simplest ylide used is methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and this is also the basis of an alternative synthesis of Wittig reagents.  Substituted ylides can be made by alkylation of Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a primary [[alkyl halide]] R−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−X, to produce a substituted phosphonium salt:

Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  [[Alkyl halide|R-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-X]]  →  Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;− CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R  X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

which can be [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]] with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li  to make Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R.

=== Stabilized Wittig reagents ===
These contain groups that can stabilise the negative charge from the [[carbanion]]-like carbon, for example Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−COOR, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−[[Phenyl|Ph]].  These are less reactive than simple ylides, and so they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating the use of the [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons]] reaction as an alternative.  They can be prepared from the phosphonium salts using weaker bases than butyllithium such as [[alkoxide]]s and (in some cases) [[sodium hydroxide]]. They usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.

=== Structure of the ylide ===
The Wittig reagent may be written in the '''phosphorane''' form (the more familiar representation) or the '''ylide''' form:

[[File:Wittig reagent structure.gif|300px]]

However the phosphorane resonance requires expansion of the [[Octet rule|octet]] on phosphorus. This [[hypervalency]] cannot (yet) be explained well in terms of standard bonding theory, and this resonance is rather less favoured than the more familiar p–p overlap seen in π-bonded compounds as [[alkene]]s or [[imine]]s.  This means that the ylide form is a significant contributor, and the carbon is quite [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]].

== Scope and limitations ==
The Wittig reaction has become a popular method for [[alkene]] synthesis precisely because of its wide applicability.  Unlike [[elimination reaction]]s (such as [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[alkyl halide]]s), which produce mixtures of alkene [[regioisomer]]s determined by [[Zaitsev's rule]], the Wittig reaction forms the double bond in one position with no ambiguity.  

A large variety of [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s are effective in the reaction, though [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives such as [[ester]]s fail to react usefully.  Thus mono-, di- and trisubstituted alkenes can all be prepared in good yield in most cases.  The [[carbonyl]] compound can tolerate several groups such as [[hydroxy|OH]], [[alkoxy|OR]], aromatic [[nitro]] and even ester groups.  There can be a problem with [[Steric hindrance|sterically hindered]] ketones, where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields, particularly with stabilised ylides, and in such cases the [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction|Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction]] (using phosphonate esters) is preferred. Another reported limitation is the often labile nature of [[aldehyde]]s which can oxidize, polymerize or decompose. In a so-called Tandem Oxidation-Wittig Process the aldehyde is formed [[in situ]] by oxidation of the corresponding [[alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Richard J. K. Taylor, Leonie Campbell, and Graeme D. McAllister | title = (±) trans-3,3'-(1,2-Cyclopropanediyl)bis-2-(E)-propenoic Acid, Diethyl Ester: Tandem Oxidation Procedure (TOP) using MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxidation-Stabilized Phosphorane Trapping | year = 2008 | volume = 85 | pages = 15-26 | url = http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/V85P0015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

As mentioned above, the Wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary [[alkyl halide]], because with most secondary halides the phosphonium salt is formed in poor yield.  This means that most tetrasubstituted alkenes are best made by other means.  However the Wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants. It may contain alkenes and [[aromatic ring]]s, and it is compatible with [[ether]]s and even [[ester]] groups.  Even C=O and [[nitrile]] groups can be present if [[conjugated system|conjugated]] with the ylide- these are the [[#Stabilised Wittig reagents|stabilised ylides]] mentioned above. Bis-ylides (containing two P=C bonds) have also been made and used successfully.

One limitation relates to the [[stereochemistry]] of the product.  With simple ylides, the product is usually mainly the [[Geometric isomerism|Z-isomer]], although a lesser amount of the E-isomer is often formed also- this is particularly true when ketones are used.  If the reaction is performed in [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]] in the presence of [[lithium iodide|LiI]] or [[sodium iodide|NaI]], the product is almost exclusively the Z-isomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. D. Bergelson and M. M. Shemyakin | title = Synthesis of Naturally Occurring Unsaturated Fatty Acids by Sterically Controlled Carbonyl Olefination | year = 1964 | journal = [[Angew. Chem.]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–260 | doi = 10.1002/anie.196402501}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the E-isomer is the desired product, the Schlosser modification may be used.  With stabilised ylides the product is mainly the E-isomer, and this same isomer is also usual with the HWE reaction.

== The Schlosser modification ==
[[File:Schlosser Wittig.gif|right|380px|The Schlosser variant of the Wittig reaction]]

The major limitation of the traditional Wittig reaction is that the reaction goes mainly via the [[erythro]] [[betaine]] intermediate, which leads to the [[Z-alkene]].  However [[Manfred Schlosser|Schlosser]] &amp; Christmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Schlosser and K. F. Christmann | title = Trans-Selective Olefin Syntheses | year = 1966 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 126 | doi = 10.1002/anie.196601261}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the erythro betaine can be converted to the [[threo]] betaine using [[phenyllithium]] at low temperature (forming a betaine) followed by [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]].  Upon workup this leads to the [[E-alkene]] product as shown.

[[Elias J. Corey|E. J. Corey]] and [[H. Yamamoto]] found that the utility can be extended to a [[stereoselective]] synthesis of [[allyl alcohol|allylic alcohols]], by reaction of the betaine ylid with a second aldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[E. J. Corey]] and H. Yamamoto | title = Modification of the Wittig reaction to permit the stereospecific synthesis of certain trisubstituted olefins. Stereospecific synthesis of α-santalol | year = 1970 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1021/ja00704a052}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

== Examples of use ==
[[File:Wittig CH2 examples.png|right|450px|Two examples of the Wittig reaction using methylenetriphenylphosphorane]]

Because of its reliability and wide applicability, the Wittig reaction has become a standard tool for synthetic organic chemists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = B. E. Maryanoff and A. B. Reitz | title = The Wittig olefination reaction and modifications involving phosphoryl-stabilized carbanions. Stereochemistry, mechanism, and selected synthetic aspects | year = 1989 | journal = [[Chem. Rev.]] | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 863–927 | doi = 10.1021/cr00094a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular use of the Wittig reaction is for the introduction of a [[methylene]] group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In the example shown, even a sterically hindered ketone such as [[camphor]] can be successfully converted to its methylene derivative by heating with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and [[potassium tert-butoxide]], which generate the Wittig reagent ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitjer, L.; Quabeck, U. ''Synthetic Communications'' '''1985''', ''15(10)'', 855-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the phosphorane is produced using [[sodium amide]] as a base, and this successfully converts the [[aldehyde]] shown into alkene '''I''' in 62% yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = F. A. Bottino, G. Di Pasquale, A. Pollicino, A. Recca and D. T. Clark | title = Synthesis of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole monomers and studies of the surface photostabilization of the related copolymers | year = 1990 | journal = [[Macromolecules (journal)|Macromolecules]] | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 2662–2666 | doi = 10.1021/ma00212a011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is performed in cold [[THF]], and the sensitive [[nitro]], [[azo]] and [[phenoxide]] groups all survive intact.  The product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a [[polymer]], to protect the polymer from damage by [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]].

Another example of its use is in the synthesis of [[Leukotriene|leukotriene A]] methyl ester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I. Ernest, A. J. Main and R. Menasse | title = Synthesis of the 7-cis isomer of the natural leukotriene d&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; | year = 1982 | journal = [[Tetrahedron Letters]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–170 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)86776-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E.

Soc.]] | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 1436–1439 | doi = 10.1021/ja00524a045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step uses a stabilised ylide, where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation, although unexpectedly this gives mainly the ''cis'' product.  The second Wittig reaction uses a non-stabilised Wittig reagent, and as expected this gives mainly the ''cis'' product.  Note that the [[epoxide]] and [[ester]] functional groups survive intact.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant. It was discovered in 1922 by Evans and Bishop. They found that it helped with reproduction in rats. The structure of Vitamin E consists of four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta tocopherol) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta tocotienol). The most abundant is the alpha tocopherol and it has been found that alpha tocopherol can undo symptoms of Vitamin E deficiency in humans. In the 50s Vitamin E was rediscovered and found to be a cellular antioxidant. 
Because of this discovery, Vitamin E has been studies primarily as an antioxidant and many people have looked at its capability to prevent chronic disease. Epidemiology studies have found a correlation between high Vitamin E intakes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. 

Brigelius-Flohe, Regina; Traber, MG (1999). Vitamin E: Functions and Metabolism. The FASEB Journal, 13 (10), pp. 1145-1155. http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/short/13/10/1145.

Vitamin E stops the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals.
Serum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. Vitamin E is also involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes

http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamine.asp

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/big&gt; (RDA)&lt;/u&gt; 
The RDA for vitamin E was previously 8 mg/day for women and 10 mg/day for men. The RDA was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in 2000 (4). This new recommendation was based largely on the results of studies done in the 1950s in men fed vitamin E deficient diets. In a test-tube analysis, hydrogen peroxide was added to blood samples and the breakdown of red blood cells, known as hemolysis, was used to indicate vitamin E deficiency. Because hemolysis has also been reported in children with severe vitamin E deficiency, this analysis was considered to be a clinically relevant test of vitamin E status. Importantly, this means that the latest RDA for vitamin E continues to be based on the prevention of deficiency symptoms rather than on health promotion and prevention of chronic disease.

=French Defence, Winawer Variation=

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. White pushes his e pawn forward, gaining space and defending it with the d4 pawn. The pawn structure now is the same as the Advance Variation, with white gaining extra space on the kingside. Black's usual response is 4...c5, threatening white's pawn chain at its base. Note that since white's knight is already on c3, the standard Advance Variation reply of c3 is unavailable. Thus, since c5 also cuts off the bishop's escape route, white usually chooses to boot the bishop with 5.a3, leading to an exchange of pieces with 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3.

=French Defence, Winawer Variation=

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black has just pushed forward his c pawn with 4...c5, threatening white's pawn chain. White's knight on c3 prevents him from extending the chain by moving a pawn to c3, so this puts white's center pawns in danger.

However, c5 also blocks the escape route for black's dark squared bishop. White usually takes advantage of this to regain the initiative with 5.a3. Black usually trades bishop for knight with 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
The European Fundamental Rights Agency was formed so that fundamemental rights for those residing in the European Union would become a reality. The Agency achieves this by completing three task.  Those task are collecting and analyzing objective reliable comparable data on a variety of fundamental rights issues, by networking with partner organizations to ensure that that the research that is carried out by the FRA is relevant to the needs, and finally by communicating it's evidence based advice to partner organizations to and the general public thereby raising awareness of fundamental rights.

The Agency has a management board that consists of people with appropriate past experience in the management of public or private sector organization in the field of human and fundamental rights. These members consist of one independent person appointed by each of the 27 Member States. Also included is one independent person appointed by the Council of Europe and also two representatives of the Commission.

The FRA receives it's funding by European Union funds which it receives each year from the European Union budgetary authority such as the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (representatives of the 27 Member State governments). The Director of the FRA must present the rationale about how the organization implemented its budget to the European Parliament upon request of the EU. The FRA must also present its annual report to the European Parliament along with an Annual Activity Report. The Agency's budget for 2010 is approximaltey 20 million Euros.

== History/Timeline ==
The European Fundamental Rights Agency was formed so that fundamemental rights for everyone living in European Union would become a reality.  This organization began in March 2007.  This organization had it's roots in another human rights organization called European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). The EUMC was established in Vienna as a separate entity. The EUMC activities started in 1998.  The preceding organization ceased to exist on 28 February 2007. 

On the basis of the data that was collected, the EUMC closely look at the extremity and development of the phenomena and manifestations of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other behavior related to that kind. The EUMC analyzed the causes and also the effects.  The organization was also tasked to develop strategies to combat racism and to showcase examples of good practices specifically related the assistance by organizations in integration of migrants and ethnic and religious minority groups in the EU Member States. 

The EUMC developed the European Information Network on Racism and Xenophobia (RAXEN) to collect data an monitor racial occurrences within the EU. This was accomplished by an organization called National Focal Points. This organiazation was retained by the EUMC to collect, review and disseminate information in each of the EU Member States as it related to racism.

== Local Significance ==
This organization is extremely significant because it affects many different areas with regard to fundametal rights.  The EFRA is active in areas such as:

a) racism and related behavior

b) discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation and against persons belonging to minorities and any combination of these grounds (multiple discrimination);

c) compensation of for people who have been victimized.

d) the rights and protection of children;

e) asylum, immigration and integration of migrants;

f) visa and border control activities; 

g) inclusion of the EU citizens in the Union's democratic processes;

h) information society and, respect for private life and protection of personal information; and

i) access to an impartial justice system.

All of the above mentioned area are of concerns not only in Austria and CZECH Republic, but the entire European Union.

== Global Impact ==
The Agency works to support an environment in which human rights promotion and protection at all levels of society and governance will become a natural reflex activity.  Engaging with the Agency's stakeholders, the wider human rights community, those at the national and local level responsible for providing services and those supporting people who make use of the services is seen as an essential part of supporting this development. This lies at the heart of the Agency's external relations and networking strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I fleshed out the introduction a little and changed some things.  I perhaps rather overcautiously removed the reference to application and abstraction as axioms simply because it is more usual to refer to alpha substitution and beta reduction as the most basic axioms of the calculus - is this agreeable? I will continue slowly - next the syntax. [[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|talk]])

== Alonzo Church ==

Just a quick note - Lambda calculus was developed by Alonzo Church, not Lorenzo Church.</text>

Could a book layout be useful for a course on writing a literature reviewer's guide?
The participants of the course would write their own reviewer's guide and would consequently
be able to make their own informed decisions about children's and youth literature based on
their own deductions in their reviewer's guide. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 10:48, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Question 1=
==i==

&lt;math&gt;ax = a\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a \cdot (x \cdot a^{-1}) = a \cdot a^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a \cdot (a^{-1} \cdot x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(a \cdot a^{-1}) \cdot x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1 \cdot x = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


==ii==

&lt;math&gt;(x-y)(x+y) = (x\cdot(x-y)+y\cdot(x-y))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (x^2-xy)+(xy-y^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^2-xy+xy-y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^2-y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;


==iii==

&lt;math&gt;x^2 = y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Either &lt;math&gt;(x+y)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means &lt;math&gt;x=-y\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x-y)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;x=y\,&lt;/math&gt;.


==iv==

&lt;math&gt;x^3-y^3 = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(x-y)x^2 + (x-y)xy + (x-y)y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(x^3 - x^2y + x^2y - xy^2 + xy^2 - y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=x^3 - y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

==v==

&lt;math&gt;x^n-y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} +x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1}) - y(x^{n-1} +x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (x^n + x^{n-1}y + ... + x^2y^{n-2} + xy^{n-1}) - (x^{n-1}y + x^{n-2}y^2 + ... + xy^{n-1}+y^n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^n - y^n\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the two middle terms do no appear to match, but if you follow the logical development in each term, you will see that there is a matching additive inverse for each term on both sides.


==vi==

Use the same method as '''iv''', expand the expression and cancel.


=Question 2=

&lt;math&gt;x^2 = xy\,&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = y\,&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;x-y=0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Step 4 requires division by &lt;math&gt;x-y=0\,&lt;/math&gt; and thus is an invalid step.


= Question 4=
==ii==

All values of x satisfy the inequality, since it can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;-3 &lt; x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt;= 0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all x.

==iii==

If &lt;math&gt;5-x^2 &lt; -2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; 7\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Thus, &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \sqrt{7}\,&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &lt; -\sqrt{7}\,&lt;/math&gt;.


==v==

&lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+2&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored in its current form, so we first turn a part of the expression into a perfect square:


:&lt;math&gt;(x^2-2x+1)+1 &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


We then complete the square on &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+1 = (x-1)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, so now we have the expression:


:&lt;math&gt;(x-1)^2+1 &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is positive for all values of x.


==vi==

If &lt;math&gt;x^2 + x + 1 &gt; 2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^2+x-1 &gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt;x^2+x-1 = \left(x+\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \left(x-\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


Thus &lt;math&gt;x &lt; -\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


==viii==

Complete the square:


&lt;math&gt;x^2+x+1=x^2+x+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}=\left(x +\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left(x +\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\frac{3}{4} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==ix==

Solve for &lt;math&gt;(x-\pi)(x+5) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; first, then consider the third factor &lt;math&gt;(x-3)\,&lt;/math&gt; for both cases, giving us &lt;math&gt;-5 &lt; x &lt; 3\,&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \pi\,&lt;/math&gt;


==x==

&lt;math&gt;x &gt; \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &lt; \sqrt[3]{2}&lt;/math&gt;


==xi==

If &lt;math&gt;2^x &lt; 8\,&lt;/math&gt;, then taking the base 2 logarithm on both sides:


&lt;math&gt;log_2 2^x &lt; log_2 8 = x &lt; 3\,&lt;/math&gt;


==xii==

&lt;math&gt;x &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


==xiii==

NOTE: The answer in the 3rd Edition provides &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging in values &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. 10, gives us &lt;math&gt;1/10-1/9 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, so I think this is a misprint or an incorrect answer.


If &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x-x^2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is only positive when &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; x&lt;/math&gt;. 


=Question 5=
==i==
&lt;math&gt;a+c&lt;b+d\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;= (b+d)-(a+c)&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (b-a)+(d-c) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is true since &lt;math&gt;(b-a),(d-c) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


==ii==
&lt;math&gt;b-a&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;=-a+b &gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=-a-(-b)&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=-b &lt; -a\,&lt;/math&gt;


==iv==
&lt;math&gt;(b-a), c &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;c(b-a) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;c(b-a) = bc-ac\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bc\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


==v==
&lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;1-a &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a(1-a) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= a^2 - a &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=a^2 &gt; a\,&lt;/math&gt; 


==viii==

If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are 0, then by definition &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bd&lt;/math&gt;.

Otherwise, we have already proved that &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bc&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a, c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, therefore if &lt;math&gt;c &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bd&lt;/math&gt; is true.


==ix==

If &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;b^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; ab&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;ab &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The National Eligibility Test (&quot;NET&quot;) is the national level entrance examination for postgraduate candidates who wish to qualify for university level teaching jobs in India. It is administered by the University Grants Commission.

==About the NET==
The University Grants Commission (&quot;UGC&quot;) administers the NET to determine eligibility for a lectureship and for the award of Junior Research Fellowships (&quot;JRF&quot;) for Indian nationals in order to ensure minimum standards for the entrants in the teaching profession and research. The examination covers humanities (including languages), social sciences, forensic science, environmental sciences, computer science and applications and electronic science.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (&quot;CSIR&quot;) administers the UGC-CSIR NET for other science subjects, namely, life sciences, physical sciences, chemical sciences, mathematical sciences and Earth, atmospheric, ocean and planetary sciences jointly with the UGC. The tests are conducted twice in a year generally in the months of '''June''' and '''December'''. For candidates who wish to pursue research, a JRF is available for five years subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. UGC has allocated a number of fellowships to the universities for the candidates who pass the test for JRF. A JRF is awarded to the meritorious candidates from among the candidates qualifying for eligibility for lectureship in the NET Examination. A JRF is available only to candidates who opt for it on their application forms.

The test for a JRF has been conducted since 1984. The government of India, through its notification dated 22 July, 1988 entrusted the task of conducting the eligibility test for lectureship to the UGC. Consequently, the UGC held the first NET, common to both eligibility for lectureship and JRF in two parts, that is, in December 1989 and in March, 1990.

==Concept of SET/SLET==
It was felt that an eligibility test at the national level may not be completely able to represent the subjects which are regional in their character. Moreover, the demand for enabling the candidates to appear for the test in their own mother tongue was also being made. The state governments and union territories were, therefore, given the option of conducting their own test for eligibility for lectureship at the state level. Thus was born the concept of SET, that is, State Eligibility Test for Lectureship Eligibility only. It is conducted both in English and the vernacular.

The Commission at its meeting held on 25 May 1990 decided to constitute a UGC Committee on Accreditation of Test (U-CAT). The terms of reference of U-CAT are as follows:

* Laying down guidelines for holding the tests.
* Laying down guidelines for holding the tests/CSIR.
* Monitoring of tests conducted by other agencies and suggesting follow-up measures.
* Extend guidance and help to State level agencies in the organization of the tests.

Based on the recommendations made by U-CAT, the following guidelines are given to the states regarding test design, course content, organization of the test, etc., for conducting State Eligibility Test (SET) for Lectureship only.

In accordance with the mandate given by the Government of India, the UGC, on request of State Governments, proposed to have the SET duly accredited by UGC for a fixed term. This state level test is based on the pattern of the NET conducted by UGC and UGC/CSIR for humanities, social sciences and science subjects respectively. The State Governments and Union Territories, which wish to conduct their own SET, are required to obtain accreditation from UGC from time to time.

Besides conducting the NET examination, the role of the NET Bureau is to assess and accredit state-identified agencies to conduct SET examination. The SET assessment is done by evaluating the performance of the state agency designated by the state government. The Certification of Accreditation is given to the state for a stipulated period of time.

===Identification of State Agency===
A State Government may identify an agency, which may be a University, or an examination body of repute or a reputed agency associated with recruitment of teachers for higher education.

===States conducting SLET===
Presently, SET/SLET is being conducted in the following states:

* Maharashtra
* Goa
* Tamil Nadu
* Madhya Pradesh
* Andhra Pradesh
* Himachal Pradesh
* Jammu &amp; Kashmir
* Rajasthan
* Uttar Pradesh
* West Bengal
* Gujarat
* NE-SLET (Which includes all North Eastern states and Sikkim)
* Karnataka

The Commission constitutes an Accreditation Committee from time to time to assess the performance of the states conducting the SET Examination. The Commission takes a final decision about any state on the basis of the Report of the Committee.

==Scope of NET &amp; SLET==
===Eligibility for Lectureship===

Clearing of NET Examination confers eligibility for lectureship upon Indian nationals, i.e. the NET qualified candidates are eligible to apply for the post of lecturer in all Indian universities/Institutes/colleges. It was resolved in the UGC's Commission Meeting held on January 1, 2001 that for SET examinations scheduled in or after June 2002, the SET qualified candidates would be eligible for appointment to the post of lecturer only in the universities and colleges belonging to the state from where they have passed the SET examination.  The status of SET was decreed to remain unchanged for SET examinations conducted prior to 1 June 2002, that is, the candidates clearing SET were eligible for appointment to the post of lecturer anywhere in India.

===Junior Research Fellowship===
The candidates who qualify the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) Examination of UGC/CSIR NET are also eligible for the post of lectureship.  In addition they are also eligible to receive Fellowships (UGC/CSIR) under various schemes subject to the candidates finding their placement in the universities/IITs/other national organizations. The validity of the offer is currently within two years with effect from the date of issue of the JRF award letter.  The validity period of the offer has been raised from one year to two years for JRF Award Letters issued on or after 1 May 2005.  However, in case the candidates have already joined M.Phil./Ph.D. programs, the date of commencement of fellowship will be from the date of declaration of NET examination result or date of their joining, whichever is later.

===Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (SPM) Fellowship===
To commemorate the birth centenary year (2000) of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who was the  first Vice-President of CSIR in the Independent India, the CSIR has instituted a special fellowship, namely, &quot;Dr. Shyama  Prasad Mukherjee (SPM)  Fellowship&quot; open to the selective CSIR-UGC JRF (NET) awardees. Around top 50 candidates in Life Sciences and Chemical Sciences and top 25 each in Physical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences &amp; Earth Sciences from each of the two NET examinations conducted in a calendar year and GATE qualified candidates in the subject areas of NET with percentile score of 99% and above are called for interview. The eligible candidates are first screened by a specially constituted panel of subject-experts. The shortlisted candidates after first interview are further interviewed by a panel of SPMF Core Committee members and subject- committee chairmen for making final recommendations. It is the most prestigious fellowship given in India for doing PhD and a preferential qualification in recruitment to CSIR jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Factorial notation ==
A factorial of a positive integer ''n'' is the product of all the natural numbers from 1 to ''n''. The factorial of ''n'' is denoted by ''n!'' (n factorial). Factorials are used in probability distributions.

Factorials can be used to find the possible number of permutations or combinations of the elements of a set. For example, let ''S'' represent the set of beads in a bag. The bag has 2 blue and 2 green beads. The beads are taken out of the bag and arranged. The possible arrangements are:

* BBGG
* BGGB
* BGBG
* GBGB
* GBBG
* GGBB

where ''B'' represents a blue bead and ''G'' represents a green bead.

We can see that there are 8 possible arrangements. We can use factorials to work out the number of possible arrangements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
What if we could have all of the energy we needed and never run out of it? What if we could use this energy without polluting the air and water? In the future, renewable sources of energy may be able to provide all of the energy we need. Some of these resources can give us &quot;clean&quot; energy that causes little or no pollution.

Plenty of clean energy is available for us to use. The largest amount of energy to reach Earth's surface is from solar radiation. Each year is 174 petawatts (1.74{{e|17}}&amp;nbsp;W) of energy from the sun enter the Earth's atmosphere. Because the planet's interior is hot, heat flows outward from the interior, providing about 23 terawatts (2.3{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;W) of energy per year. By contrast, the total world power consumption is around 16 terawatts (1.6{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;W) per year. So solar or geothermal energy alone could provide all of the energy needed for people if it could be harnessed.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe different renewable resources, and understand why they are renewable.
* Understand that the sun is the source of most of Earth's energy.
* Describe how energy is carried from one place to another as heat and by moving objects.
* Understand how conduction, convection, and radiation transfer energy as heat when renewable energy sources are used.
* Understand that some renewable energy sources cost less than others and some cause less pollution than others.
* Explain how renewable energy resources are turned into useful forms of energy.
* Describe how the use of different renewable energy resources affects the environment.

==Solar Energy==
When you think of the sun, you probably think of two things&amp;mdash;light and heat. The sun is Earth's main source of energy, and light and heat are two different kinds of energy that the sun makes. The sun makes this energy when one element, called hydrogen, changes into another element, called helium. Changing hydrogen into helium releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to the Earth mostly as visible light. The light carries the energy through the empty space between the sun and the Earth in a process called '''radiation'''. We can use this light from the sun as an energy resource called solar energy (Figure 5.6).

[[File:Mafate Marla solar panel dsc00633.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.6''': Solar panels like these can turn the sun's energy into electricity to provide power to homes.]]

Solar energy is a resource that has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Its use on a larger scale is just starting to ramp up and people increase production of renewable energy sources. One focus of solar power development in the United States is the desert southwest.

Solar power plants are in the works for southeastern California, near the California-Nevada border.

Solar energy is used to heat homes, to heat water, and to make electricity. Solar energy can be used to heat the water in your pool or to heat tile floors in your home. In recent years, scientists and engineers have found new ways to get more and more energy from this resource. Because there are many different uses for solar energy, there are also many different ways of turning the sun's energy into useful forms. One of the most common ways is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that can turn sunlight directly into electricity. You may have seen solar panels on roof tops. Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel.

Solar power plants turn sunlight into electricity using a large group of mirrors to focus sunlight on one place, called a receiver (Figure 5.7). When a liquid, such as oil or water flows through this receiver, the focused sunlight heats the liquid to a high temperature. Then, this heated liquid transfers its heat by '''conduction'''. In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are in contact with one another. The object that is at a higher temperature transfers energy as heat to the object that is at a lower temperature. For example, when you heat a pot of water on a stove top, conduction causes energy to move from the pot to its metal handle, and the handle gets very hot. In the case of the solar power plant, the energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.

[[File:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 5.7''': This solar power plant uses mirrors to focus sunlight on the tower in the center. The sunlight heats a liquid inside the tower to a very high temperature, producing energy to make electricity.]]

Solar energy has many benefits. It does not produce any pollution. Also, there is plenty of it available. In fact, the amount of energy that reaches Earth from the sun every day is many times more than all of the energy we use. For this reason, we consider solar energy a renewable form of energy. For as long as sunlight continues to warm the Earth, we will never run out of this resource. One problem with solar energy is that it cannot be used at night, unless a special battery stores extra energy during the day for use at night. The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until this technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources. As you learned earlier, most of the Earth's energy comes from the sun. Other renewable resources also come from the sun originally. You will be learning about these resources later in this lesson.

==Water Power==
Earlier in this lesson, you learned that energy can travel in the form of light and heat, just as it does when it travels from the sun to the Earth. Now, you will learn about one way in which energy can travel in the form of a moving object. In this case, the moving object is water (Figure 5.8). Water power uses the energy of water in motion to make electricity. It is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world, and it provides almost one fifth of the world's electricity.

[[File:Adam Beck Complex.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.8''': Hydroelectric dams like this one use the power of moving water to create electricity.]]

In most power plants that use water power, a dam holds water back from where it would normally flow. Instead, the water is allowed to flow into a large turbine. Because the water is moving, it has energy of motion, called kinetic energy. The energy of this moving water makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity.

Many of the streams in the United States where water flows down a slope have probably been developed for hydroelectric power. This is a major source of California’s electricity, about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of California’s nearly 400 hydropower plants are located in the eastern mountain ranges where large streams descend down a steep grade.

One big benefit of water power is that it does not burn a fuel. This benefit gives water power an advantage over most other energy resources in how it affects the environment. Because water power does not burn a fuel, it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy. Another benefit of water power is that, like the other resources you are learning about in this lesson, it is a renewable resource. We use energy from the water’s movement, but we are not using up the water itself. Water keeps flowing into our rivers and lakes, so wherever we can build plants to use it, water will be available as a source of energy. The energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power.

Water power does have its problems, though. When a large dam is built, this creates a reservoir, changing the ecosystem upstream. Large river ecosystems are inundated, killing all the plants and animals. The dams and turbines also change the downstream environment for fish and other living things. Dams also slow the release of silt, so that downstream deltas retreat and seaside cities become dangerously exposed to storms and rising sea levels. Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary. Wave power applications have to be able to withstand coastal storms and the corrosion of seawater.

==Wind Power==
As you learned earlier, the sun provides plenty of energy to the Earth. The energy from the sun also creates wind (Figure 5.9). Learning about what causes wind will help you understand that energy can move as heat, not just by radiation and conduction, but also by convection. Wind happens when the sun heats some parts of the Earth differently. For example, sunlight hits the equator much more directly than it hits the North and South Poles. Hot air rises and cooler air moves in, so when the air near the equator is heated much more than the air near the poles, the air begins to move carrying heat through the air in a process called '''convection'''. This movement of air is wind.

[[File:Windpark.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.9''': Wind turbines like the ones shown above turn wind into electricity without creating pollution.]]

Wind power uses moving air as a source of energy. Some examples of wind power have been around for a long time. Windmills have been used to grind grain and pump water for hundreds of years. Ships with sails have depended on wind for even longer. Wind can be used to generate electricity, too. Like the moving water that creates water power, the moving air can make a turbine spin to make electricity.

To help you understand how moving air can be used to make electricity, you could think back to what you have learned about energy of motion, called kinetic energy. Any form of matter that is moving has kinetic energy. Even though you cannot see air, it is matter, because it takes up space and has mass. So, when wind makes the air move, this air has kinetic energy. When the moving air hits the blades of a turbine, it makes those blades move, and the turbine spins. The spinning of the turbine creates electricity.

Wind power has many advantages. It is clean energy, meaning that it does not cause pollution or release carbon dioxide. Also, wind is plentiful almost everywhere. One problem with wind energy is that the wind does not blow all of the time. One solution is to find efficient ways to store energy for later use. Until then, another energy source needs to be available when the wind is not blowing. Lastly, windmills are expensive and wear out quickly. For the amount
of energy they generate, windmills are more expensive than some other forms of renewable energy.

California was an early adopter of wind power. Windmills are found in mountain passes, especially where cooler Pacific ocean air is sucked across the passes and into the warmer inland valleys. Large fields of windmills can be seen at Altamont pass in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area, San Gorgonio Pass east of Los Angeles, and Tehachapi Pass at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.

==Biomass==
Another renewable source of energy is biomass. Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were recently living. Biomass also includes the waste that plants and animals produce. People can use biomass directly for heating. For example, many people burn wood in fireplaces or in wood-burning stoves.

Besides burning biomass directly for heating, people can process biomass to make fuel. This processing makes what is called biofuel. Biofuel is a fairly new type of energy that is becoming more popular. People can use fuels from biomass in many of the same ways that they use fossil fuels. For example, some mechanics have made changes to car, truck, and bus engines to allow them to use a fuel called biodiesel. Other engines can run on pure vegetable oil or even recycled vegetable oil.

If we use fuels made from biomass, we can cut down on the amount of fossil fuel that we use. Because living plants take carbon dioxide out of the air, growing plants for biofuel can mean that we will put less of this gas into the air overall. This could help us do something about the problem of global warming.

==Geothermal Energy==
Geothermal energy is a source of energy that comes from heat deep below the surface of the Earth. This heat produces hot water and steam from rocks that are heated by magma. Power plants that use this type of energy get to the heat by drilling wells into these rocks. The hot water or steam comes up through these wells. Then, the hot water or steam makes a turbine spin to make electricity. Because the hot water or steam can be used directly to make a turbine spin, geothermal energy is a resource that can be used without processing. The fact that it does not need to be processed makes geothermal energy different from most other energy resources. Geothermal energy is clean and safe. It is renewable, too, because the power plant can pump the hot water back into the underground pool. There, the water can pick up heat to make more steam.

This source of energy is an excellent resource in some parts of the world. For example, Iceland is a country that gets about one fourth of its electricity from geothermal sources. In the United States, California leads all states in producing geothermal energy. Geothermal energy in California is concentrated in a few areas in the northern part of the state. The largest geothermal power plant in the state is in the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in Napa and Sonoma Counties. The source of heat is thought to be a large magma chamber lying beneath the area, a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Many parts of the world do not have underground sources of heat that are close enough to the surface for building geothermal power plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
''Plate tectonics'' is the unifying theory of geology. This important theory explains why Earth's geography has changed through time and continues to change today. It explains why some places are prone to earthquakes and some are not; why some regions have deadly volcanic eruptions, some have mild ones, and some have none at all; and why mountain ranges are located where they are. Plate tectonic motions affect Earth's rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life. Plate tectonic theory was developed through the efforts of many scientists during the twentieth century.

Before you can learn about plate tectonics, you need to know something about the layers that are found inside Earth. From outside to inside, the planet is divided into crust, mantle, and core. Often geologists talk about the lithosphere, which is the crust and the uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is brittle–it is easily cracked or broken–whereas the mantle beneath it behaves plastically; it can bend. Geologists must use ingenious methods, such as tracking the properties of earthquake waves, to learn about the interior of our planet.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Compare and describe each of Earth's layers.
* Compare some of the ways geologists learn about Earth’s interior.
* Define lithosphere, oceanic and continental crust.
* Describe how heat moves, particularly how convection takes place in the mantle.
* Compare the two parts of the core and describe why they are different from each other.

==Exploring Earth's Interior==
Earth is composed of several layers. On the outside is the relatively cold, brittle '''crust'''. Below the crust is the hot, convecting '''mantle'''. At the center is the dense, metallic inner core. How do scientists know this? Rocks yield clues, but geologists can only see the outermost rocky layer. Rarely, a rock or mineral, like a diamond, may come to the surface from deeper down in the crust or the mantle. Mostly, though, Earth scientists must use other clues to figure out what lies beneath the planet's surface.

One way scientists learn about Earth's interior is by looking at '''seismic waves''' (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves travel outward in all directions from where the ground breaks at an earthquake. There are several types of seismic waves, each with different properties. Each type of wave moves at different speeds through different types of material and the waves bend when they travel from one type of material to another. Some types of waves do not travel through liquids or gases and some do. So scientists can track how seismic waves behave as they travel through Earth and can use the information to understand what makes up the planet's interior. Much more about earthquakes and seismic waves will be presented in the Earthquakes lesson.

[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.1''': Different types of seismic waves bend or even disappear as they travel encounter the different properties of the layers that make up Earth's interior. Letters describe the path of an individual P wave or S wave.]]

Scientists also learn about Earth's interior from rocks from outer space. '''Meteorites''' are the remains of the material that the early solar system formed from. Some iron and nickel meteorites are thought to be very similar to Earth's core (Figure 6.2). For this reason they give scientists clues as to the core's makeup and density. An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands!

==Crust and Lithosphere==
Of course, scientists know the most about Earth's outermost layer and less and less about layers that are found deeper in the planet's interior (Figure 6.3). Earth's outer surface is its crust; a thin, brittle outer shell made of rock. Geologists call the outermost, brittle, mechanical layer the '''lithosphere'''. The difference between crust and lithosphere is that lithosphere includes the uppermost mantle, which is also brittle.

[[File:Earth cross section-i18.png|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.3''': A cross section of Earth showing the following layers: (1) crust (2) mantle (3a) outer core (3b) inner core (4) lithosphere (5) asthenosphere (6) outer core (7) inner core. The lithosphere is made of the crust plus the uppermost part of the mantle. The asthenosphere is directly under the lithosphere and is part of the upper mantle.]]

The crust is the very thin, outermost solid layer of the Earth. The crust varies tremendously; from thinner areas under the oceans to much thicker areas that make mountains. Just by looking around and thinking of the places you’ve been or seen photos of, you can guess that the crust is not all the same. Geologists make an important distinction between two very different types of crust: oceanic crust and continental crust. Each type has its own distinctive physical and chemical properties. This is one of the reasons that there are ocean basins and continents.

'''Oceanic crust''' is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 to 8 miles). This crust is made of basalt lavas that erupt onto the seafloor. Beneath the basalt is gabbro, an igneous intrusive rock that comes from basalt magma but that cools more slowly and develops larger crystals. The basalt and gabbro of the oceanic crust are dense (3.0 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) when compared to the average of the rocks that make up the continents. Sediments cover much of the oceanic crust, primarily rock dust and the shells of microscopic sea creatures, called plankton. Near shore, the seafloor is thick with sediments that come off the continents in rivers and on wind currents.

'''Continental crust''' is much thicker than oceanic crust, around 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks of all three major types: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. The average composition of continental crust is about that of granite. Granite is much less dense (2.7 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) than the basalt and gabbro of the oceanic crust. Because it is thick and has relatively low density, continental crust rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust, which sinks into the mantle to form basins. When filled with water these basins form the planet's oceans.

Since it is a combination of the crust and uppermost mantle, lithosphere is thicker than crust. Oceanic lithosphere is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) thick. Continental lithosphere is about 250 kilometers (155 miles) thick.

==Mantle==
Beneath the crust, lies the mantle. Like the crust, mantle is made of rock. The mantle is differentiated from the crust by an increase in rock density as indicated by a sudden increase in seismic wave velocities. Evidence from seismic waves and meteorites let scientists know that the mantle is made of iron and magnesium-rich silicate minerals that are part of the rock peridotite. These types of ultramafic rocks are rarely found at Earth’s surface. One very important feature of the mantle is that it is extremely hot.  Although the higher temperatures far exceed the melting points of the mantle rocks at the surface the mantle is almost exclusively solid. The heat in the mantle is mainly due to heat rising from the core. Through the process of '''conduction''', heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects until all are the same temperature. Knowing the ways that heat flows is important for understanding how the mantle behaves.

Heat can flow in two ways within the Earth. If the material is solid, heat flows by conduction, and heat is transferred through the rapid collision among atoms. If a material is fluid and able to move&amp;mdash;that is, it is a gas, liquid, or a solid that can move (like toothpaste)&amp;mdash;heat can also flow by '''convection'''. In convection, currents form so that warm material rises and cool material sinks. This sets up a '''convection cell''' (Figure 6.4).

[[File:Convection cells.svg|center|frame|'''Figure 6.4''': In a convection cell, warm material rises and cool material sinks. In mantle convection, the heat source is Earth's core.]]

Convection occurs when a pot of water is heated on a stove. The stove heats the bottom layer of the water, which makes it less dense than the water above it, so the warmer bottom water rises. Since the layer of water on the top of the pot is not near the heat source, it is relatively cool. As a result, it is denser than the water beneath it and so it sinks. Within the pot, convection cells become well established as long as there is more heat at the bottom of the pot than on the top.

Convection cells are also found in the mantle. Mantle material is heated by the core and so it rises upwards. When it reaches the surface of the Earth, it moves horizontally. As the material moves away from the core's heat, it cools. Eventually the mantle material at the top of the convection cell becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks back down into the deeper mantle. When it reaches the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally just
above the core. Then it reaches the location where warm mantle material is rising, and the mantle convection cell is complete. The relationship between mantle convection and plate tectonics will be discussed in the final section of this chapter.

==Core==
At the planet's center lies a dense metallic '''core'''. Scientists know that the core is metal for two reasons: The first is that some meteorites are metallic and they are thought to be representative of the core. The second is that the density of Earth's surface layers is much less than the overall density of the planet. We can calculate Earth's density using our planet's rotation. If the surface layers are less dense than the average for the planet, then
the interior must be denser than the average. Calculations indicate that the core is about 85% iron metal with nickel metal making up much of the rest. These proportions agree with those seen in metallic meteorites. Seismic waves indicate that the outer core must be liquid and the inner core must be solid.

If Earth's core were not metallic, the planet would not have a magnetic field. Metal conducts electricity, but rock&amp;mdash;which makes up the mantle and crust&amp;mdash;does not. The best conductors are metals that can move, so scientists assume that the magnetic field is due to convection in the liquid outer core. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Earth is made of three layers: the crust, mantle and core.
* The brittle crust and uppermost mantle are together called the lithosphere.
* Beneath the lithosphere, the mantle is solid rock that can flow, or behave plastically.
* The hot core warms the base of the mantle, which cause mantle convection.
* Mantle convection is very important to the theory of plate tectonics.

==Points to Consider==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
An important piece of plate tectonic theory is the continental drift idea. This was developed in the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, mostly by a single scientist, Alfred Wegener. His hypothesis states that continents move around on Earth's surface and that they were once joined together as a single supercontinent (Figure 6.5). Wegener's idea eventually helped to form the theory of plate tectonics, but while Wegener was alive, scientists did not believe that the continents could move.

[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.5''': The continents fit together like pieces of a puzzle. This is how they looked 250 million years ago.]]
{{clear}}
==Lesson Objectives==
* Be able to explain the continental drift hypothesis.
* Describe the evidence Wegener used to support his continental drift idea.
* Describe how the north magnetic pole appeared to move, and how that is evidence for continental drift.

==The Continental Drift Idea==
Find a map of the continents and cut each one out. Better yet, use a map where the edges of the continents show the continental shelf. In this case, your continent puzzle piece includes all of the continental crust for that continent and reflects the true size and shape of the continent. Can you fit the pieces together? The easiest link is between the eastern Americas and western Africa and Europe, but the rest can fit together too!

Alfred Wegener, an early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century German meteorologist believed that the continents could fit together. He proposed that the continents were not stationary but that they had moved during the planet's history. He suggested that at one time, all of the continents had been united into a single supercontinent. He named the supercontinent Pangaea, meaning entire earth in ancient Greek. Wegener further suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis
'''continental drift'''.

==Evidence for Continental Drift==
Besides the fit of the continents, Wegener and his supporters collected a great deal of evidence for the continental drift hypothesis. Wegener found that this evidence was best explained if the continents had at one time been joined together.

Wegener discovered that identical rocks could be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These rocks were the same type and the same age. Wegener understood that the rocks had formed side-by-side and that the land has since moved apart. Wegener also matched up mountain ranges that had the same rock types, structures, and ages, but that are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachians of the eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range that was separated as the continents drifted.

Wegener also found evidence from ancient fossils (Figure 6.6). He found fossils of the same species of extinct plants and animals in rocks of the same age, but on continents that are now widely separated. Wegener suggested that the continents could not have been in their current positions because the organisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans. For example, fossils of the seed fern ''Glossopteris'' are found across all of the southern continents. But the plants' seeds were too heavy to be carried across the ocean by wind. ''Mesosaurus'' fossils are found in South America and South Africa, but the reptile only could only swim in fresh water. ''Cynognathus'' and ''Lystrosaurus'' were reptiles that lived on land. Both of these animals were unable to swim, let alone swim across wide seas! Their fossils have been found across South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Wegener proposed that the organisms had lived side by side, but that the lands had moved apart after they were dead and fossilized.

[[File:Snider-Pellegrini Wegener fossil map.gif|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.6''': Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. Wegener suggested that when the organisms were alive, the lands were joined and the organisms were living side-by-side.]]

Wegener also looked at evidence from ancient glaciers. Large glaciers are most commonly found in frigid climates, usually in the far northern and southern latitudes. Using the distribution of grooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers on many different continents, Wegener traced the glaciers back to where they must have started. He discovered that if the continents were in their current positions, the glaciers would have formed in the middle of the ocean very close to the equator. Wegener knew that this was impossible! However, if the continents had moved, the glaciers would have been centered over the southern land mass much closer to the South Pole.

Wegener also found evidence for his hypothesis from warm climate zones. Coral reefs and the swamps that lead to the formation of coal are now found only in tropical and subtropical environments. But Wegener discovered ancient coal seams and coral reefs in parts of the continents that were much too cold today. The coral reef fossils and coal had drifted to new locations since the coal and coral formed.

Although Wegener's evidence was sound, most geologists at the time rejected his hypothesis of continental drift. These scientists argued that there was no way to explain ''how'' solid continents could plow through solid oceanic crust. At the time, scientists did not understand how solid material could move. Wegener's idea was nearly forgotten until technological advances presented puzzling new information and gave scientists the tools to develop a mechanism for Wegener’s drifting continents.

==Magnetic Polarity Evidence==
The puzzling new evidence came from studying Earth's magnetic field and how it has changed. If you have ever been hiking or camping, you may have used a compass to help you find your way. A compass uses the Earth’s magnetic field to locate the magnetic North Pole. Earth's '''magnetic field''' is like a bar magnet with the ends of the bar sticking out at each pole (Figure 6.7). Currently, the field's north and south magnetic poles are very near to the Earth's north and south geographic poles.

Some iron-bearing minerals, like tiny '''magnetite''' crystals in igneous rocks, point to the north magnetic pole as they crystallize from magma. These little magnets record both the strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field. The direction is known as the field's '''magnetic polarity'''. In the 1950s, scientists began using '''magnetometers''' to look at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations.

[[File:Dipole field.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 6.7''': Earth's magnetic field is like a magnet with its north pole near the geographic north pole and the south pole near the geographic south pole.]]

Geologists noted that magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks pointed to the current magnetic north pole. This happened no matter where the rocks were located, whether they were on different continents or in different locations on the same continent. But for older volcanic rocks, this was not true. Rocks that were the same age and were located on the same continent pointed to the same point, but that point was not the current north magnetic pole. Moving back in time, rocks on the same continent that were the same age pointed at the same point. But these rocks did not point to the same point as the rocks of different ages or the current magnetic pole. In other words, although the magnetite crystals were pointing to the magnetic north pole, the location of the pole seemed to wander. For example, 400 million year old lava flows in North America indicated that the north magnetic pole was located in the western Pacific Ocean, but 250 million year old lava flows indicated a pole in Asia, and 100 million year old lava flows had a pole in northern Asia. Scientists were amazed to find that the north magnetic pole changed location through time!

There were three possible explanations for this puzzling phenomenon: (1) the continent remained fixed and the north magnetic pole moved (2) the north magnetic pole stood still and the continent moved (3) both the continent and the north pole moved.

The situation got stranger when scientists looked at where magnetite crystals pointed for rocks of the same age but on different continents. They found these rocks pointed to different magnetic north poles! For example, 400 million years ago the European north pole was different from the North American north pole at that same time. At 250 million years, the north poles were also different for the two continents. The scientists again looked at the three possible explanations. If the correct explanation was that the continents had remained fixed while the north magnetic pole moved, then there had to be two separate north poles. Since there is only one north pole today, they decided that the best explanation had to involve only one north magnetic pole. This meant that the second explanation must be correct, that the north magnetic pole had remained fixed but that the continents had moved.

To test this, geologists fitted the continents together as Wegener had done. They discovered that there had indeed been only one magnetic north pole but that the continents had drifted. They renamed the phenomenon of the magnetic pole that seemed to move but actually did not '''apparent polar wander'''. This evidence for continental drift gave geologists renewed interest in understanding how continents could move about on the planet's surface. And we know that the magnetic pole wanders, too, so the correct explanation was that both the continents and the magnetic poles move. Yeah hoe

==Lesson Summary==
* In the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, scientists began to put together evidence that the continents could move around on Earth's surface.
* The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climatic zones.
* Although the evidence was extremely strong, scientists could not think of a mechanism that could drive solid continents to move around on the solid earth and most rejected the idea.
* Continental drift would resurface after World War II when a mechanism was discovered.

==Review Questions==
# Why can paper cutouts of the continents including the continental margins be pieced together to form a single whole?
# How can the locations where ancient fossils are found be used as evidence for continental drift?
# To show that mountain ranges on opposite sides of the Atlantic formed as two parts of the same range and were once joined, what would you look for?
# What are the three possible explanations for apparent polar wander when the rocks are all on one continent? If the rocks are on more than one continent, which explanation is the only one likely to be true and why?
# In the face of so much evidence in support of continental drift, how could scientists reject the idea?
# Look at a world map. Besides the coast of west Africa and eastern South America, what are some other regions of the world that look as they could be closely fit together?

Perhaps surprisingly, it was World War II that gave scientists the tools to find the mechanism for continental drift that had eluded Wegener and his colleagues. Scientists used maps and other data gathered during the war to develop the seafloor spreading hypothesis. This hypothesis traces oceanic crust from its origin at a mid-ocean ridge to its destruction at a deep sea '''trench'''. Scientists realized that seafloor spreading could be the mechanism for continental drift that they had been looking for.

==Lesson Objectives==
* List the main features of the seafloor: mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and abyssal plains.
* Describe what seafloor magnetism tells scientists about the seafloor.
* Describe the process of seafloor spreading.

==Seafloor Bathymetry==
During the war, battleships and submarines carried '''echo sounders''' to locate enemy submarines (Figure 6.8). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions, bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. The round-trip time of the sound wave is then recorded. By knowing the speed of sound in seawater, scientists can calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit. During the war, the sound wave rarely encountered an enemy submarine, and so most of the sound waves ricocheted off the ocean bottom.

[[File:Echo Sounding USN.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.8''': A ship sends out sound waves to create a picture of the seafloor below it. The echo sounder pictured has many beams and as a result it creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor beneath the ship. Early echo sounders had only a single beam and created a line of depth measurements.]]

After the war, scientists pieced together the bottom depths to produce a a map of the seafloor. This is known as a '''bathymetric map''' and is similar to a topographic map of the land surface. While a bathymetric map measures the distance of the seafloor below sea level, a topographic map gives the elevation of the land surface above sea level. Bathymetric maps reveal the features of the ocean floor as if the water were taken away.

The bathymetric maps that were produced at this time were astonishing! Most people had thought that the ocean floor was completely flat but the maps showed something completely different. As we know now, majestic mountain ranges extend in a line through the deep oceans. Amazingly, the mountain ranges are connected as if they were the seams on a baseball. These mountain ranges are named mid-ocean ridges. The '''mid-ocean ridges''' and the areas around them rise up high above the deep seafloor (Figure 6.9).

[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.9''': A modern map of the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Darker blue indicates deeper seas. A mid-ocean ridge can be seen running through the center of the Atlantic Ocean. Deep sea trenches are found along the west coast of Central and South America and in the mid-Atlantic east of the southern tip of South America. Isolated mountains and flat featureless regions can also be spotted.]]

Another astonishing feature is the deep sea trenches that are found at the edges of continental margins or in the sea near chains of active volcanoes. Trenches are the deepest places on Earth. The deepest trench is the Marianas Trench in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, which plunges about 11 kilometers (35,840 feet) beneath sea level. Near the trenches, the seafloor is also especially deep.

Besides these dramatic features, there are lots of flat areas, called '''abyssal plains''', just as the scientists had predicted. But many of these plains are dotted with volcanic mountains. These mountains are both large and small, pointy and flat-topped, by themselves as well as in a line. When they first observed the maps, the amazing differences made scientists wonder what had formed these features.

==Seafloor Magnetism==
In the previous lesson, you learned that magnetometers used on land were important in recognizing apparent polar wander. Magnetometers were also important in understanding the magnetic polarity of rocks in the deep sea. During WWII, magnetometers that were attached to ships to search for submarines discovered a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor.

In fact, using magnetometers, scientists discovered an astonishing feature of Earth's magnetic field. Sometimes, no one really knows why, the magnetic poles switch positions. North becomes south and south becomes north! When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say the polarity is normal. When they are in the opposite position, they say that the polarity is reversed.

[[File:Oceanic.Stripe.Magnetic.Anomalies.Scheme.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.10''': Scientists found that magnetic polarity in the seafloor was normal at mid-ocean ridges but reversed in symmetrical patterns away from the ridge center. This normal and reversed pattern continues across the seafloor.]]

Scientists were surprised to discover that the normal and reversed magnetic polarity of seafloor basalts creates a pattern of magnetic stripes! There is one long stripe with normal polarity, next to one long stripe with reversed polarity and so on across the ocean bottom. Another amazing feature is that the stripes are form mirror images on either side of the mid-ocean ridges. The ridge crest is of normal polarity and there are two stripes of reversed polarity of roughly equal width on each side of the ridge. Further distant are roughly equal stripes of normal polarity, beyond that, roughly equal stripes of reversed polarity, and so on. The magnetic polarity maps also show that the magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents, which are sometimes lined by a deep sea trench (Figure 6.10).

The scientists used geologic dating techniques to find the ages of the rocks that were found with the different magnetic polarities. It turns out that the rocks of normal polarity are located along the axis of the mid-ocean ridges and these are the youngest rocks on the seafloor. The ages of the rocks increases equally and symmetrically on both sides of the ridge.

Scientists also discovered that there are virtually no sediments on the seafloor at the axis, but the sediment layer increases in thickness in both directions away from the ridge axis. This was additional evidence that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis and that the rocks are older with distance away from the ridge (Figure 6.11). The scientists were surprised to find that oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old while the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old. They realized that some process was causing seafloor to be
created and destroyed in a relatively short time.

[[File:Earth seafloor crust age 1996.gif|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.11''': Seafloor is youngest near the mid-ocean ridges and gets progressively older with distance from the ridge. Orange areas show the youngest seafloor. The oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep sea trenches.]]
{{clear}}
The scientists also discovered that the seafloor was thinner at the ridge axis and grew thicker as the crust became older. This is because over time, additional magma cools to form rock. The added sediments also increase the thickness of the older crust.

==The Seafloor Spreading Hypothesis==
Scientists brought all of these observations together in the early 1960s to create the '''seafloor spreading''' hypothesis. They suggested that hot mantle material rises up toward the surface at mid-ocean ridges. This hot material is buoyant and causes the ridge to rise, which is one reason that mid-ocean ridges are higher than the rest of the seafloor.

The hot magma at the ridge erupts as lava that forms new seafloor. When the lava cools, its magnetite crystals take on the current magnetic polarity. The polarity is locked in when the lava solidifies and the magnetite crystals are trapped in position. Reversals show up as magnetic stripes on opposite sides of the ridge axis. As more lava erupts, it pushes the seafloor that is at the ridge horizontally away from ridge axis. This continues as the formation of new seafloor forces older seafloor to move horizontally away from the ridge axis.

The magnetic stripes continue across the seafloor. If the oceanic crust butts up against a continent, it pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well. If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it will sink into it and be lost into the mantle. In either case, the oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean.

It is the creation and destruction of oceanic crust, then, that is the mechanism for Wegener's drifting continents. Rather than drifting across the oceans, the continents ride on a conveyor belt of oceanic crust that takes them around the planet’s surface.

One of the fundamental lines of evidence for continental drift is the way the coastlines of continents on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean fit together. So let’s look at how seafloor spreading moves continents in the Atlantic by looking more closely at figure 3 above. New oceanic crust is forming at the mid-ocean ridge that runs through the center of the Atlantic Ocean basins, which is called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Stripes of different magnetic polarity are found on opposite sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These stripes go all the way to the continents, which lie on opposite sides of the Atlantic. So new seafloor forming at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is causing the Americas and Eurasia to move in opposite directions!

==Lesson Summary==
* Using technologies developed to fight World War II, scientists were able to gather data that allowed them to recognize that seafloor spreading is the mechanism for Wegener's drifting continents.
* Bathymetric maps revealed high mountain ranges and deep trenches.
* Magnetic polarity stripes give clues as to seafloor ages and the importance of mid-ocean ridges in the creation of oceanic crust.
* Seafloor spreading processes create new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and destroy older crust at deep sea trenches.

==Review Questions==
# Describe how sound waves are used to develop a map of the features of the seafloor.
# Why has no ocean crust been located that is older than about 180 million years when the oldest continental crust is about 4 billion years old?
# Describe the major features of mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and abyssal plains and their relative ages.
# Describe why continents move across the ocean basins as if they are on a conveyor belt rather than as if they are drifting, as was Wegener's original idea.
# Explain why the following scenario is impossible: Oceanic crust is not destroyed at oceanic trenches, but new crust is still created at mid-ocean ridges.
# If you were a paleontologist who studies fossils of very ancient life forms, where would be the best place to look for very old fossils: on land or in the oceans?
# Imagine that Earth's magnetic field was fixed in place and the polarity didn’t reverse. What effect would this have on our observations of seafloor basalts?

; mid-ocean ridge
: The location on the seafloor where magma upwells and new seafloor forms. Mid-ocean ridges are the dominant feature of divergent plate boundaries found in the oceans.
; seafloor spreading
: The mechanism for moving continents. The formation of new seafloor at spreading ridges pushes lithospheric plates on the Earth's surface.

==Points to Consider==
* How were the technologies that were developed to fight World War II used by scientists for the development of the seafloor spreading hypothesis?
* In what two ways did magnetic data lead scientists to understand more about continental drift and plate tectonics?
* How does seafloor spreading provide a mechanism for continental drift?
* The features of the Atlantic Ocean basin are described in terms of seafloor spreading and continental drift. Now look at the features of the North Pacific Ocean basin and explain them in those terms as well.

Wegener's continental drift hypothesis had a great deal of evidence in its favor but it was largely abandoned because his theory on how the continents moved was disproved. In the meantime, scientists developed explanations to explain the locations of fossils on widely different continents (land bridges) and the similarity of rock sequences across oceans (geosynclines), which were becoming more and more cumbersome. When seafloor spreading came along, scientists recognized that the mechanism to explain drifting continents had been found. Like the scientists did before us, we are now ready to merge the ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading into a new all-encompassing idea: the theory of plate tectonics.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe what a plate is and how scientists can recognize its edges.
* Explain how mantle convection moves lithospheric plates.
* Describe the three types of plate boundaries and whether they are prone to earthquakes and volcanoes.
* Describe how plate tectonics processes lead to changes in Earth's surface features.

==Earth's Tectonic Plates==
Now you know that seafloor and continents move around on Earth's surface. But what is it that is actually moving? In other words, what is the &quot;plate&quot; in plate tectonics? This question was also answered due to war, in this case the Cold War.

Although seismographs had been around for decades, during the 1950s and especially in the early 1960s, scientists set up seismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing atomic bombs. Seismographs record seismic waves. Modern seismographs are sensitive enough to detect nuclear explosions. While watching for enemy atom bomb tests, the seismographs were also recording all of the earthquakes that were taking place around the planet. These seismic records could be used to locate an earthquake's '''epicenter''', the point on Earth's surface directly above the place where the earthquake occurs. Earthquakes are associated with large cracks in the ground, known as '''faults'''. Rocks on opposite sides of a fault move in opposite directions.

Earthquakes are not spread evenly around the planet, but are found mostly in certain regions. In the oceans, earthquakes are found along mid-ocean ridges and in and around deep sea trenches. Earthquakes are extremely common all around the Pacific Ocean basin and often occur near volcanoes. The intensity of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions around the Pacific led scientists to name this region the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 6.12). Earthquakes are also common in the world's highest mountains, the Himalaya Mountains of Asia, and across the Mediterranean region.

[[File:Pacific Ring of Fire.png|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.12''': The bold pink swatch outlines the volcanoes and active earthquake areas found around the Pacific Ocean basin, which is called the Pacific Ring of Fire.]]

Scientists noticed that the earthquake epicenters were located along the mid-ocean ridges, trenches and large faults that mark the edges of large slabs of Earth's lithosphere (Figure 6.13). They named these large slabs of lithosphere '''plates'''. The movements of the plates were then termed plate tectonics. A single plate can be made of all oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere, but nearly all plates are made of a combination of both.

[[File:Quake epicenters 1963-98.png|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.13''': A map of earthquake epicenters shows that earthquakes are found primarily in lines that run up the edges of some continents, through the centers of some oceans, and in patches in some land areas.]]

The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. The plates' edges can be drawn by the connecting the dots that are earthquakes epicenters. Scientists have named each of the plates and have determined the direction that each is moving (Figure 6.14). Plates move around the Earth's surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate fingernails grow.

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|600px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.14''': The lithospheric plates and their names. The arrows show whether the plates are moving apart, moving together, or sliding past each other.]]

==How Plates Move==
We know that seafloor spreading moves the lithospheric plates around on Earth's surface but what drives seafloor spreading? The answer is in lesson one of this chapter: mantle convection. At this point it would help to think of a convection cell as a rectangle or oval. Each side of the rectangle is a limb of the cell. The convection cell is located in the mantle. The base is deep in the mantle and the top is near the crust. There is a limb of mantle material moving on one side of the rectangle, one limb moving horizontally across the top of the rectangle, one limb moving downward on the other side of the rectangle, and the final limb moving horizontally to where the material begins to move upward again.

Now picture two convection cells side-by-side in the mantle. The rising limbs of material from the two adjacent cells reach the base of the crust at the mid-ocean ridge. Some of the hot magma melts and creates new ocean crust. This seafloor moves off the axis of the mid-ocean ridge in both directions when still newer seafloor erupts. The oceanic plate moves outward due to the eruption of new oceanic crust at the mid-ocean ridge.

Beneath the moving crust is the laterally moving top limb of the mantle convection cells. Each convection cell is moving seafloor away from the ridge in opposite directions. This horizontal mantle flow moves with the crust across the ocean basin and away from the ridge. As the material moves horizontally, the seafloor thickens and both the new crust and the mantle beneath it cool. Where the limbs of the convection cells plunge down into the deeper mantle, oceanic crust is dragged into the mantle as well. This takes place at the deep sea trenches. As the crust dives into the mantle its weight drags along the rest of the plate and pulls it downward. The last limbs of the convection cells flow along the core. The material is heated and so is ready to rise again when it reaches the rising limb of the convection cell. As you can see, each convection cell is found beneath a different lithospheric plate and is responsible for the movement of that plate.

==Plate Boundaries==
Back at the planet's surface, the edges where two plates meet are known as '''plate boundaries'''. Most geologic activity, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, takes place at plate boundaries where two enormous pieces of solid lithosphere interact.

Think about two cars moving around a parking lot. In what three ways can those cars move relative to each other? They can move away from each other, they can move toward each other, or they can slide past each other. These three types of relative motion also define the three types of plate boundaries:
* '''Divergent plate boundaries''': the two plates move away from each other.
* '''Convergent plate boundaries''': the two plates move towards each other.
* '''Transform plate boundaries''': the two plates slip past each other.

What happens at plate boundaries depends on which direction the two plates are moving relative to each other. It also depends on whether the lithosphere on the two sides of the plate boundary is oceanic crust, continental crust, or one piece of each type. The type of plate boundary and the type of crust found on each side of the boundary determines what sort of geologic activity will be found there: earthquakes, volcanoes, or mountain building.

===Divergent Plate Boundaries===
Plates move apart, or diverge, at mid-ocean ridges where seafloor spreading forms new oceanic lithosphere. At these mid-ocean ridges, lava rises, erupts, and cools. Magma cools more slowly beneath the lava mostly forming the igneous intrusive rock gabbro. The entire ridge system, then, is igneous. Earthquakes are also common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust result in crustal shaking. Although the vast majority of mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea, we can see where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge surfaces at the volcanic island of Iceland (Figure 6.15).

[[File:Bridge across continents iceland.jpg|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.15''': The Leif the Lucky Bridge straddles the Mid-Atlantic ridge separating the North American and Eurasian plates on Iceland.]]

[[File:Greatrift.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 6.16''': The Arabian, Indian, and African plates are rifting apart, forming the Great Rift Valley in Africa. The Dead Sea fills the rift with seawater.]]

Although it is uncommon, a divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called '''continental rifting''' (Figure 6.16). Magma rises beneath the continent, causing it to thin, break, and ultimately split up. As the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust erupts in the void. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up. The East African Rift is currently splitting eastern Africa away from the African continent.

===Convergent Plate Boundaries===
[[File:Peru-Chile trench.jpg|right|250px|thumb|'''Figure 6.18''': This digital elevation model topographic map shows the trench lining the western margin of South America where the Nazca plate is subducting beneath the South American plate. The resulting Andes Mountains line western South America and are seen as brown and red uplands in this image.]]

What happens when two plates converge depends on the types of crust that are colliding. Convergence can take place between two slabs of continental lithosphere, two slabs of oceanic lithosphere, or between one continental and one oceanic slab. Most often, when two plates collide, one or both are destroyed.

When oceanic crust converges with continental crust, the denser oceanic plate plunges beneath the continental plate. This process occurs at the oceanic trenches and is called '''subduction''' (Figure 6.17). The entire region is known as a '''subduction zone'''. Subduction zones have a lot of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting plate causes melting in the mantle. The magma rises and erupts, creating volcanoes. These volcanoes are found in a line above the subducting plate. The volcanoes are known as a '''continental arc'''. The movement of crust and magma causes earthquakes. The Andes Mountains, which line the western edge of South America, are a continental arc. The volcanoes are the result of the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South American plate (Figure 6.18).

[[File:Active Margin.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.17''': Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate forms a line of volcanoes known as a continental arc and causes earthquakes.]]

The volcanoes of northeastern California&amp;mdash;Lassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Medicine Lake volcano&amp;mdash;along with the rest of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate (Figure 6.19). Mount St. Helens, which erupted explosively on May 18, 1980, is the most famous and currently the most active of the Cascades volcanoes.

[[File:Cascade Range related plate tectonics-en.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.19''': The Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are formed by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate. The Juan de Fuca plate forms near the shoreline at the Juan de Fuca ridge.]]

Sometimes the magma does not rise all the way through the continental crust beneath a volcanic arc. This usually happens if the magma is rich in silica. These viscous magmas form large areas of intrusive igneous rock, called '''batholiths''', which may someday be uplifted to form a mountain range. The Sierra Nevada batholith cooled beneath a volcanic arc roughly 200 million years ago (Figure 6.20). Similar batholiths are likely forming beneath the Andes and Cascades today.

[[File:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.20''': The granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range is well exposed here at Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the range at 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) and the second highest mountain in North America.]]

[[File:Oceanic-oceanic convergence Fig21oceanocean.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.21''': A convergent plate boundary subduction zone between two plates of oceanic lithosphere. Melting of the subducting plate causes volcanic activity and earthquakes.]]

When two oceanic plates converge, the older, denser plate will sink beneath the other plate and plunge into the mantle. As the plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts, which forms magma. As the magma rises it forms volcanoes in a line known as an '''island arc''', which is a line of volcanic islands (Figure 6.21).

The Japanese, Indonesian, and Philippine islands are examples of island arc volcanoes. The volcanic islands are set off from the mainland in an arc shape as seen in this satellite image of Japan (Figure 6.22).

[[File:Satellite image of Japan in May 2003.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.22''': Japan is an island arc composed of volcanoes off the Asian mainland, as seen in this satellite image.]]

[[File:Continental-continental convergence Fig21contcont.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.23''': When two plates of continental crust collide, the material pushes upward forming a high mountain range. The remnants of subducted oceanic crust remain beneath the continental convergence zone.]]

When two continental plates collide, they are too thick to subduct. Just like if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together, the material has nowhere to go but up (Figure 6.23)! Some of the world's largest mountains ranges are created at continent-continent convergent plate boundaries. In these locations, the crust is too thick for magma to penetrate so there are no volcanoes, but there may be magma. Metamorphic rocks are common due to the stress the continental crust experiences. As you might think, with enormous slabs of crust smashing together, continent-continent collisions bring on numerous earthquakes.

The world's highest mountains, the Himalayas, are being created by a collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Figure 6.24). The Appalachian Mountains are the remnants of a large mountain range that was created when North America rammed into Eurasia about 250 million years ago.

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.24''': The Himalaya Mountains are the result of the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate, seen in this photo from the International Space Station. The high peak in the center is world's tallest mountain, Mount Everest (8,848 meters; 29,035 feet).]]

===Transform Plate Boundaries===
[[File:Sanandreas.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 6.25''': At the San Andreas Fault in California, the Pacific Plate is sliding northeast relative to the North  American plate, which is moving southwest. At the northern end of the picture, the transform boundary turns into a subduction zone.]]

Transform plate boundaries are seen as '''transform faults'''. At these earthquake faults, two plates move past each other in opposite directions. Where transform faults bisect continents, there are massive earthquakes. The world's most notorious transform fault is the 1,300 kilometer (800 mile) long San Andreas Fault in California (Figure 6.25). This is where the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other, sometimes with disastrous consequences.

California is very geologically active. A transform plate boundary creates the San Andreas Fault. A convergent plate boundary between an oceanic plate and a continental plate creates the Cascades volcanoes. Just offshore, the Juan de Fuca ridge is subducting beneath the North American plate at a divergent plate boundary.

==Earth's Changing Surface==
Geologists now know that Wegener was right when he said that the continents had once been joined into the supercontinent Pangaea and are now moving apart. Most of the geologic activity that we see on the planet today is due to the interactions of the moving plates. Where plates come apart at a divergent boundary, there is volcanic activity and small earthquakes. If the plates meet at a convergent boundary, and at least one is oceanic, there is a chain of volcanoes and many earthquakes. If both plates at a convergent boundary are continental, mountain ranges grow. If the plates meet at a transform boundary, there is a transform fault. These faults do not have volcanic activity but they have massive earthquakes.

If you look at a map showing the locations of volcanoes and earthquakes in North America, you will see that the plate boundaries are now along the western edge. This geologically active area makes up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. California, with its volcanoes and earthquakes, is an important part of this region. The eastern edge of North America is currently mostly quiet, although mountain ranges line the area. If there is no plate boundary there today, where did those mountains come from?

Remember that Wegener used the similarity of the mountains in eastern North America, on the west side of the Atlantic, and the mountains in Great Britain, on the eastern side of the Atlantic, as evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. These mountains were formed at a convergent plate boundary as the continents that made up Pangaea came together. So about 200 million years ago these mountains were similar to the Himalaya today (Figure 6.26)!

[[File:Appalachians NC BLRI9242.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.26''': The Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America were probably once as high as the Himalaya, but they have aged since the breakup of Pangaea.]]

Before the continents collided they were separated by an ocean, just as the continents rimming the Pacific are now. That ocean crust had to subduct beneath the continents just as the oceanic crust around the Pacific is being subducted today. Subduction along the eastern margin of North America produced continental arc volcanoes. Ancient lava from those volcanoes can be found in the region.

Currently, Earth's most geologically active area is around the Pacific. The Pacific is shrinking at the same time the Atlantic is growing. But hundreds of millions of years ago, that was reversed: the Atlantic was shrinking as the Pacific was growing. What we’ve just identified is a cycle, known as the '''supercontinent cycle''', which is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone. Scientists think that the creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years.

==Intraplate Activity==
While it is true that most geological activity takes place along plate boundaries, some is found away from the edges of plates. This is known as '''intraplate activity'''. The most common intraplate volcanoes are above hotspots that lie beneath oceanic plates. Hotspot volcanoes arise because plumes of hot material that come from deep in the mantle rise through the overlying mantle and crust. When the magma reaches the plate above, it erupts, forming a volcano. Since the hotspot is stable, when the oceanic plate moves over it, and it erupts again, another volcano is created in line with the first. With time, there is a line of volcanoes; the youngest is directly above the hot spot and the oldest is furthest away. Recent research suggests that hotspots are not as stable as scientists once thought, but some larger ones still appear to be.

The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a chain of hotspot volcanoes. Kilauea volcano on the south side of the Big Island of Hawaii lies above the Hawaiian hot spot. The Big Island is on the southeastern end of the Hawaiian chain. Mauna Loa volcano, to the northwest, is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a lower rate. Hawaii is the youngest island in the chain. As you follow the chain to the west, the islands get progressively older because they are further from the hotspot (Figure 6.27).

[[File:Hawaii hotspot poster.jpg|center|frame|This view of the Hawaiian islands showing the youngest islands in the southeast and the oldest in the northwest. Kilauea volcano, which makes up the southeastern side of the Big Island of Hawaiian, is located above the Hawaiian hotspot.]]

The chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts, which are so old they no longer reach above sea level. The oldest of the Emperor seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian trench off of Alaska; no one knows how many older volcanoes have already subducted. It's obvious from looking at the Emperor seamounts that the Pacific plate took a large turn. Radiometric dating has shown that turn to have taken place about 43 million years ago (Figure 6.28). The Hawaii hotspot may also have been moving southward during this time. Still, geologists can use some hotspot chains to tell not only the direction but the speed a plate is moving.

[[File:Pacific elevation.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.28''': The Hawaii-Emperor chain creates a large angular gash across the Pacific basin in this satellite image. The bend in the chain is due to a change in the direction of motion of the Pacific plate 43 million years ago.]]

Hot spots are also found under the continental crust, although it is more difficult for the magma to make it through the thick crust and there are few eruptions. One exception is Yellowstone, which creates the activity at the Yellowstone hotspot. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions, but now its activity is best seen in the region's famous geysers.

==Lesson Summary==
* Driven by mantle convection, the plates of lithosphere move around Earth’s surface. New oceanic crust forms at the ridge and pushes the older seafloor away from the ridge horizontally.
* Plates interact at three different types of plate boundaries, divergent, convergent and transform fault boundaries, which are where most of the Earth’s geologic activity takes place.
* These processes acting over long periods of time are responsible for the geographic features we see.

==Review Questions==
# What are the three types of plate boundaries? For each type, what sort of geologic activity do you find?
# As a working geologist, you come across a landscape with a massive fault zone that produces lots of large earthquakes, but has no volcanoes. What type of plate boundary have you come across? What are the movements of plates relative to each other at this type of boundary? Where would you find a plate boundary of this type in California?
# You continue on your geologic tour to a location where there is a chain of volcanoes on land, but not too far inland from the edge of the continent. The region experiences frequent large earthquakes. What type of plate boundary have you come across? What types of plates are involved? Where would you find a plate boundary of this type in California?
# What is the driving force behind the movement of lithospheric plates on the Earth's surface? About how fast do the plates move?
# How does the theory of plate tectonics explain the locations of volcanoes, earthquakes and mountain belts on Earth?
# Thinking about the different types of plate boundaries, explain why continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust.
# Why are there few (if any) volcanoes along transform plate boundaries?

* Now that you know about plate tectonics, where do you think would be a safe place to live if you wanted to avoid volcanic eruptions and earthquakes?

We will compute the derivative and show that it is always &lt;math&gt;g'(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative of &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the quotient rule to be
&lt;math&gt;g'(x)=\frac{xf'(x)-f(x)}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The denominator is clearly always positive as we know it is the square of some real number &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so in order to show that the entire derivative is always positive we need to show that the numerator is positive.

However, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{x}\leq f'(x) \Leftrightarrow xf'(x)-f(x) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and we know that, by the mean value theorem there is some &lt;math&gt;c \in (0,x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{x}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing it must be that &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \geq \frac{f(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;xf'(x)-f(x) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and so the derivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is positive, which implies that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing.



==11== 

Since the denominator of 
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2}&lt;/math&gt;
goes to zero as &lt;math&gt;h \to 0&lt;/math&gt; we can employ L'Hopital's rule. Using this we get  
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2 h}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the denominator is again zero we apply L'Hopital's rule again
&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f''(x+h)+f''(x-h)}{2 }&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; = f''(x) &lt;/math&gt;


An example of a function that is not differentiable, but where this limit exists is 
&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} 0 &amp; x \leq 0 \\ x^2  &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;
The second derivative of this function does not exist at zero, as 
&lt;math&gt; f'(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} 0 &amp; x \leq 0 \\ 2x  &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;
however we can compute the above limit at zero by
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h^2}{h^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;

==14==

A function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be convex if
&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda  + (1- \lambda) y ) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y) &lt;/math&gt;

First we shall prove (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; monotonically increasing implies &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex.


Assume &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing. Let &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt; z&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. The mean value theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;\exists c \in (x,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(c)=\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;\exists d \in (y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(d)=\frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, since &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be monotonically increasing we have 
&lt;math&gt;f'(c) \leq f'(d) \Rightarrow \frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt;y\in(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;y=\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, we have
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z)}{z-\lambda x- (1-\lambda)z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ z-\lambda z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)}{z-\lambda x - z + \lambda z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ z-\lambda z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)}{-\lambda x  + \lambda z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda (z-x)  \left( f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) \left(  z - x  \right)&lt;/math&gt;
We note here that the direction of the inequality is preserved since we have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-\lambda &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (*)
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  \left( f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  \left( f(\lambda x+ z(1 -  \lambda))-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(\lambda x+ z(1 -  \lambda))- \lambda  f(x)  \leq f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  -\lambda f(z)+ \lambda f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  &lt;/math&gt;
reducing yields
&lt;math&gt; - \lambda  f(x)  \leq f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  -\lambda f(z)   &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow - \lambda  f(x) -f(z) + \lambda f(z)   \leq -f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(x) + f(z) - \lambda f(z)  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
but since the initial choice of &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt; was arbitrary (up to ordering) this holds for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt;. We must still address the case corresponding to &lt;math&gt;x&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. This is easy though.

For let &lt;math&gt;x&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Then by what we have proven already
&lt;math&gt; \lambda  f(z) + f(x)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda z+ x(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
now let &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1-\lambda&lt;/math&gt; so it follows from the above that
&lt;math&gt; ( 1-\alpha)  f(z) + f(x)(1 - 1+ \alpha )  \geq f((1-\alpha )z+ x(1  - 1+\alpha )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow ( 1-\alpha)  f(z) + \alpha f(x)  \geq f((1-\alpha )z+ \alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;

Thus if &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing
&lt;math&gt;\lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now we prove (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; convex implies &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing.


The proof of this direction follows similarly to the previous. Let's assume &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex.

Then
&lt;math&gt; \lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt; x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; (Note: we must have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; by (*)) and &lt;math&gt;x,z \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Following the previous reasoning in reverse we see that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in (x,z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

So in the limit &lt;math&gt;y \to x&lt;/math&gt; we have 
&lt;math&gt; f'(x) \leq \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x}&lt;/math&gt; 
and in the limit &lt;math&gt;y \to z&lt;/math&gt; we have 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x} \leq f'(z) &lt;/math&gt;
thus, combining these statements we have
&lt;math&gt; f'(x) \leq \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x}  \leq f'(z) &lt;/math&gt;
so &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing as desired.

Now it only remains to prove that (assuming &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex if and only if &lt;math&gt;f''(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing by the previous proof. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f''\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; (proved in class).

So we have shown that (assuming &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex if and only if &lt;math&gt;f''(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

By page 121 we know that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must be bounded, say by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. We need to show that given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_c^1 f(x) dx \in B_\epsilon \left( \int_0^1 f(x) dx \right).&lt;/math&gt;So, by Theorem 6.12 (c) we have &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \int_0^c f(x) dx + \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_0^c f(x) dx \leq M \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx \leq M \cdot c + \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; but since we can choose any &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is fixed we can choose &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\epsilon}{2M}&lt;/math&gt; which yields &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2}+ \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; So, given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; we can always choose a &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_c^1 f(x) dx \in B_\epsilon \left( \int_0^1 f(x) dx \right)&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

Considered the function which is defined to be &lt;math&gt;n (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; on the last &lt;math&gt;6/(n^2\pi^2)&lt;/math&gt; of the interval [0,1] and zero at those &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=6/(n^2\pi^2)&lt;/math&gt;. This function is well defined, since we know that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty 6/(n^2\pi^2) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. 

More specifically the function has value &lt;math&gt;n(-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; on the open interval from &lt;math&gt;(p_n=1-\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 6/(m^2\pi^2),p_{n+1}=1-\sum_{m=1}^n 6/(m^2\pi^2))&lt;/math&gt;

First we evaluate the integral of the function itself. Consider a partitioning of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; at each &lt;math&gt;p_n \pm \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the lower and upper sums corresponding to the intervals of the partition from &lt;math&gt;p_n - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1} + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are the same, since the function is constant valued on these intervals. Moreover, as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; the value of the upper and lower sums both approach &lt;math&gt;n (-1)^n(p_{n+1}-p_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we can express the value of the integral as the sum of the series
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)n (-1)^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(-1)^n 6}{n\pi^2}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; =\frac{6}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(-1)^n }{n}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
but we recognize this sum as just a constant multiple of the alternating harmonic series. Hence, the integral converges.

Now we examine the integral of the absolute value of the function. We argue similarly to the above, again partitioning the function at &lt;math&gt;p_n\pm \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as defined above. The difference is that now, as we let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; the upper and lower sums both go to 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)n  = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{ 6}{n\pi^2}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;  = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \frac{ 1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
and so the integral does not exist, as this is the harmonic series, which does not converge.

In the above proof of divergence the important point is that the lower sums diverge. The fact that the upper sums diverge is an immediate consequence of this.

So, we have demonstrated a function whose integral converges, but does not converge absolutely as desired.

==8==

We begin by showing (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;math&gt;) that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges.

So, we assume to start that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges. Now consider the partition &lt;math&gt;P=\{p_n\ |\ p_n=n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; decreases monotonically it must be that &lt;math&gt;inf\{f([p_n,p_{n+1}])\}=f(p_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; and similarly that &lt;math&gt;sup\{f([p_n,p_{n+1}])\}=f(p_{n})&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the integral which we are trying to evaluate is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; and below by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now we observe that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; may be written as a sum over the domain as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \int_{p_n}^{p_{n+1}} f(x) dx \right)&lt;/math&gt; We know moreover that each of these integrals exist, by Theorem 6.9. Also, since &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is always positive each such integral must be positive. Therefore, the integral may be expressed as a sum of a nonnegative series which is bounded above. Hence, by Theorem 3.24 the integral exists.

Now we prove (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that if &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges then  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges.

So assume now that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges. Then we can prove that the summation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Cauchy criterion. We established above &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=k}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; and below by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=K+1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that given a sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=K+1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; it is bounded above by the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, since the integral  &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; exists and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is nonegative we know that it has the property given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0\  \exists M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_M^\infty f(x) dx&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. For otherwise the integral would not exist and instead tend to infinity.

So now we can apply the Cauchy criterion for series. Since an upper bound of the series has the property that given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0\  \exists M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_M^\infty f(x) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. So must the series itself have this property.

Thus, the sum converges as desired.

We will prove that If  &lt;math&gt;u\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 
&lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
and that equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
\begin{proof}
We begin by proving the special case of equality

Assume that &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow u=v^{q/p}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^{q/p+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^{q/p+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu =v^{q(1/p+1/q)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
(Similarly we can show that &lt;math&gt;vu=u^p \Leftrightarrow u^p=v^q &lt;/math&gt;.)
Thus, &lt;math&gt;vu=v^q \Leftrightarrow u^p=v^q &lt;/math&gt; and we see moreover that 
&lt;math&gt;uv = \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q} \Leftarrow vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
since in this case we have 
&lt;math&gt;uv = v^q \left( \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q} \right) \checkmark &lt;/math&gt;
Also, if it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt; then it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;uv \neq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt; as for a sum of quotients by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; to not contain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; we must have the numerators equal.


Now we show that as we vary &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; we must always have &lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;. For, compute the derivative of &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. We get &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. If we have &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt; then these are equal as demonstrated above (we showed that &lt;math&gt;u v = u^p&lt;/math&gt; in that case). In the case that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is larger than this value then &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and in the case that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is less than this value then &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&lt;v&lt;/math&gt;. 

This argument can be repeated in an analogous manner for variations in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and given any &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; we can find values for which &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, we observe that 
&lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
as desired\end{proof}

If &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f^p d\alpha = 1 = \int_a^b g^q d\alpha, &lt;/math&gt;
then
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f g d\alpha \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
\begin{proof}

If &lt;math&gt;0 \leq f \in \mathcal{R} (\alpha) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^q&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; by Theorem 6.11. Also, we have &lt;math&gt;f g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; so we get
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f g d\alpha \leq \frac{1}{p} \int_a^b f^p d \alpha + \frac{1}{q} \int_a^b g^q d\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt;
as desired.\end{proof}


===c===

We prove H\&quot;older's inequality
\begin{proof}
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are complex valued then we get 
&lt;math&gt;\left|\int_a^b f g d\alpha \right| \leq \int_a^b |f||g| d\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|^p \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|g|^q \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; then applying the previous part to the functions &lt;math&gt;|f|/c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g|/d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c^p=\int_a^b|g|^q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^q = \int_a^b|g|^q &lt;/math&gt; gives what we wanted to show.

&lt;math&gt;\left| \int_a^b f g d \alpha  \right| \leq \left( \int_a^b |f|^p d\alpha  \right) ^{1/p}+ \left( \int_a^b |g|^q d\alpha  \right) ^{1/q}&lt;/math&gt;

However, if one of the above is zero (say without loss of generality 
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|^p =0&lt;/math&gt; then we just have 
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|(c|g|)d\alpha \leq c^q \frac{1}{q}\int_a^b|g|^q d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit &lt;math&gt;c \to 0 &lt;/math&gt; we observe that the inequality is still true.

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f||g| d\alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt;

\end{proof}

We take the expression &lt;math&gt;s \int_1^\infty \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt; and express it as a sum of integrals on the intervals &lt;math&gt;(n,n+1)&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;s \left( \int_1^2 \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx + \int_2^3 \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx + \dots  \right) &lt;/math&gt; but since each such interval &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; is the same, we just write &lt;math&gt;s \left( \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx + \int_2^3 \frac{2}{x^{s+1}} dx + \dots  \right) &lt;/math&gt;(1)

Now we exploit the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, computing &lt;math&gt;\int_n^{n+1} \frac{n}{x^{s+1}} dx= n \left[ -\frac{x^{-s}}{s} \right]_n^{n+1}=n \left( -\frac{(n+1)^{-s}}{s} +\frac{n^{-s}}{s}\right).&lt;/math&gt; So, the summation in Equation 1 can, more explicitly be written as &lt;math&gt; s \sum_{n=1}^\infty n \left( -\frac{(n+1)^{-s}}{s} +\frac{n^{-s}}{s}\right)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \left( \frac{n}{n^{s}} -\frac{n}{(n+1)^{s}} \right)&lt;/math&gt; However, grouping common denominators, we observe that the sum partially telescopes to yield more simply &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}= \zeta(s).&lt;/math&gt;

===b===

Having now proved  Part a it suffices to show that  &lt;math&gt; s \int_1^\infty \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx = \frac{s}{s-1} - s \int_1^\infty \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx.&lt;/math&gt;


By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we have &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^s} dx=\frac{1}{s-1}&lt;/math&gt; So
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_1^\infty \frac{x}{x^{s+1}} dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \frac{x}{x^{s+1}} dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \left( \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} + \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} \right) dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \left( \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} + \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} \right) dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty  \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx &amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1} -  s \int_1^\infty  \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx\\
\end{eqnarray*}
as desired\ 

end part b 

It remains now to show that the integral in Part \ref{2} converges.

Since for &lt;math&gt;x \in (1,\infty)&lt;math&gt; we have
&lt;math&gt;0 \leq  \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} \leq \frac{1}{x^{s+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
we know that
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges.

However, 
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges by the integral test (Problem 8) since we have already shown that the sequence
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
is convergent for &lt;math&gt;1&lt;s&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Summons and Appearance Notice */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A person can be compelled to attend court to face criminal charges in several ways. It starts with the police. They investigate a crime and at some point they suspect an individual is responsible.

The police start by doing one of three things:
# serve an appearance notice on the accused; 
# arrest the accused; or
# lay a charge and issue a warrant or summons

These are not mutually exclusive actions but rather first steps. 

Where the person is given an appearance notice, they are simply served with a document directing them to attend court.

Where the person is arrested first, the police will decide whether to lay a charge. If a charge will be layed the police can do one of the following:
# hold him for court without release 
# release him using a summons, Appearance Notice, Promise to Appear (with or without an undertaking), or Recognizance (with or without an undertaking)

If they are held for court, the issue of release will be left to the judge to determine.

Where the charge is layed first, the warrant or summons gives authority to the police to locate the individual for the purpose of arresting them to serving them with notice to attend court.

==Attendance without Arrest==

===Appearance Notice===
Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec496 s. 495(2)], a police officer who forms grounds of arrest pursuant to s. 495(1), shall not arrest the individual to ensure that they will attend court where:
# where the offence is one under [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec553# s. 553], a summary, or hybrid offence, and 
# where the officer &quot;believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest...may be satisfied without so arresting the person&quot; while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
## establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or
## prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, and 
# he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.

If the officer does not arrest due to s. 495(2), then under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec496 s. 496], the officer &quot;may issue an appearance notice to the person&quot;

==Attendance on Release from a Warrantless Arrest==
Police officers have a number of options to release an accused subsequent to their arrest but without having to have the accused attend court for a bail hearing. The options consist of the following:
# summons or appearance notice
# promise to appear or recognizance (with or without an undertaking)

===Summons and Appearance Notice===
If the officer believes there is grounds to make a warrantless arrest under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec495 s. 495(1)], after concluding that s. 495(2) does not apply, then under s. 497, the officer must release the accused &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; on a summons (s. 497(1)(a)) or a appearance notice (s. 497(1)(b)), if the offence  for summary, hybrid or [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec553# s. 553] offences,  person, unless, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec497 s. 497(1.1)], the officer &quot;believes, on reasonable grounds&quot; that:
#either:
## &quot;it is necessary in the public interest that the person be detained in custody&quot; or 
## &quot;that the matter of their release from custody be dealt with under another provision of this Part&quot;
#while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
##establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence,
##prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, or
##ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence; or
#&quot;that if the person is released from custody, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.&quot;

Under s. 497(2), these rules do not apply where the accused is arrested without a warrant for an offence in a different province (as referenced in s. 503(3)).

Also, the officer should not release if he believes that the person may fail to attend court or where the offence described in s.503(3)--discusses offences outside of the jurisdiction.

Where the officer does not release the accused then they will be brought before a judge to determine if interim release will be granted.

An appearance notice is defined in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec493 s. 493] as &quot;a notice in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 9] issued by a peace officer&quot;.

A summons is defined in s. 493 as &quot;a summons in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 6] issued by a justice or judge;&quot;

===Promise to Appear or Recognizance===
If the officer believes there is grounds to make a warrantless arrest under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec495 s. 495(1)], after concluding that s. 495(2) does not apply, and, the officer does not release on an appearance notice or summons under s. 497, then, the officer must release under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec498 s. 498] on a summons, a promise to appear or recognizance (without surety) once there is no further reason to detain the accused, if the offence  for summary, hybrid or 553 offences, or any offence with a maximum penalty of five year jail and is not currently subject to a release process.  That is, unless, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec498 s. 498(1.1)], the officer &quot;believes, on reasonable grounds&quot; that:
#either:
## &quot;it is necessary in the public interest that the person be detained in custody&quot; or 
## &quot;that the matter of their release from custody be dealt with under another provision of this Part&quot;
#while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
##establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence,
##prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, or
##ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence; or
#&quot;that if the person is released from custody, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.&quot;

A promise to appear is defined in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec493 s. 493] as requiring Form 10. It shall include the accused's name, the substance of the offence, a demand to attend court at a stated time and place.([[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec501 s. 501(1)])

Under s. 503(2.1), any promise to appear or recognizance can be made to include conditions, including:
*to remain within a territorial jurisdiction,
*to notify the officer of any change of address, employment, or occupation,
*to abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with certain individuals,
*to abstain from attending certain locations,
*to deposit their passport,
*to abstain from possessing any firearm and to surrender any firearms licenses,
*to report at certain times to the police,
*to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances,
*to abstain from the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, and
*to comply with any other condition the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim or witness.

===Undertaking to an Officer in Charge===
If an officer has grounds to make a warrantless arrest under s. 495 and the accused is not released under s. 497 or 498, then there is a general discretion under s. 503(2) to release the accused from custody &quot;conditionally&quot; by either a promise to appear or recognizance for any offences except 496 offences. Under s. 503(2.1), the officer may further require the accused to enter into an undertaking, which can have one or more of the following conditions:
*to remain within a territorial jurisdiction,
*to notify the officer of any change of address, employment, or occupation,
*to abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with certain individuals,
*to abstain from attending certain locations,
*to deposit their passport,
*to abstain from possessing any firearm and to surrender any firearms licenses,
*to report at certain times to the police,
*to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances,
*to abstain from the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, and
*to comply with any other condition the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim or witness.

Failure to comply with the undertaking is a criminal offence.

The form of the undertaking should conform to [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 11.1] of the Criminal Code.

====Varying Conditions====
Conditions in place from an undertaking to an officer in charge can be modified at any point under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec499 s. 499(3)] and [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec497 497(1.1)], as well as 503(1.1) for the Defence and 503(1.2) for the Crown. The modification does not need the consent of the crown.


===Attendance from release===
If an accused is released by summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, recognizance, or undertaking, as discussed above, and the accused fails to attend on the date specified, the justice may issue a warrant under s. 502 for the arrest of the accused. The warrant may be &quot;endorsed&quot; pursuant to s. 507(6) otherwise the warrant will be considered &quot;unendorsed&quot;.

If the accused attends before the justice, at which point the information will have been laid, the judge will either confirm the &quot;process&quot; (that is, the release mechanism used to compel attendance) or else will cancel it under s. 508.


==Release upon Warrant Arrest==
Where an officer is arresting an accused person on a warrant sections 499 and 503 governs.

===Endorsed Warrant===
Under s. 499(1), where the warrant for arrest was endorsed for release pursuant to s. 507(6) and the offence is not a 469 offence, the officer may do any of the following:
# &quot;release the person on the person's giving a promise to appear&quot;; 
# &quot;release the person on the person’s entering into a recognizance before the officer in charge without sureties in the amount not exceeding five hundred dollars that the officer in charge directs, but without deposit of money or other valuable security&quot;; or
#if the person is not ordinarily resident in the province in which the person is in custody or does not ordinarily reside within two hundred kilometres of the place in which the person is in custody, release the person on the person’s entering into a recognizance before the officer in charge without sureties in the amount not exceeding five hundred dollars that the officer in charge directs and, if the officer in charge so directs, on depositing with the officer in charge such sum of money or other valuable security not exceeding in amount or value five hundred dollars, as the officer in charge directs.

The officer may also impose conditions specified in s. 499(2):
{{quotation|
'''Additional conditions'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In addition to the conditions for release set out in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c), the officer in charge may also require the person to enter into an undertaking in Form 11.1 in which the person, in order to be released, undertakes to do one or more of the following things:
:(a) to remain within a territorial jurisdiction specified in the undertaking;
:(b) to notify a peace officer or another person mentioned in the undertaking of any change in his or her address, employment or occupation;
:(c) to abstain from communicating, directly or indirectly, with any victim, witness or other person identified in the undertaking, or from going to a place specified in the undertaking, except in accordance with the conditions specified in the undertaking;
:(d) to deposit the person’s passport with the peace officer or other person mentioned in the undertaking;
:(e) to abstain from possessing a firearm and to surrender any firearm in the possession of the person and any authorization, licence or registration certificate or other document enabling that person to acquire or possess a firearm;
:(f) to report at the times specified in the undertaking to a peace officer or other person designated in the undertaking;
:(g) to abstain from
::(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or
::(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription; and
:(h) to comply with any other condition specified in the undertaking that the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence.
...&lt;P&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec499 CCC]
}}

===Unendorsed Warrant===
Under s. 503, an officer arresting someone on a warrant may either detain them in custody to be brought to a justice within 24 hours or, release the person &quot;conditionally&quot; on a promise to appear or recognizance.

==Laying an Information==
At some point after the initial arrest and before the first appearance for arraignment, the peace officer is expected to prepare an Information and swear the information before a justice of the peace. The officer will give sworn evidence that they had reasonable ground to believe that the offence had been committed by the accused.

This can be done at any time prior to the first appearance for arraignment so long as it is within the time limit for the offence (6 months if summary offence).

See more at [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Informations and Indictments]]

==Confirming Attendance==
Once the accused attends for the first time in court, the authority of the justice of the peace or peace officer is complete and only the judge may compel future attendance. The purpose of a promise to appear, summons, or any other tool to ensure attendance is to secure attendance for the first time. After the initial appearance the promise to appear is irrelevant.&lt;ReF&gt;R v Oliveria  at 30&lt;br&gt;&lt;/reF&gt;

Whenever a judge had an information before him, he must comply with section 508. Section 508(b)(i) would appear to require that judges confirm that the notice, promise to appear or recognizance remains in effect and then endorse the information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Key, 2011 ONCJ 780 - detailed review of cases&lt;/ref&gt;

However, case law has been divergent on the issue of whether the failure to confirm the order to return to court creates a nullity, invalidating the information. While there are a number of cases supporting the nullity effect on the lack of confirmation,&lt;ref&gt;
eg. R. v. Koshino, [1991] O.J. No. 173 (Gen. Div.), R. v. Sandoval, [2000] O.J. No. 5591 (S.C.J.),  R. v. Smith, [2008] O.J. No. 381 (S.C.J.), R. v. Pilieci (2010), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. S.C.J.).&lt;/ref&gt; there is a growing line of cases that see it as having no effect on the validity of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rennie, [2004] O.J. No. 4990 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pavlick, [2008] O.J. No. 2114 (S.C.J.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sullivan, [2009] O.J. No. 5075 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Duran, 2011 ONSC 7346&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Morton (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 625 (Ont. Gen. Div.), affirmed, (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 95 (Ont. 
C.A.). &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Matykubov,[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2010/2010oncj233/2010oncj233.html 2010 ONCJ 233]&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Wetmore (1976), 18 N.S.R. (2d) 292 (N.S.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused was properly ordered to attend court and failed to, the court may issue a warrant for their arrest under s. 524:
{{quotation|
'''Issue of warrant for arrest of accused'''&lt;br&gt;
524. (1) Where a justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an accused
:(a) has contravened or is about to contravene any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance that was issued or given to him or entered into by him, or
:(b) has committed an indictable offence after any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance was issued or given to him or entered into by him, he may issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Arrest of accused without warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a peace officer who believes on reasonable grounds that an accused
:(a) has contravened or is about to contravene any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance that was issued or given to him or entered into by him, or
:(b) has committed an indictable offence after any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance was issued or given to him or entered into by him, may arrest the accused without warrant.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec524 CCC]
}}


{{reflist|2}}

= Judicial Interim Release (Bail) =
If the peace officer does not release the accused, then under s. 503 they must present the accused before a justice within 24 hours to consider whether to release the accused under s. 515.

=Ruy Lopez:Riga Variation=

White has chosen to move the king to h1, replying to the bishop attack on h2.

Black still has queen under threat and knight pinned, as well as bishop possibly hanging. The only way to address this is [[/10...Qh4|10...Qh4]], threatening checkmate. Alternatives leave things hanging. 

Taking with [[/10...bxc6|10...bxc6]] invites a king and rook fork after 11.Bxc6+. After 11...Bd7, white can also choose to play 12.Bxd5 and pile more pressure on the pinned knight white leaving the option open to take the hanging bishop. 

[[/10...Qd7|10...Qd7]] sets up a queen trade with a win of a pawn for white and the end of black's attack. This continuation may go 10...Qd7 11.Qxd5 Qxd5 12.Nb4+ Kf8 13.Nxd5 Be6 14.Rxe4 Bxd5 15.Rd4 Be6. After the queen trade, black has two pieces hanging, and cannot save both.

=Ruy Lopez:Riga Variation=

Black now threatens the weak f2 square with both knight and queen, threatening checkmate.

If white does not deal with the threat sufficiently, or plays an ineffectual move, black may be able to win with the following lines:

*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Ke3 Qh6+ 16.Kd3 Nxf2#
*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Kd3 Nxf2+ 16.Ke3 Nxd1+
*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Kd3 Nxf2+ 16.Kd2 Qh6+ 17.Re3 Nxd1

Moves that would inhibit this are [[/11. Rxe4|11.Rxe4]], removing black's control over the f2 square, 11.Bg5, threatening black's queen, and any move of the c6 knight, delivering discovered check.

It turns out, however, that only [[/11. Rxe4|11.Rxe4]] can keep white ahead. 11.Bg5 Qxg5 12.Qxd5 Qxd5 13.Nb4+ leaves black up substantially, though it will win back the queen. Knight moves allow 11...Kf8, unpinning black's knight and more or less forcing a following 12.Rxe4.

= Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation =

This move order is a common transpositional tool for Scheveningen players to avoid the [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...e6/6._g4|Keres Attack]], which is reached from 6.g4 from a standard Scheveningen position. While it initially follows the Najdorf move order, the e6 push is more characteristic of the Scheveningen than the Najdorf, where black often plays a direct e7-e5 push.

Note that here, white can choose to follow up with [[/7. g4|7. g4]], but this line is referred to as the Perenyi Attack rather than the Keres Attack. This is because now that a6 controls the b5 square, black can play 7...e5 without fear of 8.Bb5+. Normally, in the Keres Attack, that would result in a trade of light squared bishops. But in this case, black now has two attackers on the exposed g4 pawn, where there is only one defender, the white queen. Further, 7...e5 threatens the d4 knight, so simply moving 8.h3 to protect the g pawn drops the knight. White's move, therefore, in the mainline Perenyi Attack, is 8.Nf5, cutting off the bishop's assault on g4 while moving the knight to temporary safety.

= Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation, Perenyi Attack =

The Perenyi Attack is similar in idea to its cousin the [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...e6/6._g4|Keres Attack]] of the standard Scheveningen Variation. White mounts an aggressive pawn storm on the kingside, castling long and supporting with Qd2 and Be3. However, it usually arises from a transposition from the Najdorf rather than the normal Scheveningen move order. Compared to the Keres, white has his bishop already developed to the e3 square while black has a pawn on a6 rather than a7.

The differences are subtle but critical. Now, the standard line of the Perenyi attack follows with [[/7...e5|7...e5]]. This puts two attackers on the advanced g4 pawn (which only has the queen defending) and threatens the d4 knight. If this were the Keres, white could play Bb5+ Bd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7, which eliminates one attacker on g4. Then Nb3 moves the knight to safety. However, Bb5+ is not an option here because of the a6 pawn. 

Therefore, play usually continues 8.Nf5 (cutting off the bishop's attack on the g4 pawn and moving the knight away). Black then threatens the knight with 8...g6. At this point, play becomes very complex and sharp. White cannot move the knight away without losing the g4 pawn, and so usually chooses to sacrifice it. White can try to win back a knight with 9.g5 gxf5 10.gxf6, or sacrifice it with 9.g5 gxf5 10.exf5 Ng8 11.f6, boxing in black's kingside pieces. Alternatively, white can develop with 9.Bg2. This leads to a very complex line mostly found in top level chess: 9...gxf5 10.exf5 d5 11.Qe2 d4 12.O-O-O.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tiger hash ==
The Tiger hash processes data in 512-bit blocks and produces a 192-bit message digest. This hash was designed by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham (see http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/), with the goal of producing a secure, fast hash function that performs especially well on next-generation 64-bit architectures, being still efficient on 32 and 16-bit architectures. 

== Tiger tree hash ==
Tiger Tree cryptographic hash is calculated by applying the Tiger hash to 1024-byte blocks of a stream, then combining the interim values through a binary hash tree. 

This implementation method is specially useful as a secure way to validate transfers, especially blocks of a file and prevent corruption in distributed systems.

There is a way you can do this, but it is not a standard option within the program.
 
You need to edit this file (with a program like notepad): 
 
C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4\Publishing\quizresources\styles.xml
 
You'll find a section
 
&lt;style id=&quot;aftereachquestion&quot;&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbacknextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationnextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbackbackbutton&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationbackbutton&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
 
change it so that all the values are true, like so
 
&lt;style id=&quot;aftereachquestion&quot;&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbacknextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationnextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
For roughly 600 years the Vienna Hofburg was the primary residence of those who ruled over Austria. Over time the Hofburg has developed into one of the most important focal points of European history. From the Hofburg located in Vienna the Habsburgs ruled from the 13th century. Initially their rule started as rulers of the Austrian lands then from 1452 as emperors of the Holy Roman Empire.  The last phase of their rule was from 1806 to the end of the Monarchy in 1918 as emperors of Austria.

== History/Timeline ==
Originally a medieval fortified castle dating from the 13th century, the Hofburg palace was modified and extended extended by each emperor.  The palace underwent so much construction that it eventually came to look like a 'city within a city'. The sprawling and vast asymmetric complex which extends to well over 240,000 square feet.  The present day palace now consists of 2,600 rooms, 19 courtyards, 18 wings.  There are also 2600 rooms where approximately 5000 peoples work.  Also, some people live there.

The oldest part of the Hofburg is the Alte Burg Old Fortress. Since the 18th century the Old Forstress has been called the Schweizertrakt (Swiss Wing) after the Swiss Guards who served as the palace watch. The core of the Hofburg complex remains intact. It should be noted that although its four corner towers, most of the moat and the drawbridge were modified over the centuries. Around the middle of the 16th century the façade was changed to reflect the Renaissance style. 

In 1552 the Schweizertor (Swiss Gate) was built.  The gate was designed by Pietro Ferabosco.  This piece is one of a few Renaissance monuments the still remain in Vienna. This particular wing houses the Imperial Treasury.  This place is where the regalia of the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire are presently kept. The Vienna Boys' Choir still sings on Sundays at High Mass in the Burgkapelle (Palace Chapel). This part was created and built which was built in 1449. 

Around 1559 construction began on the Stallburg as a new primary residence. Since the 18th century this part of the palace has contained the stables of the famous Lipizzan stallions.  The Lipizzna stallions can be seen daily (except on Mondays) at their morning training or their performances in the Winter Riding School.

The Amalienburg (Amalia Residence) was designed as a stand alone building just opposite the Schweizertrakt. This residence was named after Empress Wilhelmine Amalia.  She used this residenc as her dower residence after the death of husband, Emperor Joseph I. The last occupant of this part of the Hofburg was Empress Elisabeth.  Presently these apartments are still open to the public. 

In the 17th century Emperor Leopold I had the Swiss Wing connected to the Amalia Residence. It was occupied by Empress Maria Theresa during the 18th century. Eventually after her untimely death these apartments were used until the end of the monarchy as state rooms. From 1946 it has been the official location of the offices of the Austrian Federal President.

During the 18th century the Hofburg was enlarged.  All of these enlargmement were designed and initiated by the court architectwho at the time was Joseph Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Following the architect's death in 1723 the completion of this task was given to his son Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. He was the person who supervised the construction work. 

Between 1723 and 1735 the Court Library which is now the Austrian National Library, was built to showcase the historically significant collection of books owned by the Habsburgs. 

When Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach died, another architect, Lukas von Hildebrandt, seized and opportunity for notariety. While Fischer's son was occupied fulfilling his father's vision for the designs, Hildebrandt planned the builiding the Imperial Chancellery Wing which contained the chancellery of the Holy Roman Empire.  However, at the emperor's express wish Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach was chosen to complete this wing in 1730. After the breakdown of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the chancellery was modified to be the residence of imperial family.  

In 1735 Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach completed the Winter Riding School.  It is still used today as the setting for the performances of the Spanish Riding School. Elaborate ball rooms were then created in addition to the school. Today they serve as the congress center even though they were initially designed to be used for reception and balls.  

Around the beginning of the 19th century Ludwig Montoyer erected Hall of Ceremonies   This room was used for all the ceremonial events of the imperial dynasty.  Today it continues to be used for famous Viennese balls. 

At the end of the 19th century when the old palace theatre was demolished Ferdinand Kirschner completed the Michaelertr.

At the beginning of the 20th century, shortly before the end of the monarchy, the New Hofburg was erected facing Heldenplatz Hasenauer. Presently is it contains a part of the National Library along with other valuble collections.

== Local Significance ==
Today the Hofburg Palace stands as an important center of cultural significance. This palace is also the official residence for the President of Austria.  The Hofburg area has been the official center of government since 1279 for various empires and republics within Europe.  The palace is a tourist attraction that offers tours and special events.

      <comment>/* Floating and sinking */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Gas pressure|Next=Expand or contract?}}

As you know from kindergarten, some things float while other things sink. You may also know that oil, which is insoluble (cannot be dissolved) in water, floats on top of water. What you might not know is how to find out whether something will sink or float. We will discuss that in this long chapter.

== Density ==
First, let's learn a new word: 'mass'. 'Mass' means how much of matter there is. This is not the same as 'volume'. Do you remember that there are always spaces between particles? 'Mass' does not include the spaces between the particles, while 'volume' does. Mass is measured in the units kilogram, gram and milligram.

Imagine you are in an enclosed room, say your bedroom. You are the only one inside the empty, airless room. Therefore, you are the only thing with mass in it. If your room is 1.5m × 2m × 2.5m, and your mass is 30kg, then there are 30kg in every 1.5m × 2m × 2.5m = 7.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, in every average cubic metre, there would be 30 kg ÷ 7.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 kg.

Remember that in your room, there are (on average) 4 kg in every cubic meter. That is also the density in there: density is the amount of matter in a specific space; the volume is usually represented by an invisible '1'. What are the units of density then? The units of density are always constructed by the unit of the mass, a forward-slash, and then the unit of the volume. By now you may have deduced that the method of finding density is mass over volume. This formula is very important, so we will put it here:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note: You can also swap them around like you do in maths to find the mass or volume when you have the density.

== Floating and sinking ==
[[Image:Particles density.svg|right|150px]]
What does all that have to do with floating or sinking? Here's an old riddle: which one is heavier, 1kg of lead or 1kg of feathers? Yes, that's right, they are the same. But what if you put the lead and feathers into a pond? Will they both sink?

Actually, no. While their mass may be the same (1kg), the volume of lead is a lot smaller than that of feathers. As there is the same mass stuffed in a smaller space, it must be denser. The density of water is 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so if the density of the lead is more than 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it has to sink. On the contrary, the feathers' density is probably less than 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which makes them float.

In other words, whether an object will float or sink in a certain liquid (or gas) depends on their density with relation to the density of the liquid. An example is the diagram on the right.

Unfortunately, we need a bit of math here. The following is a table of the name, mass and volume of some liquids and solids. If all these things are put into a measuring cylinder (or any container for that matter), and nothing dissolves, what will be the order of their altitude, from top to bottom?

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;830&quot;
! Name
! Volume
! Mass
! Density
|-
| Solid W
| 0.000 001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--1 cubic cm--&gt;
| 5g
| 
|-
| Solid X
| 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.8g
| 
|-
| Solid Y
| 300mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.6g
| 
|-
| Solid Z
| 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 0.01kg&lt;!--10g--&gt;
| 
|-
| Liquid A
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 96g
| 
|-
| Liquid B
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 12g
| 
|-
| Water
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| 
|}

Next, we need to know their densities. Remember to change the units. Note that we use division rather than fractions here. We will round off to three significant figures here.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;830&quot;
! Name
! Volume
! Mass
! Density
|-
| Solid W
| 0.000 001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 5g
| 5g ÷ 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid X
| 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.8g
| 1.8g ÷ 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid Y
| 300mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.6g
| 1.6g ÷ 0.3cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid Z
| 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 0.01kg = 10g
| 10g ÷ 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Liquid A
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 96g
| 96g ÷ 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Liquid B
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 12g
| 12g ÷ 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Water
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Then, we arrange them in the correct, ascending order.

5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 0.5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid X &lt; Liquid B &lt; Water &lt; Solid Z &lt; Liquid A &lt; Solid W &lt; Solid Y
[[File:Float sink diagram simple.svg|left|160px]]

Since Solids W and Y are both on the bottom, they are on the same level—they both sink in liquid A. So, the correct order is as follows:
#Solid X
#Liquid B
#Water
#Solid Z
#Liquid A
#Solid W and Solid Y

You can refer to the diagram on the left, which shows a container with all the solids and liquids in it.

== Balloons, ships and submarines ==
Let's get to a topic with no sums: how vehicles work.

=== Balloons ===
[[File:Hot air balloon particles.svg|270px|right]]
[[File:Ballon2.jpg|thumb|160px||left|The engine of a hot-air balloon]]
Once upon a time, when aeroplanes were yet to be invented, the only way to soar through the skies was to ride in a hot-air balloon. A hot air balloon is just like those you ride in amusement parks. They work the same way: using the differences in density to hurl the balloon up.

How exactly? Look at the diagram on the right. Did you know that a hot-air balloon has to be heated before it flies? This is because the particles inside the balloon are just as dense as the particles outside the balloon at the beginning. However, as soon as the particles are heated, they move more vigorously, and as they bump into each other more often, they become less dense. As less dense things float, the balloon will rise.

=== Ships ===
Many ships are made of steel. Steel is very heavy and dense. Its overall density is approximately 7.85g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The density of water, however, is much lower, at 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it is difficult for steel ships to float if they are made only of steel.

So, how exactly do those ships manage to float? You see, the density of air is very, very low. If there is a large amount of air inside the ship, the total density of the ship will decrease greatly. As long as the density is under 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the ship will float.

=== Submarines ===
Submarines work in a way that is similar to the ship, except the overall density of the ship can be altered at will so that the submarine sinks or floats as desired. Look at the diagram below. A tank called a ballast tank takes up a significant part of the submarine's area. Note that it does not have to be position like that in the diagram; it can be anywhere the shipbuilder wants it to be. The ballast tank fills up with sea water when the submarine needs to be submerged. When it needs to surface again, the sea water is pumped out of the ballast tank with the air in another tank.

== Quiz ==
#Explain why a hot-air balloon cannot rise up if there is no fire.
#Evaluate the following.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Matter !! Mass !! Volume !! Density
|-
| Solid P || 15 || 3 || a
|-
| Solid R || 100 || b || 4
|-
| Liquid H || c || 15 || 6
|}

Answers:
#It is because the fire makes the air particles inside the balloon vibrate more vigorously, thus decreasing the density of air inside the balloon, so that it floats.
#a) 5; b) 25; c) 90

      <comment>/* Vacuum */ hey... i mentioned that above!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Three states of matter|Next=Float or sink?}}

You may have heard about the experiment in which you suspend a glass of water, and the cardboard under it does not fall down. Why does that happen? And what is the secret of the rubber suckers (the real name is suction cup) that hold up your towels? Read this chapter to find out.

== Gas pressure ==
Picture this. You have 4 table tennis balls, and you put them in a box of 1m x 1m x 1m. That's pretty big. Now you get a weightlifter to shake it. You will here the sound of the table tennis balls hitting against the wall of the box. Let's assume it's, say, once every ten seconds.

Now you put the balls into a box of 50cm x 50cm x 50cm. This time, you realise that the balls hit against the wall six times every ten seconds! That is because as the volume of the box decreases, there is more chance of the table tennis balls hitting against the wall.

When the table tennis balls hit the wall more, they exert more pressure on it. Pressure is when someone drops a heavy weight on you. Remember that gas particles move freely all the time? When gas particles are put into a container, they hit the walls on the container and exert pressure on them. When you hit put them into a smaller container, they would therefore hit the walls more often as well. The pressure exerted is named 'gas pressure'.

Gas pressure is measured in a unit called 'pascal', or simply 'Pa'. A Bourdon gauge can be used to measure gas pressure. We can also connect a pressure sensor to a datalogger to measure gas pressure.

== Air pressure ==
Air is also a kind of gas. Air is made of nitrogen, oxygen and other elements. As air is all around us, it also creates gas pressure. Gas pressure from air is called air pressure or atmospheric pressure. Mind you, you cannot actually feel air particles hitting your skin!

== Vacuum ==
[[File:Magdeburg.svg|200px|left]]
If there is no air, there is no atmospheric pressure. In 1664, the Mayor of Magdeburg combined two hemispheres (halves of spheres), then he pumped the air out of the sphere. He tried to use horses to separate them, but it did not work. Why is that?

This can be explained by the diagram on the left. When the hemispheres are filled with air, the air pressure on the inside equals out the air pressure on the outside. When the inside is hollow, there is no pressure so the air presses the hemispheres together, making it impossible to separate. A place without any air is called a vacuum.

[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|100px|right]]
A daily life application is the suction cup where you pump out the air while pressing it onto the wall. As the air is pumped out, the air particles outside press against the sucker, causing air pressure. That's why it takes some effort to take it off!

== Quiz ==
Fill in the blanks.
#Gas pressure is caused by gas (1) hitting the wall of its (2).
#(3) pressure is also known as air pressure.
#The power of a (4) can be shown by the (5) hemispheres.

Answers:
#particles
#container
#Atmospheric
#vacuum
#Magdeburg
